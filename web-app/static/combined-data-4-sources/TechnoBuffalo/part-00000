[Music] Google i/o 2017 the keynote just wrapped up it was not an overly exciting keynote for hardware but they announced a ton of stuff for sophomores usually what these developer conferences are about the highlight of which we got a more in-depth look at Android Oh coming later this summer we don't know what the name that's going to be I'm still still betting it's going to be Oreo we could get some behind-the-scenes look at what's in the key features are going to be so Android is kind of rethinking what multitasking is going to be with we've seen them try and do side by side screens now the same picture picture is the way of the future for multitasking similar what we say on iOS so you're watching a video did ever you want to have a small window playing a YouTube video and you can swipe it off the screen whenever you want notifications so we're also going to be big and Android or your nugget notification dot because you know there's notification for that app you would interact with notifications so like Instagram for example we'll have a little dot next to it swipe down from the shade you'll see that maybe someone liked the video or left a comment you can interact with it when you swipe it away the dot will also go it's not like a badge counter swirl just like a hey over here look at this open up open up his app Google intended Norden at a time it's talking about machine learning and if somebody said that was mostly like a Skynet flashback so I did a lot of machine learning when it comes to cut copy and paste oddly enough Phandroid oh so if you think the most things that get copied are things like addresses phone numbers and email so if you're an email for example and you want to copy some of the phone number just go ahead sir tap it a little no to select that whole phone number it'll also give you shortcuts to launch the dialer for example same thing formats and addresses go ahead tap on an address it'll select the whole thing for you and also for name I'll give you the option to pull into your contacts if Andreo is about anything decided republic helping delicious name it's about battery efficiency and security they talked a lot about vitals they called it in a way that apps and oxy bail just drain your battery in the background commuting a lot of work in the backgrounds to kill a lot of that drains so things like snapchat for example facebook that have been huge injured battery drains should be better this generation of Android and sort of the last big thing they talked about for Android OS OS improvements overall faster Apple something Android absolutely needed faster boot up time from turn off doesn't like to be a giant new rethought version of Android just a better version of Android and should be fast there should be smoother and should also be more security if you want to try it did you actually try it now go to Android comm flash beta and give it a world so big story here is Security battery life its new multitasking hopefully by time Android ohit's presumably the pixel to later on this summer will know a lot more we're trying to try Android Oh give it a shot it's still definitely in beta so which one uses a daily driver for example don't expect it to run super smooth or even have a great battery life right now but what do you guys want to see an Android Oh most that list is not yet done give me a picture down below I'm hoping for more elegant backups to some upper back up and restore been waiting for Android do that for a while anyways leave a comment down below let me know I'm going to go explore Mountain View and see what else is here at Google i/o 2017 
So it's been about a month since the
Note 8 came out and I've been using as my daily driver for three of those weeks
and then in conjunction with an iPhone 8 Plus so I've got a good sense of the
phone I know it's nuances I know what makes it hum and purr and my opinions
have changed a little bit from our review so I thought I'd revisit the
Galaxy Note 8 if you haven't picked one up
and maybe help you decide whether or not you should and if you bought one perhaps
or perhaps not justify your purchase so let's start with the good on the Note 8 holy moly that's 6.3 inch screen is still absolutely beautiful there
sometimes I look at the screen and I'm still shocked that it's actually on a
mobile device it looks like a sticker the screen is absolutely beautiful black
levels are really black it hasn't been as good that would like in direct
sunlight I usually don't keep out of brightness
on on my phones but I had to keep it on on the Note 8 so I can see it in direct
sunlight it kicks all the way up to max brightness so if use your phone outdoors
all the time you might be disappointed in the screen but if most of your usage
is like indoors you're gonna be really happy with the screen so I didn't use
the edge panels at all and surprising to me in initial review was I didn't really
use app pairing either and that was a big thing for me when I did the review because
when I did it for that first week I used it all the time and part of me just
stopped doing the top and bottom multi tasking just using one app at a time I
was a disappointed myself that I didn't that I didn't use that pairing then I
remembered and oh I should probably use that and I just forget about it
again so as much as I thought that's gonna be a reason to perhaps buy the Note 8 again perhaps sheer laziness or forgetfulness I did not use it as much
as I thought I was going to and speaking of not using as much as I thought the S
Pen that's a big reason why a lot of people get the note devices they want to have
the functionality of the pen I probably only use a pen maybe ten times
throughout my month but it was really handy to have it those ten times and
despite not using the s-pen I always liked knowing it was there it's kind of
like a safety net I started using it a lot at the beginning to  take notes and
meetings and then gradually I just stopped using it like anything sort of
over time but having it for shopping lists having it for annotating screenshots
having it for drawing mustaches on pictures of mark and Ralph
we're helpful I didn't find myself making many
gifs or animated pictures on it as often as I thought I was going to but I really
liked having the safety net of the s-pen I know that's kind of doesn't make that
much sense I didn't use it but I like having it I don't know perhaps I'll use
it more as I keep using the phone but I was shocked that I didn't use it as much
as I thought I was going to but what I did use more than I thought I was
going to was the camera so these cameras are absolute incredible we covered him
at length in the review the portrait mode is absolutely beautiful on here and
I used that a tremendous amount I love this camera in every situation that I
took pictures in they always look good whether it was sort of low-light shots
whether not I was in broad daylight outside at the park wherever pictures
always looked good next to the camera is still that fingerprint sensor and
listen I read the comments you guys think I'm over blowing the location of
fingerprint reader you think oh you put a case on it and you could find it well
I don't have a case on this I got a dragon skin dbrand skin on
the back because the black one is a fingerprint magnet which coincidentally
if you want to check out will link to it down below that fingerprint reader is a
joke to me I never use it when I can find it with my finger it doesn't work
all that often I find myself using the facial scanner and the iris unlock more
than I used a fingerprint reader but perhaps that's a testament to how many
different options you got to unlock your phone if you don't like the location of
that or you're left-handed it's hard to find there are other options but I hope
for the next-gen for the s9 they move it somewhere or get rid of it
to put it somewhere I can reach it and you can yell at me again in in the
comments the 3300 milliamp hour battery my thoughts on battery life it's kind of
the same for the review it's good I can get through a full day which is what
matters I wish I could get through like a day and a half for a day of heavy
usage or day of video streaming I do like having a fast charging that's nice
to plug in for 10 or 15 minutes but the fact that I can just put it on a
wireless charger I'm sitting on my office really alleviates for me a lot of
battery concerns other intangibles I love about the phone always-on display I
still really like so before you guys tell me that Samsung pay is the same as
Apple pay and Android pay it does the same stuff with an extra trick in
terminals that don't except tap the payments so don't take
NFC Samsung pay will still work it'll put out a magnetic fields like your
credit card you just hold the next two terminal making it work almost anywhere
so I still really like having Samsung pay on here the phone is still fast I
don't know if it's psychosomatic because the extra 2 gigs of ram versus the s8
plus 6 gigs of ram is nice probably not necessary but though I never had any
slowdowns there any stutters I didn't have through of OS lag and some people
claim Samsung has in fact I really like the software that Samsung has on a
device now I wish that or you already who knows when that's gonna come if you
want the latest software updates you're gonna want to look at the Pixel 2 but if
you want a phone that's a really overall good package that's got decent enough
battery life and incredible camera a beautiful screen perhaps a poorly placed
fingerprint reader on the back a lot of other options to unlock your phone get
the Note 8 I can still absolutely recommend in the note 8 so if you
haven't tried it try it if you're thinking about switching just do it
their deals to be had right now it's an incredible phone perhaps my favorite
device out there what do you guys think about the Galaxy Note 8 did I echo your
sentiments you guys gonna yelling about the fingerprint reader I want to know
your thoughts in the comments down below so next time I'm Jon Rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo 
trying to figure out an intro for the Galaxy s8 in the galaxy si plus review has been tough this is actually about the fifteenth take I've done I wasn't quite sure what to say I went back and forth on saying they have the weight of the company on its shoulders since the note 7s Fiasco is it more than just a marketing hype of a floating whale but it boils down to this the Galaxy s8 at least on paper and in your hand looks to be an incredible phone but how was in a real world usage I didn't just test this phone in the office and take pictures of things I set up I took this phone out in the real world and use it the way I use a phone to the park with my kids to Home Depot to buy stuff I need it for my new home and throughout the courses review I'm gonna answer the question that hopefully you guys have on your minds is it worth your money should you buy it and did I end up picking one up I'm John written drew from TechnoBuffalo this is our review of the galaxy s 8 and the galaxy s 8 [Music] so let me get some of the details out of the way I use this phone for ten days and I use both the s8 and the s8 plus they go through the review I'm gonna just say s8 the only differences between these two phones aside for about a hundred bucks and price is little bigger screen size an extra 500 milliamps on the back all phones nowadays kind of look the same they're different variants of the rectangle so had a chance to first pick up a Galaxy s8 it struck me for its design and that's a hard thing to do nowadays the big story with the SI discrete that's what Samsung's touting the marketing machine came up the terminal finita display and if you can familiar with Samsung displays in the past you probably know it's gonna look really good and a holy crap is this display look incredible and if it seems like I am overly excited about it it's because I am legitimately overly excited about this play this is what I use all the time what you use all the time how you interact with your phone it's gotta be good and man does it look really good even mundane things like checking emails and sending SMS look awesome and are kind of fun to do because things look so crisp that's even with the resolution scaled down to a little bit better than 1080 versus a qHD that's capable of just for comparison purposes it's got 36% more screen real estate than we saw on the galaxy s7 and the galaxy s 8 plus 6 point 3 inch screen size almost the exact same footprint as the iPhone 7 plus so you are getting a ton of screen real estate you're also getting some new design cues you've got rounded corners you've got now the edge display that's on the standard models but it's a much less subtle I just what we've got on the galaxy s7 the mbola tech Samsung's had in the past is here they've added mobile HDR which looks nice I didn't test that much mobile HTR I did watch them netflix content looks marginally better but the story for me and how the screen is better than previous generations is in direct sunlight that has been the Achilles heel of almost every smartphone and I'm a dad I take my phone out take pictures of my kids at the parks and I want to be able to see what the screens gonna look like so I can get that perfect shot if you take the brightness and push it all up 200% you're gonna get all 1000 nits of brightness coming out of this thing now if you can feel the phone getting super warm when you're pushing that much brightness you can actually see the display in direct sunlight which is really rare and also really refreshing to see the other stuff you'd expect from the screens looked good certainly do games and video look absolutely beautiful they do have the curved display here so holding it kind of be tricky often times I was launching the edge panel so they're trying to hold the sides and for playing games your right hand is certainly gonna cover the single downwards facing speakers so you got to figure out how to hold your hand properly to get real audio to come out when playing game is your even watching video and while the screen is beautiful perhaps the most surprising thing about the Galaxy s8 is Samsung finally laid the smackdown on carriers and there's not a tramp stamp to be found on any of these I'm looking at you Verizon in your check mark you like to put over home buttons and speaking of home buttons you are not gonna find a physical one here on the galaxy s 8 because of all that screen real estate Samsung made the home button in the screen itself it's kind of like a force touch 3d touch type thing it's a touch panel all the way across the bottom you can push it all the way and get a bit of haptic feedback and you can go home it also means for playing a full screen game or watching a full screen video you can sort of push hard on that screen you'll be able to go home instead of just tapping on screen buttons come up and then hit the home button again perhaps the biggest downside of the phone is removing that physical home button meant and I meant moving the fingerprint reader to the back of the phone and oh what a horrible choice for an otherwise really awesome phone they put it oddly directly next to the camera sensor and because you don't have any humps anymore on this camera sensor when you're using the phone looking at the screen your finger doesn't really know where to go to hit that your print reader which means your camera sensor is going to fingerprints all over it I wish you would have put that somewhere else and I kind of think Samsung knew then they give you a ton of other ways to unlock your phone things like iris scanner for the note 7 are here and it works well especially works well in dark environments it works through sunglasses but if you in direct sunlight it's not gonna work so well for you Samsung brought back something that used to be on old Android devices and tried to improve it with facial recognition it works a little bit slow for my tastes and it can be fooled with some pictures so it's not the most secure buy found another way to unlock your phone it's there so in typical reviews after I talk about the screen I'll jump into build and it's kind of hard to do that the SI it because the screen pretty much is the build and I will say this the phone feels really nice in the hand despite it being so thin I don't feel like I'm going to drop it and also for someone who's been using an iPhone 7 plus in the past I really appreciate how thin the phone is in my pants I don't have bone bulge in my jeans I didn't do any drop tests on it but it is coated front and back with Gorilla Glass 5 so presumably be able to survive those drops and everybody will come in my 10 days of testing haven't noticed any scratches but man is it a smudge machine I've got the black version and my fingerprints are everywhere it's not like I just ate like McDonald's fries and picked up the phone I washed my hands like a normal Clemen being and it still looks kind of gross in the back the aspect ratio is also changed with the screen getting bigger in fact the galaxy si+ fits into almost exactly the same footprint as an iPhone 7 plus so that means your experience at the phone is a little bit different it's tall and thin it's more Giselle and less like Jack Black you're gonna be able to see a lot more content on the screen but it also means you're gonna have to really stretch your thumb to get to the top to put the notification tray the Samsung lets you do things like you use a fingerprint reader to swipe down to bring that down but again it's hard to reach the fingerprint reader with the Galaxy S a plus and it's hard to find it on either phones the virtual assistant world is pretty saturated right now but Samsung thought there was room for one more so enter Bixby the only Ricky interaction you're gonna have a Bixby probably at launch you can accidentally press the dedicated Bigsby button when you're trying to push volume down and if you do push that you're gonna get hello Bixby which is gonna look very similar to Google now of information at rating birds victory visions also here kind of gives you an augmented reality information on books wine or products I tried to test it out at Home Depot excited by a showerhead and it did not work or very well for me but the big selling point of Bixby is that you can control anything you can with your finger with your voice that also is not working as of launch date so Bixby's kind of half-baked right now so Samsung software's a tough one to talk about I've been let's just say less than kind in the past about samsung GUI and I think a lot of you guys have been less than kind and as soon as you bought a Galaxy S whatever the first thing he did was down a little launcher ever since I think the galaxy s6 Samsung has been getting way better in fact I'm gonna go on record of saying this I love what Samsung did with their Android software you can quote me on it and take it to the bank use it for five or six days and I think you're gonna agree with me it took a lot of really nice things from stock Android and added a ton of other features on top of it that get out of their way they're not layer on layer on layer stuff you have to relearn how to use your operating system they're nice improvements you get the things you like from the pixel on check to swipe up to get your app drawer you also get a lot of other improvements as well you can swipe down for example to also get your app drawer you've got an improved notification tray we've got a tweaked and redefined setting I really like being able to swipe my hand over the screen to take screenshots you've got edge panels if it's ton of information to swipe away what Samsung's done in the software is surprisingly make it more elegant without making it more cumbersome and as critical as I've been in years past I think I gotta give credit where credit is due in a preview like me you're not sold on VIX Piett Google assistant also is shipping with the Galaxy S II and perhaps the best software feature and for me I think a reason to consider the Galaxy s8 a really most modern Samsung phones is Samsung pay so it works like Apple pay or Android pay can use NFC payments but also will put out a magnetic field for anywhere you would swipe a card you can hold your phone right next to it and it works really well then you could pretty much do Samsung pay anywhere credit card is when the essay was announced it said it was gonna be the same camera sensor as a note 7 in the a7 I was a little bit disappointed to the new phone and I wanted something new just because new turns out that was a bit unfounded because the camera in the s8 is still really good the 12 megapixel sensor with some software improvements over last gen and the shots look awesome things do look a little bit overexposed so they can be tweaking settings but I still like the brightness of it and I wanted to test the camera like I legitimately use a phone every day so took my kid out to the park I was able to get pictures of him running which is really hard to do for fast motion and normal noontime sunlight pictures with absolute incredible low-light also looks really good the video quality also looks awesome you can set all the way up to take 4k video you get if you don't have a micro SD card a 10-minute cap on 4k but here you go here's a video of my son going down a slide in 4k just as a fun sized story he was terrified to go down that slide like four days ago and he just got super brave and and went down so while the rear camera didn't get much the way of improvements the front-facing cameras did it's 8 megapixel and it now has autofocus which is something I guess we moved down a further facing camera so we want to take your selfies it works really well and also new the cameras I guess everybody is taking cues from snapchat you've got filters built right in the camera boils down to this Samsung's throwing around a ton of marketing talk about the cameras things like multi frame image processing pictures look really good look great in almost any situation in fact when compared to things like the pixel or the iPhone 7 plus this stands on its own if it's not the best phone camera out there it's certainly in the running and deserves to be in that conversation the estate's got a 3,000 million power battery si plus has a 3500 and in my battery test I was mostly using the S Plus and I was able to get through a full day of testing and my usage might vary from yours but I wirelessly charge it overnight 100% when I wake up around 7:30 in the morning I am taking a lot of pictures like ultimate dad it didn't land number of pictures I'm watching a ton of YouTube videos thinking about hour and a half two hours of phone calls playing some games when I probably should be working and by end of the day without changing any set my brightness set to about 75% usually I'm about 10 to 15% battery life left but those figures are only if you don't have any power saving modes on Samsung offers two different ones there's a midden to max and turning on the make and turn about 20% of battery life until like 8 to 10 hours so you can really get through 2 or 3 days if you need just beware those settings are there usually my phone reviews have a performance category but that's almost a moot point now with modern phone so fast that's performance but I've got some intangibles I had the most fun putting together notes for this part of the review because there's a lot here let's start with the big one IP 68 same waterproof ich miss we saw on the s7 the note 7 you could take it in the shower with you if you're inclined to do so for reasons I'm not gonna talk about headphone jack it's here and it's gonna be shipping with $99 equivalent AKG headphones which I guess to my untrained ear sound like any other hear buds that come bundled with phones but it's there you can plug your headphones with it and have to just use bluetooth if you couldn't tell I really liked the galaxy s 8 and I asked the questions the beginning what did i do did I buy one and I did I caved I really like the Galaxy S a I ordered a galaxy s 8 plus in black in fact maybe the only knock I have on the phone as I have from price and a really poor place from the fingerprint reader is the colors I wish the u.s. got the gold and the blue like we had with the last gen phones but alas they ain't here I wasn't a fan of the silver of the grey so I went fingerprint smudgy black the phone looks really sleek I've had it into my own phone now for about three days I don't think I'm looking back I like the way the phone performs I like the way it feels and the best endorsement that I can give for a phone is to actually buy one myself my own money behind it use it as my daily driver and the galaxy s 8 plus it's gonna be the phones in my pocket for the foreseeable future but that's just my opinion what do you guys think about the Galaxy s8 in the si+ is it the phone you've been waiting for you disappointed let me know your reasons down below in the comments looks legitimate have a discussion about the technology that's in is the latest from Samsung I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you like the cinematography credit goes to Nate Andrew takes no credit for this one please give the video a thumbs up we certainly appreciate it until next time I'm John render from techno bow you 
so this is a pretty sweet time to be alive not just because beta geek is cool but because there are so many good phones out now it used to be if you wanted something decent that was gonna last you a year more you had to spend like a thousand bucks to get the latest thing but now there are pretty baller phones for under 200 bucks and we cover a lot of the expensive flagships but I figure it's important for us to cover the other end of the market as well so meet honor 7x this thing is under $200 I want them to be dramatic like pulling it up I wanted to pull a sheet off it but mark wouldn't let me so I think that would have been cool and dramatic to pull a sheet off from the comments down below and tell mark that he was wrong all right throw the box so this is 7 X and there's a lot to like about the 7 X again starting with the under $200 price point which which is crazy so we're gonna do an old-school unboxing it's the blue box alright so taking that off the top we've got B + 7 X Oh sitting here looking pretty it's two lenses staring at me we've got a sim removal tool also in the box we've got wall wart we've got a pretty standard cable got a pretty standard cable micro USB happening happening here alright so this is the 7 X I'm gonna power it on and we'll talk about some specs and what this thing can do so first the build it is an aluminum feels unibody type build when it turns on you are greeted by a screen as one would expect but it's pretty decent-sized here it's 5.9 three inches and the resolution is 1080 by 2160 so how about some specs so you're getting a Kirin octa-core processor built into this thing 3 gigs of ram 32 gigabytes of storage but that is expandable with micro SD card slots also I feel like it's important to mention you have a headphone jack here so you want to plug in headphones you can actually just do that the power port is micro USB though so bear that in mind so the back you've got two cameras staring at you one's a 16-megapixel one is a 2-megapixel and on the front you have an 8 megapixel sensor for four taken for taking those selfies first impression some can be pretty positive and again it's shocking nowadays the value you can get for an under 200 price but if you think about what you could get under $200 going back even like two years ago it used to be way way way pared down slow operating system didn't work all that well you're getting a full fledge octa-core processor with a higher than HD resolution three gigs of ram you know out of the box there's some concerns people have is that Google Play services won't be support you got to do like a weird roundabout way of getting on there this phone is meant to be released in the US market this is a US marketed phone so you do get the Google Play Store and Play services right out of the box so during the set up I went and set up the finger per unit which is located pretty nicely on the back and see how fast it unlocks here that's pretty quick another reason I really like this phone is actually the battery so it's a 33 40 million power battery honor claims you're gonna get a pretty exact 1.47 days so just under a day and a half with a resolution of the screen and a really large battery you can probably push that so longer but as I use the phone I'll test it but if you want a phone is going to last for a while but to be a pretty solid option and with three gigs of RAM things that order they wouldn't be possible on these lower priced phones like gaming becomes something that you could definitely do and do pretty well with the 7x so because of that longer aspect ratio things that you would narrowly do with the phone media consumption like watching movies gonna get less of those black bars but probably the best use case for me is reading a website so if you're like browsing TechnoBuffalo you'll see way more content than you would on a phone that has kind of a squatter display so it also has a screen split mode that probably guess lets you run to ass but you can resize the windows depending on how big you want stuff to be so for me it's usually like Twitter and chrome keeping up-to-date on TechnoBuffalo but also you guys are doing on Twitter so on the camera side there's some gestures you can do as well you can just hold up your palm and take pictures instead of trying to to find the button on screen you can do time lapse or slow motion you got phase detection autofocus here a lot of stuff usually reserved for the higher-end phones is really in here so you're some camera samples if you want to see if they look like they look pretty good coming out of the sixteen plus two megapixel sensors on the back again I keep saying this but for two hundred bucks you're getting a pretty solid set if those pictures look good they look like almost last year's flagship quality for a phone again the price point here here is insane you're getting a really good value for the dollar do you want to see a full review on the 7x or you want to see more phones covered in this price point give the video a thumbs up to let us know so thanks to honor for sending over the 7x if you want to learn more about or you want to pick one up for yourself we'll link to it down below so if you guys enjoyed be sure to subscribe but of course hit the bell to get notified when new videos are coming up until next time I'm John Breton you're from

Meet the Galaxy S9.
This one's been leaked for a while so this shouldn't be a giant surprise if
you follow the tech rumors but let me tell you everything there is to know
about these phones. Let's start with some of the differences, the S9 is now not
just a smaller version of the S9+ the Plus version is going to get two
extra gigs of rams, it's going to have six, that's going to have double the
cameras. So that's gonna bring it up to two. The main sensors are the same 12
megapixels, they now have dual apertures so it's mechanical you can actually see
it open and closed. They showed us some examples of how that's going to reduce
noise. We tested it did seem to do that although real-world usage will determine
it. When we get this in their offices will of course test it. They're also capable of
taking an insane 960 frames per second slow-mo video at a pretty awesome 720p.
We tested it and they look absolutely incredible and at fun fact about these
phones they actually now have RAM built into the camera system so it could
handle all those crazy frames that are coming in. The Plus version though gets a
second camera of course for the zoom stuff that you'd like. Other than that
things are pretty similar from last gen. The screen size are still a 5.8 and 6.2, the bezels have been slimmed down just a little bit. The
screens were already really good with the S8 but now they're better this time
around. They are 15% brighter and we tested this,
the screens did look really bright. That should be nice and bright sunlight when
you're outdoors it's going to gonna be able to see the screen. If there could be
two knocks on the Galaxy S8 that I was pretty vocal about, it was the silly
finger print reader location that's now been fixed and no dual speakers, that has
also now been fixed. The earpiece is a speaker, it gets pretty loud. In fact it's
about 1.4 to 1.5 times louder than the S8 so they're really proud of it for
music and if I use it for speakerphone it's just louder now. One of the things
that I liked about the Note 8 was it kind of flattened out the edges so the
phone felt more substantial in her hand Didn't feel kind of as thin as the S8
was and it that same thing here at the Galaxy S9 did it the note it's got kind
of a flatter side to it so it does feel better in the hand. If you like the way
the Note felt you're gonna love the way the Galaxy S9 is gonna feel. 
Samsung loves to be first with stuff this is the first phone out of the gate
shipping with a Snapdragon 845 so it's gonna be incredibly fast for processing,
for gaming, for a lot of VR and AR, and should be better on the battery as well and
those sizes are the same as last-gen at 3,000 and 3,500 but again the Plus has
the 6 gigs of ram versus the regular that has the 4 so so bear that in mind. I know
you're gonna ask, I I asked Samsung, Bixby button is still
there. It still does Bixby things but it's a
little bit better now, you get some sort of AR makeup see what looks like
a different makeup on, it's now gonna do real-time translation if you hold it up
to words that are in different language, and also if you hold it up to food
it'll tell you what an estimated calorie count is. One thing that is
definitely new here with the S9 and the S9+ are animated emojis. If you
ever made it like a Nintendo Mii but you wish it was more high-def and could map
your face, that's what we've got right here is kind of cool. It's actually gonna
take a picture of your face and it's going to make it, you can customize some -
stuff your skin tone hair and clothes but it does work actually really well. I
did a test with each eyebrow going up and down is able to see those things,
smiling was able to see those things, turn your head see those things. It's able to
map your face really well of course if you want to just put yourself into other
sort of emojis like like bunny rabbits and other things we might be used to
those are here as well and they'll work on third-party apps. It actually will
just save it as a picture if you want. On the software side the UI is going to
look similar to last-gen and actually I really like what Samsung has done on the
software side but it is Android Oreo based, in fact it's based off of 8.0 and
I think all the things that make Samsung phones stand out are also here you can
run through the list of flagship specs as check them off one by one.
Expandable storage is here, quick charging here, wireless charging is here,
Samsung pay is here, ip68 of course it's here as well.
All that stuff that makes you generally Samsung phones awesome or of course
packed into the Galaxy S9 and S9+. The u.s. is getting some good launch
colors finally. It's gonna be midnight black, coral blue, lilac purple, there's an
awesome looking gray one that's only going international. So that's it that's
the S9 and the S9+. It doesn't at least appear to be a giant upgrade. What
I think was already peak smartphone with
the S8, coming from an S7 is a giant step forward, coming from a Note
8 you might want to give it a second thought before we decided whether or not
to upgrade but it looks awesome. We're gonna get one in the office of course
the test put it through its paces. I'm excited I like to last gens.
This one looks like a really nice improvement on that but we'll we'll be
the judge. Anything you guys want us to see particular about the s9 the s9+ leave it in

Before we jump into the versus I want to
thank our sponsors Zolo Liberty+ the very first legitimately no compromise
wireless headphones get up to 48 hours of battery life is graphene and inside of
these things that use the Anker battery technology to make them last and last
and last things are absolutely incredible if you want to learn more about them
the link will be down below It's time for an epic smartphone battle this
is the Galaxy S8 versus the OnePlus 5 these are two incredible phones that
bring a lot of specs and a lot of performance to the market
I put these two head-to-head and declare a winner none of that cop-out whichever
one is best for you there are a lot of categories you could have picked from
but I picked a seven that I think some up the phone's the best we've got design
screen software camera battery performance and intangibles and we will
declare a winner design is a huge category when it comes to phone it's a
big determining factor and you look to buy most phones do the same stuff the
design can separate one phone from another let's start with the Galaxy s8
got a really nice metal frame a glass back glass front curved on both sides
it's almost all screens is infinity display got an incredible 84 percent
screen to body ratio and it is super thin at 8 millimeters the elongated
aspect ratio make its 5.8 inch screen seem kind of approachable it's not as
a giant behemoth as you would expect fingerprint reader is located on the
back and we will definitely talk about that despite looking and feeling really
nice does have a bit of a fragile feel to it maybe I'm a little bit biased
admittedly there because I have dropped and cracked a galaxy s 8 plus when it
comes to design Samsung get this one out of the park so
I mentioned how thin the Galaxy s8 was this thing is even thinner at 7.2 two millimeters which is an engineering marvel when you consider the
incredible specs that are packed in here I've got a 5.5 inch screen with a screen
to body ratio of about 73 or 74 ish % oneplus is said they wanted to do sort
of an infinity edge so I didn't have the resources to do it as I go through and
do this versus oneplus is a smaller company going head-to-head toe-to-toe
against one of the behemoths of the industry and they did an awesome job
I like the rounded edges on the back and eyes aluminum so really good it kind of
has a feel of an old-school HTC phone and a modern-day iPhone a huge
compliment to oneplus got a pretty pronounced fingerprint reader on the
front which I'll talk more about but is crazy fast it looks really nice and
there's no design slouch and so it's going up against anybody else it might
have a chance when it comes to pure design the Galaxy s8 is the clear winner
so next let's talk about screen this is what you are looking at all the time
if the screen sucks your phone experience they're going to suck no matter what
expect let's start with the s8 the cue HD screen so it's 2960 by 1440
resolution is not the whole story here so don't think it's over because this
packs more pixels than the full HD screen on the oneplus 5 pictures video
games when the phone is a static it's like there's a sticker on it the best
way I can describe it it doesn't even look real
more use the phone more I can appreciate the incredibleness of the screen
things can look and a little bit saturated I've gotten used to it and I
kind of like it that is going to be a personal preference but oneplus 5 is
a really nice job with this display so it's full HD it's 1920 by 1080 it's an
optic AMOLED panel which is really solid the 401 PPI it's an evolution of the
3T's display but does give a lot of customization options support things
like srgb DCI p3 a one caveat I want to mention here is if VR is important to
you the low resolution is not really going to lend itself to any sort of VR
experience so the full HD panel on the OnePlus 5is good and it skims even say
it's great perhaps not as good and not as great as the best in the industry the
Galaxy S8 same issue we ran into talking about design the Galaxy s8 takes
a category before you start screaming and yelling at me in the comments let's
go into the next category in that software Samsung TouchWiz is used to be
the biggest knock on what used to be pretty awesome hardware it was bloated
it was cartoony and made the phone slow but since the Galaxy s6 Samsung I think
it turned a pretty big corner as of this filming it's based on Android 7.0 and
it's surprisingly solid actually prefer to use this versus what I usually use a
Nova Launcher on most other Android devices to give it a gives you a clean
kind of Nexus style launcher which I appreciate
they've downplayed the cartoony aspects of this a lot and they've done a lot of
nice UI tweaks you're definitely not going to mistake this UI for stock
Android but just look and perform well on its TouchWiz that aspect of TouchWiz
gets you away from Samsung in the past definitely worth looking at oh what's
software on oneplus I was a huge fan of cyanogen when oneplus
first launched I shed a nerd tear when they ditched it I went for own OxygenOS
which was a little bit half-baked when it first launched but much like touchwiz OxygenOS is really coming to its own the OnePlus 5 atleast as of shipping based
on android 7.1.1 so almost the most recent version of android and it looks
and feels like stock with a ton of customization you can choose to the
advantage of or just sort of leave it and get a really nice really close the
stock Android experience if you decide to dig into the settings you're going to
find a lot of really cool options to make this phone your own things like a
reading mode night mode gestures launcher settings this might even be a
more complete OS and you can Android itself oneplus hasn't always been the
best with updates so bear that in mind but this has a stock feel and it kind of
seems like a hybrid between Nova and just naked nude Android and for me that
is a winning combination I love what oneplus did oxygen OS this is a clear
winner for the OnePlus 5 all right so let's jump in and talk about camera this could
probably be a 13 to 45 minute video on its own but I tried to hit the
highlights a little cliche but the best camera is the one you have with you and
chances are you're gonna have your phone with you so camera is a big determining
factor in which phone people buy the galaxy s8 I think it's a big omission
from Samsung not putting a dual sensor setup on the back of the phone a lot of
the competition has including the oneplus 5 that doesn't hold a 12
megapixel sensor back too much pictures are awesome in normal light
I think this shines in low light so it's clean high ISO and processing the low
light shots looks surprisingly good but the less like that's there the more
artifact you're going to have that's not unique to the Samsung on it's kind of
true with any camera but really good in low-light photos are a little bit warm
and kind of contrast yet that's personal preference they make colors look a bit
brighter I like it you may not also oh is is a
huge help on the video side and also aids to those low-light shots and if
you want to get in save photos as raw when it comes to camera on the oneplus 5
this is really what they're selling it can blaze into two separate times on the
box they want you to know this is an incredible camera and it definitely is
it's got two sensors the usual setup you see with those dual sensors
got a wide angle and a telephoto and I couldn't mention at this point they
pretty much just ate the iPhones camera UI which they did but the good UI and it
works well here and just realize impact the camera fidelity for the longer focal
length in distant portrait mode is nice to have but the portrait images look
crazy artifact II does not look real at all you don't get that natural bokeh effect
I think they're trying to go for I imagine it can be fixed with software but if you
want this for portrait mode I would not rely on this for it at least as of
shipping solo like shot suits are important to me did not come out as well
on the OnePlus 5 maybe there's a lack of ois is that really impacts the pictures got
a smaller 1.12 micron pixels in here as well the things just looked
artifacting grainy and not nearly as clear this one was kind of a tough one
for me to call like you add a flexibility of the wide-angle and
telephoto by myself taking a lot of low-light pictures though and again as a
dad that's where a lot of my photos are taken think which is my kid sleeping
image in Italy is a little bit creepy but I really like to have a camera
that's good in low-light the addition of OIS on the galaxy s8 and a little bit
of a better front-facing camera as well I mean this round is surprisingly going
to go to Samsung your phone's only going to be as good to you as long as it's
working the battery life is I think it's an important category as well the Galaxy
s8 has a 3000 milliamp hour battery which is good but not great we recharge
me a wireless charging or quick charge and generally in my usage which is
surprisingly heavy by end of the day I'm around 25 to 30% now your usage is going
to vary but I'm pretty tough on my phone there's a lot of YouTube watching and
there's a lot of social media a lot of pictures being taken a lot of things
running in the background which is pretty impressive considering the amount
of pixels thing is pushing and the processor that is going along with this
a battery expect to be a huge difference on the oneplus 5 that's got to be
the trade-off for having a 1080p screen a little bit of a bigger battery so it's
got that going for it at 3300 milliamp hours and it was better than the Galaxy
s8 but not by giant leaps and bounds it's about 10 percent better than what I
got on the Galaxy s8 so 35 to 45 percent I probably could have pushed that a
little bit more and gone for almost two days of battery usage generally I
got my display set about 50% I think that is where the oneplus 5 tends to shine
if battery is going to be important to you there may be better battery savings
phones out there but if you want a phone it's going to last a lot longer than the
competition at least so oneplus 5 did a really nice job with that you got
to decide if that trade-off is worth it do you want the extra pixels of a Galaxy
s8 or another flagship phone you want a really solid screen with the admittedly
better battery life the oneplus 5 offers battery life was
very clear winner here going back to the one part so this category I've added
from our last verses performance I generally don't do this because every
phone now it tends to feel fast it's hard to find a phone that feels slow and
the Galaxy s8 certainly does not feel slow Snapdragon 835 eight gigs of ram
almost up-to-date version of Android is an incredibly fast phone there's still a
few things that slow it down that bother me like I try and search for a stick
allow for the keyboard to pop up but overall it is a very fast experience
whether I'm playing games or browsing the web or scrolling pretty rarely do I
notice and you slow down and then on the OnePlus 5 the version we have is packing and
insane 8 gigabytes of RAM I get the RAM it's different than your laptop but let
that sink in a lot of computers out there I'd wager don't have 8 gigabytes
of RAM in them it is an insane amount to pack into a phone I'm not even sure
Android take advantage of the full amount of RAM all of that couple of the
Snapdragon 835 you've got a recipe for it incredibly fast phone and it is in
fact I noticed how zippy it was and perhaps maybe with psychosomatic joiners
8 gigabytes of RAM in here but everything on this phone just felt that
even that same thing that bogged down surprisingly the galaxy S8 trying
to pull the keyboard searching for an app seemed fast it might be attributed to
oxygen OS vs TouchWiz I don't know but everything felt quick zippy and
in other words like used to describe fastness felt that on the oneplus 5 so if
you're keeping track at home we are all tied up 3 to 3 heading into the last
category and that is intangible than both these phones bring a ton of in
tangibility to the table on the estate side you've got things like wireless
charging iris scanning Fisher recognition a headphone jack Samsung pay
absolute killer screen expandable storage and you can buy it on all four
carriers on the oneplus 5 side you've got just insane performance
you've got - charging way better value for the price if you're not buying ideal
on the galaxy s8 and there are a lot of deals to be had on those phones got
better audio headphone jack as well it's got more band support and it is dual SIM
for me though wireless charging is a big one for me waterproofing also someone
who's dropped their phone and water the big one to have this is a tough one to
call but intangibles for me go to the Galaxy s8 so we've got a winner by four
to three the Galaxy s8 takes this crown this is a big testament though to OnePlus for
phone that is at least full retail price about two hundred dollars less to
compete with a flagship from Samsung one of the largest manufacturers in the
world damn impressive what oneplus has done they didn't build a perfect phone
they built a really good phone I would have loved things like waterproofing and
a high-resolution display but those things drive the price up oneplus is
trying to find a nice value price versus performance and they struck a really
nice balance I love doing use versus videos let me know down below which
verses you want to see come up next our last time we did was the Galaxy s8
versus the iPhone 7 if you want to check that out you guys agree with me am i way
off base leave in the comments and let me know I want to hear from you we'll
have the whole discussion about it until next time I'm Jon Retinger from
TechnoBuffalo we took these two mobile units and put
them head-to-head which is not easy to do but one thing that is easy is to
finally tell you there is a legit no compromise wireless headphones outs if
you sick of bad battery life or doesn't stay in your ear or the audio fidelity
sucks the Zolo liberty+ have you covered these things have a ton of
Technology in teeny tiny little earbud size packages so the first big thing to
know about the liberty+ you get up to 48 hours of battery life which is
absolutely insane and beyond that they've got alexa built in so just tap
your Liberty+ ask Alexa what the weather is as
your shopping list whatever you want her to do she can do for you want to take a
pair of these up and if you're in the market for wireless headphones you
should really consider these you get the kickstarter price for 99 bucks for the
price jumps up to a hundred and forty-nine bucks

technology sparks a passion in people if you've read the comments section of anything iOS or Android you will see the fervor that people have for technology and what does sometimes lend itself to disagreeing there's one thing we can all agree on saving some money so in that vein let's unify the tech loving population and here's some top tech to help save you some cash the big caveat here that for a lot of these things certainly you have to buy them so the goal is to save money over the longer term of the product the first one is a smart thermostat Nest and Ecobee tend to get most of the press or become smart thermostats those are expensive starting around 250 bucks and going up there are less expensive options from Honeywell and a few others but these smart thermostats do move the needle on a yearly basis for an average annual savings 231 240 five dollars according to Nest and Ecobee own findings so loud you guys might have a landline bundled into your cable plan or maybe your parents have a landline phone it's time to drop that and go to voice over IP or VoIP is incredibly less expensive option that gives you almost the same features if not more than most and landlines there's a lot of options things like Ooma was also lower cost options like magic jack this next one's gonna some kind of obvious but shocking people are still stuck in a contract it's an unlocked smartphone most major carriers now offer a plan we can pay your phone off over time but you're still paying interest on that device you can afford to buy a phone outright buy it unlocked phones not gonna be stuck any to your contracts you're not sucking payment plans and the freedom and flexibility to move carriers if you choose unlocked smartphones i could go on for probably another 10 minutes in some video to why it's a better option you can swing it get an unlocked phone this next one is something i think a lot of you guys are considering doing and that is cutting the cord and going for a streaming service for your TV coupled with an HD antenna HD antennas cost between 1300 bucks you access to local channels all in HD and streaming options are now becoming really easily available you've got DirectTV NOW starting at 35 bucks a month which does have some issues Sling TV at twenty bucks a month and also have on demand options as well things like Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime etc on a good package of channels that you watch not pay for channels you don't watch consider cutting the cord and probably cutting off around 60 bucks off your cable bill I'm get a little nerdy with you these next ones these are LED light bulbs and you think of these a lot of folks think that color doing one's from LIFX or HUE and those certainly countess LED bulbs we don't have to get fancy light changing bulbs that save some cash they're way less expensive options you probably think about outlet so much like stuff in stuff gets power their energy conserving outlets that cost around thirty fifty dollars that will more than pay for themselves over the course of a few years they'd like you to cut power to an outlet without having to plug around plug devices to have to worry about any sort of power drain or paying for power to keep things I know you're not using TP-Link smart plugs 30 bucks Orvibo has a Wi-Fi smart socket for 21 so you can get one really good one in that thirty dollar price range and last but not least by your cable modem stop lease in that thing cable internet companies really wanted to lease their cable modem it can be purchased for as low as 50 bucks and they're happy to charge you six to ten dollars per month to lease one stop it stop doing it go out and buy one just kind of affordable options starting around like I said 55 bucks that will pay for themselves in less than a year net gears got some TP-Link got a few go to BestBuy look online links are down below to Amazon if you want to pick up a new cable modem but stop leasing you'd be surprised how much money you can save there's a lot of other things you can do to help save money but technology can also help you save some cash you guys like this video and you want to see more let us know and we will do more videos showing you some of the cool stuff you can do to save some cash and technology can commute is not fight over smartphone os's and for a comment of the day this comes from our tesla model x one month later review it comes from cruise earth who says that car is a douche factor plus 1,000 Thank You cruiser I appreciated you want to be an upcoming come to the day it's pretty obvious just just leave a comment down below and say something funny or witty or kiss this guy making fun of me and perhaps we will feature you and will link you guys down below as well it's more subscribers video a thumbs-up we appreciate it the next time i'll see you guys in the next video 
I want to thank the awesome folks at
Anker and the Power Core 2 portable battery for making this epic video
possible keeping all our gear charged up so this is a Tesla Model X it's actually
my car I've been driving it for the better part of a year we've held off on
her floor review because the car was delivered to me initially it was missing
a ton of features that ultimately came over the air so it has the autopilot 2.0
hardware but at delivery none of it was active in fact the car could do less and
older cars that are quipped with Hardware 1.0 when I mentioned autopilot
2 hardware it's essentially it's 12 ultrasonic sensors all around the car
and eight cameras gonna make this thing eventually
according to Elon Musk and supposedly by the end of the year be fully level five
autonomous so this version that I have is a 75D the 75 means it's
got a 75 kilowatt hour battery in the D is dual motor so essentially it's
all-wheel drive it's got an advertised range of about 237 miles but I've never
once gotten close to that when I do almost a full hundred cent charge
generally shows about 220 miles and that's not actual range it's gonna
depend on your driving so you got to really use the car to see how many miles
you can actually get Tesla doesn't recommend you charge the card up to a hundred
percent the recommend about 80 percent so sort of cycles through the cells it's
gonna be a 0-60 time of about four and a half seconds I've actually clocked it
that's what  I got so it's not a slow car for being something this big you
could option it up Tesla let's sort of change your battery pack size and get a
100 D give you a faster 0-60 and up your range just under 300 and if you want the
fastest Model X available you can get a P100D so bringing it down to about
four seconds or under four seconds and keep that almost 300 mile range of
course things start to get super expensive from there so driving an EV
is different for some people it's obviously no gas and other questions
that I get is what is it gonna cost to actually fill up or charge the car so I
charge my in off hours here in Southern California so it's about ten to eleven
cents per kilowatt so from zero to a full 75 kilowatt hour charge it's gonna
cost me about $8.25 so to go 200 ish miles it's about eight
dollars for me so way less what you get with gas charging up the model X is pretty
easy I installed the 240 outlet at home and I just use the standard charge that
came with the car it'll charge generally about 20-ish
miles an hour you can get bigger faster charges but for me that was totally fine
it's like a cell phone I plug in at night and I wake up in the morning and
it's got a full charge I never have to deal with gas station or issue at
all but if you need faster charging you need sort of more regular charging
Tesla's got super chargers all over the US in fact they're expanding I think
they're gonna go like 2x which is what they have right now it can charge
your car up to 80% in about 30 minutes and it is insanely fast it's not quite
as fast as gas yet but it works and the stations are almost everywhere and
actually inside the car will tell you if there's a stall available the big story with the Model X is the doors the Falco Wing doors people love them or hate them I'm kind
of in the middle I certainly liked them when I got the
car sort of the big appeal of a car like this in practical use they work very
well in certain situations and others they are definitely an inconvenience
they used to be really slow when the car first shipped it would take almost four
seconds the doors open up but as software updates have come doors are
opened up a way faster and I will say even in tight spots I have never once
hit another car the car have been are really good about detecting overhead beams never
hit overhead beams either putting kids in out of the car it's been really nice
to have those I don't have to sort of twist of my back to get kids in and sort of walk
up to the car and you can just put the kids straight in so the Falcon wing
doors have held up really well I haven't had any issues with them but my
passenger door it's a little bit of a creak in it you can you can hear what it
sounds like doesn't affect the performance at all or detecting anything
it just sort of is a bit of an annoyance so aside from the Falcon doors another
highlight feature of the Model X is its kind of helicopter type of windshield
and when you sit in the car it's unlike any other experience you can look up and you
can sort of see straight up it's different that a panoramic group you don't have
that sort of cross beam it's just sort of glass all the way up and it sounds
awesome on paper they put some sort of tint on it to drive and block out the sun
and they claim it blocks 97% of UV rays and the heat but it gets really hot so
Tesla does some things really well they're innovators and technology but
some stuff is just kind of baffling to me why
they would do it the visors on the model X are weird it's like a strange magnetic
dance you got to pull it and snap it and then pull it down again to get the visor
to come out and if you want to block the Sun so you got his freakin glass over
you it's strange to do and it's so little
profile doesn't do much so you can configure the car with different seating
arrangement so you can get a five seater a six seater or seven seater I opted for
the six seater I like that alley in the middle it's gonna
give you two captain chairs in the second row and then two seats in the
third row you get a ton of storage back there that sort of a hidden compartment
in the back sort of store stuff kind of like a minivan kind of looks like a
minivan anyway you've got the front trunk two stories for sorting some kind
of extra stuff that you might need it so I opted for the white interior and when
I first did our video on the Model X I got a lot of like what's wrong with you
you got kids why would you go white so according to Elon Musk
the vegan material that goes into this is the most durable of all the Tesla
materials that includes their leathers and synthetics so I was a bit dubious to
have white in my car especially as someone who wears jeans every day so going on now a year
I've had ketchup spill on those seats I've had coffee spill on those seats and
I've had other gross stuff that kids tend to eat on those seats and I can say
the seats look almost brand new so if you're nervous about getting the white
actually seems to be really good even more durable and some of the leather
options at Tesla offers so I option in my car with the air suspension that
means you can sort of raise it up or down you can sort of do it manually
it'll remember locations so if you'd like to raise it up when you go to work
it'll do that automatically you get there it's a really cool feature that
the car has the main reason that got it thought is gonna make the ride seem a
little smooth I can sort of adjust itself as it goes over bumps it turns
out the suspension on this thing is tuned like a sports car you feel every
single bump in the road it doesn't matter if you've got air suspension or not
I was kind of disappointed the suspension of Tesla put in here it's a
way harsher ride that would have wanted from the big family hauling SUV if I had
a Model S maybe I'd expect it if I had even a model 3 or a roadster you
kind of want that hard suspension you want to feel the bumps in the road but
in a car like this that was not a welcome surprise the biggest reason that I got
the Model X was autopilot I loved what it could do and I loved the promise of
what it was ultimately going to be able to do but as it stands right now it's
like level 2-ish autonomy it means it can do some stuff they got to stay
aware and stay diligent but when it's doing its thing in the right conditions
it is awesome so you give the cruise control stock a little DoubleTap towards
you it's gonna activate autopilot and it works you can essentially take your
hands off the wheel while paying attention and the car is going to
navigate itself it's meant to be used on freeways it's still technically in beta
but it works in all conditions it works on turns it works in the rain
it works anywhere you want to use it on a freeway damn is it cool if you
want to change lanes you put the signal up and it'll change lanes for you on its
own it'll make sure things are clear and it'll go it won't keep going if you keep
the signal on that you got to turn off and turn it back on again and it'll keep
speed other features are coming like being able to pass on its own and that
kind of stuff but as it stands right now it works really well with a few super
dangerous caveats if it can't track the lanes it'll try and track a car in front
of it you'll see the car kind of turn blue on the dash if lane markings aren't
so bright it'll kind of ping-pong around it also works on city streets it's not
technically meant for that but you can turn it on if you go through a big
intersection if there isn't a car in front you that it can track I mean this
thing can almost veer off into another Lane so you got to stay diligent and you
got to stay awake when using autopilot but in the right conditions it is
absolutely awesome it can make a long drive or stop and go traffic really kind
of usable so I mentioned the cars equipped with autopilot 2.0 and as this
filming doesn't really do anything that the original auto pilot didn't but it
does do a ton of stuff so first the car's got a summon feature which means from
your key fob or the mobile app you can make the car go forward or back without
anybody in it which is insane and ultimately the car is going to use the
autopilot 2.0 software to drive itself so you could park it in a spot you can
summon it the car to come to you it'll pull out the spot it'll turn
and drive and go right to where you are doesn't work as of yet
right now it's forward and reversed but it is really cool I'd also can for a
particular Park itself or parallel park itself with varying degrees of accuracy
so I love the Model X for me it's perfect but the car itself is far from
perfect I like what it represents I like it's sort of electric propulsion I like
that I'm kind of paying to pave the way for cars like the model three I'm okay with
all of that I wish Tesla would have done some other stuff I wish there was more
storage in the car I wish the visors weren't freaking weird
I wish autopilot wasn't kind of squirrely at times but overall in a
whole package the cars been incredible Tesla delivered on their promise
the Falcon Wing doors are awesome they're usable they're not necessary but I'm
glad that they're here if anything they're kind of a conversation starter
I'm really happy with the Model X it was a three year lease for me and I'll be
sad to give it away in two more years perhaps my next car will be a model 3 a
model Y or event another one of these guys but I think Tesla hit a home run with this
car I know it's not growing any beauty awards but for a functional family
hauler or a car that has a lot of storage capacity it's really good in
fact it's probably my favorite car that I've never had so much to my surprise
the ultra white seats held up the Falcon wing doors have been usable with no issues
the car is still plenty fast enough and I love it it's not a perfect car but
it's a perfect car for me this video has been a year in the making we wanted to
show the Model X when it got to its full capacity or at least on par with what
autopilot 1.0 could do it's only gonna get better from here we should have full
autonomy coming in the next two years hopefully if you subscribe to Elon's
promises more features should be coming over the next few years this car will
drive itself this car park itself this car will become even more usable
than day one and I love that as a geek as a car enthusiast as a tech guy and as
a dad this car has been the most perfect package that could imagine so like
pretty much all EVs except for hydrogen the Tesla uses lithium-ion cells to give it
its juice it's sort of the same lithium-ion cells that something like an
external battery pack would use and I want to take a quick second to thank our
friends at Anker for sponsoring this video and making something of this epic
proportion happen I've got their power core 2 here
it's a 10,000 mAh power battery same lithium-ion technology that's in the car
is in the battery pack like this so if you want something that's gonna last you
wanna be able make sure your gadgets can be charged much like you want your car
to be charged so if want to learn more about Anker or the battery pack we will
link to them down below so you guys think I hope you enjoy it's a new kind
of video for us I really want to make it as epic as possible until next time I'm
Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo hope you guys enjoyed the review none of our
incredible aerial shots or car tracking shots could be possible without the
incredibly awesome and talented people at drone gear if you wanna check out their
channel link here they also did a BTS video behind-the-scenes of our shoot day
with them we'll link to that down below 
So I'm gonna get to the video but before
lets just play a quick game how many months ago do you think the
iPhone 8 and the 8 Plus came out the answers is a very surprising at least for me four
months ago I had to look it up September 22nd Apple released the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus we've had a lot of time to look at it now a lot of my testing time has been
spent admittedly checking out the iPhone X but I went back and looked at the 8
in the 8 Plus to revisit it see if it's still the phone but I know a lot of you
guys are considering buying is you look at the iPhone X and you're like so my
initial review was that the phones really surprised me I wasn't expecting
that much from the 8 and the 8 Plus and that's kind of changed a little bit
because I started using it then I started expecting a lot from it the
performance on the phone is absolutely credible I never thought that most
modern release iPhones were ever slow they're always behind you when it came to
raw horsepower but iOS was optimized for the hardware the phone here still feels
incredibly fast with iOS 11 boot up is insanely fast as fast of course you get
with things like the iPhone X games load incredibly quick third-party apps
load fast you can throw geekbench scores all you want but end user
experiences what matters the phone still feels extremely fast the big difference
for me coming back to the 8 plus I spent a lot of my time testing with from the
10 was getting used to touch ID again I'm so used to not having a home button
and got used to using gestures that was definitely a learning curve but if your
coming from an iPhone that wasn't the iPhone X we're gonna be right at home
with this experience touch ID here still works very well in fact it looks
better for me more accurately than Face ID does but certainly you have to
you know use your thumb to do it it was a bit hard to get used to not having
gestures again but after two days it really wasn't an issue this multitasking
very quickly at least how Apple allows you to multitask
with giant air quotes battery life is also another area where I became
extremely impressed with the phone I've been super disappointed battery life on
the iPhone X on the iPhone 8 Plus I can almost stretch this thing out to two days
with normal usage and auto brightness turned on battery life is damn
incredible when it comes to the iPhone 8 Plus and I mentioned battery life before I
got the screen because I'm probably gonna seem like a bit of a hypocrite
here and I'm totally aware of that it's a 1080p screen and you can take
that for what you want it's no longer a best-in-class screen that's like doesn't
work great it's still really solid outdoors picture still a great text still looks crisp you're not seeing any chunkiness you're not see any pixels cuz it's still
more than the eye can see but it certainly doesn't look as good as
a competition especially the equally priced competition but of course the
trade-off you're getting awesome battery life so again like I said I know it's
super critical to be like I want a higher-risk green and awesome battery
life because you give you just clearly can't have everything as you saw what
happens to the iPhone X battery life but I'd probably sacrifice like a tiny
bit of battery to maybe get a higher resolution screen on it but if you're
coming from an older Jen Plus device you're not gonna lose any difference
here on the screen at all it's similar experience it works well it's true tone
display is nice actually I kept it on here so it boils down to this screen is
fine I really love the way the glass back feel on this generation devices I
also really like the color I wish Apple could decide what the heck color space
gray actually was it's like six different versions in eight different iterations
but I liked away Space Gray looks I really liked her the eggshell white of
the silver I loved that wireless charging is enabled
here the Space Gray is definitely fingerprint magnet so if you go for that
color I definitely recommend putting on a dbrand skin so you get a little bit
more grip on it well link to those down below if you want to check them out my
issue with the 8 plus and this is a minor issue than the design front it's
the fourth iteration of the same design we saw this back from the iPhone 6 and
6 Plus things haven't really changed that much but if you like that design
you're still getting a really good phone and that's kind of the moral of this
whole video you're still getting almost everything that you get from the iPhone
X with a few exceptions certainly the front-facing camera you're not getting
portrait mode you're getting close to the same rear camera and of course the
same speed you with the iPhone X if you want to save some money
you want the latest Apple experience I'm still really enjoying the iPhone 8 plus
but I will say the plus feels gigantic in my hands so if you don't mind the
giant screen size you want to go back something like the iPhone 8 which it's a
whole other discussion when it comes to the screen on that phone that's the
decision up to you it's certainly a better value if you can save value when it
comes to an Apple flagship phone and you're still getting close to what you
get with the iPhone X so let me know what you guys picked up I know a lot of
you guys decided to go for the iPhone 8 or the 8 Plus over the X if you switch to Android
it all together and of course hit the subscribe button and that little Bell
next to it you notify when new videos are coming we got a ton more awesome
flagship vs. videos coming your way that's all next time I'm Jon Rettinger
from TechnoBuffalo 
you know things get super intense when they get cranked up to 11 meet the latest from HTC this is the U 11 but one seem to be going longer in thinner with like a two by one a sec ratio or like a two point seven six five by 1.2 it's like to see just a normal aspect ratio phone it is a big phone though it's not for for tiny baby hands or for just normal adult hands but is a 5.5 inch quad HD screen it's got Corning Gorilla Glass 5 all over it so should be pretty protective but if you plan on getting it wet or or dusty no this only has IP 67 so obviously this is a very design centric phone it is extremely glossy in fact if you want to use it like a mirror like the old palm trees back in the days with this thing around pretty much any color save for the white which looks beautiful but not coming to the US you can use just as a reflection or like to blind somebody usually comes along with really glossy backs fingerprint D so you don't want to keep a microfiber cloth with you HTC did pack a lot on the software and the specs side so it is Android 7.1 which is really nice and it's HTC Sense that's not the only sense that's in here the big stories that you 11 is the edge sense such as you can squeeze the phone you can almost use it like two separate buttons a short press can be anything you want to launch the camera you can launch a web browser they made it really customizable and a long squeeze can watch something else so you essentially get two separate buttons so having to find and locate two separate buttons on the film in our testing it works really well it's kind of fun to set up don't know how useful it's going to be on a daily basis but if you want extra buttons you find yourself looking for shortcuts it's a really ingenious way to do an HTC did a nice job putting it together it also packs pretty much the latest specs it's got a snapdragon 835 in there it's got 4 gigs of ram 64 gigs of storage is the only storage option of course you can up that with a microSD card outside of the u.s. though you're going to get a different version if you want you get 6 gigs ram or 128 gigs of storage the people who have had like a mixed feeling towards HTC's cameras they've done some cool stuff ultra pickles in the past and they've kind of reverted back but the camera looks to be really nice and our initial camera test the pictures it was pretty good it's a 12 megapixel ultra pixel 3 sensor the latest camera stuff they'd expect safe detection self-timer dual LED flash f1 points of an aperture HDR boost 4k video recording the front camera really packs megapixels it's a 16 megapixel sensor it's got a live make up feature auto selfie voice selfie we've got a self timer for 10 seconds HDR boost selfie panorama and full 1080p video recording so a really nice selfie camera before I talk about sound um should get this one out of the way no that's phone Jack know what going in we love it or hate it I create a plug your headphones in unless they are USB see but HD does do a lot with sound it's high-res certified hecu sonic with active noise cancellation HTC boomsound hi Fayed ition so got the extra 5 you know it's going to sound pretty good HTC has done a really awesome job of audio fidelity in the past so I expect even better performance from you 11 on the battery side its 3000 milliamp hours I feel kind of the same way I do about that as I do about the lack of a headphone jack HTC claims we get about 24 and a half hours or so of talktime and up to 14 days of standby time and of course all the other Qualcomm quick charge stuff it expected here like quick charge 3.0 you also added extreme power saving mode so this is the HTC new 11 it's glossy it's shiny it's big bold and is hopefully HTC's come back I'm gonna reserve judgment so I get a chance to actually play with it we only got some hands-on for real few minutes the screen looks bright the camera looks pretty solid how it all comes together in a package you use on a daily basis you have to be determined to being able to squeeze the phone and something very new got to retrain your brain to the grip and grab when you are gripping and grabbing the phone does feel really nice in the hand HGT spent a lot of time clearly trying to make the screen to the back view almost bezel listen to feel like you can't find a theme with your finger and you can't the build quality a typical HTC fashion is awesome whether or not just the phone for you I can't answer yet I want to get one though and technical buffle offices will test it and will let you know what we think if you wanted to test anything in particular leave in the comments down below if you want to see that full review is a video a thumbs up to let us know you want a review of the HTC EU 11 so next time and John Ranger some TechnoBuffalo you 
all-in-one PCs of a very interesting reputation these days most people don't consider them that slow computer like they once were and we're just good for browsing the web or checking email but they're not also considered to be the best of the best that can handle 4k video editing as well as VR gaming right out of the box but Dell is looking to change that mindset the new all-in-one 27-inch Inspiron 7000 can do just that but is there really both a beauty and a beast let's talk about it so let's get specs out of the way first thing our unit is powered off of an 8 core AMD Rison processor with 16 gigs of RAM and rx 580 GPU a 256 gig nvme SSD coupled with a one terabyte hard drive for data storage it's also got a 4k anti-glare IPS display that dominates the front of this machine it's a fairly beefy system inside and considering they crimp all these components inside an all-in-one which is a fairly small and compact footprint I'm pretty impressed so the screen on this all-in-one machine is really following that design trend from Dell of an infinity edge display I mean you're gonna have thinner bezels on the top and the sides of the display but the bottom is gonna have a much bigger chunkier bezel but at least that bezel serves double duty it sports Dells performance stereo speakers under the grill as well as a Windows hello compatible IR camera and a webcam I still have my gripes with the webcam it is decent quality but it's probably in the most unflattering position possible though I really like Windows hello it's convenient it's fast it was fairly consistent throughout my testing speakers were also fairly decent definitely loud enough to be used for any movie night with friends or if you want to fill up your home office of music the big story of course is that 27-inch display it's an IPS panel with a matte finish that kind of helps prevent glare and the colors look super vibrant and sharp playing back 4k content on this display looked fantastic and they'll amount a huge fan of that anti-glare display technology it didn't take away from quality at all jumping to i/o on the back of this thing is almost every single port you could ask for it's got a USB C port though no Thunderbolt 3 here multiple USB 3 ports an HDMI out port and even an HDMI IN port so you can actually plug in a console of your choice and use this thing for all its 4k display goodness there's even a full-size SD card slot and an Ethernet port so you're getting kind of all the creature comforts of a desktop tower but in a pretty stylish all-in-one form factor so besides just watching 4k content on the display you're probably I don't want to use the computer to edit 4k video and do some moderate to high intensive gaming and this Michigan handles all of it really well I had no issues whatsoever editing 4k video back in Premiere Pro playing it back full quality in the timeline and rendering it out it was all super fast and on par with other Intel machines the rx 580 is also a very capable graphics card big-name titles like GTA 5 rocket League and battle grounds all ran extremely well at moderately high settings mostly thanks to that eight gigs of video ram you can play games and 4k on this thing they're gonna have to adjust your settings accordingly to get pretty decent framerate I will mention though that we had some issues playing battlegrounds kind of the hottest game out right now but at the time of this recording the game is still in alpha and not very well optimized though it is still definitely playable on this machine so the RX 580 graphics card and the eight core eyes and CPU inside of this machine the computers actually already right out of the box and Dell loves to tell you that on the website so grab your VR headset a choice plug it in and you can play VR games without any hiccups fan noise was an initial concern of mine and especially with an all-in-one having all those components crammed in and I thought it was going to be really loud but Dell did a pretty good job venting and cooling all these components and even under load the fans are definitely on and audible but it didn't sound like a jet engine was taking off from my desk bottom line I had zero performance issues of this machine this is my first time extensively testing a rise in base PC and I was really pleasantly surprised with how well it performed day to day tasks like checking email and browsing the web and doing some light photo and video editing was super speedy and fast and even with some heavier tasks like full-on 4k video editing and some moderate gaming the system handled all of it really well another thing worth mentioning is that for being an all-in-one this machine is surprisingly upgradable unscrewing a few screws on the back gets you access to the guts in the machine and the RAM hard drive and even the nvme SSD can all be replaced and though it's not encouraged by Dell some reports online say that with a little bit more work the CPU can also be upgraded so I really do like this Dell all-in-one and I have had a lot of negative things to say about it but though I know you'll ask let's talk quickly about peripherals Dell will tell you all these great things about their keyboard and mouse combo and how it won a bunch of awards but though that may be true I don't have a lot of praise for them I will say the keyboard is actually surprisingly a pretty solid wireless keyboard had a really good key travel and it was pretty comfortable to type on but the mouse just felt cheap and lightweight and put my hand in kind of an awkward position a wired or wireless mouse of your choice is a simple and easy solution to this problem but I did think it was worth mentioning and wrapping things up with pricing we have one of the higher configurations that Dell offers for this machine but you can get a baseline configuration of this machine for just $9.99 so to answer my original question yes the Inspiron 7000 really is both a beauty and a beast despite its plastic build that I thought was a little bit cheap it really is a good-looking computer that packs a lot in a really small and compact footprint do you want to finally

Amazon Alexa products are everywhere these days you see him in the bedroom the kitchen the bathroom and we're also starting to see them sneak into the car this is the rove Viva and it's bringing those Alexa features that used to in-home into the car now you might be thinking why would I want Amazon Alexa in my car I'm supposed to be driving but there's actually a lot of cool uses for it so you can do things like control your favorite music services like Spotify or Pandora just with your voice you can ask for directions and it can open it up in Google Maps or ways you can even order things from Amazon so if you're driving and you're like prep I forgot to order toilet paper you can do that right from your car and because it's connected to Alexa you can control all the different skills you're already using so say you're getting home and you want to turn on the lights you just ask Alexa in your car and when you walk in the lights are already on so the way this works is you take the dongle and plug it into your 12-volt outlet in your car and it looks just like a normal car charger and it actually is it has two fast charging ports so you can charge your phone or your tablet or anything you like then you head over to your phone and download the Rho vive app connect it to the dongle and then set up your Alexa preferences and then you're pretty much ready to go so you will need your phone in order for this to work whether it's an iPhone or an Android phone but every time you get into your car it'll automatically connect aside from the two charging ports that are built in you also have two microphones that are built-in and that's so it can hear you and I found that even when driving around and you hear the road noise it still picks up your voice relatively well and if you don't want to be heard there's a mute button right in the middle and you just push that and it has a little bonus if your car doesn't have hands-free calling built-in you can make phone calls through the vive in the few days that I've been using the vive I've really enjoyed it I've used it for directions and for asking things like the weather and the location I'm going to and it works as advertised although I will say that it's a little bit better on Android just the limitations that iOS has having an Android phone will make this experience almost perfect so why would you buy this and I think there's one specific reason and that's if you're already invested in the Alexa ecosystem sure there's other assistants out there but if you're ready--you so using Alexa switching over can be kind of weird the vive you can use your alexis skills like you're used to just in one more in your car if you want to pick one up for yourself it goes for fifty dollars but if you use the code viva Cara you can get it for $10 off through March seventh week for that is down in the description I would like anchor for sponsoring this video and be sure to let us know down below in the comments what you think would you put this in your car I hope you enjoyed this video if you did be sure to hit subscribe and hit that notification bell so you can see when new videos are up oh thank you all so much for watching again I'm Matt Gonzalez with TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you next time [Music] 
I wasn't entirely sure how to start this video I have to say this video sponsored by Sony but in reality I feel like this video is sponsored by spider-man he was sponsored by freaking spider-man Sony reached out it was like hey spider-man homecomings coming out July 7th they have a cool opportunity to be a part of the promotion for the movie you want to do it I've never replies like hell yeah faster than that you know if you don't notice about me I'm a huge comic nerd not like a johnny-come-lately comic nerve and like MC you started but like since I was a little kid this is my comic collection from when I was tiny and I've been collecting comics for ever I mean I was a cub of them I've got two more tubs at home I lived and breathed this stuff when I was little and served the geek culture become something cool look see these characters that I loved as a kid on the silver screen or on the movies has been absolutely awesome so a chance to be on the periphery of something that had to do with that world was beyond incredible and I guess this was very different in typical text video that we've done but this was an opportunity for me to live a dream so like it was that we can make our own spider-man costume promote the spider-man DIY that you could sort of make your own spider-man costume Sony was working in conjunction with goodwill it was sort of goodwill find stuff so make a spider-man costume you could make one and then we got a chance to present our costume to spider-man himself Tom Holland you got to go to the YouTube space enter latest film which was cool in its own right and they wouldn't let me see the steps days built for the spider-man stuff it was like very secretive and they had to cover my eyes before I went in and I walked in and now I know why they did it they defensively built Peter Parker's labs at the YouTube space they had actual props in the movies they had the actual homemade spider-man costume they had a vulture costume big guns and other stuff from the movie it was incredible deceit and I I mean they got my initial reaction on camera and I was Lord in fact if the actual cost me were there they had the Tony Stark costumes from draped in a corner just all the things that were there with like my whole childhood coming back to me sort of coming to life which is a insanely awesome opportunity and I got to sort of build my costume in this set I got to feel like Peter Parker was just such a badass time and cool thing to do we had our idea already in place for the costume that we wanted to go with but we got there they're like a table just like biter stuff out everywhere from like sequins like belt buckles like Seuss and sock I always like the Scarlet Spider kind of look we took a kind of a hipster look at hoodie and cut it and then we use stencils to make a spider logo we want to like a battle-worn type look for a costume to use like feeds blood and we cut it we found these really cool like scoop of boots that really web base that look like a costume and then we've got to make goggles and put a hood over it I think the costumes would look bad at it looks kind of homemade it looks like Peter Parker's costume from the movie before he gets that Tony Stark dude I was really proud of how it looked and then when I showed my son the video telling him Spider Man I will for my whole life remember to look on the face it was something that I will never forget we've done a lot of sponsored videos have done a lot of videos in jail over the years but there are some memories that stand out of this professional career getting the dress up like spider-man meeting spider-man and the look on my son's face is the answer sadly if every man was absolutely incredible it was just a really inspiring experience to be a part of and again I know not a tech video this is a chance for me to live my dream like really live my dream and I decided I wanted to share it with you guys so I've talked about the costume and I hope you guys want to see it so if you're watching this after June I link down below to go to the Sony YouTube channel to check it out watch it before June 9th wait Lincoln costume came out awesome got to keep kind of cool effects smoke and I was in a fight II lab with props from the actual movie it was awesome will link to it to check it out wait till June 9th it was again friggin dream come true and if you guys had a chance to make your own spider-man suit what kind of style would you go with you or something like we did Karluk spider original like traditional Peter Parker out like a spider Gwen I want to know what you would do leave in the comments down below I'll be back talking about tech soon but for right now I'm going to like really just sort of back and it's incredible a credible opportunity I'll see you guys the next one you 
the hype for the model 3 you need to be like a combination of like iPhone 8 hype and like galaxy s 8 hype like combined into one tech loving car enthusiast machine but there's something coming next from Tesla after the model 3 and that is the model y they're smaller than Model X crossover with the Falcon wing doors that Elon Musk had said was coming sometime late 2019 early 2020 he had said it's going to be built on a brand new architecture not using the model 3 platform even model 3 underpinnings which made very little sense so on yesterday's quarterly earnings call Elon Musk said and I quote upon the counsel of my executive team who reeled me back from the cliffs of insanity much appreciated the model I will in fact be using substantial carryover from the model 3 or to bring it to market much faster he also added I want to thank the executive team for stopping me from being a fool so there's a lot to read into that I think when you think about Tesla I oftentimes think about it it's just Elon Musk but he's surrounded by really smart dudes you got JB Straubel Franz on hold Houston who did all the design really smart guys you probably thought that building a brand new platform does not make much sense specially from a business standpoint so you look at the model 3 right now we've got about 450,000 reservations at $1,000 each if they were going to use a brand new platform for the model one only would it complicate the assembly line platform for a new company it also would probably push back the date of delivery and if you figure that 2019 2020 date is now going to be earlier for the model why a lot of us didn't give a date but would assume now probably late 2018 maybe early 2019 that means Tesla could have jumped started almost another half a million reservations at $1,000 each there was a lot of money they're bringing to the table earlier you're probably wondering why musk would even try and build a new platform for the model why it goes back to the Model X and allegedly just the damn disaster that car was for Tesla it's based on the Model S but they couldn't get the engineering right it was delayed by almost a year they had quality problems the cars for shipped almost through a year after shipping a lot of tributed to the Falcon wing doors so we said you know what screw it we're able to brand your platform with this design in mind and they certainly backed off from that so a few things refresh you on the model why it is going to Falcon wing doors give me about the same size to think of a BMW x3 or the Audi q3 store the smaller crossover there won't be a third row seat it'll have a Franck and I'll have a hatchback in the back of course and the last thing about the model Wyatt can be the first card can do away the 12-volt batteries addition to having that big old battery injected car every Tesla still has the old school lead acid battery in there so the model y is going to do away with that so made a ton of sense I give much credit for backing off I'd expect to probably see a model Y announcement towards like the early part of 2018 and then do a big date with the model 3 have another announcer on their ready to ship and then deliveries probably a year later so I love talking about Tesla it's a credible story the mayor came manufacturing it's brilliant engineering it comes from the mind I think of one of the greatest visionaries that we've seen in almost the past hundred years it's a passion of mine I hope you guys don't mind me chatting cars over now then especially electric cars kind of cool to chat about but before I end I do want to thank audible for making this video possible you guys probably know who audible is that a leading purveyor of audiobooks and actually sponsor this video and actually I

Galaxy s8 you've probably heard about it
it's been about two months since our review actually hit and I bought a
galaxy s8 plus for Verizon for myself and in between testing of their phones it's
been my daily driver for almost every day or that eight week period if you
watch our new show review you'll know I really loved the phone but things have changed a little bit since then so some general thoughts about the galaxy S8
first I'm still in love with the design the screen still looks like a sticker to
me it does even look like a real screen Samsung's technology is absolutely
awesome and the review I said I didn't mind it
an outdoor sunlight the more I used in outdoor sunlight the more I took it to
the park to try to take pictures the more I was outside the less awesome the
screen got in direct sun left turn the brightness up to a hundred percent you
get a warning from Samsung and telling you not to do that and this one gets
incredibly warm I just keep my brightness around 50% so in direct
sunlight it has not been as good as my initial sort of first week impressions
with the device so bear that in mind also not as good initially thought
battery life typically getting through a full day now it's like 20% down about
five ten percent of my initial review perhaps I'm using it a little bit more
perhaps I have more apps open in the background I don't have my brightness
set to serve auto brightness I keep it again at 50% I just like it there I can
get through a full day no problem but still not as strong as initially thought
the other little knock on this phone and I'm a big wireless charging guy and
before Yelp man oh it's not Wireless you gotta plug the the chi pad and I
understand that Wireless for the phone phone goes on it the contact point for
the phone really small and oftentimes if I put it down I turn the phone off I
move it a little bit sir my phone background the more I notice it wouldn't
have been fully charged so small annoyance is there the last thing that
still annoys me is the fingerprint reader and I read the comments our
review it was overwhelming Jon just  put a case on it and you can find
a location I don't like to have a case on this phone I loved where this one
feels the designer for me is part of the appeal of the device I feel like you
lose that with the case so let's get the S8 plus the larger
version I don't think I've ever used the fingerprint review
may be to like login to some apps but that is essentially it have anything
the retinal scanning andthe face scanning seems to be working
pretty well those are negatives those things that
have changed I still love this phone Samsung pay for me seems like magic when
I use it I love the fact that little may fit out a magnetic field for swipe cards
tap it I love the way the phone feels a design quick charger has been incredibly
awesome so my go-to camera taking pictures and
my kids it's my go-to video camera taking videos of swim lessons or
anything that I'm doing I've even used it at events I even maybe clicked it to
Apple's WWDC and take pictures on the open and I got some dirty looks from
certain company employees but the camera is absolutely awesome and there's a lot
of reasons still want to buy this phone I've never had any speed issues the
phone is so incredibly fast I know like you guys may be a little bit worried it
only had four gigs of RAM but it's still quite a bit no performance issues I'm
able to get through and to get through of use less split screen multitasking
and it's still been really smooth I don't mind the change of themes like
main care to mind the on-screen button but have a phone that looks this good
that's this thin that's powerful and still has a headphone jack which I've
used quite a bit it's really nice to have I could go back two months I would
still buy the phone again there is a huge onslaught coming of competition you've
got the essential phone coming you've got whatever Apple is going to do next
coming you've got the LG V30 oneplus five there's a lot of competition for
this premier smartphone dollar I really like the phone and also I have not once
used Bixby have zero point zero use for it and that unnecessary button I
know you can remap it just haven't done it but the moral being I still love this
phone I would buy it again in a heartbeat
still a fingerprint magnet I wish it came in different colours in the US but
I love this device apart of my favorite phone that ever tested perhaps aside
from the Galaxy Note 7 and the iPhone 6 plus also my favorite phones I've ever
used it's a great device if you want to buy a phone and the price and it going
to turn you off really look at the S8 and S8+ I don't think they're
disappointed so the moral two months in things have changed a little bit so I
like to do the revisited videos generally in a week double use test
devices it is a good enough time to get a broad sample of the product but the
more you use it obviously things can change an opinion to change so what are
your opinions on the film did you buy one as your battery life gotten a little
bit worse since you bought it is your phone get really warm when you're doing
you know mobile tethering like like mine does you wish you bought something
different let me know leave a comments down below this video a thumbs up if you
like these revisited videos we'll keep doing them until next time I'm Jon Rettinger
from TechnoBuffalo so we're about to hit upload on this video but I got something
to add went on a bit of a family vacation to Las Vegas when I took my
Galaxy s8 plus with me I wear some shorts with a bit of a narrow pocket and
the phone fell out I was sitting down and breakfast screen cracked and not
like a little bit of cracking it was a giant crack almost the whole upper left
part of the screen got destroyed and I was really sad I just mentioned that I
thought it was pretty durable I know any phone can crack depending on on how it
happens but I was bummed actually it's a first screen that I've cracked that I
can remember so repair process there's a little bit
interesting you don't have like Apple stores but there is a Samsung store
actually in LA we take the phone and get it repaired almost same day so I did
that dropped it off on a Friday night picked it up on Monday but it would have
been available later on that night I tried calling Samsung and it gave me a
prepaid label to send the phone back and we were taking a few days to get it done
so bear that in mind if you want to pick up a Samsung device lives are one of
those stores it's really nice to have as well and the repair cost came out to be
about 220 dollars after taxes so it was a tough tough pill to swallow
I'm not through sure how I stand on the break ability durability and not going
to crack this of the Galaxy s8 and s8+ now I know I should put a case on it
with my own dumbass fault I'm still not sure I'm going to pick case on it which
is also still my fault when I break it again
maybe I'll get insurance plan 
so this is the essential pH one mostly just called the essential phone we actually reviewed it on our Facebook page but I didn't take a look at it and when we first looked at it it was before it got a lot of software updates for the camera it was also before a two hundred dollar price drop making us peers to be at least a bargain at five hundred bucks I kind of wanted to take a look at it myself since I didn't do the full review we had to send back our review units we just went out and bought this one we bought in the new color that's available now it's called pure white so I figured an old-school unboxing kind of needs an old-school knife let's go ahead and dig in it's the essential phone so before I put blade to plastic I want to think actually YouTube themselves for sponsoring this video they are appropriately enough watching a brand new channel focused on unboxings it's just called youtube.com slash unbox link to it down below ton of awesome creators in boxing a lot of really cool products sure to check out especially this holiday season he's like to buy a lot of tech you want to see what's inside the box they've got you covered with the new unbox channel again link down below so if you guys are new to the channel this seems to be like my old staple this is senior stabby this is the original unboxing knife so I'm excited to take a look at the essential when we first had it in I only got it for maybe 20-30 minutes so there's a box it's got a tab on it go ahead and do a pull this kind of satisfying I like a little more whooshing noise action it should just slide it right out it's a pretty clean box if you're not familiar with essential it's actually founded by the father of Android at Andy Rubin so and there is the new pure white color which I hadn't seen it's pretty good in person inside you've got a USBC cord it seems to be a pretty good length it's also Braden it feels pretty sturdy charging brick it's USBC dongle no headphone jack so this is gonna give you on that USB see little sleeve it's got some legal material in there and a sim removal tool so so this one was 700 bucks it was kind of a tough sell but now I've got a 200 I love price drop we're getting a lot of phone for your money including the highest quality materials you ever seen in a phone the back is ceramic and the side banding is titanium and they claim it's gonna be super durable in drop specially the titanium band the most common drop is on the corner and ceramic it supposedly pre dura but we've seen some drop tests with the ceramic has cracked the front is of course glass and it is Gorilla Glass five and there's a lot of talk about about the screen first you're getting about 85% screen to body ratio which is really awesome at the top of that screen you're get a little cyclops that is the 8 megapixel camera can also shoot 4k video it's not a dead zone I should mention also the digitizer goes across it so you can still still swipe down from that area it does make using the OS look a little bit weird of course some apps obviously not gonna be optimized for it so it's gonna make the status bar look a little bit chunky I don't mind the cyclops look I'd rather be there than have the facing camera on the bottom but at least it makes it identifiable that it's the essential phone because there's there's no little brain and on the back the fingerprint reader is going to live in the back it's really nicely placed and above that it's probably our biggest knock at least when we first tested the essential and those are the two cameras so they're dual 13 megapixel sensors you're probably thinking one regular one wide you'll be wrong it's one regular one monochrome so we'll see how that works essentials put out a ton of software update since I reviewed why I wanted to go back and look at up seen some sample to come out after the most recent update and it looks to be drastically improved I'm gonna do a visit review I'm excited to take a look this I'm excited to see if it's gotten any better I want to do more revisited reviews so anything you guys want to see us cover questions you've got about this maybe for your own experiences in the comments down below and let us know if you like every now and then an old-school unboxing video come back up also let us know in the video a thumbs up we appreciate it until next time John Rand your from TechnoBuffalo [Music] 
at Apple Developers Conference they took the wraps off iOS 11 and predictably they made the spinal tap joke they trekked it up to 11 but not predictably I think there's a lot of new features crammed into iOS Levin it certainly the flagship ones they mentioned on stage things like a new dock for the iPad a files app which certainly makes the iPad now a little bit more PC like quicktype keyboard and a ton more as we went through and installed iOS Levin we learned there's a lot of stuff in there that Apple didn't talk about there are some surprises that we found in iOS 11 and some bugs as well and the caveat here is the very first data something you can change and disappear so you could get better things to get worse just our experiences with the very first version of iOS 11 so first and probably super welcome screen recording they made it really easy to swipe up to Control Center there's a little circle tap it and your screen starts to record it's going to give you a blue bar up top it absolutely to do with tethering that's still going to be there in screen recording if you want to stop recording to tap that little blue bar and you can stop it and your video will show up in photos nice to have it there I wish that blue bar wasn't part of it and Apple users I think I've been clamoring for dark mode since we finally got it in Mac OS and you sort of have a dark mode but not like an official dark mode in iOS 11 if you go to Settings General accessibility accessibility shortcuts and hits smart invert colors you're going to get kind of a dark mode and you'll see it in settings but I did sort of go through to use the phone you'll notice that it kind of gets a little warped things it always worked out well the dock looks all kinds of messed up but at least in first party apps did you kind of get a cute version of the darkroom I don't know why Apple won't just do it but you're clamoring for them dark colors at least right now close you're going to get so instead of talking to Siri you can now type her I know it all you you Android fans are going to stay but if you want to turn that on go to general accessibility Siri turn that switch now you can type this here instead of talking towards you want to find out what the weather is like in Hawaii on Wednesday spoilered it's probably much nicer than many of us live go ahead and type it have it after Apple friends a long time talking about control center but they didn't talk about what's back you can actually customize a ton of option so if you go to settings and control center you can turn all those things on actually can scroll through your control center now there's some obvious things they talked about you can force touch on the platter to get more options but if you want all of the settings of control center you can out do that al it's kind of gangly and ugly and scrolling but house if you want it apples giving you a little bit of nitrous customize you take me you can get Apple specs a lot of time talking about the quicktype keyboard you can sort of swipe up to get numbers they didn't talk about was there's a lot of one handy keyboard action that's happening so if you don't have multiple languages on your keyboard just long press on the emoji and you'll see options on the left or right you can pick the keyboard with not you want to go to either side whether your left or right hand if you have multiple languages to the globe you can select those options if you type of one hands while you're walking there make things a little bit easier if you're stuck with a smaller storage size iPhone is running out of space Apple now look you offload unused apps and they're using this machine learning determine what apps you don't use the most so go into settings go into storage and go ahead and flip that switch then you can actually save a ton of space if you've got unused apps but also the side note any 32-bit apps we no longer work on iOS 11 and if you want to redownload the apps that Apple got rid of for you when you read download them all your settings are going to be there nothing's going to change just read up some space so QR scanner you can al do from the camera app which is really welcome you don't have to open a third-party app to scan a QR code you just put the camera in front of a QR code automatically do it saying add your friends and snapchat find out what things cause the grocery store whatever QR code thing you want if you don't do it correctly from the default camera this last one is kind of fun you can take live photos during a FaceTime call an hour test it had to be an iOS 11 device based having with another iOS 7 device maybe that will change as release nears but when you're faced having somebody who's on iOS 11 will be a little circle icon in the bottom left hand corner is cat that you'll take a live photo so you can I mean I'm not even gonna not even getting guess it you're going to use that for you know what you're going to use it up for take life loads your kids it's a time when you're on vacation dirty mind and if you ever snickered wanting to know how many balls of service you have the balls are gone Apple got rid of the balls bars you're back there's a ton more stuff in iOS love and I've kind of fun to go through and play and see new stuff start to appear in the betas but if you saw something in your version of iOS love and perhaps your developer and tried it leave my comments down below and let us know if you want to stuff like this video we will do that if you like these sort of beta videos the video a thumbs up to let us know we always like playing with new stuff till next time I'm John Wright enjoy some second [Music] you 
Summers over man bad news time to tell
the girl you met at the beach you're gonna stay in touch and perhaps be
together forever but you got to go back to school and you might need some new
tech to go along with you so we've got the top back-to-school tech under 100
bucks I'm not gonna tell you to go buy a $2,000 laptop to take with you to school
we're keeping things affordable for your back-to-school tech so let's start
making sure you don't lose your stuff it's the tile sport if you want to put
on these guys on your backpack if I hypothetically your new freshman year
roommate thinks it's super funny to hide your backpack in the shower now you can
find it we've talked about the tile in the past it's a Bluetooth tracker this one has
almost double the range the last version it's 2 times louder - so you can squeeze
it it'll make noise if you need to find stuff or you can have it trigger from
your phone to find wherever it's at it's a great way to keep track your things
you can pick one up for 35 bucks or a 2 pack for 60 I keep one on my wallet
because I lose that all the time so it's just great great way just to keep track
of all your stuff so smart speakers are a big deal you might want one for your dorm
room or to keep you in a room to wake you up to remind you to not sleep
through like your 2:00 p.m. class but they're also expensive Amazon has
actually allowed Alexa to be on non echo products the echo Dot is probably the
most popular out there but only is it kind of expensive it's also not very
loud and music does not sound good so enter the Eufy Genie it's between
like six and perhaps like eight times I just made those numbers up louder than
the Echo Dot but it just sounds better the sound feels it more of the room
doesn't sound tinny it's got more bass just overall better product and it's
actually cheaper than the Echo Dot you pick one up for about 35 bucks or even
less if you get it during the sale will link to it down below and with Alexa
built-in you could ask the whether you can set calendar reminders so you don't
forget to write that paper due tomorrow you can send an alarm clock to wake you
up so you don't sleep through your 2:00 p.m. class. If you decide to go with the
Eufy Genie you can also pick up the Eufy Luma Smart Bulb it's at 20 bucks the
60 watt smart bulb so you can turn on and off your lights in your dorm room or
you can just mess with your roommate put it by his bed or her bed and wake
them up with your voice no hub needed it all - it's all totally
Wi-Fi so big bonus there so I mentioned maybe your jerk roommate hide your
backpack and I've got a backpack for you from a company you might not expect this
is actually the OnePlus backpack the company that makes the phones they
legitimately make a really good bag in fact two people in our office actually use
this bag on a daily basis it's not that expensive either at 70 bucks compared to
other bags that cost two three times that you can pick one up in black or gray we we
obviously have the black one here the gray looks nice but can kind of get
dirty so if you're prone to drop in your bag and dirt you might want to go the
black color it can store up to a 15 inch laptop it's got a luggage strap so you
can attach it to a larger bag it's got a memory foam back pad so keep things safe
it's also super breathable it's gonna hold all your stuff it's not gonna hurt
your back that's the moral and you're not gonna look stupid doing it. So how about a mouse it's not the most like sexy product in the world but you're
gonna want a good one and if you decide to pick up a laptop you're gonna want
one you can carry with you I think Logitech makes some of the
best I personally use the MX master it's kind of a bigger version of this this is
the MX Anywhere 2S and it's an incredible Mouse its compact it's great
if you're on the go again just throw it in your backpack you can sync up to
three different computers to which is nice if you've got like a PC you know at a
science lab and you've got a Mac at your dorm room or whatever you want to hook
it up to another tablet you do three separate devices and make it really easy
to do you just push a button on the bottom and if you want to use that Mouse
to like play a game I recommend picking up Battlegrounds it's about thirty bucks
right now it's an alpha build and it's not even close to being optimized for 4k
displays for video cards and all kinds of other stuff don't let that detract
you from it being just a really awesome game in fact the guys at the office here
stream it on Twitch which will link our twitch channel down below almost on a
daily basis it's kind of a open world battle royale style game it's windows
and Steam only so either time to build the PC or or dust off your old rig so
affordable back-to-school tech I was like fighting the urge to be like you
need to go out and buy a Razer Blade Pro it's the best back school laptop
wanted to keep things affordable and keep stuff that is for
folks in a budget that still get really high quality things and this is stuff
that I would use in fact stuff that I do use but if we miss something if there's
like a big piece of back-to-school tech that you think we need to have him here
let us know down below and we will add it we'll talk about it and maybe I'll
add it to the comments and pin your comment to the top but something that I
think is particularly awesome but that being said I want to thank Eufy for
sponsoring the video making this whole back-to-school tech video possible
definitely check them out and it's legitimately awesome product at a
pretty badass price until next time I'm Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo 
i made a video about two weeks ago saying that was a really bad time to buy a phone wait for what's coming out of Mobile World Congress and the comments mostly agree but there's a large contingent of people who are like Jon OnePlus 3 OnePlus 3T buy it anytime we got kinda talking the office the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T have kind of like a Apple reality distortion field by like circa 2010 going on it could do no wrong I've learned that you guys love the OnePlus 3T so I went back and revisit it and I saw that trend again we're talking about the Huawei Mate 9 one of our favorite phones everybody's like OnePlus 3T so i'm back and started playing with the OnePlus 3T again and I see why you guys liked it so much there's a ton of stuff to like about the device so consider this like a revisited and today you're gonna buy the phone anyway you some updates on which changed since our review first incredible value for the dollar we also did a video while back talking about technique and save you money one thing that can save you money buying online phone if you want to buy it on my phone this is a really good way to go you're getting six gigs ram getting SnapDragon 821 you can up the storage up 226 internal getting a pretty awesome camera you're getting dual sim getting fast charge us bc getting kind of everything you would want from the flagship of the few missions least a few that are decent for me wireless charging live without it be nice to have really any sort of waterproofing would be nice here as well but that's kind of it the screen is really nice certainly some people would want to cage pants 1080 you get incredible battery life at 3,400 million power battery that's the trade-off i'm going to make for a phone like this I wasn't the biggest fan of oxygen OS when I initially did the review the one plus three and three teams gotten infinitely better running the latest version which is now based on seven point of new get you get all the Nugaty deliciousness to go and it's delicious Nougat that you get from a pix learning the device that's running the software and the knocking on the phone is that it got really warm under heavy load so watching in HD videos from God really noticeable hot one plus them to fix that it's no longer an issue that bad so it gets it gets a little bit warm but it's not gonna like burn a hole in your pocket follow through on the floor and like burned a hole in the floor down to the floor below and then just like all the way of solving generation doesn't get warm anymore the cameras also gotten much better at the speed that you can take snaps gotten much improved the way captures colors lot better the way captain blacks getting a lot better they've done a really nice job of the phone i kind of consider this may be the best analogy but kinda like a like a Tesla software updates come really frequently hear out the one plus 3t and always big improvement and listen to the consumer there are things that you want you can reach out to one plotting we got the CEO they listen and the phones keep getting better dash charging is still really fast i can get like eighty percent battery life and like 20 minutes real quick plug in and you're going to kind of make its wireless charging for me to the point of videos i get the OnePlus 3T love even though I told you now is a bad time to buy phone even though I told you that one of our favorite phones right now is am 89 you guys still love OnePlus 3T and I get it again i love the OnePlus 3 kids like the plucky upstarts smaller company try to make the name in the world get almost everything you get from black your phone at a less than flag for price you can pretty much buy two of these for the cost to buy a Galaxy S7 Edge presumably i'm guessing like two-and-a-half for what the galaxy has a costing so incredible value powerful phone the latest specs for a really affordable price so i understand it i want to i feeli always come to my own video be like Jon I'm going to buy the OnePlus 3T now's a great time to buy iphone your basic dome and the comment of the day appropriately comes from trolling videos it was on our huawei mate nine videos think one of our favorite phones he wrote one plus three users hit like fire telling you people of the one plus 3t got the car up a reality distortion field happening if you want to check him out with him down below and found the features that come into the day was pretty obvious people comment and we will feature you can get more subscribers you can know you and your mom or dad can give you some more attention could go out to use nature hug i'm filming this video on Valentine's Day happy Valentine's Day to you happy day after Valentine's Day happy three months past Valentine's Day interview watch this house the ones you love I'm Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo 
the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s plus are
joining like a Freddy vs. Jason sequel and a good video game movie and the list
of things that are never going to be happening today Apple took the wraps off
the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus the little brothers perhaps to the flagship
iPhone 10 so let me tell you a little bit about the 8 and the 8 plus first
there's kind of a newish design aesthetically the phones look the same
they still have the touch ID button the same bezels but now they're made of
glass to support wireless charging which I give Apple credit for using the Qi
standard and I've been saying for years please give me a wireless charging and
Apple now after years of asking finally delivered and again nice that it's Qi so
most of the wireless charges you may already have at home will work the
screen size is staying the same 4.7 inch and 5.5 on the 8 and 8 plus respectively the
resolutions also appear to be staying the same if you want a higher res screen
and OLED technology you want to look towards the iPhone 10 so despite the
resolution not changing Apple is bringing the TrueTone display that they
debuted with the iPad Pro to the iPhone line so the screens and the pictures at
least should look better than last gens and these screens are gonna be wrapped
in three colors either silver space grey or a new gold new gold does look really
nice also new here Apple's got stereo
speakers that are 25% louder and supposedly deeper bass and powering the
new iPhone 8 and 8 plus is the not surprising Apple's A11 Bionic chip but what's
surprising it's the first Apple designed GPU and what that's going to mean you
should get about 70% faster performance than the last gen iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus
and that is a gigantic jump in performance so I mentioned these phones
sort of look the same and the cameras looked the same on both so the iPhone 8's
got a single sensor 12 megapixel where's the iPhone 8 plus has two
sensors both of which are 12 megapixel of course 8 plus is going to support portrait
mode but the 8 plus is also gonna support something new at least in beta
called portrait lighting where you can sort of simulated different lighting
environments from your phone it can do it live you can also take a picture
and sort of add those effects afterwards Apples claiming it's way more than just
a filter they also claim it's the best video that's going to be taken in the
smartphone slo-mo's gotten way better at 1080p you can go 240 frame
per second which is double the frame rate of the last gen overall the cameras
just look better other things you'd expect here support for LTE advanced
which is a huge deal as we start moving towards that 5g progression LTE advanced
they're going to sort of be the backbone of 5G what things are gonna fall back to
you want to have a phone that supports that so hats off to Apple for supporting
that other things you'd expect like Bluetooth 5.0 are here as well so
pricing and storage sizes so sizes are a bit different this generation it's
either 64 or 256 for both phones then whether or not you go for the 8 or the 8 plus
the 8's gonna start at $699 whereas the 8 plus is going 100 bucks more at $799
and you're gonna be able to pre-order in just a few days on September 15th and
shipping on my son's birthday September 22nd and of course don't forget about
the Big Brother the iPhone 10 coming in November pre-order starting in October
you're thinking that that might be the phone you want to get we have a whole
separate video on that I will link to it here and down below if you want to check
it out so iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus they look
like nominal improvements over what we have with the last gen and it's sort of been
true with the S line of phones this would have been an S phone had Apple not
decided to jump and just go for a new number but nice things are here you got
better speakers I got a presumably better display I would have liked higher
resolution I've got wireless charging and of course
the stuff that we liked last gen like dust and water resistance but is it
enough for you to pick up an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus these are not cheap phones and
stretch the imagination is it enough to get you back to Apple there's enough for
you to upgrade your last gen phone or you gonna skip this and wait for the
iPhone 10 I love to hear your thoughts on it I'm not sure what I'm gonna do I think I
got a wandering eye for that iPhone 10 but the iPhone 8 plus does have a bit of
appeal to me I like the fact that it's got a physical touch ID button I'm not
yet sold on facial unlocking with face ID anyway leave a comment down below
give you a thumbs up we appreciate it until next time I'm Jon Rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo 
This is the Google Pixel 2 and this is the
Google Pixel 2 XL. The not surprising sequels to last year's
flagships from Google, and in my heart I wanted to love these phones. I was a big fan of the last gens, the cameras
are incredible. Throughout the course of this review I am
going to talk about weather or not you should get these phones, if I am buying these phones,
and who these phones are for. As we go through the different categories
perhaps you will find out which camp you are in. Alright so lets start where I always begin
my reviews with the screen because that's mostly what you are looking at. It's a 5-inch version and a 6-inch version
depending on which phone you want to go with. It's a 1920 x 1080 panel or it's a 6-inch
2880 x 1440 panel. Both screens look really nice this time around. I was not a fan of the screen technology on
the last-gen Pixel phones but these look really nice. They don't get that bright but when you do
go outside you notice that they will work in direct sunlight, which is quite nice to
say and also the black levels are incredible as you would expect from an OLED panel. The colors are bright and vibrant. The whites are incredibly white. On both phone I didn't have any soft of screen
bleed as you get often times if you look at an all white image or an all black image. So pretty impressed with screen technology. The big things for me, can I see it in the
sun how bright is it going to get at night and how do blacks and colors look, and everything
across the board looked really nice on both phones. While I do love the screen, the auto-brightness
calibration is super wonky. It's nothing I ever noticed on any other phone. It was changing all the time when I was just
holding the phone. If I was in a dark environment, it got too
dark. If I was in a bright environment, it didn't
brighten the screen enough. I had to turn it off. Something's got to give, so hopefully a software
update will fix it. Next lets talk about design. This is a category that's becoming increasingly
important to me. It a big way of how phones differentiate themselves
from each other. How they look and how they feel. Let's start with the Pixel 2. That is not a pretty picture from a design
standpoint, with the Pixel 2. It looks like it got left in 2015. Its got gigantic bezels, its got that big
Pixel chin and I get that there big bezels there and I also get that there are front
facing speakers now on the phone but those bezels on the smaller device look almost inexcusable
by 2017 standards and considering this phone is going to be Google's flagship until almost
the end of 2018. It is becoming even harder to understand why
they would go with that really antiquated design for the Pixel. So it's a different story on the Pixel 2 XL. It is definitely the better looking of the
brothers. It's a way better looking phone, still retaining
the front facing speakers of its smaller brother but in a way better package. In fact, the bezels are so much smaller the
phone itself, despite having a screen that's an inch bigger, is not even that much larger
than the Pixel. A couple things that I don't like about the
build, and this is on both phones, you can very clearly feel where the screen goes into
the body. There is definitely a ridge there and dust
is getting caught. I imagine they did that to make it a little
bit more durable during drops, so no glass is going to be on the outside. As you scroll your finger definitely hits
up against it and there is certainly a noticeable gap you can feel with your finger. I should at least talk a little bit about
durability cause while I was testing this phone, admittedly without a case, I dropped
it on concrete and I didn't have any cracks, scratches, or any issue at all. So perhaps that seam along the device that
I was complaining about collecting dust does protect the screen if you happen to drop it
on the corner. So both phones have a texture on the back
that is kinda nice to feel. I've been using glass phones for a while wether
it was the Samsungs or the iPhone 8 that I had been testing before this, but it does
feel nice and no it is not fingerprinty on the back of the phone so hurray there! The fingerprint sensor is where fingerprint
sensor should be, on the back, really nice and easily placed. You can locate it quickly with your finger. It is also going to respond incredibly fast. So I think the big questions that I had as
I was using the Pixel 2, is this stock Android anymore? It used to be the Nexus phones and the Pixels
were stock Android but as things are only coming to the Pixel-the launcher unique to
the Pixel, always on display unique to the Pixel, things like that make you wonder if
this even stock Android anymore or is this one of the skins or the UI that is put on
top of Android for the Pixel line. I am not sure what stock Android is anymore,
maybe this is it but still unique to one or two phones. What do you guys think I am not entirely sure. It used to be one of the benefits of using
a Pixel phone was you got a native Google experience, now you're getting a native Google
experience that's tweaked and customized for the Pixel 2, but those tweaks are really nice. I like the always on display. It's almost identical to what we saw with
Samsung and LG. It doesn't mean it doesn't work, and it works
really well, handy to see information at a glance. I liked having that. As you go ahead and turn the phone on and
start swiping through it you will notice the launcher is different. So Google moved the search bar to the bottom. I get why they did that, it's easier to reach
with your thumb. On top of that is your dock, on top of that
is things you can customize, and then on top of that you've got the new At a Glance where
you can set things like weather traffic or calendar. So what that's going to mean in real world
usage is about 20% of your screen, you cannot customize because you've got a gigantic Google
Search and then your dock on top of that. Obviously this can be fixed by putting on
a third party launcher. I am a big fan of Nova, but for the first
time in a while, I do not like the launcher that comes with Nexus or Pixel devices. It takes up way too much precious screen real
estate. It's weird for me having that gigantic Google
Search bar at the bottom, especially when I can launch the assistant and subsequent
search in a myriad of different ways by squeezing the phone or long pressing the home button. So that's personal preference thing, but for
me, the new UI tweaks, specially on the launcher are a no go. Other things that are new here, its got something
called now playing. You have to turn it on, it's not on by default,
but when you do it'll show you on the lock screen what song is playing. I found it to be inconsistent. Sometimes things worked, sometimes it didn't,
but I imagine that'll get better with software updates but out of the box, it was kind of
squirrely. Another things that's new to Android 8.0 is
notification dots. I initially thought that was just a fancy
way of showing notifications. I've got 4 unread messages! But it is a really cool way to get information
in context with the app. It gives you more information a badge count. I liked having it, some of you may not, but
I appreciated what it did. So camera is what's been the big deal with
the Pixel line of phones. Google said when the first Pixel came it has
the best camera ever, and they said it again when the Pixel 2s came out-Best Camera Ever! I can't say it's the best camera ever since
pretty much every flagship camera looks good, but man these pictures do look beautiful when
they come out. There's a portrait mode built into here. It'll blur the background and keep the stuff
in the foreground in focus. It also works on the front facing camera. I found when it works, it works really well
but there are times when it doesn't and things look all kinds of strange but presumably that
will get better because of machine learning but at least out of the box, it works like
85%-90% of the time. It does look really good. Speaking of looking really good, the pictures
coming out of this thing look incredible. If you are outdoors in ordinary sunlight the
photos look gorgeous. You're not getting the over saturated look
like you get with a Samsung. You're getting really true to image colors. Things look absolutely beautiful here. Low light is another area where the camera
shines. If you don't have that much light, if you're
taking pictures of your kids like I do when the sun is down, it is really nice here. So I don't have a shaky hand but often times
I am running raking video. This has not only optical stabilization, but
optical stabilization and digital both at the same time. Things look really stable. If you have a shaky hand or trying to film
while you're running, skating, or doing something else weird with your video camera, it's going
to look pretty stable. So battery is one of the few areas where these
phones differ. You've got a 2700 mAh in the Pixel 2 and a
3520 mAh in the Pixel 2 XL. As you would expect from pretty decent sized
batteries, battery life is going to be pretty good on both. I am very easily able to get through a full
day on both devices with almost 50% battery life left, and that's with pretty extensive
usage. A lot of YouTube browsing which you can do
in full screen this time, a lot of social media, a lot of email, and just looking at
the screen quite a bit. I found having the always on display actually
saved my battery a lot because I am not turning on the screen a lot checking notifications. That's probably why I am up in the 50s opposed
to being in the 40s, where I usually am, on other device. No issues with battery life at all. Intangibles are usually where I make my decision
on phones. What does this give me that another phone
doesn't and these Pixels give you a lot of stuff. You get smart storage, unlimited photo storage
with Google Photos, you get guaranteed software updates. They are priced pretty well and pretty competitively
compared to the competition, but there is a lot of negatives here as well. You're not getting expandable storage. You're not getting a headphone jack, which
is mind boggling-especially on the XL considering it is based on the XL which has a headphone
jack. You're not getting wireless charging, but
of corse a really solid quick charging feature. You're getting IP67 instead of IP68 like most
flagships have. I am guessing one of those things is going
to annoy a lot of buyers and if you don't care about any of that stuff you're going
to get a really good phone but if you look at the competition-especially similarly priced
competition-the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL don't really separate themselves that much. So I said in the beginning I would answer
if I was going to buy these phones and I think I would probably sit this generation out of
the Pixel line. The sacrifices of expandable storage, wireless
charging and the rest that I mentioned I can get with other similarly priced flagships. So the Pixel line, is it for you, are you
going to pick one up? Are you disappointed? I want to know why you're picking one up and
why you are not. Leave it in the comments down below. We will pin a few comments to the top and
we will change them up so if you guys have a good reason let us know. Give the give thumbs up, we always appreciate
it. Until next time, I am Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo. 
so usually when we do our verses videos it's to flagships from different companies will bash them screen to screen into clear winner but sometimes certain manufacturer from Korea whose name rhymes with Pham Fung releases two flagship phones a few months apart mudding the water is about which phone to actually get thus is the case with the galaxy s 8 plus and the Galaxy Note 8 is a difference more than just a pen I'm gonna try and answer that question for you guys help you decide which phone you should get should you upgrade if you already have a Galaxy S 8 plus or and why would you want to pick up a Galaxy Note 8 so looking at these phones they share a lot in common just looking straight down they look almost identical they've got the same Samsung design language with the infinity display the same pressure-sensitive home button slightly different software experiences but Samsung used to call TouchWiz it's now Samsung user experience but for the most part these phones appear to be the same but there's a lot more inside of these phones that make them different let's start with the screen so the screen on the Galaxy s8 me-sa plus it looks pretty ball or a screen is gorgeous it's Super AMOLED technology it's a qHD screen but and this is something I didn't realize until I tried the note 8 it doesn't get that bright until you compare it with the latest from Samsung so the Galaxy Note 8 actually gets 22% brighter than the galaxy s A+ in case you want to get technical it's 1200 nits versus a thousand it's just by random comparison if you want to know I phone 7 at 625 minutes so that 22% makes a gigantic difference when you are outdoors if you have adaptive brightness on take out your phone in direct sunlight in the middle of the day you can see it much better on the note 8 then you can't on the galaxy s 8 plus and this is sort of a thing of you don't know it until you see it or you don't know which don't know it's always thought the SI plus screen looked awesome and I looked at the note a screen I was like damn that looks so much better so if you thought things look a little washed out on the galaxy s 8 over use your phone outdoors a lot that is a big-ass reason to consider the Galaxy Note 8 so yet again another case of I didn't realize it could be much better until you see something that's much better the cameras on both phones I use a Galaxy s8 in the si+ for months and I loved the camera in those phones and I still love the cameras they're still really good there's some of the best on the market then I started using the camera on the note 8 the pictures that come out of the Galaxy Note 8 look in sane perhaps it's because both sensors have optical image stabilization built-in perhaps it's psychosomatic but the pictures look really good the Galaxy Note 8 also adds a very Apple esque portrait mode where you can blur the background of an image if you even do it after you already took the picture if you go to the Samsung gallery app and open up that photo you can adjust how much background blur you want it works really well what kind of minimal artifacting around the actual focal point of your image and also it's gonna snap too so for pictures you've got your wide-angle shot and your normal shots in case you want to see what was in the periphery of an image you can do that on the node 8 you can't do that on the si+ battery at least on paper I think would be a big reason to give a nod to the galaxy s 8 plus with sheer numbers 3500 versus 3300 in the Galaxy Note 8 and it was very clear that Samsung was let's say good shy from recalls of the note 7 to say went with a smaller battery but super software tends to matter this is running the Samsung software experience 8.5 versus 8.0 on the Galaxy S a plus at least as of this filming and due to optimizations with software I'm still getting almost this thing about 11 hours of battery life that I got on the SI plus now that's on time so when I plug my phone at the end of the day with almost exactly the same amount of usage generally around 20 to 25% and that was true with both phones so despite having a smaller battery I still got same amount of usage on it so it's kind of a tie there and I guess that tie is kind of a win for the note and it's got smaller milliamp hours performance at least pursued performance is another reason to consider the Galaxy Note 8 it's rocking six gigs of ram versus four on the si+ and before you yell at me the comments I know there are versions that have 62 RAM but then one most people have is 4 so 50% Ram made the phone seem faster to me it might have been again psychosomatic I ran benchmarks and all that Geekbench scores and yes it does come across as faster but we will usages what we're talking about here and it does seem pretty good I think where that's going to matter the extra RAM is future proofing so all these things we're talking about batteries screen for four months I've even talked about the s-pen yet and that's why a lot of people at least consider wanting to get the Galaxy Note II that's sort of the big flagship feature about it yes it's here no you can't put it in backwards and it's also IP 68 and it's actually one of the least reasons for me to pick up the note I really like having it it's nice but I don't use it all that often I find myself kind of making up reasons to use it if you're the kind of first untrim stylist and a screen then yeah you already know you want the note but for me there's more icing on a cake instead of the actual cake itself so I mentioned the beginning of the video these phones look identical but they don't feel identical the note is 12% heavier than the Galaxy S 8 plus and that matters the phone is overall thicker it's wider doesn't have that same sort of beautiful design and feel at least that you get with a Galaxy S Bessie plus they seem to hold the phone in your hand just looking at them screen down they do look very similar so if you thought maybe the s8 plus was a little big for your hand and definitely try the note 8 in store first for your side to pick one up on the s8 plus side I think this is the best feeling and best looking phone on the market I think it's incredible a Samsung blended the infinity display the thinness of the device it feels incredible in the hand this still remains the best feeling device that I have ever used so last but definitely not least it's price so there are a ton of sales and Samsung runs trade-in deals and best buys got kills and carriers have deals but generally speaking they're about 300 bucks separating these two phones I don't know if you're getting $300 more worth of value if any that features I mentioned are must-haves for you or sort of all those different parts make a whole that's worth spending about 950 bucks then you're going to love the Galaxy Note 8 figure to get the best camera the best software that Samsung has to offer if you decide that 300 bucks is not worth it for you you are still getting an incredible phone a phone that adds up like a month ago would have been the best phone on the market but it is still a really good phone and will still be a really good phone for the next year or longer so here's what the morale boils down - if you have a galaxy si - si plus look longingly at the node eight be jelly of your friends that maybe bought one but it is not worth paying the money for the upgrade you're coming from a previous gen note that hasn't been recalled so a note five a note 4 or an older a galaxy s device so an s7 s7 edge or older but all means get the note eight you're going to love it notice the differences in improvements immediately so before I end the verses I want to thank the awesome folks at Mac Weldon for making this video possible Ralf and Mark who are off camera tell me where too many ram's gears and then I need more casual clothes so actually I legitimately use the stuff at Macworld and I'm wearing Mac Walden's shirt right now it looks nice it's comfortable it's also probably most importantly antimicrobial so if you go to the gym or you're just sweaty dude like me it's not gonna grow so when you leave it in like a hot car it's not gonna smell when you get back to it it's comfortable it's kind of stretchy they've got shirts under shirts hoodies socks underwear anything you need their websites super easy to use and stuff comes really quickly and it's high-quality I think most importantly they give me 20% off if you decide to pick something up and I recommend it I'm a big fan of their their navy blue obviously looks nice against our white seamless use coupon code TechnoBuffalo I'll give you 20% off hope you guys check them out so what do you guys think s 8 plus or Galaxy Note 8 which one did you buy and why I think it's a big question is are you going to upgrade from the si plus to the note 8 are you going to heed my warning if you don't throw caution in a thousand bucks to the winds and say give me my stylus I want to know why I leave in the comments down below and if we like your answer well pin it to the top and then everybody can see you you can become famous and your mommy proud of you until next time John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo you guys see I do this a lot I guess I do phone 
I've talked a lot about the Google Pixel
over the year I love the phone I think the software is incredible the hardware
is awesome but like if we can be honest with each other the design of the phone
itself I don't think aged all that well that big
old Jay Leno chin at the bottom without any buttons there just doesn't look like
a modern smartphone despite it performing and still being one of the
best smartphones out it looks like though the Pixel 2 is going to get a bit
of a makeover I want to talk about that on this episode of TB News so first a
code name because makes it sound more like a like a James Bond movie than a
phone Taimen, some something like that so if you've also
been watching some the reviews on HTC U11 the other flagship feature there is
squeezable I'm squeezing my side squeezable sides that make it do certain
actions the squeezable sides are going to be parts of Pixel 2 probably one of
the flagship features you probably saying to yourself so I guess HTC is also making this new Pixel and the answer is no LG will
allegedly be making the phone but they're just kind of aping that that's
squeezable thing and the squeezy squeezeness will be integrated allegedly again
with Google assistant so you can squeeze it pull her up and ask your questions
and have her make appointments or after what your favorite restaurant is or find a
Gif, Jif don't yell at me for you and addressing
like I said the biggest I think negative on the Pixel is the design it's
going to be LG G6 inspired still have a 2:1 aspect ratio rounded corners
edge to edge AMOLED panel so you should get that I just calling it a infinity display I know that's a samsung term but like there's very little bezels and it should
come in at about a six inch screen so not a tiny phone so being made by LG
it'll have the LG fingerprint sensor located in the back it should also get
an always-on display which is probably my favorite feature of something like the G6
what we've got with the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus it should be coming later this
year and we're already middle of July so not that many months left we should see
Android O hit in a few months well so I would guess probably like August
Septemberish around the same timeframe we see the Note come we should see the
Pixel 2  we don't know colors I'm hoping for a pretty baller blue to make its way
down we've seen some color options red and black so that kind
of stuff it looks like a better looking phone so we know some stuff don't know
some stuff we do know is I am damn excited for the Pixel 2 you guys
yelling for talking with my hands all the time but I'm excited and that's just me
and how I talk so Pixel 2 would you buy one for me it's gonna depend on price
that sort of larger phone it's going to compete squarely against the S8 Plus even
the LG's own G6 the Note 8 there's a ton of competition the new iPhone coming out
it's harder and harder to differentiate yourselves as a smartphone manufacturer but
the Pixel looks to be a pretty solid phone but is it the phone for you does
it need one feature to get you to buy it leave a comments down below and let me
know before I jump out this isn't an ad rating just kind of a company that I'm
working with I want to tell you a little bit about a new hardware and software
thing coming out called Babylon I'm associated with a company it's idea that
I've loved the passion about for a really long time it's coming to fruition
so it's on IndieGoGo link to it down below potentially what they're trying to
do is take your voice in your voice profile so everything about that so your
throat pattern so essentially your cheek flaps - how your lips move they're
taking all of that out into a voice profile of synthesizing it digitally and
taking that same profile and adding it different languages you can hear
yourself speak Chinese you could speak Spanish in your actual voice technology
could also be used to take an actor's voice and they do dubbing for movies in other
languages you can still have that actual actors voice that can make digital
assistants like Siri and Google Now sound more realistic it's awesome
it's cutting edge and it really is a future so check them out down below so
next time I'm Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo hope you guys enjoyed this episode of TB News 
so I'm gonna what day you watch this video maybe it's like a Tuesday or like it's Saturday afternoon whatever day it is it's a good day to win the latest phone from Apple you teamed up the folks from Kingston to let you win a 64 gig iPhone 10 or if you want an iPhone 8 or and I have Phone 8 plus but the 10 looks to be where it's at any new Apple iPhone under a thousand bucks you can win here the dates right right here the giveaways going to be happy we made it super simple if you want to enter open to anyone on this planet so as long as you live presumably on earth you are going to be good to go hit the link down below good article on TechnoBuffalo comm you you're entering over there I never thinking to yourself sounds like a pretty good deal John thank you but 64 gigs is not enough for my gigantic photo library folk to Kingston have you covered with the bolts available in 32 64 128 you also have got the 128 one here and I'm gonna throw one of these in for the winner so you can also win a 128 gigabyte bolt but this is gonna do let you back up your photo and pictures like stupid simply so plug it in you'll download an app and the app they made it just do one thing only it backs up your photos and videos you could take pictures directly onto the bolt or video directly onto the bulbs you can choose different photos or folders that you want to backup directly onto the bolts to keep and use the bolts with other iOS devices like wife's iPhone or your iPad plug it in you are good to go it's really thin too so the iPhone is going to sit flat send me the camera humph doesn't make a wobble but the bolt is not going to make it wobble my iPhoto library right now since it around 17 gigs it's a huge chunk of my iPhone storage so the bolt makes it really easy I think cloud storage has a place but if you are on an airplane don't have internet connection or you somewhere where and that's not working you're not working fast enough you lose access to that stuff you gotta throw something like this really small in your bag your pocket this makes it really easy it's also a great way to stave off maybe you have an upgrade this year you got your eye on the iPhone for next year now thing you don't have to upgrade your phones running out of storage space pick up a bolt throw all your photos on it you are good to go again when any iPhone you want under a thousand bucks but probably you should pick the 64 gig iPhone 10 that's that's when I would pick we'll send you the unlocked version so doesn't matter where you live I'll have all the radios in it linked down below to go your article on checking out Buffalo comm to enter then get a Kingston and legitimately badass bolts so next time John render TechnoBuffalo good luck [Music] [Music] you 
I'm using the Galaxy at 8 in the galaxy s 8 plus for the better part of like two and a half three days not enough time to do a full review which is coming and if it's out when you watch this video I'll link to it up here but the more research I do on the phone somewhere I realize there's a ton of incredible technology that goes way beyond the iOS or Android debate just as a piece of tech there's a lot of firsts or almost first at Samsung's credence to a really thin package so do you buy a smartphone you want something that's going to last you 1224 months be future proofing usually with that you think of RAM you think of processor screen and that kind of stuff what you might not think about the data speeds that's not just reliant on the amount of bars you have or the amount of bulbs you got pending on what OS you're using got a lot of balls the Galaxy s8 I'm just going to say Galaxy sa for the Sigma talking about f8 si+ are amongst the first phones in the world the PAX 2 really unique and very different LLC technologies are going to net you just faster data speeds at least eventually the first one is LTE you then for LTE on license essentially what cares you'll be able to do is use the five gigahertz sort of spectrum is reserved for Wi-Fi to put small cells in crowded areas to give you better network in really busy areas so that's awesome first one that supported that at least as of right now two Mobile's the first network that turn some of those things on and perhaps more paradigm-shifting is actually going to be shipping with gigabit LTE capabilities and actually the s7 s7 edge or the first phones that shipped with the four antennas necessary might have heard like four bytes learn MIMO before they weren't turned on it launched these are on an active at log at least at t-mobile so I'm going to try and not get that and nerdy but I've been doing a lot of research on this I spoke to folks at Qualcomm learn more about technology it's pretty awesome so gigabit LTE you're going to theoretically get a thousand gigabits per second really fast speeds they're not really going to get that theoretical number you probably get around 200 to 300 if the tower is active but where I think this is a really cool essentially going to be the backbone of what 5g is going to be it's going to be simultaneously connected to 5g can get you Penelope so most of what you'll get when 5g is out is actually going to be the gigabit LTE that your phone the Galaxy s8 already has and Bluetooth 5.0 is on this phone and that might be a big paradigm shift for you guys as well and it was definitely kind of I think it's going to be a big one for me so first you get to simultaneous streams so you and a buddy can vocab listening to music bluetooth headphones control it separately which is pretty awesome but I get four times the range a Bluetooth 4.2 so if you leave your phone and you walk far away you'll be fine you're also going to get twice the data transfer speeds as well as 4.2 so do a lot of data transfer via bluetooth and pictures you're going to really appreciate what they daleks pf8 has done the screen on the Galaxy s8 Samsung has always had pretty awesome screens but the s8 is unique for a few reasons first it goes to a thousand nits which is a lot of nits what that's going to mean for real-world usage is in direct sunlight it's going to look really bright you can actually see it when you're outside and that I've tested and it does look really good when the sun's hitting directly on it also mobile HDR so if you extreme lot of Netflix shows or anything else at the ports mobile HCR it looks really incredible on the display keeping up with the nerd theme of this video let's talk nanometer process size whether you get the Exynos 88-90 5 with a Snapdragon 835 versions of the Galaxy s8 those things are tiny 10 nanometers so they are 4 nanometers smaller than was already the smallest chip that out there that's going to means you get better performance presumably better battery life in a smaller package which means a phone can be this thin and still give really awesome performance which I'm still testing so I'll attribute that to just spec sheet and a real-world usage actually vented review I'll let you guys know there's a lot of really cool things about the galaxy I hope you can look at it not depending on what OS you prefer whether it's Android or iOS that's a piece of technology as a piece of tech that's pushing the envelope forwards sampling did a lot of really cool things here and did a lot of things right a lot of things that make me excited about the galaxy Fe and really Tech in general so what do you guys think what are you excited about any of these things you're like hell yeah one gigabit LG or what the hell is LTE you i've never heard about it the comments down below and let us know and course the video a thumbs up it really helps so next time Jon Ranger from techno box 
it's Apple rent time before you smash the like or even a dislike button hear me out so I'm back for dub WGC a chance to see apple's new products that start to unfold to the next year and I started thinking more about Apple and so as you guys don't know Apple kind of got me started in tech review the first sort of products I reviewed we've always kind of had a soft spot in my heart that some really filtered through as you guys like to call me out all the time to my reviews but I think apples got a problem and I don't think the problem is actually Apple I think the problem is a competition the competition's gotten so much better than it was in the past and look at Apple's product line there hasn't been an innovative brand new category since the iPad you could argue the Apple watch has come out but hasn't changed it was good a paradigm shift since we saw the original iPad and back then there was a huge discrepancy between the efficiency of iOS and with Android at the time and I think we started to get throughout 2011 we saw the Galaxy Nexus we saw Ice Cream Sandwich that was the iPhone 4s was coincidentally the last phone that Steve Jobs was alive for he had his hand possibly leasing the iPhone 5 from the 5s but that was when things starts to get closer and closer for Apple and apples being held I think two unattainable double standard they're not reinventing a new category every few years they're failing they're failing they're not doing something great like they used to I don't think that's fair and I'm guilty of that too I've certainly said apples not innovating there's nothing new coming out they've perfected their categories they've perfected a tablet they perfected a phone whether you like the iPhone or not for a lot of people that is the perfect device but the problem they're facing is a perception problem if the competition again has gotten so much better and again I think it went back that 2011 starting point and you look back at what Samsung started doing strangely was five years ago oh and Galaxy S 2 launched when I started parroting the Apple 1 you know the next big thing and that hit Apple word heard I think that hid the perception that if the image that Apple was impenetrable gigantic innovation machine and slowly but surely the little pieces started to get chipped away and what you have right now it's a company that is clearly firing off the own there they're selling millions of millions of phones the largest manufacturer for a ton of different categories but they're still being held set double standard and again I'm guilty of that as well but now the competition that's really look at things with the Galaxy Tab A 3 look at the Galaxy at 8 and LG G 6 you take from a feature standpoint the gas that used to be there can android/ios is no longer there and a concerning argument could be made and your has surpassed Apple on the future standpoint the easy argument to make here is that Steve Jobs is rolling over in his grave but in cooks job is not to make you happy or me happy can you cook responsibilities to the shareholders an Apple stock is at an all-time high so in a lot of ways can cook is doing an incredible job people are buying products they're offering new wages apples ecosystem and the more they sell the more money they make the perception isn't changing with it used to be Apple was incredible they were untouchable like I said but now it's yeah I'm not that excited about the next iPhone and for me to say that something I think said in years you know I feel like for the past almost three or four years and make this analogy the office all the time I feel like I'm some one crazy guy outside as an umbrella screaming it's going to rain and on the day it rains I'm gonna seem brilliant but the other threat is 64 days of the year they are crazy first and every time there's new iPhone I feel like I'm out there saying this is the year we're going to get wireless charging it's gonna be fast charging didn't get feature parity with Android and it just hasn't happened and at least for me I don't look at Apple the same way that I use you I don't look at Apple the same way as this paradigm of innovation not to say they're not but that perception has changed for me personally and I feel like it's changing for partly you guys as well and that's a the product aren't good not to say the phone you have in your pocket is a crappy device you made a wrong choice if it works for you it's a perfect choice but the competition that Apple is facing and they say back in 2007 versus what they face now it's different the iPhone first launched for example was sort of when the modern Apple started you know they're not facing the likes of the Moto Cube they're not facing blackberry anymore it's an Android onslaught and because of so many manufacturers they're fighting battles on multiple front and not fighting just Apple versus those rims the time it's now Apple and it's LG Samsung it's the Chinese brand there's on slots from every direction Annapolis was done an incredible job still selling these devices and still making profit hand over foot but the problem with competition and the competition has just gotten better over time so do you think the better than Apple is kind of up to you but serve had just I don't there's an epiphany a bit of thought and my whole time of the thickness is that the problem was Apple was Apple doing wrong and I realized I was holding on to double standard - you can't reinvent a new category it's not there every few years we're just going to sort of force something that does need to be there and you get criticized for it so those are my ramblings that was my thought on Apple you guys you guys agree am i way off here and the more I thought about it the more I thought that they don't have to invent new product categories to keep doing what they're doing selling millions of devices honestly why do they have to change Tim Cook is selling devices stock prices as an all-time high investors are happy and that is first and foremost responsibility so green disagree I generally want to know try to be civil in the comments up there your thoughts on it so next time I'm John Rhett injure and techno both you [Music] [Music] 
where the process of revamping our set so for right now you just you just get blue this is kind of another public service announcement we did another one a few weeks back when I told you now is a really bad time to buy a phone this is a product that i reviewed a while back in light my experience with it has totally changed do not buy Google Wi-Fi let me let me tell you why so my house is not that big for 1,800 square feet it's the few bedrooms i picked up google Wi-Fi want to have a mesh network to essentially extend my Wi-Fi network throughout my whole house so really hard time getting reception with my pretty awesome NETGEAR Nighthawk up my bedroom and I couldn't move the router bit of background I've got 18 cheese giggles blasts internet my helmet so I should theoretically be getting a thousand up and a thousand never signed close to that when I'm standing next to the NIGHTHAWK generally i got about seven hundred up or down on Wi-Fi not be plugged in directly i'll get that full thousand speed crazy fast so i set up Google Wi-Fi at my house our testing at the office and i'm super excited and my speed drop instantly to about 300 up and 200 so i reset everything did it again speed consistent is kind of delicate because those speeds are still pretty fast I get that this feeder are still really quick but they're not what I'm paying for so Google life is 100 number on the back called it their service was great into the phone right away try to walk them through what's going on they had no idea heavy rain diagnostics and diagnostics back to Google and came back with the big lake we don't know what's going on so I'm paying for fast speeds but i'm not getting fast speed and beyond that the mesh capabilities of google Wi-Fi put up in that good i'm still barely getting more service and i had with just a single night hawk router before so I was bumped and I figured I want to be the voice of consumer i want to tell you guys my experiences i get a lot of questions when you get about products to buy and i recommend a lot of products but i feel like i should probably not recommend some as well when i get when it does not work from I'm gonna be testing a few other options I'm gonna test amplify I'm gonna test 0 i'm going to test or be as well to find one that works you guys looking for a mesh network hopefully you'll find one at those that should work for you if you used one you've got an option comment down below and let me know which one you guys use country looking for something good i'm moving in about two months and I want to be is going to cover my whole home I really hard work is going to function properly and I want to get at least close to the full of theoretical speeds thank you guys for watching want a quick second to give you the comment of the day become today comes from our text save you money video and it comes from double-a IV who asks you could have gone slightly in more depth of each product that is why LED bulbs are the best option so if you want to follow him link to it down below into your question I say it was more about a teacher salad video here's some general tech that can save you money for no more details about it we can definitely do that in upcoming videos and if you want to be featured in an upcoming comes the day is pretty obvious just leave a comment down below bit of a different kind of going down the past more of a TV news style PSA don't like Google life I just see yourself the money wait till software updates comment maybe gets improved but for right now I cannot recommend Google life 
so LG's V series of phone used to be like their playground they would try new stuff dual screens Dax and see how things worked and eventually that would make its way into the flagship line the G line of phones they're scrapping that whole method now and the V 30 clearly sits atop of their portfolio and this is kind of what the G 6 should have been we're still testing the be 30 before we do a full review but I've already found a lot of stuff to really like about this phone so as you guys decide what phone you want to buy or think about buying here are five reasons of e 30 doesn't suck so I was gonna go in reverse order and start with five and worked my way up but I'm just gonna jump right into number one the screen holy crap that OLED screen looks insane I didn't think that I was gonna find a display that looks better than Samsung Super AMOLED panels on the no date the SAT si plus but damn LG did it this looks better than the Samsung display OLED looks insane on a phone LG's makes awesome OLED TVs but seeing it on a smaller phone form factor a six inch screen it looks so good so the black levels obviously look awesome you expect that with OLED what surprised me was actually the visibility in direct sunlight that's not where old legends I can still see this in direct sunlight your screen gets crazy bright if you're in a dark room and turn the brightness all the way up it's like burn your retinas bright you like the Eclipse glasses to look at it so that has been really surprising colors also obviously look really bright and vibrant but you can see a difference with OLED maybe it's psychosomatic I don't know actually excited to see an OLED phone but hotdamn is a screen look insane good job LG number two so a lot of people were annoyed with the g6 in the US we got wireless charging other mah career markets you got a quad DAC you didn't get both LG righted that ship here you now have quad DAC and you've got wireless charging with the V 30 so if you plug in compatible headphones gonna take advantage of the full audio fidelity wall wireless charging which is really nice to have number 3 battery life I don't know Ola is using less power LG software's just gotten better by the 3309 power batteries pretty good so by comparison on my s8 when I plug in my phone into the night genuinely I meant like twenty to twenty five sometimes thirty percent at the v3 and the same usage I met thirty to thirty five percent so I'm getting pretty good battery life here it's something I'm really happy to see with LG I wasn't the biggest fan of battery life on the g6 so it looks like the trend continues they fix the machine with the g6 the V thirty can last you easily all day so I don't mean for this via the turns like a g6 bashing but number four is speed the GC kind of Snapdragon 820 one for a lot of things didn't matter but where it did matter was using LG's multi window and trying to do two things the phones tend to slow down oftentimes stutter especially well one of those windows with streaming video 8:35 on the v 30 same four gigabytes of RAM and the same issues I had with the g6 are gone with the V 30 same four gigabytes of RAM are here but the Snapdragon 835 make things way quicker than I had with the g6 no slowdown no stutter for doing exact the same test that had at the g6 so speed pretty good and number five intangibles so I just finished playing with the essential phone and that phone is really solid and sewn right but it's missing some stuff LG checks almost all the flagship boxes that you'd expect so you've got quad DAC you've got wireless charging you've got expandable storage you've got fast charging and you've got USB C you also have IP 68 water resistance things you're missing removable battery and an IR blaster if that's important to you bear in mind but it does check almost all the boxes for flagship phone that's nice to see and all that stuff plus a headphone jack makes a V 30 at least appear to be really solid choice looking to get a new phone over the next few months if screen is important to you you gotta take a look at the OLED screen maybe it's not gonna sell you on the phone itself but damn does it look really good the screen is super important to me and LG hit this one out of park so the V 30 it's pretty solid phone we're still doing our test though anything you guys want to see us check out in the full review leave it down below and let us know mashup thumbs up button really appreciate it or if you didn't like the video there's button for that so next time I'm John Ranger you [Music] 
this is the Note 8 I think it's
impossible to talk about and review the Note 8 without looking back a little
bit talk about the note 7 we know what happens to battery ant their recalls
Would have been easy for Samsung here I think to play a totally safe and release a
phone with minimal upgrades to make sure there weren't any issues and a lot of
ways they did that but there's still a lot of innovation in the note 8 that
I found in my about four and a half days of testing with it so the story with the
note has always been the s-pen and the screen and that sort of sits above at
the very top of Samsung's hierarchy of phones above the galaxy s line and the
screen here is gorgeous albeit gigantic it's 6.3 inches and this thing is
absolutely beautiful as you'd expect from Samsung Super AMOLED technology in
fact I would have said this is the most beautiful screen I'd ever seen until I
saw the OLED panel on the V30 so this takes the cake as the second-best screen
that I've seen and the reason I'm saying second best over what the S8 or the S8
plus has this thing is actually 22% brighter than the s8 screen which is a
huge amount and it makes a difference when you're in direct sunlight if you
turn the brightness all the way up while you're in a darker room you're going to
burn your eyeballs out the screen here gets incredibly bright which is really
nice to see so a 6.3-inch phone this is the same size as Samsung's
like old-school Galaxy mega it's only 0.1 inches bigger than the Galaxy S8+ but that point one inches makes a difference this phone is not the most
ergonomic feeling it looks like an S8 plus kind of with the infinity display
but the design isn't as aesthetically pleasing as it is on those phones it
feels a little boxier doesn't feel as thin as those devices so it's bit tough
ergonomically and especially makes it tough with a fingerprint reader which is
still in the same spot that it was on the s8 and the S8+ next to the
camera and there are two camera sensors we'll talk a lot about those but on a
bigger device it's even harder to find in fact the buttons almost flush they
can get doubly hard to find and if you are left-handed don't even bother trying
to use a fingerprint reader the other stuff from the s8 line of phones are
still here you still have the iris scanning face unlock and of course you
can use a pin or a swipe password it's a lot of ways
to unlock your device rounding out the screen it's bright it's beautiful
it's probably one of the best displays on the market as you'd expect from
Samsung's the aspect ratio is the same eighteen
and a half by nine but you get used to HDR plus if you can watch HDR content on
Netflix if you're streaming it if you're carrier is not gonna downgrade the
quality looks incredible here on the device so screen aside the biggest
reason I think people get the note is the s-pen it's here you can't put it in
backwards it's got a IP68 just like the phone does and it works really well and
Samsung's updated what it can do via software so it lives in the bottom right
hand corner you pop it out you can start writing right on the screen like you
could with the note 7 except now you've got multiple pages so you can just sort
of keep writing page down keep writing and page down and it works really well
I've had very minimal latency it's a great palm rejection it's an awesome way
to sort of take notes to jot notes down does a lot more than that it'll do live
translation now I'll do it by sentences whether or not you like the S pen is
gonna depend on how much you're gonna use it I use it mostly to draw pictures
of trains with my son it's nice for editing screenshots and stuff it's not
necessary for me I know a lot of you folks really want to have it and if
you're debating whether or not you want to get this or the s8+ having the option
to always have the s-pen it's certainly a nice benefit so performance used to be
a category I talked a lot about when it comes to flagships nowadays they're all
plenty fast there an extra two gigabytes of RAM in here versus the S8
and the S8+ so there's six gigs as opposed to four and things are fast
whether you're multitasking using multi window playing games editing
pictures whatever the phone's gonna be fast with no slowdown whatsoever
64 gigs of internal storage but of course you can use the micro SD card I'm
putting as much storage as you can find that's available I believe it will support
up to 2 terabytes which I don't think even exist yet other thing is that no
dates can be aware of that maybe you didn't know it's got support for gigabit
LTE which is going to be the fallback for when 5g hits so t-mobile Verizon
AT&amp;T and Sprint have all started rolling out gigabit LTE
or going through the near future and when you get access to it it will be
really fast if you're on your phone it's gonna be a little more future-proof note
8 even the S8 and S8+ support the technology as well on the
software front it's pretty familiar from the s8 and s8 plus it's version
8.5 of Samsung's user experience which is what they used to call TouchWiz there
are few notable additions so first in the edge panel you've got something
called app pairing so Samsung uses multi window so you can have one app on top
one app on bottom but now you can actually put both of those apps into a
single icon on the edge panel so for me if I'm watching video and using email I
can set that up so when I hit a button it'll automatically launch it the way I
want a lot of apps you can do that with it just makes it a lot easier so now I'm
sort of dragged apps around and I think that means that people knew what the
window was there but rarely use it so Samsung's trying to put that in front of
you and make it way easier to do so I started using the Galaxy Note 8 from a
galaxy s 8 so things here we're very familiar the Samsung user experience
they used to call it TouchWiz is 8.5 it's a newer version and things look
really good here I've become a huge fan of Samsung software I know a lot of
folks give Samsung a lot of grief and I used to as well but starting with the s7
things got really good here and actually prefer Samsung's take on Android almost
over anything else there used to be the rule that Samsung phones slowed down
over time and that was true I think from the galaxy s5 and older generations of
phones but haven't tried the same thing device since then that's no longer the
case I use my Galaxy s8 for about five months
no issues I had an s7 before that no slowdown at all if you have that me
preconceived notion not an issue here with the note 8 so one of the other big
upgrades from the Galaxy s8 and s8+ is the camera so now you have two sensors
here it's got a wide-angle and a telephoto it's really nice you can do
two times optical zoom ten times digital you just hit a button we've seen that UI
before where I think Samsung hit a homerun though is with the live focus so
if you don't know what that means you can create kind of a blurred effect
behind a subject and does it all with software now we've seen that before
we've had at portrait mode on iOS the oneplus 5 has it built in Samsung did a
couple cool things so first if you use the Samsung gallery app you can edit it
after the fact it looks almost DSLR quality before you started zooming it so
other sort of camera niceties shots in low light will actually look
surprisingly good in direct sunlight typical Samsung fashion a little bit
overexposed but the pictures look really bright and vibrant
both the sensors here of optical image stabilization so if you have a shaky
hand you're taking pictures on a bus for example they look
really good so I imagine that Samsung was a little gun-shy and overly cautious
when it came to battery we've got a 3300 mAh power
battery in here as opposed to 3500 on the S8 plus and samsung
claims is smaller because of the ten nanometer technology in the Snapdragon
835 which the same processor in the galaxy s8 and S8+ but haven't any
battery issues so again I was coming from a galaxy s8 by the end of my
day I was generally yet maybe twenty five thirty percent and I was about the
same here with the no date with the exact same usage so it appears that
they've done a really nice job with software managing battery and at some
point in the future when Oreo makes its way to notate battery life should even be
improved but you can get through a full day easily if you want to charge the
battery of course it's USB-C it's got fast charging and it's got wireless fast
charging as well and of course other stuff you'd expect like ip68
so but not always perfect in the note world even when you've got volume all
the way up on a phone call the speaker up to your ear was not that loud it was
quieter for me than it was on the s8 no DAC built in the speaker using
speakerphone it was seen the music is not overly loud either so I probably
recommend either a good pair of bluetooth headphones or if you want to
plug in headphones you can do it no DAC again but it does have a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack built-in and a big knock on the phone it's really the phone itself
it's the color choices I don't know why Samsung does this they release other
colors and different regions just release all the colors for everyone the
u.s. kind of got shafted in the color Department we've got black and Orchard
gray ordered gray looks nice but the rest of the countries got a
gorgeous-looking deep sea blue there's a maple Gold you have to kind of wait for
those colors to make their way out here and they eventually will but if you want
to buy a phone at launch you're kind of limited Samsung sent us the black
version and this is a fingerprint magnet it's the same sort of shiny black we had
on the s8 or the si+ so I recommend putting a skin on it you've got a deep
brand skin on ours a link to them down below and also Bixby's here with its
Bixby button yeah I mean I've talked about Bixby at length for me it's
unnecessary Google assistance here which has been plenty good enough but if you
want to use it bixby vision Bixby voice are both
here and they do what bixb does if you decide to set it up or or not remap the
button it so as you'd expect it's not a cheap phone depending on where you buy
it between nine hundred and thirty nine hundred fifty bucks but it's tough talk
about price because Samsung does ton of sales it's gonna be an expensive phone
regardless if you have an S8 and s8 plus it's probably not worth the upgrade
you're coming from a note five earlier device we're going to really want to
consider what Samsung has done here with the note eight it's an incredible bit of
hardware it is a big phone though and for a lot of people that might be a turn off I
recommend feeling it in your hand before you go ahead and buying it if you wear
tight pants or shorts with shallow pockets it's going to fall out or feel
really unwieldy for you what do I think about the note eight is it the phone
you've been waiting for you skipping for maybe what Apple has to come next if
you've already pre-ordered one I wanna know what you guys think if you liked
the review please give it a thumbs up we always appreciate it certainly helps
until next time I'm Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo you 
a lot of the coverage you see from see especially over the years spent on these crazy flagship products but I think one of the coolest things about the show that doesn't get the cover deserves are these big paradigm shifts these things that happen that change the industry and change tech and I think in turn kind of changed consumers and I think the smart home is one of them we've heard the term smart home for years now we've seen selective smart home products but finally we're at the shifts or the smart home like the vision of everything connected inside of your house is becoming possible so I figured that was a sit and it's like kind of houses set up and show you what the vision for the connected home is and beyond that what you can do with your home right now and some stuff that like maybe might be coming I so I am at the Bosch booth in CES 2018 I think they have one of the most comprehensive smart home visions what that means for a smart home is obviously all of your devices are connected that connectivity goes with you whether you are on the road whether you're traveling for work the way you're sitting on your couch using your voice you can control what's in your home and I think more importantly make your home work for you so obviously you can use your voice to change the thermostat change the temperature up and down that stuff that we've seen use your voice to control 360-degree cameras and then hide that camera so it's not on all the time having things like smart switches and smart outlets they can plug anything into and something that takes them lion obviously beyond that using your phone it's using an app to control everything in your home but there are also times when you're not near an Alexa or when stable device you don't have your phone with you you want to think sort of tangible to control all of these things it's up the call to twist about right on your wall and magnetically you can turn pull it off you can physically see all the things Eve patrol in your home control them move them change temperatures move cameras closed doors put it right back on the wall and you're good to go so my vision of Smart Hub I think it's twofold to make my life easier and to solve problems so behind me we've got the rock star it's a robot vacuum from Bosch so we've seen robot vacuums now for a super long time but this does a few new things that we haven't seen before so first it'll use lasers to map out your house and you can set sort of go or no-go zones on my house I've got pets and their food and water bowls around the floor I've got robot vacuums that I set to go and end up just pushing them all over the place so I could set a no-go area that's kind of cool gonna of course you can control it also from your phone so all that stuff are things that exist but it wouldn't be CES without sort of concept stuff that we might see like we've seen smart lamps before you can turn them on from your phone with this lamp as a projector the projected image down and all stirred into a touchscreen we've got it set up to even play games to see the air temperature project anything to see your doorbell that's another way to interact with surfaces it's obviously being the Kinect at home kitchens gonna be a big part of it all of your stuff they use at home can be connected things like your oven your coffee machine even your dishwasher you can be notified via if to set up a custom pattern when a dishwasher is done or the dryer cycles done flash the lights or play your favorite song another way you could make your house smart so there's a lot of cool potential for the Kinect at home a lot of stuff is here now and a lot of stuff I think it's so coming that future things were waiting for things like smart glass and smart mirrors serve on the cusp of a coming reality but Bosch has here and now is absolutely awesome so if you want to know how to never search for a parking spot again hit the link down below got a longer cut that's gonna explain that a ton of other cool ways to use the Internet of Things to make your life easier hope you guys enjoy it of course subscribe it the belt icons get notified when new CES videos are coming your way until next time I'm John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo and I legit feel like I'm standing in the future [Music] 
Thanks to Nucleum by Kingston for
sponsoring this video. It's been almost exactly two months since the iPhone 10
came out and during that time I'm using it on and off as my daily driver,
at least one of the two phones that I'm carrying. My opinions and thoughts on
the device have changed a little bit since my initial review so I figured
let's revisit the iPhone X. So the big thing for me in my review I
said I was gonna go case free, I was gonna opt for AppleCare and if I broke
it or dropped it I was gonna bite the bullet pay the fee and fix it. Then I
dropped my phone without a case on to carpet and I got a little bit scared so
I did put a case on my phone. It's just the Apple silicon case in black. I still
wish I could not have a case on it but I am way too paranoid and I got too many
kids in my house to do it. I love the way the phone feels but it's certainly
fragile. When it dropped even on carpet the sides still ended up getting a
little bit scratched. That was a bit of a bummer. The phone is not appear to be as
durable as Apple is saying. They're claiming it's the strongest glass ever
on a phone but there is no way I am going to test that. One of the things
about the device that seems to have gotten worse over time, and was ever great
to begin with, was battery life. In fact, in the office here we have seven
different iPhones and four of the people have said to experience the same thing. Battery
life is not great on the iPhone X. I don't know, I don't want to pile on
to Apple's battery issue that have been going on right now but it seems that it's worse than
when I initially start testing the device. Generally my usage on any iPhone
or any phone I can get through a full day without any problem. With my iPhone
10 generally I'm at 20% or lower by end of the day and sometimes I have to plan
on charging to get through it and I'm not even doing crazy usage. The battery life
has not been outstanding with the iPhone X. I've also noticed
some fit and finishes use with the iPhone, this might be unique to mine but one of my screws on the bottom for example isn't fully screwed. It's kind of
rough when I touch it. Something I've never experienced on any other Apple
devices so maybe it's small issue at the iPhone X maybe it's just mine, but
little things like that certainly you notice as you use the phone more and
more. When the phone launched I had two big concerns. The first was that notch being
really annoying, in fact I don't notice it anymore at all. It was a bit of
annoying when I first started watching full screen video when I first are
testing the device the more I use it honestly I don't notice it at all. I
don't think you will either. If that's something that's holding you back from
buying the iPhone I wouldn't worry about it. Then face ID, so we did a lot of
tests on it and faced ideas works pretty well actually. It's worked pretty well in
almost all situations for me. My wife has thick sunglasses and she has an iPhone
10 and for some reason it won't work through her sunglasses. So
it works as advertised for a lot of people but I wish there are some
redundancies. Look at what Samsung has with their Galaxy line, you've got iris scanning, you've 
got face scanning, you got a fingerprint sensor. I wish there was something like
that that worked, have different options and layers to sort of make your phone
unlock. It's a mind-boggling to me if you're wearing an Apple watch, it won't
automatically let you know your phone is safe to be unlocked. It still  has to see
your face. Or even something other things that Android has, if you're on a Wi-Fi
network that you label that secure it'll unlock. Or, if you want to use geolocation
when a particular area phone should unlock. I wish those things were baked in
to iOS to give you some sort of redundancy to unlock your phone. If
you're laying in bed on the side for example it's not going to see your face. It's not a giant issue and face id worked as well as I could have expected
but I'd like to have some sort of other option at least a face ID wasn't working
a particular situation. One opinion that hasn't changed is the camera. The rear
cameras on these things are absolute incredible. Portrait mode is great,
portrait lighting has actually improved since my initial testing. It's still not
great but the camera itself the pictures look incredible in any situation whether
it's low-light whether it's normal light whether it's almost in the dark. The
pictures here look absolutely beautiful. One thing that was surprising to me when
I bought the phone I thought I needed the bigger storage. I figured I have a
giant photo library, it's like 16 gigs or something, but for the first time in a
while I set my iPhone 10 out from scratch. Apple's got a lot of new file
systems here new file management. Pictures are stored in the cloud with
this new phone setup from scratch I am using less than 20 gigs of storage.
If you're looking to maybe save some money from already a really expensive phone I
think the smaller storage opt is gonna be fine for a lot of people and if you're
worried about storage on your previous device try setting it up from scratch. You
might be really surprised how much space do you actually have on your phone.
This next one's kind of weird. I love wireless charging and I've hoping wireless
charging was gonna come to Apple for a while. I know some of you guys don't care
about it but for me it's a convenience that I really like about the phone.
Apple's got an issue with the wireless charging. Whenever I wirelessly charge
my phone at night I turn it off. So I put it on the charger let it start charging
and then without moving it I'll turn the phone off. Usually almost every
other phone I've tested will charge overnight. I'll take it off, I'll
turn it on, and it's fully juiced up. The iPhone will turn on at some point during
the night, no matter what and it's not just my phone. It happens to my wife's phone
as well. We tested it here in the office, we've tested with four different
wireless chargers, and for some reason at some points the phone will turn back on
which is really annoying. I like to turn my phone off at night, I get notifications
throughout the entire night. I can obviously put it into nighttime mode or
Do Not Disturb but I've opted now just to plug my phone
in. I don't even use wireless charging so for me that's been a bummer I don't like
that my phone turns on at night it might not matter for you but that's something
that's really been an issue at least personally. A lot of stuff was new at the
iPhone X, one of the big ones was gestures and there was a definitely a learning
curve getting used to it. Now two months in I feel really used
to the new gestures and they feel like second nature to me. In fact I went back
to an older iPhone and it felt weird double tapping the home button so I kind
of gotten very used to it. It's a really elegant way to use the phone and to
navigate around it so if you're worried about the gestures don't. This video
wouldn't be possible without Nucleum. This is one of those product we've
actually been using a ton in the office it's super helpful if using one of the
new MacBook or MacBook Pros since it adds seven extra ports including two USB A two
USB C ports SD card reader and way more. Most importantly you can use all the ports at
once and actually the color matches with the MacBooks and iMacs that support USB
type-c. It's an awesome accessory. If you've got one those laptops,
definitely pick one up. If you want to learn more link to it down below. So
overall I've really enjoyed the iPhone 10. I loved a new screen. I wish a battery
life lasted longer but minor quibbles aside and certainly the gigantic price
point aside it's been a really good phone. It's really the best iPhone
Apple's ever made as you'd expect from the most recent iPhone Apple has ever
made. Have your experiences changed? Did you buy it when the phone came out?
Let us know down below. Are you holding out from my buying one for whatever reason, again
let us know. Of course subscribe, hit that little
bell next to it so you get notified when new videos are coming up. We have a lot more
iPhone coverage coming up and more versus videos coming. Hope you guys
enjoyed. Until next time, I'm Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo

It's time for the world to meet the
iPhone 10 just don't call it the iPhone X the true successor to the iPhone is
here and there's a lot of technology packed into its 5.8 inch OLED package
also getting announced today was the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus so
poor one out for what would have been the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s plus the
leaks were right the phones look like we expected them to look it looked like
this available in space grey or silver but there's a lot of Technology perhaps
we didn't know about first the screen technology it's OLED and Apple said they
waited on OLED for sort of obvious OLED reasons it wasn't the best in direct
sunlight wasn't the best for brightness they said they fixed all of those issues
creating a really bright and vibrant display and they are dubbing this new
display super Retina display and I think most exciting and probably most
importantly we finally have a true higher resolution display from Apple
this thing has a resolution of 2436 by 1125 you can do the math it's got a 458
PPI now it's by no means the highest pixel per inch of any 5.8 inch phone out
there but it is the highest PPI that Apple has ever announced and they claim the
screen looks absolutely beautiful at least it appears to look really nice and
it's got the same design that we expected it is edge to edge with the cut
out on the top for the cameras we're gonna talk a lot about those cameras
Apple is calling that whole cut out the true depth sensors that they do a lot
with the phone but the cutouts on the left and the right are gonna do a few
things so first one on the left is where you're going to see your time on the
right you'll see notifications like your Cellular strength you'll
see when it connects to Wi-Fi we're also gonna use those for the UI as well
our initial thought was that those areas are going to be kept for only those
notifications but actually that area the screen is gonna be used in a lot of apps
so if you're viewing a video there's gonna be a cut out your video picture is
the same way third party apps as well so we're on the home screen only we see
those notifications up at the top so bear that in mind no matter what you're
doing already have a little bit of a cutout doesn't look to be a giant issue
with the phone but the cutout is definitely going to be there this is
something I've been screaming at for years and we finally have it from Apple
we now have wireless charging and I give Apple credit for
using the Qi standard so any Qi chargers but not you've got a wireless
charger from Samsung or LG or Belkin or Mophie whatever you want you can now
charge your iPhone 10 and also be able to charge your iPhone 8 and iPhone 8
plus but of course it wouldn't be Apple without sort of their own spin on it
so they announced something new called Airpower the new technology it's gonna go
in conjunction with a new piece of hardware that can charge multiple i
things at once you can charge your iPhone you could put your AirPods on
it and your Apple Watch series 3 which got announced on it no kind of charg it
all at once with a cool animations on the phone that's not gonna ship till
next year but you got to know at least it's Qi wireless charging is here
powering this whole phone is Apple's new A11 Bionic chip in Apple's first
in-house design to GPU should get 70% better performance then last gen that's
the same chipset that's gonna be found on the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus
there's new sort of neural networking processing being done because thing
doesn't have a home button and without a home button don't have touch ID so enter
face ID this is facial unlocking this isn't like the old-school Android facial
lock and we sort of looked at your face and unlocked apples doing crazy stuff
with the cameras here Apple's using infrared and dot projection to actually
make a map of your face and using that reference when you want to unlock your
phone so the way it works you'll pick up the phone pull up to your face and it
will presumably unlock now the demo the Craig Federighi did didn't work the first
time didn't appear to be overly fast either perhaps that was just jitters or
pre-release software but I'm hoping it's going to be fast cuz a success of the
iPhone 10 is gonna rely on face ID if you want to unlock your phone aside from
just looking at it you can now swipe up from the bottom in fact that's where
you're going to get home any of your apps it's just a swipe up from the
bottom multitasking is kind of similar you swipe up from the bottom and then
yeah sort of wait a minute and then multitasking will show up and you can go
wherever you want to go and you can use the bottom to swipe between apps you can
go swipe to the left to get different apps or swipe to the right to go back if
you want to launch control center you go ahead and just swipe down from the upper
right and that's where control center is going to live it's a new way to interact
with your iPhone Apple talking a lot about a new experience with the phone
how the user is going to interact and it's all
centered around that camera system centered a lot around face ID so the cameras on
the iPhone 10 went from this way to that way but in that transition they gain dual
optical image stabilization the apertures changed a little bit
they got support for of course the portrait mode of the new lighting
portrait effects which will work in real time or after the fact and the
front-facing camera now supports both of those portrait things as well so you can
take beautiful bokeh selfies or do studio lighting with your portraits and
pricing we knew this wasn't going to be cheap it's gonna come in two
configurations it's the same as the iPhone 8 and the 8 Plus 256 or 64 GBs you're
going to be starting at 999 dollars you'll be able to place your pre-order
on October 27th and it's going to ship on November 3rd so in time for the
holidays but after the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus so I'll leave this question to
you what do you guys think about the iPhone 10 this is clearly the best that
Apple has to offer it's a competitive phone with a compelling feature set to
compete against the best of Android but is it enough to make you stick with
Apple are gonna go for the lower price iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 plus I really want
to hear your thoughts on this one I'm excited for the iPhone 10 I want to try
face ID I want to see how it works and if it works as promised it might lure
me back to Apple I can't wait to get my hands on it gotta wait a few more months

always helps as well till next time and Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo 
got up got a frog in my throat not like David Blaine but like my three-and-a-half-year-old brought something home so for now I'm going to sound like old grandpa we've been talking a lot about the Model X on the channel but that is not the Tesla that's going to be what Tesla is known for that award goes to the Model 3 which has announced the last year and is supposedly coming in 2017 and we're getting one step closer to seeing Model 3's on the road and Model 3's that you and I can actually buy so according to Reuters routers that that company Tesla is gearing up to start a pre production run of the Model 3 on February 20th which is very soon those aren't the cars are going to be purchased it just to make sure that the equipment is going to be okay that the factory can handle it make sure the parts are up to standards also actually test these cars on the road to be in cold weather testing and hot weather testing there's a lot about the Model 3 we don't know in fact we know the final design is going to look like we saw this nub knows version of the Model 3 when I got announced last year must get that a lot of things about the design change we don't have to finalize interiors gonna look like it was obviously a lot we don't know but there's still a decent amount that we do know so refresh your memory we can expect from the model 3 first-degree Model 3 testing really wanted to spell out sex with their model line I'm they couldn't get the Model 3 patent from forward so that's number three so starting price point 35 thousand dollars Tesla says the average price of people actually pay for the cars they do some upgrades gonna be around 42 we don't know the final battery pack size we do know it's not going two hundred kilowatt-hour size like we have in the model asked me actually says as options we don't have a range of at least 215 miles and 0-60 time of at least six second certainly will be much faster options and longer-range options as well so play range and also plenty of speed even at that baseline price the car looked a little bit strange for a very good reason Tesla push the cabin almost all the way up to the front of the cars you got a really narrow from core front end of the car where engine typically would go but that gives you in the back is a lot of leg room a lot of room for five passengers in fact that car so spacious for being so small Tesla says you can put a seven-foot surfboard just straight through the back if you're looking at the model x and love that sort of the helicopter is roof even out panoramic glass roof on the Model S that is going to also be available on the Model 3 should be pretty cool almost all glass effect through the entire top of the car and i think the big thing about the car is gonna be the tech will have Tesla's autopilot to plano presumably something there's not a 3-pointer by the time it hits the roads which should give Tesla the ability to do full autonomy towards the end of 2018 which is not really that far away and that's full autonomy level 5 like your destination and go to sleep in the back that's obviously borrowing a ton of regulatory approvals a Tesla claims are gonna get the cars on the road by the end of 2017 but i would probably hold your breath for getting yours sometime this year if the model excellent indicator there will be delays and the new ship at all this calendar you're probably like two or three cars and then ramped up production 20 18 and 2019 further dating from Tesla's it's generally maybe stay away from the first year so production-ready been littered with problems without the ass shot with the ex will probably still see it with the Model 3 that's everything we know about the Model 3 i've got a deposit down I can't wait to get behind the wheel of one and see what the card is going to look like interior is going to look like Musk has been teasing a lot of stuff about it so where do to actually see what the car is going to be a this is going to be the consequence defined Tesla and the paradigm shifting automobile companies been claiming four-year study i think Model 3 to put a deposit down let us know down below and are common to the day it comes from Abdullah more Raheem who says glad to see the audio in your videos have improved I was still a lot more to go we're actually using a brand new audio setup we got some sound dampening still do in the studio we're hoping to bring you quality audio and also as a quality video as we move forward into the year so thank you for noticing if you want to give him a following to a channel down below funny featuring a comment of the day or your comment pins just leave a comment the video a thumbs up it definitely helps us the next time John Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo 
way back when I started my youtube channel phones most of them didn't even record video at the time and if you got one that in a high megapixel account it was like 1.3 so all the videos I did I had to make with a handycam with digital tape you could even hear the tape winding in the backgrounds but if you're a YouTube creator now or you want to make some videos your phone can be everything for you it could be your camera but you edit with it could be what you make your thumb know it can take care of absolutely everything so my initial thought here was gonna be what's on my phone video for the note 8 but I realize I don't change my homescreen all that much so I wanted to show you what an ideal layout and what ideal apps for a YouTube creator would be assistant for a professional YouTube creator that's their only job it's for the casual creator who uploads videos every now and then and wants to be be invest in a more expensive phone with better optics that can do absolutely everything let's jump right in anything I'm gonna talk about here by the way I'll link to it down below in case you want to download any of the apps you pick up the widgets the first thing I've got at the top of my screen is a live Youtube subscriber widget and if you're just starting off you really want to keep track of home subscribers you have if you put up a video and again you 10 or 20 subscribers or as a normal video gets you half of that you want to know that you'd be able to see how well your channel is doing right away it's kind of handy to see it it gives you kind of a bird's-eye view of your channels health so the first two apps you should probably already know about but these are essentials for any to creator no matter the level the first one is YouTube studio it's made by Google themselves and lets you do things like see your live view count on your videos when you view videos on the website it'll tell you 301 I'll get stuck account it's not really a live video count going in the back end here will actually tell you what your videos are actually at you can also see your subscribers in there you can change descriptions you can change some other stuff that goes into a video like tags it's just really nice way to get access and control your content the next app should be obvious is it's the YouTube app you want to do a YouTube live or watch other people's videos it's it's the YouTube app the next one you might not think for YouTube but it's an app called dashlane it helps me manage all my passwords so I've got four YouTube channels I've got techno blood-flow got a personal blog channel we have a movie one and we another one spoilers are coming up coming up soon and those are associated with three different Google accounts so they actually just helps me remember the passwords that I'm using not just for YouTube but also like web stuff in general I like that I can use it with my phone so it'll autofill passwords as auto log me in all that stuff is nice but the biggest reason is I'm changing phones way often it'll just think all my passwords over to the new phone so I can log into my YouTube channels pretty easily without really having to worry it'll generate passwords for you it'll sync with your Mac or PC just makes things pretty easy a lot of stuff and dashlane is free there's a premium account will link to down below if you want to check it out if you decide to stick with it here's a code that'll give you 10% off thanks a bash line for actually sponsoring this video but it's legitimately an app that I've been using I wouldn't recommend it otherwise it's a great pasture management app for iOS Android or PC or Mac so definitely check them out the next app is one that's actually been way more useful for me than I thought it's called wreck Forge - essentially it's an audio recorder so if you want to lay down some vo for video you just did you want to record some thoughts for a video coming up it's a really good audio recorder I know most phone so audio recorders built-in this one gives you a bit more granular control though over the audio fidelia's you're recording it just works well for me if you don't like this one just use any audio record at your phone has there's some ads that kind of pop up it make it a little bit annoying on the UI front but the app itself works really well so a big part of YouTube is getting people to look at your videos and a lot of people choose the videos are gonna watch based on the thumbnail so if you want to create the thumbnail from your phone a couple cool apps to try the first one is picsArt so this is gonna do is gonna let you create a collage you can draw pictures you can put stickers on the pictures you can sort of make a thumbnail custom they could bright make it pop a lot of people put themselves into thumbnails it's kind of a cool way to go ahead and do that you can import in our image you've already edited and sort of spiced up a little bit if I want to create thumbnails on the go it's a pretty sweet app to try and it's totally free alright so you've got your thumbnail you got your audio maybe use your camera I didn't put the camera app in here to shoot your video if I want to do some light editing you can do it on your phone as well I've currently been trying Chi master it's a pretty solid way to edit you create a new project I'll even give you an assistant to try and help you through it but as you learn the app you can do some pretty awesome edits to make a video look seamless you can do jump cuts or even some transitions in there if you want to edit a video and have it all done on your phone like maybe you're at an event and you want to be able to cut it up and get it live really quick it's a pretty solid app and it's free as well so it's nice it maybe doesn't compete with like apples got you know the iMovie on iOS but it's pretty close and it's been totally free and this one not necessarily YouTube related but we get a ton of questions on our wallpapers they all come from this app called backdrops you can pick your favorite background and and just throw it on there it's where this one came from it's pretty easy to use you just find the wallpaper you like set it and you're all done and you get some pretty badass like a wallpapers so here's the moral if you want to use your phone as your studio you can now microphones are good enough cameras are good enough phones are powerful enough and now software is pretty awesome that lets you do all of that right from wherever you are so if this helps if I missing an app that you guys use to create video on the go let me know we've got some stuff in here that was not so related to YouTube but we're the youthful apps as well things like the backdrops app we got - Lane another sort of really useful things that make using your phone bit more utilitarian hope you guys enjoyed give it a thumbs up we appreciate it and again if I missed an app that you use for YouTube creation or video creation in general even the comments down below [Music] [Music] 
we're gonna do this we're gonna put the iPhone 10 up against the pixel to excel this video is guaranteed to piss off 50% of you there won't be any cop-out whatever is best for you I'm going to declare a winner at the end so the five categories we're using to determine a winner our design camera display performance and intangibles clearly we could have done another 30 categories but I want this video to be 45 minutes so I picked the five that I thought best sum up a phone and hit every aspect of the device can't offer so let's start with design every company's trying to make a rectangle look sexy and Apple is no exception holding the iPhone 10 is like holding a screen albeit with my hairline not right at the top people need to be pretty split on the notch it's not my favorite design feature but overall I really like the way the phone looks I like that the front is completely devoid of buttons it is a beautiful looking device the glass on the back makes a phone feel really nice and premium as well I'm split on how I feel about the banding on the sides I like it on the Space Gray version on the silver version you look shiny prone to scratches it makes it look cheap to my eye the back is made of glass and Annapolis claims it's the strongest glass ever on a device and it may be I don't want to test it but is a fingerprint magnet so at least bear that in mind the biggest design flaw of the iPhone 10 comes from the camera and the hump that comes with those two 12 megapixel sensors you can't put it on a desk and use it without it wobbling back and forth understand why this still has such a big camera top I would easily settle for a thicker phone the bigger battery and no camera hump but if your photo on a desk you're constantly typing you're watching a video that wobble is going to get really annoying so next let's jump over to the pixel 2x L the two-tone designs not for everybody I've got the black version here I kind of dig the look it's more of an industrial design it is certainly not bezel as a lot of companies are going nowadays but the fact that it does have bezels on the top and bottom mean you get front-facing speakers the phone has a very functional feel to it I love the way the aluminum fits on the back it's got that cold kind of feel to it the fingerprint sensors on the back but they meet the texture inside of the button the same as the texture on the back of the phone I really like that as setec designer pixel 2 is relatively uninspiring I'll be an extremely functional on the camera outside it's got a teeny tiny ones but not nearly as egregious as what you get on the iPhone so when it comes down to just design looking at both of these phones you can see clearly different design directions the iPhone 10 rises far above when it comes to design design category goes to Apple so next let's jump to cameras and both these devices have incredible camera setups but let's start with the iPhone 10 it's got two 12 megapixel sensors in the typical format you'd expect a wide angle and a telephoto it's almost an identical setup actually just different orientation than what you've got on the A+ except now both sensors have oh is built-in I was really impressed with the dynamic range I thought saturation really hit a sweet spot and pictures came out looking really good overall and almost every scenario that I threw at it on the video side 4k at 60 frames per second was pretty nice but while you are recording video again oh is you can almost run with this thing and the video is gonna look really stable portrait lighting on the other hand has been a completely mixed bag in fact I stopped using completely excited entry' lie on the results perhaps when it comes out of beta beat a bit more useful but if you have a long hair you can pretty much cross off whatever finding much would be used for it alright so onto the front it's got a true depth sensor enables all that stuff like face ID but it also enables portrait mode through its 7 megapixel sensor which is awesome at least in theory for a front-facing camera it looks really bad sometimes half of a background would be blurred half wouldn't it was completely inconsistent and all over the board I expected much better from Apple if you're taking just regular non portrait selfies though they do look pretty decent alright so on to the pixel if you look at this just on paper you think this would be a blowout from the iPhone standpoint it's got two two megapixel sensors as opposed to just the one on the pixel 2xl but fortunately that is not the case damn this is an incredible camera that Google is put into the pixel to excel the pictures in normal light looked incredible about being oversaturated it really shined in low-light and direct sunlight it was perfect I couldn't find a scenario where this camera didn't take good pictures on the video side the 4k is capped at 30 frames per second it did look good portrait mode is also here on rear and the front and it works incredible on the rear it uses machine learning to sort of get better as you use it all right so it's a familiar story pork remote looks good on the back but what about the front pixel to pixel to excels rocket an eight megapixel sensor pictures coming out of the eight megapixel sensor especially on the portrait mode setting look ridiculously good and again they've gotten better over time when it comes to front-facing portrait the pixel spanx the iPhone 10 the rear photos that's really a coin toss which one you like but all around package of cameras Google did an incredible job here with the pixel through the pixel 2xl it is definitely a win for google that's an X let's jump over to arguably the most important part of the phone with the display and this is essentially the OLED Wars let's start with the iPhone Apple is really first to move into a lot of new technologies but when they move in that direction they usually do it right and OLED is no exception they did a really good job with the screen on the iPhone 10 so the 5.8 inch OLED panel is extra tall it's a little bit strange to hold it first it's got an aspect ratio of nineteen point five by nine the PPI is not as high as what you get on the pixel 2xl it's only 458 with a 24 36 by 1125 resolution is plenty of pixels here the screen is a great job balancing color saturation there is some slight color shifting at off angles a lot of people love the true tone display I mostly turned it off but that's gonna be a personal preference thing HDR content looks really good due to the wide color gamut I was able to see the screen in direct sunlight which is a big worry that I had with OLED panels overall it's a really well-balanced panel that looks good showing almost any content of any color alright so next let's jump into the pixel to excel and I do want to say that this review was filmed post the November update so display on the pixel to excel is six inches in a more conventional 18 by 9 aspect ratio really high PPI 538 and it's 28 80 by 1440 HDR content here is gonna look good same wide color gamut you've got on the iPhone 10 but there's a definite blue hue here to the device some people might like get it really didn't sit well with my eye the display looks good I think it looks better post update but do you compare the quality of the OLED panels on the XL fours on the iPhone it is a clear win for Apple and the iPhone 10 let's jump in to performance both these phones are the current king of speed for respective operating systems the iPhone is an absolute screamer the pixel to excel is a beast and everyday usage both are really fast it's only way like a quantify speed let's go to the benchmarks so the iPhone 10th is rocking a 11 Bionic that's got two high powered cores and for low power cores pair with three gigs of RAM although Apple doesn't like to tell you how much RAM is in their phone the pixel he's using the familiar snapdragon 835 with four high powered cores and for low-power cores and again you look at paper and thick benchmarks would tell the story clearly seems like the pixel is more perceived power but damn the results here were surprising so a Geekbench the iPhone got a single core score of four thousand three hundred and thirty four and a multi-core score of ten thousand eight hundred and forty two so keep that in mind when I tell you at the pixel of two XL got a single core score of 1898 and a multi-core score of six thousand 356 so those are the benchmarks and I get it the benchmarks don't tell the full story what matters is end user experience and both end user experiences are really good but I promise no cop-out gotta pick a winner and looking at those numbers is staggering what Apple has done at least it perceived a lower power at least lower ram they've done an awesome job optimising 11 bionic the iPhone 10 clearly takes this category and for the last category let's move to intangibles phones are becoming more and more like this intangible category I think helps separate one device from another the little things that make it shine and make it the best advice for you let's start with the iPhone so perhaps the biggest reason a lot of folks buy an iPhone as Apple's ecosystem things like iMessage and Apple pay make it just really easy to use you're also getting wireless charging ip67 water and dust resistance it's fast charge capable carplay you get the novelty of face ID you're getting pretty quick updates from Apple and the device is crazy fast as we saw from the benchmarks alright so the iPhone 10 brings a lot to the table the pixel to excel is clearly no slouch you are getting really good speakers for a mobile device way faster quick charging lower price of 849 bucks and always-on display I use quite a bit you're getting the Google assistant which I prefer you're getting the squeeze on the sides access Google assistant you're getting Android auto you're getting Android pay no not at the top again ip67 water and dust resistance and the last intangible but definitely not least the aluminum on the back makes this phone incredibly more durable so you're looking at the intangibles both phones have a lot to offer but find it pick one based on the little things I'm going pixel qxl it takes this round so before we tell you up a winner and perhaps to come your rage I want to thank our sponsors Sennheiser and their AM Bo smart headset for making this video possible especially in the intangible category both phones lost their headset jacks you got a deal with either lightning or USB C and these are an awesome option so first they do all the stuff you'd expect from a high-end pair of headphones there's an app you can download it can control different modes there's a really good job with noise canceling is probably my favorite way to use it you can also get some of the ambient noise piped in if you want to hear somebody talking to you but perhaps the coolest thing is binaural audio which is more commonly known as 3d audio so when you plug these things into your phone into recording when you play it back with the headphones in you're going to hear them as they were when you recorded it so you'll hear a matter the left here or the right ear depending on where they were located it is an absolutely incredible way to listen back to audio so right now the nvo smart headset six advantage of the lightning protocol in the iPhone but there's an Android version that'll be coming later it's gonna work with Apple's camera app of course the Apogee meadow recorder filmic Pro voice memos and with any other stereo audio recording app you could find there's a microphone built in to each earpiece so its plugging point right out of the box but there is an app of a to download and give you a lot more settings and customization options so again this is the Ambu smart headset thank you to Sennheiser for making as versus video possible we'll link to it down below if you want to learn more it's been a hard-fought battle 50% of you are probably crazy pissed at me but don't be pissed you picked up one of these two phones you got an incredible device but only one can reign supreme so the winner by total of three to two is the iPhone 10 it's been an incredible device I love having a big screen with almost no bezels on an iPhone I am getting one of the best phones I have ever used that is incredibly fast powerful and offers a lot of features I've been hoping Apple is gonna offer like quick charging and wireless charging are here finally Apple is caught up to the best of Android and a lot of ways has exceeded it so what do you guys think you probably already let me know in the comments do you agree with the iPhone 10 taking this battle what do you want to see next for our vs. leave in the comments down below cut the video a thumbs up because appreciate it and most importantly don't forget hit that little bell to get notified when new videos are coming we've got a few awesome vs. lined up and you don't want to miss it hope you guys enjoyed until next time I'm John R Ettinger and TechnoBuffalo [Music] 
I have been a huge supporter of the Microsoft Surface line everything they now instead of the original surface pro I even saw the value in the surface RT I use a Microsoft Surface pro floors my daily computer at home I use the turfers book as my computer at the office was better part of five months I love and I believe in the line but it was a huge gap little Microsoft was offering and enter the surface laptop would answer the question that a lot of people wanted just make a real laptop Microsoft I don't want to carry a tablet I don't want a weird-looking laptop I can take screen off of I just want a traditional thin laptop Microsoft delivered on that with the surface laptop and it's good at some strange to say this as good a laptop as this is I don't think you should buy it first care me out about the laptop so price counter service laptop something I want to talk about quite a bit you can pick one up the entry-level about $1000 going to get you four gigs of RAM to get you an i5 processor they will be seventeen and four gigs ram ours are 300 bucks more at $1300 got 70 ini 580 driving 256 gigabytes on the SS you can match this sucker out like 2200 bucks I don't recommend it thing configuration we have is kind of a sweet spot it works pretty well from any computing you want to do Savior for like video editing and game design here is very clearly a surface laptop it's aluminum and oddly Alcantara on the keyboard I'll consider is usually reserved for high-end cars the headliner but it feels really nice here I've got some concern about how it's going to wear over time with greasy-ass palms but it feels really nice there's a beard scheme on the side listen come lifted off kind of wish that wasn't there small issue but I do like how it looks and makes computer look kind of nice and if you like the way you computers look you can pick from one of four colors microsoft offers they've got a really nice arrangement of colors we've got the kind of blowing silver here next up did a couple cool things if you look at this laptop they notice you can't see you a speaker grille anywhere these speakers are actually underneath the keyboard you're probably going to think like I did they're going to sound crazy as muffled they actually sounds really good but you considering the sound is kind of coming directly through that keyboard I'm thinking of a keyboard it's pretty reminiscent of the type that we had the new surface pro the surface pro 4 it's got a little more key travel but it feels good good to type on a trackpad would like it's been a bit bigger but it is really smooth Microsoft is an incredible job with your drivers on the server side onto track that no force type stuff here a traditional gotta push it in but does work really well so battery life is also pretty decent I got about 7 and 1/2 hours it's not the best about a department of last I'll confess it but it's not horrible and instead of toned down what you're doing you'll easily be able to get through a full day microsoft's been pushing is 3.2 aspect ratio on the screens for a while and I still really like it much like I did with the surface book the scree on the laptop is pretty incredible it's a 13.5 inch screen is Gorilla Glass 3 it's 25 56 by 1504 so you're plenty of pixels and the restoration these not have to do that much scrolling stick it outside though it is going to be insanely reflective so this is definitely going to be like an inside computer ports are limited you've got a single USB a port you've got a mini DisplayPort in service connector that's that's about it I would've liked to beseen USB type-c or at least under bolt 3 Microsoft is not quite ready to commit to that yet so not here also no SD card reader certify cafeteria key dongles with you victims computer has also with Windows 10 but it's Windows 10s think of it as like regular Windows 10 without being able to download your own apps and less does apps live in the Windows Store which is like a wasteland of apps right now Microsoft Office is now in there but the app selection is just not good I could also trying to use this computer sort of forced developers to make after the Windows Store which maybe they will I think Microsoft is aware that that's probably going to annoy some consumers so for right now you can download Windows 10 the full version for free ultimately though it's going to cost you about 50 bucks do that if you want the full version of Windows so keep that in mind when I start telling you why you shouldn't buy this laptop so it's a pretty good laptop it works well by like was good it looks nice it feels nice dimensions are pretty similar to laptop it's clearly trying to fight in the mask of books air fits in the bag really well why would you not buy it the big reason not the BIOS laptop comes down to price if you value your dollar and you want to get the best computer in the best value for that buck this is not a good deal look at this competition the first razor blade stealth starts at 900 bucks I just want to look at spec for spec have it be similar be brand new just announced gunmetal version of the self is $100 more if it's going to give you double the RAM at 16 gig can give you a 4k display get me the seventh gen i7 processor didn't give you a full windows so that $100 difference and if you end up having to pay for Windows 10s you're now only a fifty dollar difference maybe if you try and buy the pen to go with this could end up being a watch you're getting so much more for a hundred bucks but if you want to spend even less just browsing Microsoft's own store online shows way better value for your computer buying buck even the new surface pro you brand-new just down surface pro you can get this thing spectra spec and have it exactly be the same price the granted you have to buy a type cover but you're getting the portability of a tablet now stating the ability to sort of how it folds almost all the way down fail to write on its rooming nice option and the sand is really good on that so those are a few examples I found while just generally browsing Microsoft's own store and beyond all that all those computers also come with full version of Windows 10 I don't like the 10s I feel like Microsoft had to put something on consumers they shouldn't be doing now know that going in so you'll know buying this you're going to have certain muted version of Windows you're going to have to get it hit that upgrade button which is pretty unique takes about a few minutes to upgrade order you have to pay for it if you're after that trial period so that's the perfect laptop it seems kind of strange to not have a positive feeling about the surface whine I've loved them since the very first gen I've been evangelizing them I've recommended them to friends and family hell I've even bought three different services for my own personal use this guy I just don't see the value but if you bought one and maybe you're thinking about buying one you see the value that maybe I didn't mention let me know in the comments we can talk about it and perhaps you can change my mind looks like a politician I can flip-flop if I'm proven wrong until next time I'm John render keep talking about you [Music] 
so it's been about six months since Apple unveiled the exact same looking Apple Watch Series 2 we have too much coverage on here because I didn't think it was that exciting I've been switching for the past three months between an iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel when I use the iPhone I've got an Apple Watches to that I just kinda wanted to try to figure out to share my opinions on it and we didn't do an unboxing went to review a kind of ignored it because I thought that was kind of blob but having actually used one have my opinions changed i'm asking to myself or knowing the answer and you couldn't tell by general answer is still the same feeling I had on the original Apple Watch shrug shrug emoji kind of what it is i went in with it's big expectations taking ok you watch more powerful i'm going to use third-party apps they're gonna load crazy fast on here brighter screen it's got some waterproofing in it i can go swimming I can beat my son I'm jazzed for the new iPhone i put on my wrist and use it exactly the same way i use the last meeting your notifications tell the time and try and close my rings remind me to get up and get up and walk that's the extent that i personally use the wearable and apple sold like 5 million of these things last quarter so i may be in the minority people are obviously buying these things in droves because they're using them for something i think a hard time that seeing what they're really useful for I'm saying that folio where of the the irony i think it's probably the right word i'm using one while i'm saying i don't see much for purpose to it but you guys see much of a use for your wearables I do like the waterproofing that is definitely come in handy else through forget that got on set my hand at bath water fills up but it's cool how the water ejects at first I thought my waters will judge you reminded me to stand up and tell me to breathe but then I started to appreciate it started calling me fat and I got mad it is for the most part I've like this kind of applications that can do but i don't use any third party apps in fact when i try to third-party apps despite them being loaded directly on the watch the launch extremely slow about time I could just do this by the app I want and then open it up and just take out my phone and that's really true for a lot of things here i do use it though one big positives for me is I want to play music in the car and i'm using Apple Music using my phone and I say Hey Siri holidays activated probably ton of phones always work on the iphone but hold it up to my wrists and saying that same command they went through twice as much more responsive speakerphones better on it but I really don't catch many called on my watch I don't like my computer with it for me it's not worth reading 70 bucks think about getting up a watch the recommend going for the first gen the Series 1 I guess he's get that for a way bigger discount get on this executive experience a 44 waterproofing some little brightness issues on the screen that was my Apple watch I guess to review thoughts ramblings it's still mad I think save your money saving for put it away for school bye-bye stocks take your lady friend gentleman friend out for a nice dinner that would probably give you much more rewarding experience that you're going to get dropping through the 17 Bucks minimum on apple launched expensive Apple tax times for so where do you guys think one of your thoughts on it before and now i do want to give a shout-out to the comment of the day and this one might be one of my favorite comments ever from Christian p have commented on the one I've been waiting for for cool things coming this month a little excited a video as you can about some tech and I always made a comment that people think i'm high on something and I said I'm not just high on life and christian said Jon the last person anyone respect to be smoking something I mean look at the guy he's a walking advertisement for dads borders at first I was like hey man eff off and look down I was like all right Christian p feel you so his link to his channel will be down below if you guys want to be featured in upcoming comments the day it's pretty obvious row row your comment i just watched awesome party last night itself my-my douche impression thank ya helps you in the next video 
there are ton of wireless headphones out there but finding a good pair is super tough I've got an answer for you meet the Optima NuForce be free eights these little suckers come in a pretty sleek black little carrying case so John you say what's new unique about these well I want to give you guys a chance to create some for yourselves we're also gonna be given a pair of these suckers away as well as a chance to win the smartphone of your dreams up to a thousand bucks we'll link to all the information down below there's a couple reasons that I think these headphones are pretty cool first I kinda like the black case really sell a battery life I think that's important for something that's this small you're gonna get about 16 hours between the battery life built into the earbuds and also into the case so that's nice what's been a big deal for me and this is a legit concern on if you guys have had this issue but I must have put weird ear canals and weird gear holes because most wireless earbuds or headphones that go inside of the year aren't comfortable for me things like ear pods that can only wear for maybe 20 30 minutes at a time before my ears start to hurt and also they fall out so the fact that things were comfortable for like an hour the longer at a time was super nice to have there's also a lot of a lot of tech they crammed in here things I'm gonna make things useful there's a button to launch Google assistant which is built in there supposedly the only true wireless headphones that support AAC and aptX low latency technologies right out of the box that's gonna mean you're getting high fidelity audio it's any device whether it's an iPhone Android or even Windows Phone and also PC and Macs got a built in dynamic micro driver with new forces sonic coating all that's gonna mean it you're gonna get get awesome sound out of headphones that are that are really small they're also sweat and water resistant with IP x5 if you get gross and sweaty when you worked out or happen to get like some rain hits them they're gonna be good to go got a built-in CVC noise cancelling microphone for calls which is awesome for something that's small usually you've got a kind of background noise that's been really helpful to have so another bit of cool tech is NF M I miss me it seems for near field magnetic induction so this is tech that produces the best quality between earpieces there's no need to receive and resend Bluetooth signals even maintain two separate Bluetooth connections between the source and the earpiece it's kind of cool you could just the left one if you want share with someone so if it sounds like something you want to check out and I think you guys probably should hundred fifty bucks is a really killer deal for something like this we'll link to it down below we also want to give you a chance to win a pair and pair it with the smartphone of your dreams any smartphone under a thousand bucks will will send you open to anyone in the world on these dates all you gotta set the link down below the article on TechnoBuffalo comm enter there and we will pick one lucky winner to win the headphones and the smartphone of your dreams you guys should really check these out folks it out to a Ralston and send it to us they spawned to this video they're legitimately really good headphones and if looking for something Wireless that's maybe not white stupid looking these are really good options I hope you guys enjoy giveaways we love doing it until next time John right and your protective buckle Oh [Music] 
I want to thank the awesome folks at
Anker and the Power Core 2 portable battery for making this epic video
possible keeping all our gear charged up so this is a Tesla Model X it's actually
my car I've been driving it for the better part of a year we've held off on
her floor review because the car was delivered to me initially it was missing
a ton of features that ultimately came over the air so it has the autopilot 2.0
hardware but at delivery none of it was active in fact the car could do less and
older cars that are quipped with Hardware 1.0 when I mentioned autopilot
2 hardware it's essentially it's 12 ultrasonic sensors all around the car
and eight cameras gonna make this thing eventually
according to Elon Musk and supposedly by the end of the year be fully level five
autonomous so this version that I have is a 75D the 75 means it's
got a 75 kilowatt hour battery in the D is dual motor so essentially it's
all-wheel drive it's got an advertised range of about 237 miles but I've never
once gotten close to that when I do almost a full hundred cent charge
generally shows about 220 miles and that's not actual range it's gonna
depend on your driving so you got to really use the car to see how many miles
you can actually get Tesla doesn't recommend you charge the card up to a hundred
percent the recommend about 80 percent so sort of cycles through the cells it's
gonna be a 0-60 time of about four and a half seconds I've actually clocked it
that's what  I got so it's not a slow car for being something this big you
could option it up Tesla let's sort of change your battery pack size and get a
100 D give you a faster 0-60 and up your range just under 300 and if you want the
fastest Model X available you can get a P100D so bringing it down to about
four seconds or under four seconds and keep that almost 300 mile range of
course things start to get super expensive from there so driving an EV
is different for some people it's obviously no gas and other questions
that I get is what is it gonna cost to actually fill up or charge the car so I
charge my in off hours here in Southern California so it's about ten to eleven
cents per kilowatt so from zero to a full 75 kilowatt hour charge it's gonna
cost me about $8.25 so to go 200 ish miles it's about eight
dollars for me so way less what you get with gas charging up the model X is pretty
easy I installed the 240 outlet at home and I just use the standard charge that
came with the car it'll charge generally about 20-ish
miles an hour you can get bigger faster charges but for me that was totally fine
it's like a cell phone I plug in at night and I wake up in the morning and
it's got a full charge I never have to deal with gas station or issue at
all but if you need faster charging you need sort of more regular charging
Tesla's got super chargers all over the US in fact they're expanding I think
they're gonna go like 2x which is what they have right now it can charge
your car up to 80% in about 30 minutes and it is insanely fast it's not quite
as fast as gas yet but it works and the stations are almost everywhere and
actually inside the car will tell you if there's a stall available the big story with the Model X is the doors the Falco Wing doors people love them or hate them I'm kind
of in the middle I certainly liked them when I got the
car sort of the big appeal of a car like this in practical use they work very
well in certain situations and others they are definitely an inconvenience
they used to be really slow when the car first shipped it would take almost four
seconds the doors open up but as software updates have come doors are
opened up a way faster and I will say even in tight spots I have never once
hit another car the car have been are really good about detecting overhead beams never
hit overhead beams either putting kids in out of the car it's been really nice
to have those I don't have to sort of twist of my back to get kids in and sort of walk
up to the car and you can just put the kids straight in so the Falcon wing
doors have held up really well I haven't had any issues with them but my
passenger door it's a little bit of a creak in it you can you can hear what it
sounds like doesn't affect the performance at all or detecting anything
it just sort of is a bit of an annoyance so aside from the Falcon doors another
highlight feature of the Model X is its kind of helicopter type of windshield
and when you sit in the car it's unlike any other experience you can look up and you
can sort of see straight up it's different that a panoramic group you don't have
that sort of cross beam it's just sort of glass all the way up and it sounds
awesome on paper they put some sort of tint on it to drive and block out the sun
and they claim it blocks 97% of UV rays and the heat but it gets really hot so
Tesla does some things really well they're innovators and technology but
some stuff is just kind of baffling to me why
they would do it the visors on the model X are weird it's like a strange magnetic
dance you got to pull it and snap it and then pull it down again to get the visor
to come out and if you want to block the Sun so you got his freakin glass over
you it's strange to do and it's so little
profile doesn't do much so you can configure the car with different seating
arrangement so you can get a five seater a six seater or seven seater I opted for
the six seater I like that alley in the middle it's gonna
give you two captain chairs in the second row and then two seats in the
third row you get a ton of storage back there that sort of a hidden compartment
in the back sort of store stuff kind of like a minivan kind of looks like a
minivan anyway you've got the front trunk two stories for sorting some kind
of extra stuff that you might need it so I opted for the white interior and when
I first did our video on the Model X I got a lot of like what's wrong with you
you got kids why would you go white so according to Elon Musk
the vegan material that goes into this is the most durable of all the Tesla
materials that includes their leathers and synthetics so I was a bit dubious to
have white in my car especially as someone who wears jeans every day so going on now a year
I've had ketchup spill on those seats I've had coffee spill on those seats and
I've had other gross stuff that kids tend to eat on those seats and I can say
the seats look almost brand new so if you're nervous about getting the white
actually seems to be really good even more durable and some of the leather
options at Tesla offers so I option in my car with the air suspension that
means you can sort of raise it up or down you can sort of do it manually
it'll remember locations so if you'd like to raise it up when you go to work
it'll do that automatically you get there it's a really cool feature that
the car has the main reason that got it thought is gonna make the ride seem a
little smooth I can sort of adjust itself as it goes over bumps it turns
out the suspension on this thing is tuned like a sports car you feel every
single bump in the road it doesn't matter if you've got air suspension or not
I was kind of disappointed the suspension of Tesla put in here it's a
way harsher ride that would have wanted from the big family hauling SUV if I had
a Model S maybe I'd expect it if I had even a model 3 or a roadster you
kind of want that hard suspension you want to feel the bumps in the road but
in a car like this that was not a welcome surprise the biggest reason that I got
the Model X was autopilot I loved what it could do and I loved the promise of
what it was ultimately going to be able to do but as it stands right now it's
like level 2-ish autonomy it means it can do some stuff they got to stay
aware and stay diligent but when it's doing its thing in the right conditions
it is awesome so you give the cruise control stock a little DoubleTap towards
you it's gonna activate autopilot and it works you can essentially take your
hands off the wheel while paying attention and the car is going to
navigate itself it's meant to be used on freeways it's still technically in beta
but it works in all conditions it works on turns it works in the rain
it works anywhere you want to use it on a freeway damn is it cool if you
want to change lanes you put the signal up and it'll change lanes for you on its
own it'll make sure things are clear and it'll go it won't keep going if you keep
the signal on that you got to turn off and turn it back on again and it'll keep
speed other features are coming like being able to pass on its own and that
kind of stuff but as it stands right now it works really well with a few super
dangerous caveats if it can't track the lanes it'll try and track a car in front
of it you'll see the car kind of turn blue on the dash if lane markings aren't
so bright it'll kind of ping-pong around it also works on city streets it's not
technically meant for that but you can turn it on if you go through a big
intersection if there isn't a car in front you that it can track I mean this
thing can almost veer off into another Lane so you got to stay diligent and you
got to stay awake when using autopilot but in the right conditions it is
absolutely awesome it can make a long drive or stop and go traffic really kind
of usable so I mentioned the cars equipped with autopilot 2.0 and as this
filming doesn't really do anything that the original auto pilot didn't but it
does do a ton of stuff so first the car's got a summon feature which means from
your key fob or the mobile app you can make the car go forward or back without
anybody in it which is insane and ultimately the car is going to use the
autopilot 2.0 software to drive itself so you could park it in a spot you can
summon it the car to come to you it'll pull out the spot it'll turn
and drive and go right to where you are doesn't work as of yet
right now it's forward and reversed but it is really cool I'd also can for a
particular Park itself or parallel park itself with varying degrees of accuracy
so I love the Model X for me it's perfect but the car itself is far from
perfect I like what it represents I like it's sort of electric propulsion I like
that I'm kind of paying to pave the way for cars like the model three I'm okay with
all of that I wish Tesla would have done some other stuff I wish there was more
storage in the car I wish the visors weren't freaking weird
I wish autopilot wasn't kind of squirrely at times but overall in a
whole package the cars been incredible Tesla delivered on their promise
the Falcon Wing doors are awesome they're usable they're not necessary but I'm
glad that they're here if anything they're kind of a conversation starter
I'm really happy with the Model X it was a three year lease for me and I'll be
sad to give it away in two more years perhaps my next car will be a model 3 a
model Y or event another one of these guys but I think Tesla hit a home run with this
car I know it's not growing any beauty awards but for a functional family
hauler or a car that has a lot of storage capacity it's really good in
fact it's probably my favorite car that I've never had so much to my surprise
the ultra white seats held up the Falcon wing doors have been usable with no issues
the car is still plenty fast enough and I love it it's not a perfect car but
it's a perfect car for me this video has been a year in the making we wanted to
show the Model X when it got to its full capacity or at least on par with what
autopilot 1.0 could do it's only gonna get better from here we should have full
autonomy coming in the next two years hopefully if you subscribe to Elon's
promises more features should be coming over the next few years this car will
drive itself this car park itself this car will become even more usable
than day one and I love that as a geek as a car enthusiast as a tech guy and as
a dad this car has been the most perfect package that could imagine so like
pretty much all EVs except for hydrogen the Tesla uses lithium-ion cells to give it
its juice it's sort of the same lithium-ion cells that something like an
external battery pack would use and I want to take a quick second to thank our
friends at Anker for sponsoring this video and making something of this epic
proportion happen I've got their power core 2 here
it's a 10,000 mAh power battery same lithium-ion technology that's in the car
is in the battery pack like this so if you want something that's gonna last you
wanna be able make sure your gadgets can be charged much like you want your car
to be charged so if want to learn more about Anker or the battery pack we will
link to them down below so you guys think I hope you enjoy it's a new kind
of video for us I really want to make it as epic as possible until next time I'm
Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo hope you guys enjoyed the review none of our
incredible aerial shots or car tracking shots could be possible without the
incredibly awesome and talented people at drone gear if you wanna check out their
channel link here they also did a BTS video behind-the-scenes of our shoot day
with them we'll link to that down below 
It's been about two months since the
Apple Watch Series 3 hit and during that time I've had it on my wrist almost
every single day so I wanted to do a full review of the Apple Watch we didn't
do a review when it first came out I wanted to get a chance to know it a
little better see if there were any giant differences. Before I jump into
that I want to talk a little bit about smart watches in general I am a ball a
conflicted emotion when it comes to these little computers on my wrist part
of me wants to be like what's the point apps on your wrist are stupid they're
slow they're hard to launch and it just as easy to look at my phone if all I need to see 
its a notification the other part of me when I don't wear a Smart Watch super
misses it and I'm not sure which side is winning so my approach with smart
watches is kind of like a question mark are they useful? Sometimes,
are they not useful? Yeah probably but the Apple Watch Series 3 does
bring something new that takes it one step closer to actual utility and that's
LTE availability you can tell you've got an LTE model by the real red on the
crown and that's pretty much the only way you can tell you've got an Apple
Watch Series 3 as opposed to the Apple Watch Series 2 or really the original
Apple Watch. So a couple things I really like about this series 3 I think
Apple improved over previous versions that is battery life hot damn is battery
life good I went three days without charging the Apple Watch by time one day
went by I used about 30% so 30% each day is pretty awesome. It's going for about 7:00
a.m. until about 10:00 p.m. the big caveat though if you have LTE turned on
or at least LTE active so if you leave your phone at home it'll detect that and
I'll turn the LTE modem on battery life with LTE is not great I did a test of
able to make a one-hour phone call on the watch with LTE and that drained the
battery from complete to zero. If you've got LTE on and just like out walking in
the park or something you can generally get through maybe about five to six
hours away before the battery life is gonna come pretty close to dead but I
don't think the use case is most people using LTE all the time
I think it's using LTE when you're going for a run you're going for swim or doing
a workout that's when you want have the benefit of having
LTE on those kind of things it works pretty well. One of the big benefits of
LTE and this wasn't there at launch actually was the ability to stream Apple
Music to wireless headphones when you don't have your phone near you and I
tried it paired it with some AirPods it worked really well as I went for my run
I could ask whatever song I wanted to play I could play playlist anything I
wanted to do anything I could do with Apple Music for my phone I could just do
with my watch. And if music is something that's really important to you and maybe
you wanna listen to music at home or by your bedside I want to thank the folks
at iHome for sponsoring this video making it possible in particular their IAVS 16 and this thing does absolutely everything it's an alarm clock it's got
alexa built-in it's got a USB port on the back for charging your Apple Watch or whatever else you want to charge and most importantly I think it addresses the big
shortcoming with an Amazon Echo device they don't have a screen so if you have
an alarm set you wake up in the middle of night you want to know what time it
is you got to ask it and it's loud and could wake up the person sleeping next to you
this has a screen built-in it's got really cool LED lights that will glow
when you ask Alexa question it does everything in a really nice small
compact footprint I'll link to it down below if you want to check it out. The
Apple Watch Series 3 seems geared towards the Fitbit crowd the folks that want a
SmartWatch that's geared towards workouts you've got a barometric altimeter in
here you've got new workout apps and make it easier it automatically detect
when you are working out. You got a revised heart rate sensor so if you need a watch to work out it's still probably the best going admitedly I should work
out a little bit more but when I did do the workout it worked out great when I'd
start working out and I forget to set my watch it would know and it would start
tracking and that was nice I liked the added heartrate stuff that it does. If
you are into working out then that might be a reason to get the Apple Watch
when it comes to me and fitness I'm generally only fitting this whole pizza
in my mouth. Some other nice things versus previous
versions this one's way faster the Apple Watch Series 1 was certainly
slow when launching the apps off the watch 2 got a little bit quicker. The jump
from two to three though seems like it three or four times as fast if you want
to launch apps and speaking of apps I don't I don't use them on a smart watch I
think it's cumbersome to find them when they launch they're not that useful it's
easier for me just to look at my phone the only time I really ever use apps to
check like a football score or something on ESPN but that was pretty
much it for me. My use case for the watch is generally notifications being able to talk
to Siri and she'll now talk back to you with the Apple Watch Series 3 which
is nice and then being able to make an occasional phone call on LTE using a
speakerphone. So maybe for me the series 3 isn't necessary most of those things I
could do on series 2 but being able to have LTE has been nice for that peace of
mind but all that peace of mind is damn expensive you're starting at four
hundred bucks to get a watch with LTE then it's depending on your carrier about ten
bucks a month for the LTE service then you gotta have an iPhone to go along
with that by the time you get all this stuff together if you've got a new
generation iPhone you're looking at like 1500 bucks just to get out the door and
that's a lot of money to have freedom from your phone it's also kind of weird
that Apple's trying to sell you on freedom from your phone while also
trying to sell you a phone. All right so who is the Apple Watch Series 3
for? First if you already know you're an Apple Watch fan and you want to upgrade
then yeah you're gonna do it anyway for coming from the first gen Apple
Watch it's gonna be a gigantic update for you not only for battery life but
for speed and overall OS and software improvements it's a gigantic improvement. If you're coming from a Series 2 I mean other than LTE there's very little
difference here there's some new band colors but you can you can just buy
those from the Apple Store or buy a ton of third-party bands from Amazon that's
who the watch is for other than that I'm not sure who the target market is I like
it I don't love it kind of sums up my apathy in general toward smartwatches
and not just the Apple Watch and I think having worn Android Wear for years
now the OS that Apple's got on the Apple watch called watch OS it's way better and more
intuitive than Android Wear but at their heart they both do the same thing. And if
that same thing that it does is for you then great if it doesn't you can skip it
wait for next gen and hopefully we'll see a design change and maybe a little
round screen or these sort of look noticeably different than the very first
version that hit. All right so that's the Apple Watch Series 3 it's kind
of the same thoughts I've had for one and two it's probably the best
SmartWatch out there whether or not you need a SmartWatch or you want a SmartWatch it all comes down to your personal usage if you want the latest from Apple you can get
it if you're a workout fanatic you wanna be able to track your heart rate a
little bit better maybe you run up in the mountains I don't want to know your
altitude it's nice to have if you're coming from the first gen watch and you
want the waterproofing and you want the speed nice to have that there as well if
you're rocking a series 2 I think stick with your series 2 for another year
perhaps your patience will be rewarded and let me know what you guys think did
you buy a series 3 if you did why you're using LTE till next time I'm Jon
Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo talk to you guys in the next video 
so I get excited for unboxings in general I'm pretty excited guy but some I get beyond jazz 4 and you game consoles are those they happen like twice a decade we've got the latest from Nintendo this is a switch it's a combination of everything they've learned from the original NES all the way on down past the Wii U which I guess you could kind of call the original switch so what we have right here this $300 portable hybrid console which I am unhealthily excited to play which is mostly at this point my Sablan just like a $300 Zelda machine which we've got because I've really jazzed to play that and also I know you see it in the frame I have the strategy guide for Zelda here you can judge me but it's open-world now so okay enough of that here is the Nintendo switch box so two different versions you can get one with neon joy con and joy con is when Tendo is calling the little controller things on the end of the console that come on and off open it up and looks kind of similar like a tablet unboxing which I guess it is here is the switch itself and tend to switch on the back it's a 6.2 inch LCD display it's 1280 by 720 so it's a 720 screen but when you throw it in a doc you can get your gameplay up to 1080p your games are gonna be stored on 32 gigs of internal storage in here but also you can pop it on micro SD card and be good to go ah it's surprising how light and thin this thing is for what it does that's being powered by a modified version of NVIDIA Tegra x1 battery life is like all over the board Nintendo claims from their own site two and a half hours to 6 hours so it's a big shrug emoji for how long this is gonna last but you want to charge it you can do it via USB type-c so no more weird proprietary connectors from Nintendo let's keep digging in we've got Greyjoy con number one and these are teeny tiny little controllers and first impression they feel really good there's nice responsiveness buttons have nice click eNOS but man they are tiny everything feels pretty good so the idea behind these controllers I'm sure you guys know at this point mostly this is my first time really ever kind of holding a switch is you can play them like this think of them as like evolved tiny remotes they've got buttons on top there's also gonna be a dock inside you can connect them too but you can throw them right on the side of the console itself which I will do here very satisfying clicky noise which is important to have your clicking always to be satisfying and you can serve a game like you could on a any sort of tablet or or iPad or Android tablet with controllers on the side you can take this with you it also the kickstand so you can prop it up and use some gaming if you want to pull off the Droid condom use it as a screen you can do that we got more in the box wrist this up to leave you care about maybe don't we'll sort of haul through this we can get the important stuff this is the dock and you should be able to tell it does cuz it's called the dock tend to switch goes inside of here screamer's on the outside and it drop it in and it pushes in pretty easily and then this could connect to your TV and use like a traditional game console also inside we've got it's like a holster and you can connect the joique on to this thing and do some gaming normally but be aware this is not going to charge your joique on if you want to charge these you can this is a theme of the switch didn't those happy to tell you an accessory that looks like this that will charge a joy con otherwise these are only gonna charge and they're connected to the dock and the polar droidcon out push it but on the back slides out do that here as well you can also obviously buy more joy con I've got the neon options you can buy as well let's see how this feels when you go in here that's gonna give you more of a traditional game experience it feels Michael normal controller stuff like you'd get with an Xbox or a Playstation a little bit on organ ama if I definitely see this working and again if you want to use this the switch ought to stand you know it's been stand out you could be good to go dan comes out like that and then you can just get get your gaming on other things in the box quickly we got this thing these are little straps for your joy comm we got that thing it's another strap okay Jim my cables and USB type-c mostly I just want to get to playing Zelda which is a hole for me the whole point of this thing right now the the console itself kind of looks unremarkable I would take away this it is really thin and really light and it's kind of cool at the games now on game cards kind of like cartridges from from years past but again if you want expand the storage if you don't want to buy the cards you can just buy a a SD card and also kind of cool to bear in mind if you buy a game car like I've got here for Zelda it's not gonna like install on your console you actually play off the card so like if you buy a game for an Xbox or ps4 s you have to install and take up storage not so here with the Nintendo switch so you guys for watching I know you guys every choice of intend to switch unboxings thank you for flying Southwest and for watching TechnoBuffalo unboxing and tennis which I am just jazz this as a fan of Nintendo and a fan of gaming I'm really excited for from my ricard I were sent him in a launch title but I think Zelda will tide me over for a while I'm gonna get let me get playing thank you guys for watching hope you enjoyed these video thumbs up if you are a fan of Nintendo til next time I'm John Ranger you 
time flies in the world but in the tech
world that seems to go at hyperspeed the Galaxy S8 is almost a year old and the Galaxy S9 is
coming in about four to six weeks SO I thought it'd be fun to do a final
revisited a last look if you will at all the things the S8 brought to the table
and sort of the newness that it was and the climate that it came into the
smartphone world Samsung was right off the Note 7 debacle these things need
it to be a hit now while it is the end of the product life for the S8 it's not
necessarily the end of when you should buy it
they're gonna be crazy deals and then go on on the S9 comes up and the S9 looks
to be sort of an "S" version type upgrade sort of fix some small quibbles and
small complaints with the almost perfect Galaxy S8 and S8+ and for the sake of this
revisited I'm mostly just gonna say S8 the phones are pretty much identical
save for screen size and a little bit different size in battery
so first the S8 got rid of the edge version of phones we saw with the Galaxy S7 it
was just the S8 and they brought in beautifully marketed term infinity
display Samsung displays are absolutely incredible and they did a
gorgeous job this time around a big knock I had a previous Samsung displays they look great when you were indoors soon as you stepped outside in
direct sunlight they got completely washed out and almost invisible Samsung
fixed that in this time around the display gets incredibly bright don't buy
into the marketing hype of how many nits brightness it is that's really just how
bright one single pixel can get but from some real user standpoint you can use
this phone and outdoors these are obviously the best screens that Samsung had made before the Note came out they're pretty much identical but the
infinity display while looking nice it's still been far from perfect in my
use often times I was activating the edge panels by accident that was
relatively annoying to have I had to turn that off so I would accidentally
activate them it also makes the phone a little bit on the fragile since
the screen curves around and the front and back are completely coated in glass
in fact as we documented on video I cracked my S8+ pretty badly and I was
sitting down and it fell on a uncarpeted floor so I
don't like two and a half feet ish it fell and it would be shattered the
screen so it was definitely more fragile than those people like that fragility
also goes through on the back in fact I used my S8+ in the office without a
case as I mentioned in without and you skin on the back and you can see what
the back looks like it looks totally gross and disgusting so if you pick up
and current-gen Samsung phone whether it's the Note the S8 S8+ even the
S9 when it comes I recommend putting a Dbrand skin on that to keep the
scratches down and also give it some protection I'll link to it down below in
case you want to check those out it also marks the first time the Samsung got rid
of their capacitive buttons and opting for on-screen buttons for navigation I
love that change I also love that you can customize it a little bit whether or
not you want the backup on the left or the right give you more flexibility
than what you had with sort of those buttons that were always in the same area so
rounding out the awesomeness that the S8 was the cameras were absolute incredible
this was before the pixel 2 and before the iPhone X these were the camera
kings they were absolutely incredible obviously making do with single sensors
they did incredible job with portrait modes by that I just mean blurring the
background they brought a ton of effects the
pictures look gorgeous in almost any setting I'll be it a little bit
saturated but I tend to prefer it and they give you a lot of granular setting
if you want to get in and tweak those these cameras were beyond awesome and the
video side the video also looked great the microphone could use a little bit of
improvement I think that's the case with almost all smartphones but really good
I think Samsung did a really good job with biometrics obviously there wasn't some
sort of face ID type technology when this phone came out but the redundancy is absolutely incredible you've got iris scanning you've got kind of
a rudimentary face unlcok you've got pin or passcode you've got options and
different layers of course the fingerprint sensor on the back as well I
liked that there were options that you could pick and choose from but coming to
the things that I didn't like so speaking of biometrics the
fingerprint reader on the back I've talked about this at nauseam I'm not
gonna sort of harp on it I hated the location of the fingerprint sensor maybe you
guys had other issues said it didn't bother you with case on for me I did not
like the location in fact I never really used the finger reader because of that
another thing I didn't like was the single downward facing speaker often
found myself covering it with us playing games listening back to movies or just
watching content it's really annoying sort of location of it you're watching
something like this you're playing a driving game you gotta make sure you're
moving your finger all around and I should mention both of those things but
to be improved when the S9 finally hits and of course rounding out the other
stuff I didn't really like or even used Bixby and that that Bixby button
it's a goodbye to the S8 and the S8+ it's an incredible phone and if you
have one it'll probably be good to even skip the S9 and wait until the S10 hits
but it's got great battery life the screen is incredible the cameras great
on it have that fast charging it's USB-C everything about these phones I've
absolutely loved I don't want some sort of pour one out for the S8 as sort of it
gets overshadowed very soon by the S9 did you pick up an S8 you guys upgrade
from an S8 are you waiting for the price drop when the S9 hits to pick one of
these suckers up if you like these final revisited let us know give the video a
thumbs up and of course subscribe and next to it little bell hit that so you
get notified when new videos are coming we have a ton of awesome things coming
up including some flagship vs. and some pretty cool car stuff that should be
hitting your sub box soon until next time Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo you 
I've always been open on this channel I know it's a tech channel but you guys have gotten to know me over the years I've shared big life news I shared when I got married when I had kids when techni Buffalo was launching you know when they launched failed and this is probably the most personal video I've ever done and then something just came from wanting to know who I am sort of where I come from my whole life I have always looked culturally ambiguous when I was younger and I was outside more often a little Tanner people were sure I was Puerto Rican or Italian or more recently that I was dude from grand theft auto 5 and I got older and saw less sunlight people just assumed I was I was Russian or somewhere some from somewhere in Europe and I always wanted to know who I was especially as I became a father and like kids start to ask questions you know who are they I wanted to know so about six months ago I started a research project I just kind of kept to myself to try and see if I could find records on my family and as far back as I could find was my great-grandparents in the earlier part of the 20th century emigrating from Eastern Europe and the records that I had was actually came through Ellis Island actually found my original last name was not written jure it was read a chanc off and it got changed at Ellis Island - Rhett injure half my family evidently their last name went to Cherry and half turned into Rhett injure it's funny because my mom's name was sherry so she theoretically could have been been chery chery previously and before that immigration I can't find any records of any of my ancestors so I wanted to know who I am it's decided to do a 23andme test if you haven't done janek tests I always thought that it was like gotta take blood and send it in or sending urine or something weird gross and invasive turns I just got a little vial like that biggie just spittin it and then you close it up and there's a label yes you send it in you log in online to get an email unlike couple weeks later you get an email with your results and that was really it I also nervous open this up I'm not gonna lie and actually before I opened it up I put out a tweet that was like hey I did a 23andme test something you guys want to know about and there was a pretty overwhelming response yes which is cool this is a tech channel I guess there's a lot of tech that goes into testing your genetics um folks 23andme saw the tweet and they're like hey if we're gonna do a video can we sponsor it so I was like sure I'm gonna do it don't do the video anyway I'm gonna say what I'm gonna say so thanks 23andme for actually actually sponsoring this so here are my results and before I before I give you my results taking guesses put in the comments before I get to this what do you think I am there were no surprises in my ancestry I was 100 or M 100% European I thought that would have been a mix somewhere on my moms or dads side mixed with something but turns out 100% so that was kind of interesting I wish I could find further genetic history of those results at which I could sort of see you know exactly we're in Europe I believe it's Eastern Europe you know Russia Poland Czechoslovakia is always sort of where I've been told my family came from but it was a really interesting process and self-discovery like for me alright so if you don't know about genes you haven't taken that class that or you forgot you have 23 chromosomes was actually where that like 23andme came from 22 of your 23 chromosomes come from your ancestors so aside from all the ancestry stuff they also offer genetic testing to help figure out what you can potentially be predisposed to it's kind of a cool test I did it if you want to have it done 23andme offers it as well so as I was going through and doing this test the folks at the office here we're super interested as well and they wanted to do the tests and most of them wanted to share their stories too about who they are who they thought they were and what they ended up being so give that a watch and maybe you guys can discover something different about yourselves and if you want to try 23andme for yourself or give it as a gift to someone they give us a code it's 23 me complex checked on Buffalo get discounts on all different services that they offer it's really cool I feel better knowing who I am and I know maybe you guys might feel cool about it as well so here's the office and sort of a pretty interesting self discovery hey guys I'm Jesse Ortiz I'm the social media guy here at TechnoBuffalo so when you angrily tweet at us about something you don't like I'm the one happily responding to you but before I did this test I was really really interested I come from a Mexican family both parents are andris that Mexican but I was interested in like what if there's anything else in there I'm I was actually really surprised with the results because I actually got 46% European but it breaks down to being Spanish so I'm 46 percent Spanish while only 41 point 9 so 42 percent native which is Mexican so if they're interesting to see that I have a higher percentage Spanish than Mexican which I expect it to be like 100% Mexican like they would only be the one trait which is interesting and the only other percentage I had was 6.4 percent African which is really interesting coming from the fact that I thought I was gonna be like a Honduras ed native and that was it so it's really cool I really enjoyed this hey what's up my name is Danny Cepeda and I'm one of the editors here at techni Buffalo if you've been on the site you've probably read some of my articles and I'm one of the guys that took the 23andme test and I'm Mexican my mom from Mexico my dad's from Mexico but aside from that I'm not really aware of my genealogy so I was very interested in finding out about that so when I got the results back it turns out much more diverse than I thought I was I'm obviously Mexican Native American and I'm also southern European which means I'm have some Spanish in me and there's even some Asian African and Jewish parts in my genealogy as I had no idea that I was brothers related to that so that's pretty cool and yeah everyone I'm Matt Gonzalez and I'm a video director here at TechnoBuffalo so I always knew that I was half European and half Mexican but I didn't really know how that broke down I didn't know exactly where I was from so it's interesting to see the results especially because on my dad's side who is Mexican he doesn't know his dad so really it's a complete mystery I don't know anything about that side of the family so it turns out after getting the results I'm very European about 75% the biggest portion is British and Irish that is on my mom's side and the other portion is Mexican but it's mainly Spanish so that was very interesting to me I thought there was more native in there but that's only about 15 percent so this test was this test was good I liked finding out exactly what it was and I think I think we're gonna have to buy more of these for my family hey I'm Marklin Sangin and I'm the creative director here at TechnoBuffalo and growing up I grew up in the Philippines born and raised there ever since then like my parents had told me I you know 100% Filipino after taking a test with 23andme it's true like there's nothing different than what they told me when I was a kid I'm according to my DNA result I am 98.3% East Asian and Native American but 91 percent of that is Southeast Asian where essentially that's where the Philippines is technically so I guess my parents weren't lying so so if this sounds interesting you and you want to test your theory on on who you are who you thought you were or see if all of your grandparents were telling you the actual truth on where you came from we got a code 23 we hooked us up so go 223 me calm select TechnoBuffalo this counts there and all their services good through January 31st it's an awesome gift I'm gonna give it to my wife she was really curious after seeing my results on who she is and if you're open to sharing your story and sharing who you are I would love to know thinkin sort of makes people unique who they are and where they came from so leave in the comments or send me a message on Twitter I'll keep the thread active and I'll try to keep coming back to check hope you guys enjoyed totally different sila video but it was one of the most personal videos that i've ever done sort of it's Who I am on like a genetic level I hope you guys enjoyed if you like these more personal style videos let us know in the comments also down below and of course subscribe and hit the little bell faint notifications when new videos are coming up until next time I am a hundred percent European Jon Rhett injure and I'll see you the next video [Music] 
[Music] [Applause] [Music] so this is the sony bravia a one-year and check out those black levels in the intro it's clearly an OLED TV yeah I love Sony sets I bought a 75 inch z9t for my house there's a ton of Technology but there's something unique about this set that makes it stand apart from anything else out there it's their acoustic surface technology essentially the entire screen is the speaker I know that sounds bizarre but there's actually actuators in the back of the screen that's gonna vibrate the glass and turn the entire 65 inch or 55 inch just heading what side you get into the speaker and it gets even crazier than that it'll actually follow the sound so if you're watching like an action movie and there's a shot fired on the left it'll sound like it's coming from the left and you look at that technology and you figure it's gonna sound not good kind of like we did but it sounds incredible to effect you might not need a sound bar even external surround sound the speakers on this thing are that good I just want to get that out of the way at the beginning because it is an incredible minute technology to actually see so some back story we've had the same four case set of techni Buffalo offices for about four to five years looking a little dingy pictures weren't looking so good we use it almost every day for video games for watching back videos and sort of watching TV and I wanted a to upgrade our set here and being a big Sony fan want to take a look and obviously the OLED set from Sony so Sony offer to send this one to take a look at so the reason that I bought a is e9d I'm really a big fan of their x1 Xtreme processor most of the TV that I watch is sports and if I'm playing video games it's usually FPS or sports video games it does an incredible job with things with fast motion you don't really think that much about the processor in your TV but it's important when you're doing a lot of things with huge amount of playback I also really liked it's powered by Android TV it makes it really easy to set up I always say for streaming it's gonna work really well but of course it's got inputs galore you can plug in whatever you want but I did like having Android TV as the brains of the set you also can get a couple other cool stuff we're gonna get Google assistant built-in for the remote wood you can just just talk and have it play some TechnoBuffalo videos from YouTube for example so a lot of old lets of taking kind of unique design approaches some are crazy thin some are gigantic so they took a bit of a minimalistic approach here the TV itself looks like it's floating it's because of the stand in the back so that's where all of your input and i/o is going to live and I had some concern about being able to wall mount the set because we're gonna wall mount two here in the office with that giant stand and that's where all the brains of the set are going to live and it folds down almost flat so you can sort of put the TV almost flush on the wall which was super important to me the other stuff you'd expect from a flagship oh let's set is there you've got 4k obviously you've got HDR support for both formats and the picture just looks incredible and that's why I spent my own money for a sony TV I just think the picture quality looks incredible I think looks better than anything else out there colours pop the black pebbles look incredible watching sports on this thing is like being at the stadium I can't overstate that enough the difference here is huge if you remember when you first started looking at HD content from standard def it was incredible you can see the grass on the field it's almost that big a jump here from regular HD to what you get with OLED that's absolutely incredible another reason the a1e is an incredible TV actually gets plenty bright so if you want to put it up in a bright room with a lot of windows picture is not going to be washed out a lot of oh let's have that problem that's another reason that I personally spent my money for a sony set they do an incredible job with brightness and that transferred over to their OLED sets had a chance take a look at this when it first launched actually at CES 2017 and the picture quality looked good it was her stock footage I want to see what it looked like actually just watching back stuff anything I did looked awesome from from YouTube videos to gaming to sports to anything you watch back looks good you can also stream obviously the forecast stuff because Android TV powered so last bit of tech that I really liked about the Sony sets there triluminos display it just makes the colors look really good I could get into the tech side of it but it just means the colors are gonna pop more even more so than on a comparable all that set by another maker if you're looking for a flagship OLED set you don't want to break the bank you want one in varying sizes it's actually available in 55 65 or 77 inches I really recommend looking at Sony this was out when I bought my z 9d I would have I would have gone for the a1 either picture quality is just insane an acoustic technology that turns the screen into a speaker's I'm you're a tech guy is really cool it something you have to hear to experience it so obviously being OLED in a flagship it's not the cheapest set out there but it's comparable with other flagship OLED sets will link to it down below in case you want to check out the pricing I'm kind of gushing about the set maybe it's my sony tv fanboy I buy a new TV every like eight years so I did a ton of research and I just fell in love the combination of technology and design from Sony they're obviously there are a lot of other good OLED sets out there but for my money i legit put it behind the Sony tech because I trusted it and I think you guys if you're looking for an OLED set you might want to consider the a1 EE as well so we're planning on doing a lot more TV reviews coming into the new year if you don't want to miss those hit the bell icon to get alerts or new videos come up what do guys think about oled sets in general i'm a huge fan of the black levels are you upgrading let us know in the comments down below until next time Jon render from TechnoBuffalo [Music] you 
there's a no date we finally get a chance to take a look at it today there's a lot of stuff going into this device and a couple things that make it unique from previous and no devices first notice it's got two cameras it's got a telephoto and a wide-angle and both of which actually have optical image stabilization Ram has been improved from four to six gigs and of course since the notes of ice there's an S Pen living on the bottom right I see 68 as well so you can get it wet and be okay or maybe you want to take notes underwater a couple cool things Samsung did with software they talking about how to notice all about productivity there's nothing called apps pairing in edge panels you can take two apps really whichever apps you want create one icon and when you click it in the edge panel it'll launch both apps for you so for me that would be something like Gmail and Chrome but maybe it's like a dialer and calendar for you it just saves the time having to go through and pick the apps and set it up yourself run me out to the rest of the specs Snapdragon 835 Rams gone up from four gigs to six there's fifty four gigs of internal storage of course that's expandable with micro sd in the US the colors you're getting at least right now are midnight black and Orchard gray other parts the rope it doesn't get this beautiful deep sea blue and there's a maple gold color as well and I feel like something I got to mention now it is headphone jack is still here and inside the box features have headphones that are tuned by AKG you should get a nice sounding earbud right inside the box of course other stuff you'd expect to be here USB see he's got fast charging wireless charging and ip68 on the entire device the screen here of course the Samsung screens that looks incredible if there's Super AMOLED technology it's 6.3 inch here so point one inches vary on what you get with the Galaxy S a plus in the hand the phone has a bit of difference feel it feels a little heavier than what you get with the Galaxy s8 line of phones is a thirty three hundred million power battery in here so it's a little bit bigger on the battery side I like the way this if I feel a little more blockers and you get with the s8 or the SI plus but overall the phone feels nice in the hand and you're getting a big 6.3 inch screen and not like what used to be a Galaxy mega size package so big screen small package and of course infinity display here as well this is a Galaxy Note 8 is it can attempt to upgrade up from a Galaxy s8 or as a plus to shy away from picking up the latest from Apple so relook to be a really nice phone in a nice package but of course when we get it back in the studio we will test it anything you guys want to know about the device leave their comments down below be sure to answer and make sure we focus on that in the full review pre-orders are going to start August 24th and devices will be in stores on September 15 so next time genre enjoy some TechnoBuffalo [Music] you 
few things in the tech world are as recognizable or sparked more nostalgia than the keyboard on a blackberry and that is still a thing that is out and exists so like you to meet the latest from blackberry this is the key one [Music] they've ditched making their own harvest manufactured by TCL this is kind of a tricky phone to go in and talk about anybody who does a review and bash the phone for having physical keyboard I think is missing the point you buy this phone for the physical keyboard you know it's there when you buy it's not a surprise if you don't want a physical keyboard this looks very clearly not the phone for you so if you're still one of those people that's longing for physical tactile feel of buttons the BlackBerry key one is a surprisingly good phone and a really nice package so let's just start with the keyboard since that's really the big story here it looks and feels like a blackberry keyboard it's got pretty nice key throw it's extremely narrow though it's going to take you at least three days to get you typing on it you're going to have some fat finger syndrome fortunately though blackberry software is really good in recognizing when you're fat thumb hit the wrong key I also really liked you can set any key of the shortcuts they also worry about launching the after we're going to Instagram if you just set the letter I as your Instagram shortcut also degraded to the keyboard this is one of my favorite things about devices like the Priven other sort of modern Android blackberries you can use the keyboard to kind of scroll through a webpage that use your finger on the screen you just go to scroll down the keyboard naturally it feels really good I also like to integrate the fingerprint reader directly into the spacebar we see no had a weird fingerprint placement recently with modern devices that makes sense to me on the bottom of the phone my thumbs almost there I push it and it works and it works almost 100% of the time TCL did a really nice job on the build of this phone is it's a sick phone but it's kind of a weird thing to say but refreshingly thick let's say that GCL was brave nay it took courage to make a fixed phone I don't might have a little sticker device to have better battery life it typed a pretty big battery into a small phone it's a little bit over thirty five hundred million dollars you didn't get about twenty six hours of mixed use so easily a full day of however you decide to use your phone so I usually skip over speakers in review but I get hammered in the comments about it so speakers are awesome they're downward firing and they are stereo speakers and also speaking with speakers you are going to find it frequent five millimeter headset jack on the top and also USB si for charging on the bottom pretty much for at the time now when any processor and a phone is going to be quick enough I noticed no slowdown issues at all I tried some serious multitasking video watching HD video watching there's there was no slowdown here google has launched a huge ad campaign about the camera and their pixel line of phone and it's the sony AMX three seven eight sensor so let me just have you guessed for a second what sensor is in the key one it's exact same sensor that's in the pixel on phones you're getting really quality images pictures still come out looking awesome low lights really good outdoor visibility pictures look really crisp perhaps a little bit oversaturated side but I kind of tend to like that there towards more of what Samsung does at the processing then maybe what Google does it they're processing on the pixels I'm still reviewing the device to see how performs with my daily tasks usually like to test devices for a week before do the review first impressions have been surprisingly good alright so you met the BlackBerry key one what do you want it to focus on in the review and if you're going to start yelling at blackberry in the comments about why would you buy a phone with the keyboard no one's forcing to buy the song if you want to phone with the keyboard it's nice to have options I think that's what Android is about giving you options to find the phone that's right for you if a lot of people the key one might be the right phones for them it's got a good feel it's got a great camera decently priced and if you want to pick one up you can do so on May 31st let's let's end this with the comment of the day it comes from a galaxy s 8 review from fascinator who says holy they got out the smoke machine for this and I realized they had a smoke machine for Galaxy s8 review might seem like a backhanded compliment but honestly we just ordered one to try and use four cool b-roll and the first video we were doing since we had it so we tried it I think the shots came out really cool but certainly you guys thought we were up to should Nana Yuri in it if you want to follow basket a to the link to his channel down below so on be featured upcoming comments of the day pretty obvious just leave a comment down below so next time I'm Jon rendered TechnoBuffalo you 
so if you guys had a chance to check out our Tesla Model X review we had some insane drone aerial videography work done that we never could have done ourselves that's probably the video out of all the videos I've ever done that I'm the most proud of and we got those shots courtesy of the folks at drone gear and this is Alex from drone gear and in the comments that a lot of people are asking questions how we got those shots what you're we used so if you're good we just team up with Alex and drone gear and give you guys a chance to win your own ultimate drone pack again over three thousand dollars worth of stuff here this giveaway is gonna be open to anyone in the world and if you haven't checked out what Alex and drone gear have done you should check out their work because it is insanely beautiful and you can appreciate the level of professionalism and skill that goes into it so Alex are gonna tell you what this giant prize pack is so yes Jon mentioned we use this drone in the TechnoBuffalo Tesla Model X review video shoots 4k 60 which we used and you're gonna get insane shots with this you know you can use it commercial worthy we've got the Phantom Ford Probe plus with the built-in monitors and no cables needed no smart device ready to fly without your phone which is great we've got the Tiff's and filters guys need filters outside we've got not one but four high-capacity batteries so that's well over an hour of flight time which is what you want we've got to learn cube lights we've also got full terabyte hard drive to store all your footage plus 128 gig microSD card and a drone crates backpack I'm running out of breath John there's so much stuff but and the drone come on man in the drunk you're drunk you're hot so yeah so we want to make this open to anyone in the world if you want to be a drone pilot you maybe want to step up your YouTube game maybe you want even get into commercial work you could use this kit for it we made it really simple to answer hit the link down below a good article on TechnoBuffalo comedy widget there you can so we're also gonna link to the drone gear channel down below you should absolutely check them out I just it's just beautiful work and it looks incredible and I could appreciate the talent and skill that goes into something like that especially like the skill that I don't have at some time seems like magic so if you guys enjoy again all links will be down below thanks Alex from drone gear for hooking us up with this bad ass prize pack see you guys next one [Music] 
what's going on everybody I am in beautiful Berlin taking in the sights it's the Brandenburg Gate behind me but the beautiful scenery is not the only reason that I am here I came to check out Vash connected world well they're showing the future of the connected world what I want to see most was how they're gonna try to solve problems and ideal what they're probably you deal with on a daily basis things like trying to find parking spots and it's like dealing with traffic which is absolutely insane in Southern California and a lot of other problems that we can in everyday life so I'm gonna check out the scenes and I'm gonna show you what is new from Bosch connected worlds stay tuned [Music] so to answer these problems we've got Bosh's vision of essentially connected parking so a couple of cool things are going on here first the parking garage is actually what's made smart you pull your car in you poked your registered area you get out of your car you open your smartphone you push a button and your car goes and parks itself and then you come back and you push a button in your car comes back to you that is incredibly cool and there's actually a real live demo of that that was going on here this technology that's coming and it's not just coming to one manufacturer it's not just for Mercedes or BMW this technology that's going to work across all cars which is pretty awesome to see almost every form of locking is getting smart and my home I've got smart locks but car keys seem to have had some incredible staying power and Bosch is looking to pretty much kill them here with completely keyless cars and way it works pretty obviously it's gonna use your phone as a key we've seen that before but what Bosch is doing they're taking the problems associated with that and just kind of making them be like not big deal issues so first you could send keys to other people so if your wife or a valet want to drive the car you could send a key to them totally wirelessly through the cloud they'll get it on their phone it's gonna remember your seating location so it'll know that it's John's phone that's being paired at the car it'll go ahead and call my seat settings where they are so things like that are super cool and as you step away from the car and you leave what Bosch is calling the locking zones your car automatically lock you get a notification on your phone saying yeah your car is is indeed locked so you may have heard of blockchain regards to cryptocurrency but the blockchain tech is used for way more watch actually using it for the used car market to make sure that your odometer is actually accurate amount of miles you have on the car is what it's going to say every time to drive in your car it's going to add to the blockchain what your actual mileage is when you go to sell the car that is verifiable by somebody who wants to buy it and you get a little tag like this scan the code and then the person who purchases the car can actually know and verify that what you're telling them is honest and right pretty cool so I'm just nonchalantly hanging out in ni 3 but I Drive an EEV at home and anybody who's driven an Eevee knows there's a problem with having like 30 different providers for different stations and you got to carry four or five different RFID tags you've got different apps on your phone it's really annoying and cumbersome to just do simple things like charge your car when you got to get somewhere another way problems are being solved Bosch is actually taking the majority of those OMS that run the charging stations and especially in Europe and they're making one app that can control everything for you and they're gonna handle all the backend stuff you just roll up to a station use your one app and charge your car it's a pretty novel solution but it's crazy a thing like something like that didn't exist talked a lot about my family I have two kids at home for and two what's crazy about seeing all the stuff here Bosch connector world it's all on the cusp of happening my kids are probably never going to drive a car they're probably never be behind the wheel of an automobile wheels William be a thing that are there they're not gonna have to park their car they're gonna grow up in a world where all of this technology exists and it's awesome to be right at the cusp of when that paradigm shift is going to happen and events like this are what are going to change the world I think we are gonna completely take for granted in 10 or 15 years so what I show here is like a fraction of what's going on at Bosch connected world I filmed another video going to a lot more detail of things that are happening here it's a hackathon the connected parking I talked to some engineers that are making this magic happen if you want to learn more I think we definitely should link to the video down below it live on Basha channel we can just check out and learn way more about all the awesome stuff that's going on here at Bosch connecting worlds I'll be the same [Music] 
the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s plus are
joining like a Freddy vs. Jason sequel and a good video game movie and the list
of things that are never going to be happening today Apple took the wraps off
the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus the little brothers perhaps to the flagship
iPhone 10 so let me tell you a little bit about the 8 and the 8 plus first
there's kind of a newish design aesthetically the phones look the same
they still have the touch ID button the same bezels but now they're made of
glass to support wireless charging which I give Apple credit for using the Qi
standard and I've been saying for years please give me a wireless charging and
Apple now after years of asking finally delivered and again nice that it's Qi so
most of the wireless charges you may already have at home will work the
screen size is staying the same 4.7 inch and 5.5 on the 8 and 8 plus respectively the
resolutions also appear to be staying the same if you want a higher res screen
and OLED technology you want to look towards the iPhone 10 so despite the
resolution not changing Apple is bringing the TrueTone display that they
debuted with the iPad Pro to the iPhone line so the screens and the pictures at
least should look better than last gens and these screens are gonna be wrapped
in three colors either silver space grey or a new gold new gold does look really
nice also new here Apple's got stereo
speakers that are 25% louder and supposedly deeper bass and powering the
new iPhone 8 and 8 plus is the not surprising Apple's A11 Bionic chip but what's
surprising it's the first Apple designed GPU and what that's going to mean you
should get about 70% faster performance than the last gen iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus
and that is a gigantic jump in performance so I mentioned these phones
sort of look the same and the cameras looked the same on both so the iPhone 8's
got a single sensor 12 megapixel where's the iPhone 8 plus has two
sensors both of which are 12 megapixel of course 8 plus is going to support portrait
mode but the 8 plus is also gonna support something new at least in beta
called portrait lighting where you can sort of simulated different lighting
environments from your phone it can do it live you can also take a picture
and sort of add those effects afterwards Apples claiming it's way more than just
a filter they also claim it's the best video that's going to be taken in the
smartphone slo-mo's gotten way better at 1080p you can go 240 frame
per second which is double the frame rate of the last gen overall the cameras
just look better other things you'd expect here support for LTE advanced
which is a huge deal as we start moving towards that 5g progression LTE advanced
they're going to sort of be the backbone of 5G what things are gonna fall back to
you want to have a phone that supports that so hats off to Apple for supporting
that other things you'd expect like Bluetooth 5.0 are here as well so
pricing and storage sizes so sizes are a bit different this generation it's
either 64 or 256 for both phones then whether or not you go for the 8 or the 8 plus
the 8's gonna start at $699 whereas the 8 plus is going 100 bucks more at $799
and you're gonna be able to pre-order in just a few days on September 15th and
shipping on my son's birthday September 22nd and of course don't forget about
the Big Brother the iPhone 10 coming in November pre-order starting in October
you're thinking that that might be the phone you want to get we have a whole
separate video on that I will link to it here and down below if you want to check
it out so iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus they look
like nominal improvements over what we have with the last gen and it's sort of been
true with the S line of phones this would have been an S phone had Apple not
decided to jump and just go for a new number but nice things are here you got
better speakers I got a presumably better display I would have liked higher
resolution I've got wireless charging and of course
the stuff that we liked last gen like dust and water resistance but is it
enough for you to pick up an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus these are not cheap phones and
stretch the imagination is it enough to get you back to Apple there's enough for
you to upgrade your last gen phone or you gonna skip this and wait for the
iPhone 10 I love to hear your thoughts on it I'm not sure what I'm gonna do I think I
got a wandering eye for that iPhone 10 but the iPhone 8 plus does have a bit of
appeal to me I like the fact that it's got a physical touch ID button I'm not
yet sold on facial unlocking with face ID anyway leave a comment down below
give you a thumbs up we appreciate it until next time I'm Jon Rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo 
we're here at CES 2018 checking out the Fisker emotion this is the latest generation of car from Fisker although it isn't the same company it's now Fisker inc so that karma that wasn't so successful yeah this is a different company altogether so the car isn't all-electric super sports sedan and it's rather striking swooping lines big capsule in the middle with a small trunk and hood huge wheels and tires crazy hinged doors this car is full of design there's still very much a prototype but Fisker said production plans are aiming for late 2019 and when it does come the company states a four hundred mile range and a $130,000 price tag this definitely isn't meant to be the cheapest car but an entry for those still hesitant with getting electric car if you can afford and of course now on the inside the emotions has screens everywhere in the front and back and in the back seat you have the option to get this huge monitor which is probably the biggest I've seen in any car and you have things like a glass roof bucket seats in the front and back the interior overall seemed like a nice place to be one interesting touch is the doors when getting inside I really thought it'd be a challenge because you have the doors right above you so you kind of have to duck down to get in but that's not really the case you can't stand up straight and then just get in the car like normal so even though the back door has this crazy hinge to open upwards there's still space to stand up and get out if the interior doesn't feel the most spacious but definitely more room than it seems looking from the outside but really the story here at least prank now is design design design the built in lidar is integrated into the body rather than just being plopped on the body lines flowed throughout the car the trunk swoops up to have an integrated spoiler the tires stick out in the back because quote they just look cool interesting design is everywhere with this car design isn't everything though and there's still a lot of questions about how this car will work and it's still a long road ahead for emotion but at least now we have an idea of what to expect so what do you think about the Fisker key motion be sure to let us know down below and also hit the subscribe button and hit the notification bill to see when new videos are up I don't think you all so much for watching I'm a kids also TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you next time [Music] 
E3 season is here in Southern
California it's nice to have a tradeshow close by and I'm really excited for this
year's show because I'm actually looking to get a new console i sat out buying
one last year I wanted to see what project Scorpio was going to end up being
I moved the past few months I bought my first 4k TV so I was really paying close
attention to which one was going to be right for me and I started doing research
on which one I wanted to buy as I watched Sony's and Microsoft's keynotes I
realized that maybe I'm not alone maybe you guys want to buy a new console - I'm
not really a hardcore gamer I casually like to play games I use my console a
lot for media streaming so maybe you're like me maybe you're more hardcore
gaming but either way this I made my decision for which console to buy let me
run through everything so price determining factor PS4 Pro it's $399 you
can walk into a store right now pick one up put in your bag go home start playing
tonight or or maybe like an hour from now depending on where you live I don't
know product scorpio is now called Xbox One X... x-x-box gonna set you back just
shy a $500 which was I believe the original Xbox one launch price but I
won't be available until November so you got to wait and even then I'll probably
be in short supply you're gonna have to fight some fights and parents for
Christmas gift it's not gonna be available until later
on the year which is a big thing it's not a game now November is very far away
I know for a lot of you guys game exclusives are the big determining
factor for which console you buy you don't care which one it is long it's got
the games you want of course both offer the typical cross-platform things like
Madden NBA 2k Call of Duty battlefield so a ton of exclusives especially on the
Sony side it's a ps4 Pro was announced last year we've spent a lot of time
there keynote focusing on games they also announced some exclusives earlier
in the year you got things like Death Sranding, God of War, Gran Turismo, Last
of Us, a surprisingly badass looking spider-man game and new DLC for
Uncharted Microsoft's less exclusive games at
least right now things like Forza crackdown and a new state of decay of
course other games like new Halo presumably coming Halo Wars - and I
loved original Halo Wars I think I might have been the only one but those sort of
Microsoft staples of course will be there as well so both our offer of
course arcade gaming and HDR support the xbox
one x has the ps4 beat though in most of the spec department specially raw specs
kind of guess you would expect because it's almost a year newer both consoles
feature octa-core processor the Xbox one is clocked a little bit higher at 2.3 vs
2.1 on the ps4 pro nominal but it is there so it comes to memory that's a
big deal for games on it certainly now but sort of later on in the compost life
span the Xbox one x has 12 gigs of GDDR5 the ps4 pro has 8 gigs of that same
gddr5 both consoles shipped at least right now with one terabyte of internal
storage but if you just plug in a lot of external hard drive options expand that
if you need so physical media I don't know where you guys fall on it whether
it's dead to you where you still collect them I've got some older blu-rays my
wedding movies on blu-ray so I like to have it but it's not a deciding factor
necessarily but oddly the ps4 pro can't support any of the new generation
blu-ray so the 4k and HDR blu-ray will not play on the ps4 pro even though Sony
is one of the heads of the blu-ray consortium the Xbox one X on the other hand
can play any blu-ray you can find put it in 4k HDR and it'll play so that may
factor into your decision so if you're coming from a legacy console you've got
a Xbox 360 or ps3 or older backwards compatibility might be something you
want to consider so putting a physical disk in the ps4 Pro from any other
generation console is not going to work Xbox One x different story support some
Xbox 360 games even going to support original Xbox games that list should be
growing but you don't know the full list right now so VR is an interesting one to
talk about maybe your team sells bar I think VR is the future or maybe you're
like Richard Hendricks you think it's a fad I'm not sure where you guys are on
that but a VR is what you guys are looking for
playstaion 4 is going to be your only choice it offers a really
well-rounded VR experience games are already available it works well it's
pretty immersive and you can pick it up today we don't know Microsoft's going to do
for VR assumably it'll be something but as of right now
they don't have anything and not an option. So let's get to a
conclusion take its way decided because I'm I'm excited so the Xbox one X
certainly works done so 100 bucks is not anything to scoff at like I said on bit
more of a casual gamer than a hardcore gamer most of what I use my console
stores as a media streamer so I like the ability to play any type of blu-ray so
that it's active by 4k blu-rays or not in the Xbox one I also have a lot of
Xbox one accessories from my original Xbox want to use those same controllers
with it fact I prefer the way the controller feels of the Xbox one and now
the Xbox one X so for me I'm going to wait I'm gonna wait until November I'm
going to pick up an Xbox one X and be pretty damn excited about it what do you
guys think maybe I'm in minority of sort of being a casual gamer announcer as
hardcore I know maybe you guys are PC master-race I want to know tell me why
hope you guys enjoy a three coverage I love this time of year just fun sort of
season your stuff coming out it makes me happy and I enjoy it anyway again
comment down below if you guys enjoyed our E3 coverage I'm Jon Rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo 
Dell has long touted their XPS 13 is
kind of the gold standard for ultrabooks it's not gonna win over the hearts of
mobile gamers or video editors but for everyone else looking for a sleek laptop
that packs a punch Dell's got a lot they want to show you after using this thing
for about two weeks I have to say I think the XPS 13 is my favorite ultra
book that you can buy on the market right now
I'm Robert Rosenfeld TechnoBuffalo and here's why design is an important part
of any laptop but I think that Dell really did a great job with the design
of the XPS 13 it's made out of an all aluminum chassis it feels very premium
lightweight in the hands and they said that they were able to fit a 13-inch
screen and what would normally be an 11 inch laptop form factor and they were
able to do that though it did leave the laptop of a little chunky not very fat
but it's definitely not the thinnest kid on the block as much as I love the
design of the XPS 13 I'm not a fan of how hard it is to get this thing open
what looks like a little microscopic lip on the front is just a charging leg
which means that opening this thing is really a two-hand operation luckily once
I got the laptop open and I started using it my frustrations really started
to subside mainly because of that display Dell really prides themselves in
the whole XPS line are having these super thin almost bezel s infinity edge
displays and the one on the XPS 13 really does look fantastic our unit is
running at a resolution of 3200 by 1800 it's a quad HD touch display and
everything just looked really good on it video was super sharp and clear colors
really seemed to pop off the display text was sharp and I really just loved
using this display it also gets fairly bright up to 400 nits which made it
pretty usable outside and definitely super usable anywhere inside you're
getting a really beautiful display with almost no bezels but with having those
minimal bezels there were some compromises made Dell move the 720p
webcam that typically sits at the top display down to the bottom left hand
side which isn't a big deal for me but for anyone who does a lot of video
conferencing or Skype calls it's probably in the most unflattering
position possible this is an example of the video and audio quality only built
in HD webcam on the XPS 13 Audio sounds very muffled very tinny even a little
crackly video is awful inside the XPS 13 there's
kind of this carbon-fiber composite kind of soft touch it feels super
comfortable and it leaves you plenty of room for your wrist when you're typing
on it's pretty average keyboard I say average because the keyboard was just
okay for the most part it has good key spacing it's got some pretty decent key
travel though at times the keyboard just felt a little mushy for my liking
after a couple of days I got used to it and it felt a little bit better below
the keyboard is the XPS 13's pretty decent trackpad it's an okay size it
supports Windows 10 s precision drivers you can swipe and scroll and zoom to
your heart's content and we also had optioned  the Windows Hello compatible
fingerprint reader which for 25 bucks it was a no-brainer it worked
about 80 percent of the time but for the price point it's an easy to use add-on
that I definitely recommend before I jump into performance I just want to
mention something I kind of like about the XPS line in general and that is kind
of the price to performance ratio you can get an XPS 13 starting at $799 and
it's not going to be a powerhouse it's got an i3 it's got four gigs of RAM but
you can kind of customize along the way and add options and add a little bit
more price point to get yourself more of a significant computer it's kind of nice
that Dell allows for that customization that you can start at a low price point
and still get a really rock-solid computer and go all the way up to and i7
with a 512gb SSD and get a really beastly computer for a higher price it's
just nice that there's a lot of options along the way and I appreciate that but
going back to that beastly XPS 13 the review unit we have is pretty much
spec'd to the gills with the best of the best of Dell offers ours has an eighth
generation Core i7 processor 16 gigs of ram a 512 gigabyte nvme based SSD and
intel 620 integrated graphics so that last component might be a little
worrisome of course this isn't a gaming laptop it's not targeted to gamers
though I will say that in my testings with games and just performance overall
I was surprised how well the integrated graphics worked with that new eighth
generation i7 the XPS 13 was able to handle pretty much anything that I threw
at it throughout the day having that 16 gigs of ram is really
nice even for the heaviest of chrome users with lots of tabs open I didn't
feel like the machine was running slowly and having that 512 gigs of SSD storage
space made me feel like I wasn't gonna suffocate the machine by having a few
games installed or having a few movies on the drive I was able to jump between
programs like Photoshop and Excel and Word and Chrome and the XPS 13 just kind
of stood the test the time it handled anything that I
threw at it and it never really seemed to slow down or be bottleneck by
anything so it handled the typical daily workload really well but what about some
like gaming and video editing for an ultrabook
I was really happy with how it handled things like editing in Premiere Pro I
was able to add at 1080p footage on this thing just fine full play about quality
no timeline issues it just worked out really well it's not gonna handle 4k
video editing but again this is an ultrabook so keep your expectations to
what this thing actually is of course rocket League is not a game that's super
GPU intensive and it's not gonna eat away and a lot of that graphics
processing power but I was still surprised how well it ran on this thing
I was able to run by default right out of the box at 1600 by 1900 at high
settings and got some really great frame rate throughout playing again the XPS 13
is a very solid contender in almost all the categories I've talked about before
but battery life is where this thing truly shines during my testing browsing
the web watching some videos on this thing I never once worried about
draining the battery and I was able easily to make it through an 8 to 10
hour day without having to plug this thing in to charge and if you're even
lighter user someone who just occasionally browses the web and checks
email I think you can make it 2 days on this battery so battery life is great
but when you're ready to charge the XPS 13 you might kind of look at the eye on
this thing and start to scratch your head a little bit on one side you have a
full-size USB 3 port and an SD card slot which is fantastic and on the other side
you have a battery indicator light a headphone jack another USB 3 port a USB
C port and then something that brings sadness to my heart Dell's proprietary
charging port the speakers on the XPS 13 are just okay they get decently loud
they give a little bit of volume and a little bit of bass but I think you're
gonna have a much better time plugging in a good pair of headphones to this
thing or using its built-in bluetooth 4.1 to connect in even better pair of
headphones to get a better overall sound experience and if you're in the market
for a good pair of wireless bluetooth headphones the fine folks at Sennheiser
sponsored this video and they also sent over their 4.50 Bluetooth noise
cancelling headphones these things are bluetooth noise cancelling headphones
with phenomenal battery life you could use them for up to 25 hours without that
noise canceling feature and up to 19 hours if you have it turned on they have
Bluetooth 4.0 built in and NFC for easy pairing and exceptional sound quality as
well as just a super lightweight foldable and
to carry around with you design I wore these things for a long time during my
testing they were very comfortable on my ear I didn't get that weird kind of
pressure sensation that you get when wearing some headphones they also have
track controls on the side of the headphone so you can adjust the volume
of the current track you listening to and also skip forward and back as needed
and they also have a detachable cable so if you want to listen to these things
plugged in and wired you can totally do that but if you want that fully wireless
experience you can unplug that cable and do that as well if you guys want to
learn more about these headphones check out the link below in the video
description alright so let's take a step back and kind of wrap things up it's got
great build quality really solid performance and the battery life on this
thing is phenomenal and over my days of testing I really just enjoyed using this
laptop so what do you guys think of the Dell XPS 13 I know you guys had a lot of
comments on my last video telling me to check this thing out so now that I did
what do you guys think is this gonna be your next contender for an ultrabook
leave your comment down below and let me know always appreciate doing these
videos for you guys thank you so much for watching
I'm Robert Rosenfeld from TechnoBuffalo see you guys in the next one you 
what's up everyone John render from TechnoBuffalo here and welcome to my house we're here for a reason for most of my adult life I have suffered really severely from insomnia I don't know what insomnia is it's not being able to sleep not be able to fall back asleep or any sort of sleep issues sort of classified under insomnia it's been a really hard for me to function as an adult that somebody who runs a business as a father for years it all started back actually when I first wanted to TechnoBuffalo so you guys haven't been following us for that long I would quit my job I had no safety net I had very little money I need to take up a little work we launched in the site crashed within 10 seconds mostly because I didn't know what it took to develop a website at the time and we were down for about six months before Tommy came back it Birds through all of our startup capital during that time we're really in danger of never even existing and I couldn't turn my mind off I was technical had to work I had no other options and ever since then I've had publicly doing before then I used to sleeps in like 2 p.m. classes and I was in school asleep was never an issue for me but something that I suffered with on and off now for the better part of nine years and that brings us this video I'll talk a lot on social media about having to deal with insomnia just to came back you guys to give me a lot of awesome suggestions things I've tried the patch drinking more water exercise melatonin other questionably legal options to try before sleep and a lot of the things I have tried with varying results most of which are short-term success but nothing really long-term its are cured the issue so the folks from Beautyrest reached out the product called sleep tracker to try lets you subtract your sleep and I've tried other sleep products before I try things that I had to wear and become very self-conscious of wearing something well in quickly answer disrupts quickly if I would get anywhere so this actually goes underneath your mattress and if you sleep with the partner you can put under each side of the mattress and it can track pretty much everything to check your breathing check your heart rate can track your REM sleep through all the phases of sleep contract and they'll learn your sleep habits and give you advice and sort of let you know what you and what you're doing wrong and try and correct it so it's been kind of cool so they did sponsor this video those opinions are hunt to set my own there's a product that I legitimately need aren't that many products out there it's something I really wanted to try this is definitely one of them so thank you to them and I want to share with you guys my experiences with it and what's works and what's not work or they're not be able to sort of cure my insomniac a little bit so I don't think you can even see me what it is right now about for the morning I got up maybe like 20 minutes ago I haven't able to fall back asleep since so all right so just woke up I was up twice a night once I woke up and walked like 5:30 I - I look up string so that was on each time it took mean it looks like 40 minutes or so to go back to sleep but I did fall back asleep entually so that's the wind as opposed some nights where I just kind of roll around and watch the clock ultimately I'll just go downstairs and start work or watch TV or something so looks like my sleep was pretty efficient it was more efficient than I thought it was going to be it's kind of interesting scale to actually quantify not just how long I slept actually what kind of sleep I had so I was surprised using the app for about the five nights that I've been using it I actually slept more than I thought I did I'm a very light sleeper I'm not getting that much heavier REM sleep it's been helpful to know when I wake up and what I'm falling back to sleep it's really my issue I did fall asleep okay right away but then at two kids at home one crying I've got to get up in the night a Bing Elvis or see a chart and get advice for when to go to sleep have the app alert me when it's a good time for me to wake up but I've had my optimal Sleep Number that's been really helpful it has not cured my insomnia which is something I was sort of hoping to get advice - how to get to that point but has made it better like I said it comes in way serve now it's undulating back up I was where I'm having trouble sleeping again but being aware the type of sleep I'm getting it's really helping me find out what I can correct now that I know what the problem is it's not just general insomnia I can try and correct it I know that it's staying asleep I know it's sort of exiting REM sleep too early are things that are really useful to me did I suffer from insomnia if you have an issue ever like I've been trying the product it's really easy to install you just slide each side on to your bed and plug it into a box plug into the wall and that's really it but you're like six minutes to install it all go through an app for either iOS or Android hope you guys enjoyed this little inside looking to my life and my house if you like this personal style you let me know those and I got a lot of issues I'm willing to share until next time i'm john wright here from [Music] you [Music] 
hey everyone I'm Matt Gonzalez with TechnoBuffalo I recently moved to Southern California and since I'm in a new place I want to make sure that my apartment is safe and secure when I'm at work and now and about luckily Ness reached out about their new nest secure security system and sponsored this video and since I already use nest products this seemed like the perfect opportunity so in the box you'll get everything you need to get up and running you have the nest guard base station to detect motion sensors and to nest tags for disabling the alarm on the surface the whole system isn't too different from a traditional security system you have a keypad to into your code you have different arming modes for when you're at home or when you're away has a battery in case the power goes out and the detect sensors stick on your door window or on the wall to detect motion in a room what makes this different and better than those traditional systems is the amount of control you have and that starts with the app this all connects to the same nest app that you'd use for your thermostat or for your camera or any nest product and it connects easily by scanning barcodes on the back of the sensor and the base station and the tags and you follow the on-screen instructions it's pretty simple the guard station connects to your Wi-Fi network so you'll be connected and you have the option for five dollars a month or fifty dollars a year through t-mobile to have cellular connectivity so you'll never be offline like if the power goes out and if you'd like you can subscribe to professional 24/7 monitoring through monie security just for that added protection although neither of these options are required to use the net secure now in addition to the base station you have the detect motion sensors these can go on a door on a window or they can attach to the wall to detect motion in a room also they have a light built-in so if you're walking around in the middle of night so you have to go to the bathroom or something it will light up your path and you don't have to turn on the light and disturb someone else and the sensor has a button built-in with a feature called quiet open so say it's the middle of the night and you just need to go outside for some reason but your house is armed you don't really want to turn off the alarm but you still need to get outside you just push that button it lets you open the door and when you close it it gets armed again now once all the hardware is installed you can move to the app here you can set your passcode it can be whatever you'd like and you can change it at any time as well and to arm the system you just push the button on the base station and they have different modes for when you're at home or when you're leaving in the app though you can tailor each situation to your specific needs so for instance when I have the alarm set to a way I have motion detection turned on but I can easily turn that off and I have the alarm countdown set for 3 minutes so I don't have to be rushed to get out the door it's gonna give me plenty of time and I won't set off the alarm also most importantly to me is that if I forget to set the alarm which has happened a time or two when I leave it'll ping me on my phone and I can just set the alarm from there now in the app is where you're going to monitor everything that happens so if your system detects motion or it detects a door opening you're gonna get pinged on your phone also if you have an S cam it'll integrate seamlessly with your system so if it detects motion you'll also be able to watch what's going on inside your house when returning home the system comes with two Ness tags these are little chips that you can put on your keyring and instead of entering your code you just tap this on the base station and it'll disarm your system now what's great about these is you can give them to anyone so say you have someone that needs to access your house like a dog walker or a cleaner you can give them one of these tags and set a time for when they can actually access your home so if the dog walker needs to walk the dog at two o'clock they can access your house at two but at 2:30 the alarms gonna go off now probably my biggest concern when I unbox this is that I didn't think the alarm was going to be very loud I mean the base station is time but it's loud so four five hundred dollars although that's a bit on the higher side this is a relatively full-featured system as the system cysts now it will definitely bring you some security that everything at home is safe and if you already news nest products like I do it integrates seamlessly into the framework I'm already used to but anyways I want to thank you all so much for watching be sure to let us know down below in the comments what you think of the nest secure system and if you want to pick one up for yourself links are in the description again I'm Matt Gonzalez with TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you guys next time [Music] you [Music] 
so with iOS 11 Apple introduced a brand-new augmented reality framework the creatively called AR kit and the first app stick advantage is that new AR kit tech are starting to filter out so we play it with a ton you hear a TechnoBuffalo to bring you eight that are fun useful and kind of show off what the tech can do so we tell you and I think the top eight AR apps are all rights let's start off with measure kits it's a free app if ou you wanted to tape measure and if you want to use it as just an AR tape measure it works actually really well if you want to measure or anything you just use your phone with your tape measure at home but if you want to pay some money like $2.99 they're gonna supposedly unlock some more features and because I don't want you spending $2.99 of features that don't work we tested those features so it'll do things like trajectory to tell the distance of an object one of the coolest things reason I wanted to try it was it'll tell you how tall a person is you can use it to measure to measure person didn't work we're just kind of kind of a bummer and I included on this list I think it shows the potential of AR actually replacing physical tools you can measure things like cubes you can use a level all those things worked but the one I wanted to try again measuring a dude or or lady didn't quite function properly so I think for right now save yourself the three bucks and its use it as a tape measure and as technology gets better and you want to be able to measure a person then go ahead and in the box alright coming in at number two this one's existed in various AR formats for a while but now it got super legit it's not just for delicious meatballs anymore and Swedish Fish IKEA IKEA is in the game with a really awesome AR app called IKEA place it actually lets you put IKEA furniture in the real world space it was really cool to see if we wanted to buy a couch for a set look envision what are we going to look like here we want to sort of add chairs to different other sets we've got in the studio it's really cool and I picked it not only excited thought it was really useful but it shows a legitimate use of technology that can actually help technology not just for tech sake it's you go to an IKEA Story one and you know something's going to look in your home you had to buy it you had to either carry at home and then build it and see how it looks get it delivered now you can actually see it and be like oof I got bad taste or your wife can entire box the orange couch idea which has happened but now I wouldn't have had a have a couch delivered in that area I took games a ours pretty pretty fun for games as Pokemon go taught us this one is appropriately called stack AR if you've played the stack game it's it's the AR version of that it's free so you can now stack things in the AR you can sacks up on a desk you'd stack stuff on Bertos head you can stack stuff on your friend's head it's EXIF on on whatever you want it's a really fun game game was fun and fine without AR but it's there and you can you try it are so next one I think might be the coolest this is world brush and so on a very like high level you can take different kinds of brushes and you could paint in a real world and then after you're done drawing and painting your Matisse inspired masterpiece you can use your spoon around and actually view it in 3d it's really cool to see the app is also gonna serve tag stuff a GPS so if someone comes back to they can see what you drew other people because the Internet's a really friendly place can definitely like your artwork if you choose to let them do so they can like it they can not like it that you comment on it you know you look at sort of what things look like in the real world you had to draw it out on a flat surface or a model out it's for a CAD program but now you're gonna shoot your finger and a phone this and this best friends for life next app is gonna cost you that's 209 called sky guide AR and it gives you a guide to the sky obviously you hold your phone up it'll show you the constellations as things are happening it's a really cool way to sort of see the sky above you and know what's there if you're wondering what that blinking light is it'll tell you it's a plane not a star you're gonna have that really bright thing in the sky is as a planet with the North Star this will tell you it's only worth the money if your amateur astronomer or you want to be a mature astronomer or if you have a four-year-old who's fascinated with the Stars and why they are there then you're gonna want to give this app a shot again not three but it's not super expensive I think it's worth a try specially if you want to see what a Arc because I know you love free the next one is free this is hallo this is a pretty simple concept brings a our characters to like life on your desk or ever you want it to be you can pick superheroes my favorite was like the super swaggy spider-man and you can sort of interact with them you can put yourself in their it's again I keep bringing my kids into this but to let my kid have a conversation with spider-man was it was pretty cool to see to go wizards and other other characters you might want it's not like so useful i wouldn't pay for it but it's like a good like 10-minute killer if you're like oh man i got to wait for my wife to finish shopping give it a download and get some business ye spider-man so - good news bad news on this next one the good news it's free the bad news is gonna have to get your butt up off the chair it's called an AR runner and the name should probably give it away it makes you move and it makes you run it creates little dots and a course that you want to set out presumably outdoors got a lot of space indoors you can run from dot-to-dot and jump around and create different obstacles it's a fun way to get moving you're definitely gonna want to look up from your phone turn right into something like I did while I was trying this it didn't get it look some people do it outdoors because you're literally running around like this alright and last but definitely not least this is $0.99 well-spent and if you only pay money for one of the apps I mentioned make it Atlas and it's not like a like a Thomas guide come to life it's an atlas of the human body so being able to seed the nervous system the endocrine system see a skull and move it around they've got 3d renders and bodies of anything that you would want to see and learn it is awesome to see this and probably the coolest use of AR today and it probably doesn't need a are it could be awesome you could have done this without judgment the reality part of it it's just really cool from a science standpoint from a curious about the human body standpoint it's a really cool app I definitely recommend you give it a shot so before I end my top eight AR abs video I want to thank our sponsors and good people like Kingston and tell you a little bit about the bolt and the bolt is pretty cool it plugs into your lightning port it's really small it's not gonna create any sort of wiggle or waggle you put it on a table it's gonna sit flush they'll been 3264 twenty eight gigabytes sizes it's going to serve essentially as a backup for all your photos or videos you can take pictures or videos directly to the bolts you can save space on your phone you can backup certainly videos or pictures that you want it's really customizable the Volt is a really good way to go and I think I must have accessory for almost any iPhone regards whether or not you need more storage let's do it down below you want to check it out these are our top eight air apps probably couldn't make the list a lot longer because there are a ton out there pick some that were fun summer silly some that means you did you get your butt up off the couch and move but if we missed anything you think we should try leave the comments down below and let us know I will try your AR apps are using a are kid at all do you care did you even know your phone could do it I want to know your thoughts on it leave a comments down below give the video a thumbs up you always appreciate it until next time i'm john ranger from TechnoBuffalo [Music] 
So it's been four months since the Apple
Watch Series 3 hit and it's either been this on my wrist or my second-gen
Mote 360 depending on what phone I'm testing and it's been two months since I
last really filmed my thoughts on it I started using it a lot more and my use
case has changed in the past two months I started working out a lot more to talk
a lot about it from that perspective and also software updates have come so LTE
and the uses of LTE are now a little bit more than they were even just eight
weeks ago so if you're thinking about getting an Apple watch Series 3 or
maybe you're debating I'm not returning yours or selling yours stick around so
my general thoughts on smartwatches is still the same I am like
a ball of conflicted emotions about it and I feel like a hypocrite on one
hand I can't articulate the use of a smartwatch even I can't even say why
somebody needs a SmartWatch on the other hand when I'm not wearing one
I really miss notificatoins and you know things like knowing who's calling
have been very helpful to have Series 3 you can tell it's a series
3 at least with LTE buy the red dot on it and that LTE is a big difference
versus the series 2, the price entry here is high at 400 bucks before your
cellular plan to get an LTE model but you're getting a lot of watch for your
dollar so the good battery life has still been incredible I can easily get
through now almost four to five days on battery life when I travel I'm not gone
for a week I don't even bring my Apple Watch charger with me the caveat there is if
you're using LTE battery life is going to drain relatively fast two months ago
when I made an hour-long phone call only LTE it went from 100% to zero so now
there's been a few iterative software updates that have come and that one hour
that extended to about an hour and 20 minutes which is a big percentage-wise
increase so I'm gonna be honest I don't use apps on a SmartWatch I think they
are clunky I still think they load slow even though now they're kind of native
on the watch and they're credibly and useful especially just to pull out my
phone and open the app but they're there there if apps are important to generally
my app usage is limited to checking sports scores and generally I just ask
Siri what the score is and she'll now talk back to you it's still slow it's
not nearly as fast as asking phone so oftentimes I'm just asking my
phone to do stuff and that's really the case with the Apple watch so I've been
trying to get this this tub of fun into shape which is kind of what made me
think to do a four month later video with the Apple watch I've been using it as my
workout companion it's kind of interesting so first after being
relatively sedentary for like pretty much at rest the time I used to watch my
first real heavy cardio the watch asked me if I was okay I thought I was having
a heart attack which like which hurt me and also served as motivation but it's
been useful to have you sort of track how many calories I burned how long I've
been running if I'm staying at home doing like a Beachbody workout which is
which is what I'm trying to do don't laugh it's been helpful to see how long
I've been going for how much I've moved it's also good motivation to
try to close the rings so I've used an Apple watch it's what they use to
measure your movement your standing and your exercise so being able to try to
close those has been helpful what also has been helpful for me to measure my heart
rate and we give you a range of what your heart rate was at the lowest and
the highest what I buy the Apple watch series here again yeah probably I would
probably feel like a jerk for doing it but again I still like having that
SmartWatch on my wrist it is by no means a must-have by no
means a must-have companion even for an iPhone it's nice you can stream Apple
music now via LTE all those things are there but there's not a compelling
reason why you should buy it but a lot of you guys are so if you're
buying an Apple Watch what's your reason why you did it and I think most
importantly to that question are you actually using it for that reason I told
myself I was gonna work out a lot when I first bought it and it took me four
months to actually start doing it maybe I'm alone even leave in the comments down below
and let me know of course give the video a thumbs up we appreciate it hit subscribe
button that little bell notification next to it let you know we got new videos
coming up we got a ton of awesome  versus videos coming your way
until next time I'm Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo 
hey Siri hmm what's better the Google home max or the home pot I say get a home pod I just love the sound of it hey Google what's better the home pod or the Google home max hmm the Google home max is clearly the best okay that didn't work smart speakers are becoming ever more popular and now we actually have some that sound pretty good here we have the Apple home pod and the Google home max I'm gonna compare them the design the sound quality and the assistance built in and see which one is better but not only that which one you should actually buy the first thing you notice when looking at both these speakers is just the sheer difference in size the home acts is a huge speaker you can use it vertically or horizontally sits on this little rubber pad to minimize vibrations it has a fabric front it's made out of plastic but it's a very hefty hence solid speaker the home pod on the other hand is very small it's still pretty heavy but it's covered in a squishy fabric material and looks pretty much the same from any angle now as for controls on the actual device the whole max has a little touch bard that you can use to swipe and adjust for volume or tap it to play pods the home pod is similar there's a touchpad at the top it has dedicated volume controls that you can tap and in the middle you can tap for play pause or to activate Siri now in theory both of these controls are pretty much the same but in practice they work they work a little bit differently the home pod is much more responsive I found with the whole Mac you kinda have to play this guessing game when you touch it you don't know exactly where to go and sometimes it doesn't register your touch I don't have any of that with the home pod some other design notes though the home max has a built-in 3.5 millimeter jack it has a very easily removable power cable and USB ports and it has a dedicated mute switch something you don't get with the home pod from a design perspective both have advantages disadvantages but from a usability and what what I want to have in my house perspective I think the home pot takes it it's not that the home max is bad it's just the home pot is a little bit better sound is hard to judge what I think sounds good may not sound good to you so instead of just telling you what speaker I think sounds better I'm gonna tell you the differences in the sound the home max has two four and a half inch subs and 2.7 inch tweeters and this translates to very loud and very basic sound the max gets loud enough that I can't listen to it at full volume in fact if it's anything above 75% it starts to hurt a little bit the max only projects in one direction though so you'll probably want to put it bookcase or up against the wall but it does listen to its environment and kind of change itself so you'll get the best sound no matter where you put it the home pod even though it's quite a bit smaller has one sub and seven horn loaded tweeters so in this little package there's quite a lot it doesn't get quite as loud as the home max and one big difference the speakers are all around the home pod so you get 360 audio and like with the home max it listens and it adapts to its environment so you can put the speaker pretty much anywhere [Music] you [Music] for sound I think the biggest difference between the two is how they handle the high-end and how they handle the low-end the home acts tends to overshoot the high-end a little bit so you do get some distortion but it has really punchy bass the home pod on the other hand is kind of the opposite the high end is very crisp and clear and doesn't really have any Distortion and the low end well it doesn't have distortion it's not quite as boomy as what you get with the max I found the mids on both to be pretty similar they're not as crisp as you can get and there is some distortion there it's pretty even in that front one last thing about distortion though even though the home max does get very loud if you play it at its full volume it's definitely enough Distortion while the home pod you can crank all the way up and it still sounds good so when it comes to just pure accuracy and quality I'm gonna have to give this round to the home pod but like I said sound is a very subjective so what I like may not be what you like and you may love the beats by dre bass that you get with the home max it's really up to you so this round is somewhat of a tie probably the biggest debate between the home pod and the home max is Siri versus Google assistant and this reaches far beyond these two speakers but when you start to compare them there are some pretty big differences for basic tasks like weather setting alarms timers they handle that pretty much the same on both but when you get to more complicated and specific questions Google assistant just destroys Siri there's a certain line that you just can't cross with Siri as long as you don't Sirius pretty good but with Google it just handles everything pretty well there's one thing though and that's that the home pod has a six array microphone and it can hear you really well much better than the home max I could stand across the room speak in a normal voice anyway here we no problem even if there was music playing the home acts on the other hand even if there's nothing playing sometimes I'd have to do it two or three times and if there is music playing I'd have to shout I was very impressed with the home pod and I think Google needs to add more than just two microphones given that these are speakers it's important to talk about music and how you can pull it so only Google home max you can use pretty much any service you'd like except for Apple music on the home pod you can only use Apple music yes on the home pod you can use airplay and yes on the Google home acts you can use bluetooth but if you're just gonna control up your voice that's a very big distinction that you need to keep in mind Apple music is really the big discrepancy here if you use it then you'll probably want the home pod and if not the home max but when taking everything into account Google assistant is just plain better it can handle more complicated queries you can handle multiple voices sure it doesn't hear you as well but when it does hear you it just works in comparison it's almost a tie of which is better and it depends what category is most important to you if you like sound quality I would choose the home pod if you want say bigger speaker that's more bassy and go with the whole max and if the assistant is what's most important to you Google just wins here but because this is a vs. I'm not gonna leave it at a tie for me I'd have to choose the home pod I'm already an apple music subscriber I prefer the sound of the home pod it's significantly smaller which makes it easier to put in my home the basic questions is Siri work fine and it's fifty dollars cheaper at three hundred fifty dollars over the four hundred for the home max neither of these speakers are perfect but they're a step in the right direction of having great sounding home audio that you can talk to but be sure to let us know down below in the comments which one you would choose and why really interested to know if you enjoyed this video be sure to hit that like button and also subscribe and hit that notification bell so you can see when new videos are out I want to Q also much for watching again I'm Matt Gonzalez with TechnoBuffalo and I will see you next time [Music] you 
when it comes to flagship phone hands-on I'd like to do a dramatic intro orderly I tell you all about the history of Samsung S series devices from the first S to the eighth iteration but this thing's been leaked like crazy so meet your old friend the Galaxy s8 there's some stuff here that's new that maybe it didn't know about but if somebody who's had a chance actually holds the device let me tell you what it's like to hold feel what the experience is like with Samsung's latest flagship any discussion about the Samsung Galaxy S they should start and stop with the screen so the s8 got big it's a five point eight inch screen but it's not as giant as you might think in fact 83% of the entire front of the phone is that beautiful AMOLED plus display nothing on the specs she's going to jump out the story here is more of how these part two work together for the whole but just so you're aware Snapdragon 835 in the US XE knows variants elsewhere that 5.8 inch quad HD plus the resolution of 29 60 by 1440 that gives it a really solid 570 PPI when it comes to battery life at least now you expect seems like to be really thoroughly spent a good portion the presentation talking about their eight point battery safety test so they didn't squeeze a gigantic battery in here focus a lot on making the battery just last longer and is a 3000 milliamp hour battery in the galaxy Fe so the camera on the SI it's going to make you either happy or bit disappointed it's the same sensor we saw on the note 7 the same sensor that's sitting on probably the phone on your desk the s7 or the s7 edge it's still a really good 12 megapixel shooter but would have liked the improvement especially on a new phone the approvement though were saved for the front megapixel sensor that's now eight megapixel with an F 1.7 aperture as steeple on Samsung phones has been that oval physical home button that is gone the home button moved to the back very curiously located next to the fingerprint sensor and you think about logistically how your hands going to sit when you tap that you're going to be smudging the heck at Atal megapixel sensor on the back that's not the only way you can unlock your phone though simply include the iris scanning technology we found galaxy s7 as well as crazy-fast face detection which as I tested you can see work like I said crazy fast there's now a pressure sensitive area on the bottom of the phone lets you access the home button so pretty much you can just press hard there in any app it'll take you home but when you are that home screen you'll see on screen back and most anybody also new here is Big B Simpson's new AI which you're going to hear a ton about over pretty much every Samsung device coming out over the next few years it's they're intelligent user interface and Samsung is claiming anything you can do with your finger you can do with your voice with big feet so bic we've got cognitive tolerance they'll kind of know what you're doing so if you're having a conversation with your friends and you say send the last picture it'll know to send the last picture that you took and i'll send it to that friend and one of the things I really like about Bixby instead of just saying I can't do that whatever you ask it allows you questions to get that job done underneath the big speak umbrella you also have big speed visions there's going to be a little button inside of the camera apps and tap that and it's going to centrally give you a grant to the reality point the camera at a restaurant I'll give you reviews pointed at a camera and yet electronic or device I'll tell you prices books you don't tell you it's adopted what it's going to be about you can do a lot of cool stuff and it should get better as the AI tends to learn more so storage on all the SH they're going to be 64 gigs but you can up that with a micro SD card of 256 or higher at a target support and other Samsung staples you'd expect you're also on board here you've got fast charging via USB see you've got fast wireless charging and of course ip68 I know a lot of you have knocked on Samsung for the software in the past and myself included they stepped out of their own way here the launcher looks good Samsung thing to stick with what they did well and took out a rest of the flock so the UI seems pretty solid this time around so aside from the Galaxy s8 and the SI plus stenciling unveiled a slew of new things to go along with them we've got a new Samsung Connect home it's a mesh Wi-Fi system with smart things built in Samsung decks is Samsung's desktop docking station essentially you get the power of the keyboard mouse all powered from your phone it's akin so what you've got with Microsoft's continuum they drop your phone in you're going to get full access to all of your stuff support for every droid app is going to be there they worked really closely with Microsoft to get support for full office and own windows as well as trying to get virtualization for Windows 10 coming also got a new gear VR through gear VR controller it's going to be backwards compatible with the obviously the s8 but the s7 or the note 5 with some adapters thrown in and the last new thing they announced is a gear 360 smaller it does 4k now actually livestream @qk got kind of a new bulb issue periscope edesign so that is the s8 and all of its accessories of friends if you want to learn more about the Galaxy s8 plus links that down below or we will link it on screen so go ahead and click it and take a look and as you guys going to pick one of these things up if you are which color if you're not why not leave in the comments down below and let us know so next time Jon render some technical you 
This beautiful piece of hardware is the
Pixelbook it's been over four months since it came out initial batch of
reviews are almost outdated because there have been a lot of software updates that have come
so I wanted to pick one up revisit it and see if it's worth the starting price
of $1000 for Chrome OS before I jump in I want to give a huge
shout out and thank you to the Acorn Collective for making this video
possible if you want to give crowdfunding you've got a new idea for
something you want to crowdfund you're going to want to stay tuned in to the end of this
video they are revolutionizing the crowdfunding platform so pricing on the
Pixelbook is is ridiculous I think anybody who bought one would even admit
themselves ridiculous start at a thousand bucks so you're getting nice
specs I've got Core i5 and here at eight gigs of ram but at a thousand bucks you are
at Surface Laptop category there's a ton of other Windows laptop so you can
get you're talking about some MacBook pricing some used MacBook Pros you can
get a lot of computer for a thousand bucks but what you're gonna get is still
really nice so Google's been testing Android apps and ChromeOS for a while
and it kind of became official with the Pixelbook and you've got close to the
full breath of the Google Play apps here which are nice some things are
still weirdly letterbox you get access to all those applications which make
things really easy to use and adds to the functionality to the Pixelbook we're
also gonna have a problem with that is you're getting duplicate apps things
like slack for example there's an awesome web app and there's the Android
app and you could use Gmail tab for Gmail and there's a myriad of other
email apps you can use you're kind of stuck with oftentimes two separate apps
or two separate icons that do essentially the same thing that took a
little getting used to the Android apps work and I haven't had much issue but
they don't look made to scale obviously for a screen of this size
what surprised me about the Pixelbook first was battery life I knew it was gonna
be awesome but I'm getting upwards it's like 10 to 12 hours of battery life
which is crazy the facts in 10 days I've had it I think I've charged it twice and
didn't even need to charge it just out of habit charged it and it'll charge
via one of the two USB type-c ports which I guess is nice to have doing work
on the Pixelbook it was a little bit frustrating doing stuff and Slack was
easy I was able to download the Android versions of Microsoft Office and that
works really well did a lot of work in the Google suite kind of stuff what I
missed was having an actual desktop experience I know there's a local
storage on here there's a decent amount of it and there's a full file explorer
it's just not as elegant as a typical laptop and I guess I shouldn't have
expected it to be that I found workarounds for everything I was able to
do all of my work on the Pixelbook it wasn't as easy as it would be on say a
Windows PC or a Mac laptop and obviously the area is where it excels is in Chrome
I loved you can launch Chrome apps as their own windows and you can pin them
to the dock you get more of a desktop experience but things in chrome
obviously were awesome watching YouTube videos watching movies
browsing TechnoBuffalo any other websites those kind of things were
really good the touch screen added to responsiveness of course the touch
screen it's a really high res screen that works well being able to scroll
and just use your finger was certainly nice to have that option there's still a
decent amount of hinge wobble we'll talk about the hinge a little bit more in a
minute but it was nice to have and it was a great Chrome experience as good as
any I think I got on a Windows PC or a Mac laptop I do want to add for extra
functionality to the Chromebook and this isn't unique to the Pixelbook but there
is Chrome Remote Desktop lets you access a Windows PC from a Chrome browsers if
you need that does work pretty well On the hardware side there's a lot of
stuff to really like about this I love the silicone a little pads on the
left and right of the trackpad it's makes for really comfortable experience
the keyboard is absolutely awesome it's one of the best laptop keyboards that
I've used trackpad is glass and works great the two-finger scrolling through websites or document is really smooth incredibly responsive so that's
nice to see here so I talked about the the hinge I thought I could sort of bend
it and I could watch movies I could put it up in a tent mode to show my wife's
some stuff that I was working on I can use it to read scripts when I'm editing videos
and working on certain things that are coming up the added functionality of
that hinge is nice it's not unique to Pixelbook we've seen
a lot of convertible laptops that have that but each time I use a reminded of
how nice it is sort of have that option the bezels are huge on this and I know
the argument is that when you're holding it as a tablet so your fingers have someplace
to go but there are other convertibles with much smaller bezels that you can
still use a tablet so I've got a hard time buying that argument it's almost inexcusable on a laptop that cost this much you can spec this thing up to cost
about $1,700 another weird design cue so it's
incredibly thin it doesn't weigh that much its been nice to put in a bag but it's
strange that when it's closed I can still push down and click the
trackpad just a weird annoyance that I noticed there are other nice things in
the keyboard we've got a button for a Google assistant and other sort of desktop
UI essentially things I become your app drawer and settings are all
here and sort of built right into the keyboard when I bought to Pixelbook
it also came at the Pixelbook Pen and I'm sure you guys probably saw our
Marques review of the Pixelbook and when the pen first came out it was not
very useful he had a ton of issues with responsiveness it didn't work that well
and evidently got some software update because I issues like he had as far as
responsiveness and moved quickly when I was scrolling around the screen app took
advantage of what it could do work really well essentially I just use it to
see if it worked I'm not a big pen guy and besides that there's nowhere to
stick this thing I was absolutely gonna lose it it's about a hundred bucks you
want to buy it separately if it's not bundled I don't see they use with it I'm
not an artist it's cool you can serve circle stuff and I'll do Google searches
with it but you know so when I got this I initially figured I was gonna use it
for like a two weeks and kind of return it like I was it was fun to try it is an
extravagance and there's a lot of other lower priced Chromebook option Samsung's
got some awesome choices it's hard to say yeah you should spend a thousand
bucks on a Chromebook it is like I said not a necessity for anybody's world and
the crazy extravagance but I think I'm gonna keep it I like having a computer
that boots up really fast I like not having to take out you know
another computer at home have this just always be at home it's able to do almost
what I need it to do for me boil down to Chrome OS is good at a lot but it's not
really great at anything what I've needed to do I found workarounds I liked
having it but it's nice and it's worked well for me so I'm gonna chalk this up
to something I certainly don't need something I'm really glad to have so I
want to thank the folks at Acorn Collective for making this video
possible if you've ever liked crowdfunded something you back something
you probably know about crowdfunding maybe you try to use it yourself
crowdfunding are quickly sort of supplanting venture capital firms as the
way entrepreneurs are getting money but the big VC firms there's some like dirty
secrets behind it the big one is that they're all equity backed so that's
gonna mean that they focus on projects that sort of give them the best return
and the barriers to entry are stupid high and their policies make it next to
impossible for people from developing countries to get their ideas on there
potentially get their ideas to turn into something real Acorn Collective is sort
of turning that entire thing on its head so the platform is backed by blockchain
technology so you know it's going to be secure and reliable and then one of my
favorite things about it's gonna be completely free for use in any country
so matter where in the world you are if you have an idea you could get it funded
it's totally awesome the early backers aren't equity holders they're token
holders surging some of the cool stuff about blockchain with cryptocurrency
their token is OAK they're in a presale right now but time you watch this video
they'll probably be already available link to it down below if you want to
learn more about crowdfunding you've had an awesome idea for crowdfunding you
haven't found a platform to bring that idea to life Acorn Collective is a
really sweet way to do it again it will link to it down below you should
definitely check it out so that that's a Pixelbook it's well-designed hardware
it's a beautiful screen for like an unnecessary amount of money you guys
really interested through Google's core of products did you guys pick all these
up did you try one in the store I'd like to know what you think about it it's
definitely a polarizing computer yes you can even call it a better one don't you
guys think leave a comments down below of course subscribe it's a little bell
icon next to it we got more Pixelbook videos coming up until next time i'm

2018 is almost here in 2017 saw the release of four hundred and seventy six different smartphones you can you can check that if you'd like it took a long time to get that number as we look back on all those phones that got released there were some that were incredible some that were less than incredible and one thing became clear that is hard to find a bad phone nowadays no matter how much money you want to spend but still several phones rose to the top so I want to pick smart phones of the year for 2017 we've broken it down into five different categories and the last one will be my smartphone in the year alright so every rectangle you hold in your hand you're looking at the screen so it makes sense to start with the best display this winner should come as no surprise the Galaxy Note 8 has the best screen of any smartphone I have seen in 2017 which also means the best grand smartphone I have ever seen this could be extended as well to the s8 and the SI plus but this screen is absolutely incredible Samsung screens are I think always been amongst the best for some they're a little too saturated but I loved the way it looked it worked well in direct sunlight pictures look beautiful colors were vibrant the screen often times look like a sticker on the display I absolutely love what Samsung has done and to come as no surprise our runner-up screen is also made by Samsung that is the screen on the iPhone 10 is the runner-up here it is a beautiful screen in its own rights if I had to pick just one which is my video so it did Galaxy Note 8 takes the best display our next let's jump into the best camera and cameras took a huge jump in 2017 I think bigger than we've seen in any previous year we're looking at borderline DSLR quality when it comes smartphones but hands-down the best camera that I tested these on paper didn't look like it should have been the best camera but it goes to the pixel - and the pixel to excel the cameras are incredible I'm not just talking about the rear cam which is incredible in its own right portrait mode looks awesome it's only gotten better with the machine learning it's worked great in any situation whether it's a low-light whether there's a ton of sunlight whether they're shadows or nachos the pictures always look incredible it also extends on a front-facing camera where portrait mode lives as well and those shots look equally good it's almost impossible to take a bad picture with the pixel to the pixel to XL camera Google absolutely nailed to this one friend for our runner up it seems always bridesmaid never a bride the camera on the iPhone 10 takes this one as well I think when it comes to rear cameras it would have been close to a tie but the front camera on the pixel - far outshines their front-facing camera on the iPhone 10 especially when it comes to portrait shots so for the next category let's go to the most underrated smartphone this category could have also been the most under the radar smartphone or the best smartphone you didn't consider it goes to the LG V 30 this was our social guy Jessie we're teases favorite phone of the year and for a really good reason the camera is incredible the OLED screen is absolutely beautiful battery life lasts for seemingly days everything about this phone screams flagship and a flagship now and a really good value so if you're looking to get a phone that maybe not everybody's gonna have the LG v 30 is an awesome phone and it should definitely be on your radar although I juiced your software is a little bit better but that's what that's what launchers are for again we saw a ton of phones come out this year but some were surprising if I film this video like three months ago this phone probably would have won the biggest bus award but the biggest surprise of 2018 goes to the new cover on the block and that's the essential pH one I love what essential is done recently dropping the price at 500 bucks alone it makes this phone of Steel you're getting one of the best builds of any phone that I have ever held and I've held a lot of phone's ceramic and titanium then octo is a camera that you've done an incredible job pushing out camera updates since all the initial reviews hit they've added portrait mode in fact as a day of this filming they push an update that enabled 360 video on Facebook on YouTube got a 360 camera that can attach to it you've got potential for modularity the cameras actually gotten pretty good here as well it's got pretty solid battery life this is my favorite phone to hold in my hand and if you're looking to spend a 500 bucks and you want the best feeling phone out there a phone that feels fly ship and feels premium I've been really surprised and impressed with the essential pH one get in white I love I loved it away and without further ado the smart phone of the year and I tested a lot of phones this year and I love mobile technology but the phone that I look back on most fondly is my favorite phone that I tested a figure four they actually went out and bought and spent my own money on that is clearly the note eight I've absolutely loved this phone it's not the phone that won me back from iOS that crown goes to the galaxy s 8 plus but it's the phone that kept me from going back to iOS I love everything about the note obviously this blazing Sat one that category I love the form factor I loved didn't narrowness of an L slope you get the giant screen everything about this phone screams premium if you could check off every flagship box it's here you've got wireless charging you've got incredible fast Shirdi you've got the s-pen you even have a headphone jack built-in expandable storage there is nothing that I don't like about this phone except for all the duplicate apps and Samsung insists on shoving on their phones but you can throw those in a folder and ignore some software foe pause for a phone that's been absolutely incredible performance-wise have been great I love this phone in fact it's gonna be the phone it's gonna be in my pocket and the calendar flips from 2070 to 2018 Samsung's got a home run on their hand the note 8 thank you excited for at the galaxy s 9 that's 9 + are gonna be and of course what the note 9 is going to be next year but for right now my favorite phone of the year that encompasses everything that I love about phones goes to the Galaxy Note 8 so those are smart phones in here and I can't read the comments yelling me that I didn't mention your miscellaneous Sony phone or Huawei phone and perhaps we did not check out here at TechnoBuffalo this is my video and my choice and my awards and I love these phones especially when it comes to the note 8 but let me know in the comments down below why you think I'm wrong why you think I'm right I'd love to hear it get the video a thumbs up we appreciate it and of course a little bell to notify when new videos are coming hope you guys enjoy it until next time I'm John render from techno boat [Music] 
few months ago Apple swore they did not forget the pro market behind me we are seeing that in fact they are trying to live up to that promise this is the new space gray I'm Mac Pro and you know it's Pro because it's a all new color I will say it looks really good this thing packed in insane amount of power and that familiar all-in-one form factor it looks exactly the same as the old iMac I said from the power that been it so there's a lot of power you can get in this thing we don't know the full price thing it's going to start at about 5,000 bucks it's available in December it'll shift it's a base version with the eight core xenon processor it will be a 10 core even an 18 core available GPU has always been area or apples maybe a little bit behind they're hoping to change that here the Radeon Vega graphics are going to be available up to 16 gigs of DRAM 211 teraflops into a precision 22 teraflops of hash precision up to 128 gigabytes ECC memory which is crazy even crazier is for scary bytes of SSD storage kind of pork tear as well as for Thunderbolt 3 ports there's first time they've ever shipped 10 bit gigabit ethernet the FaceTime cameras also improve now is 1080p new accessories are also along for the ride here you've got a space grey keyboard it's now Wireless we got a number pad there Apple figured out how to do that there's also a new Magic Mouse to go along with it you don't know that much else about it right now other than its going to come sometime in December and going to start for just under $5,000 but give Apple credit for showing something that's coming soon they show this addition to the home pod as sort of new product lines that are coming so all of that of course coupled with the 5k display on the iMac you've got them two makings of a pretty powerful computer whether it's going to be for for gaming of course now you can attach external GPUs when high sierra hits or for video editing like where you probably going to use it for there's a lot of power in that familiar form factor and it's got a new color but is it enough to win you back from your video editors to come back from the PC and Premiere Pro to get back into the Final Cut frame we're going to use this with the Premiere Pro or another editing software it's cool you can use for gaming if you load up some boot camp and get some games on one of your thoughts on it leave it down below fikriye color does look really good in person so next time john ranger ii buffalo 
before we get to some tips for iOS 11 I want to thank car packs from anchor the latest cases for keeping your Apple devices safe scratch free and and not cracked so if you're an Apple user by now you've probably had a chance to take a look at i/o s11 maybe got it on your shiny new iPhone 8 or A+ or perhaps you're holding out for the home button list iPhone 10 as you guys start to learn how to use iOS love and a lot of things are very familiar but ton of things have changed and they've added a lot of tricks inside of iOS 11 you might not know about so to help you learn how to supercharge your Apple device here are 11 tips for iOS love it alright so number one you can move multiple icons at once this one's pretty useful if you want to rearrange home screens you want to move multiple apps that having to go back and forth with your finger and it's pretty easy to do so long press and put it in to wiggle mode tap one icon and then while you're still holding downs tap another one and it's gonna loop them together you can move icons wherever you want to go the next step might be one you didn't even know about especially if you restored your phone or iOS device from a previous backup auto-brightness is gone in display settings it's on by default but if you want to turn it off Apple surprisingly hit it says what you've got to do if you want to turn that off you got to go to general get accessibility display accommodation and you'll see the toggle is on by default you want to turn that off that's where you can do it so I was Elevens got some bugs in it you might want to do a soft reset and it's pretty easy to do on older iOS devices but he's got an iPhone 8 8 plus or an iPhone 10 there's a few more steps to do so here's what you have to do you hit the volume button up real fast the volume down real fast and then immediately press the power button you'll see the Apple logo pop up and your phone will be back to normal in just a few seconds so the next one you might find is surprisingly useful there are some new features built into the camera the first one it can now read QR codes it's probably should have done a while ago no longer need a third-party apps put a QR code when you're in your camera app and automatically recognize that read it and take the appropriate action there's also some good things you can do with live photos it's pretty easy so just go to your gallery take any picture you've got it's got a live photo in it to wipe up you see you can pick a loop bounce long-exposure kind of makes it effects a little bit neater you can customize them for whatever you want to have to get scanning documents can be useful and I used to have to use a third party app to do it scanner plus was my go-to but no more it has now built into the Notes app on iOS 11 go ahead open that up hit the plus button in a document right from there so this next one is pretty useful we find yourself on group text and someone never stops messaging no matter what you can turn off the words just for certain threads if you want if you do it in a few different ways so in the main messages app you can just swipe to the left and you could hit hide alerts or if you're in the thread a pregnant corner at the eye and hide alerts there as well the next control center obviously got a gigantic overhaul in iOS 11 but you can customize what's going to show up there and Apple give you a ton of options for what you want to do so if you want to do that go to settings control center turn off toggles turn on toggles to your heart's content and as a bonus if you go into control center by swiping up from the bottom and you do a 3d touch press on any of those icons deletes a lot of them you can customize it flashlight for example you can change the intensity of the light you find a lot of other settings if you do that for the other icons so I've been really impressed that apples done with storage and a big reason that I'm using whele storage and before they've got a new file format for photos teeth we're a gif they did away with JPEGs and if you want to bring back JPEGs you can do it but there is a bit of a caveat here got an iPhone 8 or a plus or even an iPhone 10 if you turn this off you're not gonna be able to do 4k is 60 frames per second or 1080p at 240 frames per second so be warned but here's how you can do it go to settings camera formats and just flip the switch over to most compatible and you are jpg to heart's content and you should know that if we turn that off because Google photos wasn't backing up Apple's new formats you can turn it back on again now because Google photos now supports Apple's new a gif format so if you're keeping track this is number 9 alpha made it really need to share Wi-Fi passwords what that means if you're connected to Wi-Fi networking somebody comes to your house your office they don't have the password you forgot it I just don't want to tell them what it is you can share it with them pretty easily caveat though they have to be in your contacts if the person that is in your contacts brings your phone close to yours a little message will pop up on your screen if you want to share their password just automatically connect their phone to network but having them to know that your password is is 1 2 3 4 change your password and the number 10 about someone handed keyboard action so if you're in any app that requires the keyboard either hit the emoji icon next to the space bar or if you got a couple keyboards in it or look like a globe hold that down you can swipe left to right to get the keyboard left or right oriented so depending if your left or right handed it makes typing wait user last but not least you can scream record now when I was 11 maybe I heard about it maybe you're looking at your control center wondering where the heck it is so you got to go back to a previous tip you got to add it to control center so again go to settings control center flip that switch then we swipe up you'll get a new icon that looks like two circles push it you can record your screen and no video you're gonna get a red bar at the top letting you know that it's recording but you can do it now that it's surprisingly useful so I want to thank card packs from anchor for making this video possible you're probably thinking anchor makes batteries they got a new line of cases out into the car packs name that are pretty awesome so first they'll work with wireless charging that was a big concern of mine they will protect your device as well so you've got really nice easy cutouts to access a profile switcher the buttons are protected you got cutouts on the bottom for your speakers and your lightning port you got some carbon fiber trims the phone will be safe it's really durable and if you pretend to drop your phone when you want to keep your investment safe look no farther then gara packs from anchored if you want to check one out we'll link to it down in my pants location which is a gross way of saying down below so there are some tricks to supercharge your iOS 11 device this list we compiled it was like 30 plus long there's a ton of stuff we could have picked but if there's one that we've left out do you think it's surprisingly useful leave in the comments and share it other people can use it and get their iPhones or iPads running a bit more smoothly hope you guys enjoyed the video thumbs up we appreciate it till next time I'm John Ranger [Music] you [Music] 
so much like death taxes and winter the model 3 is coming and it's coming faster I think most people expect there's a lot to know about the car and also a huge amount we don't know in their last model 3 video so I want to share all the stuff with you guys decide whether or not the model 3 is the right car for you the first thing we know you know the price going to be starting at around $35,000 you can get that price down to as low as about 2075 depending on what state you live in so we've got an affordable mass-market fully autonomous car like the technology will be in it and that is a first so every model here that's going to shift going to ship with Tesla autopilot 2.0 and that's going to enable within two years must be saying full autonomy like go to sleep in the back of your car type of autonomy let's get saying no towards even the end of this year early next year they'd be able to have level for autonomy which is essentially the Carl's are all the work for you but you forgot us in the driver seat just to like check things out don't expect that technology to be there at the 35 thousand dollar price point gonna have to pay for it whatever your car will have it because get it later if you want we still know the range good to have a starting a range of 215 miles and that is deceptive as a Tesla owner myself put the love to claim range the criminal Ange at a hundred percent battery life and you should never charge your card 100% that leads to huge battery degradation down the line so real-world are probably could have about 190 ish on the range but there will be options and there will be speed options as well you want a muscle saying there should be cars that can get from zero to 60 in under 4 seconds it's not faster so it should be a PE variant as well we know it's going to have a crazy glass roof option since we've got their own Tesla glass similar what we think we have in the Model X that sort of almost a helicopter ish windshield LMS is also hinted at a solar roof option that hasn't been the biggest success thing in the world we've seen try to do it with the Prius in Japan we've seen Fisker Automotive try to do it with the Karma doesn't work out that well just can create that much electricity but it might be an option on the model 3 that's the moral of what we know there's still a lot we don't yet know about the car we should see the production unit be unveiled in July but things should change versus what we saw and billed to last year there'll be a wider trunk opening and things are a little bit kind of up in the air as far as what's actually going to according to the folks at electric successful I saw the patents for automated super charging it's you guys remember four years ago that's what shared the video with the weird snake charger kind of winding its way and plugging itself in a Tesla gears up to full autonomy they want cars go to charge themselves so allegedly you bill to park your Model 3 into a supercharger let park itself and it's going to charge itself be a very like phallic looking snake plugging itself in which is kind of cool it's technology accessible as shown does indeed exist speaking of superchargers Tesla will also be doubling the number of supercharger stations in the u.s. when 3500 to 7,000 by the end of this year to gear up for just a ton of model freeze on the road they're still expected to hit the road later this year but supercharging will not be free to have to pay to enable it and then you're going to have to sort of pay for youth if you want to supercharge your car which should which about 80% battery life in like 16 20 minutes we also don't know what's the center stack is going to look like we heard rumors for a while is going to have a heads up display and that was a rumor that I was sharing a few months back must catch squash that syndrome we will not be a heads up play instead of having sort of the large portrait style screen that you've got in the model last Model X going to be a landscape oriented screen so different UI here the big question is is it the car you guys have been waiting for $35,000 400-mile GV is pretty awesome it's kind of that perfect compromise between performance which weren't having technology and also not breaking of things to do it let me know in the comments down below if you ordered a Model 3 and let me know why and if your pro model 3 exhibit do a thumbs up let us know I'll do a ton more Tesla coverage as the card is closer to release so next time John Wright injured from TechnoBuffalo you [Music] 
if you guys are running android marshmallow you're probably reading articles about phones getting nougat and I'm about to make you feel a little bit worse for yourselves and I apologize but today Google took the wraps off Android Oh at least a very first Developer Preview came out so we installed Android Oh on our pixel and you can install this on a lot of different devices do it on the Android emulator 5 X 6 P player any of the pixel devices so it's regular pixel pixel XL or pixel C but again do with caution this is meant just for developers it will be a consumer version though plan later in the year 1 a huge area of improvement you can expect from Android o is battery life Google's giving additional limits on what apps can do in the background which is similar to what Apple does with iOS so gone are the days of background processes running what this going to mean for the end user is just much better app management and battery life notification channel is also new here users can be able to block or change any vacation behavior on each channel individually how about some pip some picture and picture display is now available on phones and tablets but you keep watching a video while you use another app so just an improved picture in picture we also have adaptive icons now system icons can add out whatever environment they're in whether on a Samsung or LG device so depending on the launch we've got going on the adaptive icon also a lot of ella purrs integrates their app icons with the devices existing UI you now have wide gamut color for apps apps and take advantage of new devices it'll have wide color gamut for color capable displays so just brilliant better colors googles are working with different partners trying to improve experiences so for better audio they work directly with Sony so you should get way better audio when you're just plugging in your headphones so I'm sure this is just the tip of the iceberg what Google is going to announce for Android oh what features are eventually going to come baked in - oh I'm going to call an Oreo whatever it eventually comes out I'm excited hopefully you guys are too many features you guys most excited about let me know in the comments down below and we can talk about them the next time John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo 
go check it out the Galaxy s8 you're thinking yourself hey that's 5.8 inch screen sounds awesome but I wish it was 6.2 what if I got good news for you meets the Galaxy s8 plus and 6 more 2 inches sounds really big and it is a big phone it looks absolutely beautiful but you do not need like ginormous sized hand to hold it the phone is mostly all screens they got a much bigger screen in a smaller package and holy crap that screen look gorgeous it's a quad HD panel at 2965 1440 it's got a 530 PPI and every one of those those ppis go to make an incredible looking package video looked absolutely awesome I thought some mobile HDR content is phone support and it looked gorgeous the infinity display here is the big story much like a galaxy s 8 it looks like thing is all screen it's got the curved edges we've seen before but it's a way less subtle curve than we've seen at the galaxy s7 edge I'm previous edge devices I didn't like the way those looks you're going to be probably pretty happy here a lot of the story here though is it's an S state with the bigger screens all the stuff you love or don't know about the s8 is going to be here on the s8 plot fingerprint reader is now on the back we've got a touch sensitive area on the front of the device where your home button is and then your back and your multitasking buttons are going to be there so the home button as I could understand it works like this on screen home buttons like we've seen before but instead like you for watching a video on Android you've got a tap screen the buttons appear and then hit home from any app you can kind of do a force touch on the bottom that will take you Amelie home so it sort of cuts out the intermediate tap screen steps a lot of other new things the Galaxy S line of phones are here again just like the Galaxy s8 the Irish getting technology we saw on the note 7 really surprisingly fast face detection although it is a low-level Samsung claimed not going to be fooled by like a picture or video but kind of want to test that for myself 64 gigs of internal storage is going to be standard you can of course expand that via microSD power and this guy in the US is going to be Snapdragon 835 or a samsung built XE nose if you live outside of the so those are things that are new some stuff that's the same four gigs of ram is the same we've seen on last generation phones as well as that 12 megapixel camera sensor same sensor is the note 7 and same as we saw with the s7 s7 edge the Samsung does forever its worst claim software improvement what is new though is a front-facing camera it's now 8 megapixel with an S 1.7 aperture all the other stuff you'd expect for flagship Samsung's are here you've got wireless charging got fast charging now with us news is nice to have and of course it's got the pretty awesome ip68 water-resistant almost waterproof also new here is Samsung's new AI Bixby eye so it's a little bit of time going through what it can do and our galaxy s 8 hands on so go ahead and check that out also new or some new accessories to go along with you sculpt I went through all those in more detail on a Galaxy s8 video but it's a new gear VR a new gear 360 and also a new mesh system with smart things built so like me you may have had some complaints to Samsung in the past with really heavy software it seems at least on first impressions of sampling listened the UI seems like Samsung got really out of their way and focus on what works you now have kind of a Google pixel style type launcher we have swiped up into the app and it doesn't care to be too much on top of that it looks like fans like the best of Google with the best of Samsung I found a really nice combination here just because I feel like I got to say it now in phone videos there is a headphone jack hooray for that there will be headphones acquitted in the box the same thing was really proud of their tune by AKG and they claim that if they sold these suckers it'd be about a hundred bucks to buy they're still in the box headphone so I don't know how they're going to sound but they are there regardless can plug your own headphones in because got that jack so remember this with the Galaxy S eight plus somebody who's held it yeah it's big because it's almost all screens doesn't feel nearly that big in the hand you're debating between the SI at me si plus probably go to a store and try it and see them for yourself it's already like a big screen phones I think jump into the si plus you're not going to regret it the screen looked absolutely gorgeous in fact I am pre-ordering a galaxy s 8 plus for myself I came away that infrared that's about the best endorsement I can give anything as putting my own money behind it and worrying in black just throwing that out there I think the black looks best I wish the US was getting the really awesome blue or even the gold and Federer skidding like to depreciate the gray and and that darker color winked all this stuff again down below if you want to learn more but what are you guys getting if anything and that's eight and say plus what color or why or why not are you skipping this one leaving the comments down below have a conversation about it so next time John Rangers will techno-bubble 
what's going on everyone John render from TechnoBuffalo here and today we are taking a first look at the brand new just announced pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL writer as you can see i am at the google event there you go mkbhd cameo right there so a lot to like about these phones let's start with the screens so the screen on the pixel XL 2 that I have right here stayed the same it's 5 inches but to the XL jumped from 5.5 to 6 inches the technology that changed both phones are now utilizing OLED panels the XL so as a full HD screen since 1920 by 1080 whereas the pixel XL 2 has jumped up to qHD powering this guy you've got a snapdragon 835 4 gigs ram available in 64 or 128 you notice on the bottom though there's something missing on these phones we are missing a headphone jack that is now gone the way of the dodo and the iPhone boy do have though is a aluminum unibody back sort of has a texture on it doesn't feel quite like aluminum but because the back is metal wireless charging is not going to be here the camera though is a giant deal the original pixel camera was awesome remembered had a DxO score of 89 at the time was the highest that had ever been given to a mobile phone they up to their game here this one got a DxO score of 98 which is pretty unprecedented it's a little bit better than 12 megapixels an 8 megapixels on the front without an F 1.8 aperture but there's a lot of of course when it comes to pixel phone's on a soft worked week so first very similar what we seen from HTC and of course since it pretty much is bought the engineers from HTC you can now squeeze the phones and things will happen you can launch the assistant in self which by giving it a squeeze and they claim that it'll work in a case and all some difference between accidental squeezes also you'll notice the UI here is different the dock is different the pixel launcher so you've got your dock right across the top and persistent google search and then you've got your navigation buttons down below I don't quite know how I feel about that as I sort of go through and scroll through screens but is what it is google search now lives at the bottom of course android 8.0 Oreo ice here as well also new we now have an always-on display and you'll see things all start to populate here like notifications and other things as the software gets more mature and if this was a bit of a quadrat miss fear if I was gonna play music the phone will automatically know what song was playing and show it down below and you could play a drinking game at the event here how many times Google said machine learning but that's what's sort of taking care of all the heavy lifting here with the phone it looks pretty nice and it feels pretty nice in the hand I know a lot of you guys are big into speakers we now have front-facing speakers on these phones on the top and bottom and spec wise the XL and the irregular pixel are almost identical say for the screen size and resolution and battery size here so the XL is gonna have a battery of about twenty seven sixty whereas the sorry the pixels got a battery of twenty seven sixty whereas the XL is about thirty five twenty are gonna be available October 19 for six forty nine or eight hundred and forty nine dollars the colors are white blue or blog I pretty much called it you'll see though they did do a turn of a pop of color on the side you can see right there on the XL you've got an orange home button I will say though the OLED technology on these screens look really nice and you can clearly see a difference here and I know that difference is gonna translate over to YouTube but I want you guys to get a real quick early look at these phones the big question here is what do you what do you think is it worth an upgrade is it something that you want to move from original pixel you're gonna switch from another Android device or move from an Apple phone I love to your thoughts on it this is a real quick first look at the brand new pixel XL - so then you guys also you think about these live videos we're doing from the events or to your thoughts on that until next time I'm John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo 
none of this time of year everybody's getting ready for for New Year celebrations and making plans at the end of the year for me is one of my favorite time just when I get a look forward to what's coming next and what's coming next is the galaxy s 9 which is crazy that the essays been out for almost a year we should see the s 9 debut and like the February March ish timeframe don't believe the rumors that you'll see it at CES in January we're starting to get a good sense of what the S 9 is going to be what its gonna look like and what it's going to have inside of it so let me run it down for you so first it's gonna be more of an iterative upgrade it's gonna be like an S version of the S 8 and the s 8 plus we saw some screen protectors leaked actually from slash leaks we saw a few things got revealed here first looks looks pretty similar infinii display is going to remain almost no bezels on the sides and blend down bezels on the top and bottom so that's nice I also expect the screen size to say the same at five point eight and six point Q for the s 9 + s 9 plus respectively and this by having thinner bezels on top we will see improved iris scanners for yes making it a bit more accurate we're asking to see sort of a face unlock type feature we have a face ID on the iPhone the iris Tanner worked pretty well worked with a lot of conditions and through sunglasses so it should just work better here on the s9 and I would not expect the in screen fingerprint reader to be on the s9 despite a lot of rumors I'd expect that a few months later when your brand new OS 9 becomes obsolete when the note 9 hits so reading out the specs should see a lot of new things inside of the s 9 despite the phone not looking that different powering this guy is a beast the snapdragon 845 got announced a few weeks ago obviously it's more powerful but what's going to matter I think for the end user better battery life and improve your key abilities and improved AR key abilities so everybody wins when a new processor comes onboard we should also see six gigs of ram standard here up from the four on the s8 and the SI plus as well as fingers fingers cross for just a bigger battery overall nope Samsung has put a couple generations behind them now from from the note 7 debacle so it's a bigger battery to make everybody happy if you could take one knock on lash Jen Samsung phones there were awesome devices but the stupid thing upper reader located next to the camera sensor was a bad design I'm just gonna say it I've said it before and if somebody guys disagreed put a case on it doesn't bother you your left hand it doesn't bother you but for me it bothered me it looks like the S sign is going to fix that the fingerprint reader is going to move where it should be and that's below the camera sensor so sorry your old cases won't work this time around but the camera sensor at the fingerprint reader is going to be below should be a bit improved on the s9 we don't know the megapixel edge or angstrom aperture information should be a little bit better it was almost the same from the s7 to the SI it's expect to jump here from the s8 to the s9 we're hearing though that the s9 + may adopt the dual sensors that we see in the note line of phones while the s9 should retain the single sensor so that one a grain of salt obviously all this is unconfirmed subject to change but I expected that to be the way the same thing goes with the next-gen phones on the software front I have good news and bad news for you I'll start with the good Andrew Oreo out of the box so that's that's awesome on the bad news front it's gonna be like Bixby central with a galaxy s 9 Samsung's put a lot of money resources they're not going to band and ship on that so they're hoping that they let you remap that button to something else you're gonna be disappointed you're gonna get Bixby in your life whether whether you want the speeder to be in your life or not she's gonna be in sconce net phone so that about sums up the Galaxy S nine I'm hoping the rumors are wrong about different cameras on the smbs Titan plus I've liked it done in the past essentially it's the same phone just different sizes so perhaps they get dual sensors on both but again who knows we'll see in a few short months we don't know colors they don't know price or release date but I mean I probably expect at this point around 900 bucks and like March ish and hopefully they print the blue color to the US don't just release it abroad I really want really want that blue and when you buy your brand-new shiny gouts the s9 just remember about six months later it's gonna be obsolete when the Galaxy Note 9 hits as such as the case with smartphones now your films very rarely the newest hottest kid on the block for long sake you excited about the s9 I can't wait it's gonna be probably the next phone that I pick up and purchase I like the plus versions maybe you guys like a smaller even the comments down below and let me know sure subscribe hit the big bell to get notified new videos pop up until next time I am drying render from TechnoBuffalo hoping I get my hands on s9 sooner rather than later these games [Music] Oh 
So this is the LG V30 we had a
pre-production unit for about two months and we've had the real deal production
model for about one month I wanted to sort of do a review one month later of
the phone and this phone goes way under the smartphone radar it gets over shadowed
especially in the Android world by the Samsung's and now the Pixels of the
world but LG does what LG does really well and they made an incredibly solid
phone that tics almost every flagship box that perhaps you're not thinking
about when it comes to buying a new smartphone and I think part of that
blame goes to LG the general thought process is that the G line is their
flagship the G5 and this year the G6 and the V line was kind of something
secondary the perhaps sat below it and that's never been the case the V line
has been their flagship but based on the marketing you wouldn't really know it
and there's a lot of things to like here I think the things that I like the best
about the phone are on the back and this is the cameras and the cameras are
incredible this generation on the V30 it's like a
lot of phones there are dual sensors here it's got one that's a regular 16
megapixel sensor with an F 1.6 aperture and optical image stabilization the
other one though it was ultra wide it's 13 megapixel with F 1.9 and these things
take incredible pictures just in auto mode and what LG's done with the
software it's nothing short of almost incredible there are 15 modes for
pictures and video inside of this phone there's even a separate mode just for
food one of my favorites though is actually the cine profile it's kind of
like what we're shooting with right now on our Sony a7s 2 it's a flat profile if
you go back later to edit and post fraction you can tweak the colors and
bring out a lot of things it's really cool to see that built into a phone I
guess there's gonna be one knock LG kind of hid features inside of other modes so
inside of the cine mode for example we've got kind of a smart zoom where if
you taps an area on the screen you can move a slider up and it'll zoom in right
on that area it's really cool effect if you don't know that it's there it can be
next to impossible to find but if you're just gonna shoot pictures in auto mode
predictably the pictures are going to look beautiful I was really surprised at
how good things looked in the low-light you're shooting outdoors obviously
things are gonna look good almost every situation that
through it this phone pictures looked awesome this is one of the best camera
setups out there and they don't have that a that unsightly camera hump it's
sits flush so nice work LG on the camera front so screen is also a big
deal when it comes to phone this is an area where I think it gets out shadowed
by the Note 8 and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ but the lg screen is really good
it's a six inch POLED panel with a slight curve to it
and it's almost bezel free it's got like a about an 82% screen to body ratio it's
1440 by 2880 that stuff you'd expect LG says the ratio is 18:9 I
don't know why the companies don't just call that 2:1 it supports both
HDR formats and things look really good on it it's not as poppy and vibrant as a
Samsung displays they muted the colors a little bit which mean watching things
like TV shows and movies that are usually a little more muted I think look
better watching YouTube for example and YouTube does a lot of processing to make
the colors kind of pop a little bit more preferred kind of the Samsung screen
this is a really nice middle ground and the fact that it's OLED the blacks are
really black I had some concerns early on about brightness but I had no issues
at all in direct sunlight with auto brightness turned on when I say that I
mean to go out in direct sunlight it's gonna detect it it's gonna kick the
brightness all the way up so you don't have to do it yourself overall though in
almost every way that I use the phone and looked at the screen it shined did a
really nice job so if you were gonna take one knock on the v30 it might be
the way the phone feels if you're used to the flagships of last generation I've
been playing with the flash stripped of this generation you used to having kind
of a hefty phone that's got a lot of weight to it built of very premium
materials you pick up the V30 it is definitely not that it almost feels too
light to even feel like there's a battery inside and there is a battery
inside this is not users replaceable that's a slight knock-on it's a little
bit plasticky it doesn't feel as premium as what Samsung's our devices are and
what the pixel devices are which is surprising especially on the Pixel 2 XL
because it's it's based on this phone and if you picked up LG stablemate the
G6 that phone felt way better to me maybe it's a weight thing and I'm sure
it's subjective after using the phone for a little while I got totally used to
the lightness up in the way it felt but if you switch phones a lot or you shop
cross shopping in a store and you're holding different device in your hands
don't let the weight of this fool you it's a premium phone in perhaps a less
premium package So it's good-news-bad-news when it comes to durability on the v30
we're actually using it with our Phantom 4 in the controller we didn't secure it
well enough obviously didn't have a case and it fell from about three and a half
feet face-first onto the screen you'd think the screen was gonna be cracked
the phone is covered front and back and Gorilla Glass 5 the screen was totally
fine like nothing happened but oddly the back part that didn't touch the concrete
was completely shattered everything still worked though the fingerprint
reader still worked and the camera was fine just the back got completely
cracked up the hardware side is pretty much what you'd expect from this
generation flagship at the snapdragon 835 it's got Adreno 540 and 4 gigs of ram
maybe 4 gigs a ram isn't gonna be enough in a year at least for right now
I had no issues and that brings me to LG's software I still don't like LG's
software I don't like the way they separate the menu buttons I don't like
the way they made things really granular I like the broader settings you've got
in stock Android I even liked what Samsung's done on the software side more but
I think said that the UI here does not slow the experience down it's not laggy
it's not buggy and you often times get used to it I solved a lot of my issues
with just putting a Nova Launcher on and I was able to deal with the settings
menu and how it looks like but it's not buggy it's not laggy at all so personal
preference I didn't mind it especially after I threw nova on here and kind of
made the phone look the way I wanted it to look also on the software side it's
based on 7.1.2 - released as a filming LG said Oreo will be coming but it's like a
big shrug emoji when that's going to happen so assume you're gonna have
nougat for probably quite a while I do like that they put the fingerprint
sensor where they belongs on the back and not next to the cameras it's also a
button so you can actually push it in I really like that as well I kind of got
used to having a power button on one of the sides of the phones I would have
liked that here but LG's got that sort of double tap to wake it up and that
kind of served in its place and speaking of the double tap and to wake it up not
necessarily the seamless segue always-on display I think LG
does some of the best always on display It's here so it's here it works it's not
gonna tell you the song that's playing I like the Pixel will but it works it's
functional and it's slightly customizable other things you'd expect
to be good or good here namely battery life my usage is gonna be wildly
different from yours but I'm still around 40% by end of the day so that
gives me about a 20% buffer to kind of do anything else that I might do on a
heavy day like watch a lot of video watch a TV show or do an unnecessary
amount of social media so if using the V30 you might want to pair it with an
Android Wear watch like for example the Casio protrek smart who actually sponsored
to this video to make it possible it's a pretty awesome watch first of all if
you've ever been a fan of Cassio's like g-shock this is an incredibly durable
watch that is meant to handle the elements whether it's cold warm
underwater whatever you want this watch can handle it so my favorite feature
it's got built-in low-power GPS it's not gonna drain your battery at all one push
of the button is gonna launch Google Maps you know exactly where you are
thrown so take those maps offline if you want battery life is absolutely
outstanding it's got almost two screens built-in you've got one that's black and
white to say battery and one that's that full-color screen take advantage of
Android wear 2.0 looking for a smart watch that's gonna be smart for your
active lifestyle I'll put a link down below to check out to the Casio protrek
smart so what do you guys think about the V30 I haven't been this overly
positive about a phone I think in a while there really isn't that much to
not like about it you guys pick one up are you debating picking one up did you
skip it completely I kind of like to know why I'm in the comments down below
give the video a thumbs up you always appreciate it so next time I'm Jon
Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo 
[Music] my baby's about to turn turn six months old the Galaxy Note 8 came out and August 23rd which makes it almost halfway through its lifespan trying to believe my favorite phone of the year za was gonna be replaced and I want to revisit the Galaxy Note I've been using it quite a bit I always come back to it but Before we jump into it I want to thank the folks at bud bow for sponsoring this video what makes bud bow unique is that the art an existing company they're not trying to raise money and so they could form their already existing the arty of a product and a product that works essentially they're trying to bring a really hyper fraction industry together and I give them a ton of credit for that and they're using blockchain to do it which is incredibly impressive so a few things let me get this out of the way there has not been any slowdown there's not been any sort of Samsung lag at favorite associated other devices that were before the galaxy s5 it's been incredibly fast maybe it's a processor maybe it's a six piece of ram I've had no silicon issues the OS is faster than when it first came out a couple other things have changed I've noticed a little bit of warmth phone gets a little warmer when I use it pretty heavily which is a little off-putting for for a note device don't think that's gonna like fry off my pocket or my my man bits when it's in there but it is getting warmer than it was initially it has an impacted performance or battery life which is still been stellar and as good since the first day that I got the phone one thing that I really love about the no date is is the ip68 actually about three days ago I was given my kids bath and I know I did I usually don't but I answer the phone and I had sort of up to my ear and I was leaning over and bathing them and you could you could see where that went the phone fell directly into the tub I was able to pick it up dry it off and obviously no issues so I was thankful for the ip68 it's something that I guess I don't think about that much anymore but if it was a lot of other phones perhaps it would have been ruined maybe I / 67 would have been enough but it just nice to know everything was was okay when it comes to the s-pen a lot of the reasons people get the note I really haven't used it I use it a lot when I first got the phone I used the simple notes and then I just kind of forgot that it was there another thing I'm not using as much as I thought it's kind of the edge panel is I'm also not using multitasking his website thought I was going to release multitasking with the app on top and bottom split screen apps I just I think I just forget that a lot of that stuff is there what I do use a phone for and what I love is a camera the cameras are absolute incredible I love the way pictures look they're vibrant and you had pictures print it out and give them to my parents give them to other people this takes incredible photos it's still really quick the iris panning is great the fingerprint sensor is still in a horrible location you can get on the L you want that it's just me and if I put a cape on it's not gonna matter but it's bad for me it is a bad looking just a finger breaker I've talked about that kind of ad nauseam so I'm not gonna beat around the bush anymore I still like having a headphone jack I put in some headphones there's an audio book that has been really nice to have I don't the word that I was carrying Wireless or Bluetooth headphones but commend Samsung for sticking with that the quick charge stuff we've been really nice as well when the phone dies I can plug it in for like 10 minutes and it boosts itself back up and just the screen the six point three inch screen that Samsung's got on this phone is incredible their screens are gorgeous they're beautiful they're vibrant but this is the best of the best this is still six months later the best screen on a smart phone I will stand five at and does everything just better than well it's not bad at anything which is awesome to say for for a modern phone so I still love the no date in fact I would still recommend buying the no date now halfway through its lifecycle you can get some credible deals on it I still think you're getting the best phone on the market so I mixed at the beginning of the video I wanted to thank the folks at bud bow we've been talking a lot about crypto and blockchain here on the channel Fred I think a really good reason it is changing the way the world is working now and going to change the way the world is going to be working in the future blockchain is incredibly powerful you probably heard a lot about tokens and I SEOs if you're gonna remotely plugged into the crypto industry but what makes but boo unique is that the already an existing company they're not trying to raise money and so they can form their already existing they already have a product and a product that works so the focus this token sale just to rebuild bud bow with blockchain adding in way more layers of security and transparency and also complying to the government essentially been trying to bring a really a hyper fraction industry together and I give them a ton of credit for that and they're using blockchain do it which is incredibly impressive with a community of over 100,000 mobile users and the support of over 2000 dispensaries but BOE has launched the sale of tokens for its platform which the company is building on blockchain technology it's actually based on the etherium blockchain but bosz vision is to mobilize and disrupt the growing cannabis industry providing users dispensaries growers and others with the necessary technology to record information in an immutable ledger but BOE has operated as a mobile platform since 2016 providing users with the ability to match a cannabis user with their preferred stranor product with brought chain technology bud bo will ensure the industry is safe for all interested parties from supply chain management to regulation that means the safe transfer of goods verified stream potency and more the presale tier 1 and tier 2 for the tokens sold-out sway in advance and bud bow is currently in Phase three of their token sale which I believe ends on March 3rd if you want to learn more about bud bow check out the link down in the description you can check the white paper check out the team and be sure to comment below and let us know your thoughts so Galaxy Note 8 give me your thoughts on it did you buy one did you not buy one why is it your favorite floor of the year I'm just assuming that it is but if I'm wrong I know you guys will tell me Chris give the video a thumbs up we appreciate it hit the big subscribe button a little bell next to it we got a ton more coverage coming up until next time I'm Jon render the techno bubble [Music] 
[Music] inside of there is home pod the latest product from Apple available in two colors either a white or Space Gray not working right now in this demo and surrounded by 40 or 50 people this is the latest product from Apple it's a smart speaker that really heavy emphasis on music that's what Apple was really emphasizing here just saying music focused speaker as opposed to going to sound awesome but also the smart home stuff here's what you've got to know at least on the music side it's got a seven tweeter array it's got a four inch woofer and throughout seven inches tall and it looks like a cylinder with some mesh around it on top again I'm sort of an illuminated LEDs it's going to show you the Siri logo and kind of move as you talk to it we can't hear anything here so I don't know a good at sound Apple at a really fancy demo but supposedly the audio is going to sound really good it sort of spatially aware no matter where you put it it will know and it will adjust the speaker thanks for the audio so that's whether you put in a corner whether I put in the center of your room or pair with a few others it'll work composedly very well but it does work only going to work with the 40 or so million songs on Apple music so if you rely solely on Spotify or another service you're going to be out of luck here and of course all the smart stuff will work as well as simple hey Siri or bring up controls for your home kid naval devices you can't these questions you could send messages you can ask normal smart assistant type stuff the big selling point versus day at Google home or an Amazon echo supposedly music fidelity which unfortunately again we don't know here but we will know in December when the ships about three hundred and fifty bucks so the guys think about home Claud are you going to wait until December to finally get your first smart speaker I've been waiting for something from Apple I really have no real interest you've got another set of speakers I want to what you guys think we're going to comments down below and let me know what you think about the latest home pod well or what you think about the name I'll take investor I thought the name was going to be I thought Apple speaker would have been a boring name anyway we've got a comment down below let us know what you think until next time I'm John Ranger from WWDC 2017 [Music] [Music] 
Time to bring back rumor roundup it feels it feels good it's good to say that and we got the big three the Trinity
phone rumors we've got some Note 8 we got some iPhone 8 and we got some
Pixel 2 rumors of any three of those phones or things you're interested in or
want to know when to buy it stick around first let's start with the
Note 8 August 23rd going to to be the day that all will be revealed but hopefully
you'll know everything about it come the 23rd. Twitter user Roland Quandt is saying we're going to see a brand new color deep blue kind of a darker almost
navy blue version the phone it's going to launch alongside the midnight black
and Orchard gray you're getting real excited about picking one of those
phones up you might want to send a tweet at EvLeaks who claims it's going to cost
you 1,100 bucks if you live outside of South Korea which is not going to be a
cheap phone it's going to be hard for Samsung I think to justify that price even with the specs that we're going to talk about what you can expect from an $1,100
phone Snapdragon 835 improved RAM from the S8 so from 4 to 6 gigs of RAM a
3,300 mAh battery which like I shouldn't have to
say it but just in case it'll be it'll be non removable I think the camera is
going to be a big selling point a big thing Samsung is going to push with the Note
8 it should have not one with two sensors the first one should be a 12
megapixel telephoto sensor with a three time zoom it should also have a 13
megapixel sensor for a wide-angle shot so the first time we've seen that dual
sensor setup on a flagship Samsung phone of course the SPen for SPenny type
things the only way I can see Samsung getting away at 1100 price point is if
the fingerprint reader is built into the screen all the renders all the leaks all
the cases showing on the back and the same really uncomfortable placement that
we saw on the s8 they can put that thing in the screen I would happily view like
here take my money let's jump to Google's own flagship the Pixel 2 listen we
can call spade to spade I love the Pixel phones but the design the phone itself
the big chin it's not like the most pretty phone to look at and look
like that should be rectified come October when we see the Pixel 2 and it
should look damn gorgeous new color option should come and it should have
the power to match the beauty it might be the first phone to actually ship with
qualcomm latest chip the Snapdragon 836 which should be about ten percent faster than 835 and if you
remember back from the Pixels first announced that shipped with an 821 chip inside we should also see much thinner bezel almost that sort
of edge to edge thing that we're trying to expect now from flagship phones no
word on wireless charging built-in but it's going to be metal not going to be
there it's going to be LG made but sort of aped features from HTC U11 the
squeezy side hopefully will be customizable but allegedly it'll just
launch Google Assistant. So if you Apple faithful last but definitely not least iPhone
8 Forbes unleashed a ton of news let's our notifications which ordinarily
would be that exciting Apple is allegedly going to move them from the
top to the bottom and almost a touch ID type area depending on what app you're using
it'll interact with you and the phone that could be kind of cool and I've
lamented on the little kind of cutout at the top of the screen the speaker is
going to be supposedly it's not going to be where the screen is going to extend
up to it'll show things like signal strength and date and tie on the screen
will start below that cut out leaving my fears and perhaps your design fears as
well there's been a lot made about touch ID with the new iPhone and where it's
going to be there's been talk it's going to be still on the bottom talk can be built to
the screen on the back and the Apple logo but here's a new one on the side
with a power and lock button it's similar what Sony's done with some of
their phones there's the talk Apple will ditch it all
together use some crazy facial recognition type feature my money's
probably on at least for the time being moving to the back they can't get the in
screen reader working but again that is just a guess and if you're a fan of Apples
white color you are you are out of luck I thought about swearing there but I
I pulled it back supposedly there won't be a white color option at least at
launch perhaps a few months later we'll see the white color launch similar like
how product red hit with the iPhone 7 and you have to wait probably a little
longer to pick one of these suckers up limited quantity allegedly not shipping
until October so there was a lot of allegedly a lot of supposedly that's
why this is rumor roundup these are all these are all rumors so you've got Note 8
coming soon got a better looking Pixel 2 you got an iPhone 8 with some
fingerprint technology perhaps is built in hitting sometime in October what one of
the three are you most excited about I love the original Pixel I think if they
can fix the design going to be a killer phone I think what Samsung does that their
screen is absolutely incredible and I'm excited for Apple to bring a new
design to the table with the iPhone 8 so consider me jazz for all three
consider my wallet not jazzed for for all three because it was not going to be
cheap phones if you had to pick one though which phone would you get are you
finally going to make the switch to Android or going to go back to iOS a
you're going to stick with one of other leave in the comments down below and let
me know if you guys like Rumor Roundup you're glad it's back give the video a
thumbs up to let us know we will do more of these till next time I'm Jon Rettinger
from TechnoBuffalo 
Hey I'm Matt the video director here at
TechnoBuffalo and I'm Mark I'm the creative director and we make videos
here at TechnoBuffalo for the past few weeks we've been testing the 27-inch 5k
iMac fully loaded and I've been testing out the eight core iMac Pro so just
like our previous flagship videos we're going to split this verses video into
three different categories we're gonna check out the iMac's design the
performance and the value and at the end of the video we'll declare a winner and
see whether the 5k iMac or the iMac Pro is a better computer for a content creator
so we just picked up the base model iMac Pro a few weeks ago since we made the
switch to Final Cut Pro X as our main editing software however we're still
using After Effects to create our graphics because that's just what we're
used to before we move into any benchmarks and test though let's just
talk design now we haven't really seen a major design overhaul on any of the iMac
since late 2012 when they remove the optical drives and introduced the 21 and
27 inch iMacs so here we are in 2018 the iMac and Pro variant look exactly
the same other than a space great color and accessories it comes with out of the
box it also comes with bigger vent in the back and you'll also get two extra
USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports a faster 10 Gigabit Ethernet port and a 1080p
FaceTime camera so up front the display on both iMac are completely identical
with the same 5120 by 2880 resolution the same 500 nits of brightness as well
as the same p3 color gamut for that super accurate punchy colors now I
personally love the screen on the new iMacs it's really vibrant it's really
bright and it's just perfect for coloring in post one thing to note
though before moving onto benchmarks speakers are so much louder on the iMac
Pro it's not the best speakers out there but there's more bass its more full than
the regular iMac and it sounds great out of the box
so let's move on to performance our 5k iMac is the top-of-the-line
27-inch model it has a 4.2 gigahertz Intel Core i7 processor 40
gigabytes of RAM which we upgraded ourselves something you can't really
easily do with the iMac Pro it has the Radeon Pro 580 graphics with a gigabytes
of vram and 500 gigabytes of SSD storage the iMac pro is the base model with the
3.2 gigahertz Intel Xeon W processor with 8 cores has 32 gigabytes of RAM
built in a one terabyte SSD and it's got the Radeon pro vega
56 with 8 gigabytes of vram taking a look at Geekbench we first see that the
iMac Pro finished quicker at 1 min 10 seconds with a single core score of 4372
and a multi-core score of 33719 the 5k iMac finished just a couple minutes
later with a single core score of 5675 and a multi-core score of
19,806 so quite a bit lower moving on to Blackmagic speed test you
can see the iMac pro blows the 5k iMac out of the water with its three gigabyte
write speed and two gigabytes reads speed the 5k iMac on the other hand is just
slightly behind the pro with a 1.8 gigabyte write speed and two gigabyte
read speed now in Cinebench the 5k iMac got an OpenGL score of 120 frames per
second and a CPU score of 900 the iMac pro got an OpenGL score of 118 frames
per second but a CPU score of 1641 now moving on to some more realistic tests
we moved to Final Cut Pro 10 we downloaded a six second 8k clip from RED
and tried to add color correction and effects to see how these two handled 8K video and it turns out the iMac pro can playback 8k videos just fine where
the 5k iMac has some trouble playing back the files even after its rendered
so we then duplicated this 8K with its effects and colors into a
1-minute file and then exported it the iMac Pro exported it in 11 minutes and 42
seconds while the 5k iMac took a decent amount longer at 20 minutes and 45
seconds after our test finish we tried playing back the exported 8K clip in
QuickTime and both iMacs were unable to playback
video in real time which surprised us moving on to After Effects we exported a
50 second clip that we made from scratch with multiple elements and in 4k the
iMac Pro finished exporting in 13 minutes and 50 seconds while the 5k iMac
exported the same project in 15 minutes and 11 seconds another thing to note
with these tests is besides the time difference there's also a noise
difference with the fans in the time we've been using the iMac Pro not once
have we heard the fans kick on or if they are on we can't hear them whereas
with the 5k iMac it sounds like a plane's about to take off so clearly the
iMac pro is the more beefier system but it's also more expensive but how much
more is it the 5k iMac we bought with the extra 32 gigabyte kit we installed
ourselves costs roughly around 3050 dollars and our base model iMac Pro
costs five thousand dollars so we're looking at almost $2,000 price
difference between the two systems obviously the 5k iMac is the better bang
for the buck but if you're looking for a computer that will grow with you for the
next three four or five years the iMac Pro starts to look appealing sure for
most of the tests we did the difference may not seem worth the price difference
but for the tests that are a bit more forward-thinking like editing 8K
large After Effects files the iMac Pro handles these way better so if you're
looking for a computer that will be able to grow with you for the next few years
the iMac Pro is the way to go especially if you run a business or rely on a
computer to make a living it's a larger investment up front that can help you
earn more in the long run as creative professionals if you're in the market
for a new computer to edit or create videos for YouTube or whatever else you
want to create the base model 8 core iMac Pro is definitely worth the extra
two thousand dollars and it's the clear winner here that extra boost in
performance will save you some time rendering exporting and if you need even
more power you can upgrade to a ten core or even an 18 core computer for way more
power than what we have here while on the 5k iMac this is the best that you
can get on pretty much every front you can't go wrong with the iMac Pro anyways

this is the Note 8 I think it's
impossible to talk about and review the Note 8 without looking back a little
bit talk about the note 7 we know what happens to battery ant their recalls
Would have been easy for Samsung here I think to play a totally safe and release a
phone with minimal upgrades to make sure there weren't any issues and a lot of
ways they did that but there's still a lot of innovation in the note 8 that
I found in my about four and a half days of testing with it so the story with the
note has always been the s-pen and the screen and that sort of sits above at
the very top of Samsung's hierarchy of phones above the galaxy s line and the
screen here is gorgeous albeit gigantic it's 6.3 inches and this thing is
absolutely beautiful as you'd expect from Samsung Super AMOLED technology in
fact I would have said this is the most beautiful screen I'd ever seen until I
saw the OLED panel on the V30 so this takes the cake as the second-best screen
that I've seen and the reason I'm saying second best over what the S8 or the S8
plus has this thing is actually 22% brighter than the s8 screen which is a
huge amount and it makes a difference when you're in direct sunlight if you
turn the brightness all the way up while you're in a darker room you're going to
burn your eyeballs out the screen here gets incredibly bright which is really
nice to see so a 6.3-inch phone this is the same size as Samsung's
like old-school Galaxy mega it's only 0.1 inches bigger than the Galaxy S8+ but that point one inches makes a difference this phone is not the most
ergonomic feeling it looks like an S8 plus kind of with the infinity display
but the design isn't as aesthetically pleasing as it is on those phones it
feels a little boxier doesn't feel as thin as those devices so it's bit tough
ergonomically and especially makes it tough with a fingerprint reader which is
still in the same spot that it was on the s8 and the S8+ next to the
camera and there are two camera sensors we'll talk a lot about those but on a
bigger device it's even harder to find in fact the buttons almost flush they
can get doubly hard to find and if you are left-handed don't even bother trying
to use a fingerprint reader the other stuff from the s8 line of phones are
still here you still have the iris scanning face unlock and of course you
can use a pin or a swipe password it's a lot of ways
to unlock your device rounding out the screen it's bright it's beautiful
it's probably one of the best displays on the market as you'd expect from
Samsung's the aspect ratio is the same eighteen
and a half by nine but you get used to HDR plus if you can watch HDR content on
Netflix if you're streaming it if you're carrier is not gonna downgrade the
quality looks incredible here on the device so screen aside the biggest
reason I think people get the note is the s-pen it's here you can't put it in
backwards it's got a IP68 just like the phone does and it works really well and
Samsung's updated what it can do via software so it lives in the bottom right
hand corner you pop it out you can start writing right on the screen like you
could with the note 7 except now you've got multiple pages so you can just sort
of keep writing page down keep writing and page down and it works really well
I've had very minimal latency it's a great palm rejection it's an awesome way
to sort of take notes to jot notes down does a lot more than that it'll do live
translation now I'll do it by sentences whether or not you like the S pen is
gonna depend on how much you're gonna use it I use it mostly to draw pictures
of trains with my son it's nice for editing screenshots and stuff it's not
necessary for me I know a lot of you folks really want to have it and if
you're debating whether or not you want to get this or the s8+ having the option
to always have the s-pen it's certainly a nice benefit so performance used to be
a category I talked a lot about when it comes to flagships nowadays they're all
plenty fast there an extra two gigabytes of RAM in here versus the S8
and the S8+ so there's six gigs as opposed to four and things are fast
whether you're multitasking using multi window playing games editing
pictures whatever the phone's gonna be fast with no slowdown whatsoever
64 gigs of internal storage but of course you can use the micro SD card I'm
putting as much storage as you can find that's available I believe it will support
up to 2 terabytes which I don't think even exist yet other thing is that no
dates can be aware of that maybe you didn't know it's got support for gigabit
LTE which is going to be the fallback for when 5g hits so t-mobile Verizon
AT&amp;T and Sprint have all started rolling out gigabit LTE
or going through the near future and when you get access to it it will be
really fast if you're on your phone it's gonna be a little more future-proof note
8 even the S8 and S8+ support the technology as well on the
software front it's pretty familiar from the s8 and s8 plus it's version
8.5 of Samsung's user experience which is what they used to call TouchWiz there
are few notable additions so first in the edge panel you've got something
called app pairing so Samsung uses multi window so you can have one app on top
one app on bottom but now you can actually put both of those apps into a
single icon on the edge panel so for me if I'm watching video and using email I
can set that up so when I hit a button it'll automatically launch it the way I
want a lot of apps you can do that with it just makes it a lot easier so now I'm
sort of dragged apps around and I think that means that people knew what the
window was there but rarely use it so Samsung's trying to put that in front of
you and make it way easier to do so I started using the Galaxy Note 8 from a
galaxy s 8 so things here we're very familiar the Samsung user experience
they used to call it TouchWiz is 8.5 it's a newer version and things look
really good here I've become a huge fan of Samsung software I know a lot of
folks give Samsung a lot of grief and I used to as well but starting with the s7
things got really good here and actually prefer Samsung's take on Android almost
over anything else there used to be the rule that Samsung phones slowed down
over time and that was true I think from the galaxy s5 and older generations of
phones but haven't tried the same thing device since then that's no longer the
case I use my Galaxy s8 for about five months
no issues I had an s7 before that no slowdown at all if you have that me
preconceived notion not an issue here with the note 8 so one of the other big
upgrades from the Galaxy s8 and s8+ is the camera so now you have two sensors
here it's got a wide-angle and a telephoto it's really nice you can do
two times optical zoom ten times digital you just hit a button we've seen that UI
before where I think Samsung hit a homerun though is with the live focus so
if you don't know what that means you can create kind of a blurred effect
behind a subject and does it all with software now we've seen that before
we've had at portrait mode on iOS the oneplus 5 has it built in Samsung did a
couple cool things so first if you use the Samsung gallery app you can edit it
after the fact it looks almost DSLR quality before you started zooming it so
other sort of camera niceties shots in low light will actually look
surprisingly good in direct sunlight typical Samsung fashion a little bit
overexposed but the pictures look really bright and vibrant
both the sensors here of optical image stabilization so if you have a shaky
hand you're taking pictures on a bus for example they look
really good so I imagine that Samsung was a little gun-shy and overly cautious
when it came to battery we've got a 3300 mAh power
battery in here as opposed to 3500 on the S8 plus and samsung
claims is smaller because of the ten nanometer technology in the Snapdragon
835 which the same processor in the galaxy s8 and S8+ but haven't any
battery issues so again I was coming from a galaxy s8 by the end of my
day I was generally yet maybe twenty five thirty percent and I was about the
same here with the no date with the exact same usage so it appears that
they've done a really nice job with software managing battery and at some
point in the future when Oreo makes its way to notate battery life should even be
improved but you can get through a full day easily if you want to charge the
battery of course it's USB-C it's got fast charging and it's got wireless fast
charging as well and of course other stuff you'd expect like ip68
so but not always perfect in the note world even when you've got volume all
the way up on a phone call the speaker up to your ear was not that loud it was
quieter for me than it was on the s8 no DAC built in the speaker using
speakerphone it was seen the music is not overly loud either so I probably
recommend either a good pair of bluetooth headphones or if you want to
plug in headphones you can do it no DAC again but it does have a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack built-in and a big knock on the phone it's really the phone itself
it's the color choices I don't know why Samsung does this they release other
colors and different regions just release all the colors for everyone the
u.s. kind of got shafted in the color Department we've got black and Orchard
gray ordered gray looks nice but the rest of the countries got a
gorgeous-looking deep sea blue there's a maple Gold you have to kind of wait for
those colors to make their way out here and they eventually will but if you want
to buy a phone at launch you're kind of limited Samsung sent us the black
version and this is a fingerprint magnet it's the same sort of shiny black we had
on the s8 or the si+ so I recommend putting a skin on it you've got a deep
brand skin on ours a link to them down below and also Bixby's here with its
Bixby button yeah I mean I've talked about Bixby at length for me it's
unnecessary Google assistance here which has been plenty good enough but if you
want to use it bixby vision Bixby voice are both
here and they do what bixb does if you decide to set it up or or not remap the
button it so as you'd expect it's not a cheap phone depending on where you buy
it between nine hundred and thirty nine hundred fifty bucks but it's tough talk
about price because Samsung does ton of sales it's gonna be an expensive phone
regardless if you have an S8 and s8 plus it's probably not worth the upgrade
you're coming from a note five earlier device we're going to really want to
consider what Samsung has done here with the note eight it's an incredible bit of
hardware it is a big phone though and for a lot of people that might be a turn off I
recommend feeling it in your hand before you go ahead and buying it if you wear
tight pants or shorts with shallow pockets it's going to fall out or feel
really unwieldy for you what do I think about the note eight is it the phone
you've been waiting for you skipping for maybe what Apple has to come next if
you've already pre-ordered one I wanna know what you guys think if you liked
the review please give it a thumbs up we always appreciate it certainly helps
until next time I'm Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo you 
so I kind of got to you guys a bit of a bit of a secret it's dirty dirty secret haven't shared much online I don't know the code and not just like I can only codes like small things like I'm not a code at all I've tried I failed tried and failed again I've got three different books on JavaScript to learn how to code and I feel like it's a big gap in my geek cred so I'm gonna fix myself I'm gonna better myself and I got something that looks looks kind of fun that'll help me learn how to code we got Berto off camera Berto can oh so supposedly reason I was kind of attracted to Cano aside from its it's pretty red box is that it makes coding super simple it's drag-and-drop coding like scratch which which for me makes sense if you use JavaScript if you're more advanced and it'll work with a Mac or a PC the self-contained computer with ports go take a look we've got make a lightboard stickers which one which one looks like me let's go the guy who's so pale you see through just like just like me and and Berto off camera from berkos bulletin all right so so you got going on here all right essentially this is a single board computer with the LED array just snap on top of it but it looks like Santa fancy so pull that out to the side we got some batteries it's got three USB ports on there for accessories we got Mike USB charging cable you got a case to hold it in and more stuff for that case more things for the case and we got this thing I love this is we'll figure out what this is all right here is the pixel brain cases oh it's a mode dial and these are joystick buttons case you're wondering so far so good I haven't broken yet it's got first impression buttons are very clicky nice it's like an old-school HTC phone now had the joystick all right this one push that in there all right time for the mode dial go ahead and do that each turn sends a signal to the brain and it snatch it like this okay now that you like that all right place a battery in shiny connectors first so there third there there's that and there's that I think that's the shiny connector all right all right powered on great now keep it strong and safe let's make a case all right so to front the case on a flat surface I can do that [Music] all right make sure the port speak out see the port speaking out you see it mark you see him that's what he's kept falling out because it didn't have the case to keep it in so wasn't my mistake I'm gonna try and plug it in because I've got a newer generation MacBook Pro okay dongle life all right so nothing has changed is exactly the same that's said if we had before let's plug this in all right so now I'm in the critic I can build ones different stuff in their training apps let's go to make a light show okay so I've got the canvas or I can go into the JavaScript if I want to do that but I am not that good so I've got these golden diamonds some what to do I'll push next all right so control this is control so every one seconds do something so what I wanted to do when the app start every one second I'll go to light board turn light on to then drive that there you go I did something look I did that I so I went through and did some of the challenges that you can tell by my proper rainbow in my light challenge I'm probably the best coder that's ever lived so they set it up kind of a cool way you've got a canvas where it's heard a lot of the drag-and-drop stuff like I said like scratch you go and you can see how things connect and they have different colors and you go and drag things down below or off to the right and the program will execute them and if you want to see if the JavaScript is you can see that as well if you want to sort of learn the JavaScript or if you already know you can program directly into there but it was really simple and it starts off very simply I started off just lighting one pixel that I moved that pixel around then I created a light strip and I got to change colors and I got to do a little little color dance and serve goes to show and you can have a foundation for coding you know strip using this drag-and-drop framework ultimately you'll learn some JavaScript as well as you're going to look which is kind of cool to see so as you go through and finish your own challenges or if you decide to create your own project on the candle kit you could also share it around lang community which they've appropriately called Kanna world you can check out other people have created you can leave a comment or decide to remix other creations you can use what other people have done you can improve or modify and make it better and show your programming skills you can use across multiple platforms either Mac or PC can't oh don't care this was it was the Meccano asked me to take a look at this and something that I wanted to try they did spawn to the video something something I really wanted to learn and I want to sort of share kind of share it with you guys so this is something that you want to try we'll put a link here and link to it down below they also be a five dollar off coupon down there cupen if you want to try it so if you guys go to code leave in the comments down below give me a thumbs up cuz I tried I'm really trying to learn how to code and if I feel the encouragement the community love I will share the stuff that I'm making with Meccano with you guys and you guys need some advice I'm learning how to code [Music] you [Music] 
this versus video is brought to you by audible the best way to take your audio books with you anywhere you want to go on any device you want to use two phones seemingly identical looking we got the iPhone eight plus and the iPhone 7 plus if you can't tell the difference between these two phone by looking at the front you are like most people because I was kind of lying to you this is the A+ and this is a 7 plus they look identical from the front the back and the internals are another story I know a lot of you guys are debating whether or not to upgrade to the 8 maybe you want to wait for the iPhone 10 or maybe you're coming from an older iPhone or Android so I want to take these two phones and compare them head-to-head and decide if you should pick up the iPhone 8 stick with what you've got or perhaps wait for the 10 or another device let's jump in I'm gonna focus mostly on the plus miles here since those are the higher end of the devices but the non plus models almost everything when to talk about it's going to be pretty close to identical so looking at these phones they look very similar in fact the iPhone 8 is the fourth iteration of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus design that we've seen not say it's a bad design but it is a very familiar design but it's definitely the best version of it and I mentioned the Front's of these devices look identical but I was actually surprised how different the backs actually look with the glass back and the glass back brings one big difference with two phones you are getting qi wireless charging and I'll talk about Apple's air power thing that's coming some time next year this is true wireless charging I put this phone on my samsung wireless fast charger and it wirelessly charge which is really nice to have about having to deal with a third party case wireless charging is a big deal for me it may not be a giant deal for you but if out the convenience was putting your phone on a pad huge props to the iPhone and I guess the apples monitor here is was better like than ever but it is definitely here another surprising difference between the phones is actually the colors so the iPhone eights are available in silver space grey and gold and all three colors look vastly different than the last gen phones so I've got the silver right here which i think is actually a beautiful color but it doesn't look silver looks more eggshell white the goal as more of a muted gold the space gray is kind of a darkish black gray hue different than sort of the straight and matte black we had with the last gen the colors are very different I imagined by designs the phones can look different if you want a phone that's going to sort of just aesthetically appear to be a different device it did a nice job with the eight actually really liked all three colors I'm gonna get the same things out of the way about these phones the big disappointment for me other screens the same 5.5 inch 1080p 401 PPI screens we've seen for years it's not a bad screen they just don't look just crisp you flock what's the opposite of crispy soggy soggy I mean it looks a little soggy if you used a modernist Samsung device you can see definitely see a difference in the screen and that's where you may want to wait for the iPhone 10 it's getting a higher res screen there's actually going to be made by Samsung it does bring a true tone display which is nice it doesn't do that much for me you can sort of change the way the screen looks spending on your environment it's fine it's not gonna be a differentiating factor we're not you should buy the phone or upgrade from the seven so the mortal here despite true tone display the screens our screens are pretty much identical from purely spec standpoint these phones read almost identical at least on paper same camera hump and all they both had the same from 12 9 pixel sensor the same set of megapixel sensor on the front the same wide-angle F 1.8 aperture in the same 2.8 telephoto so the a 11 Bionic chip inside which we'll talk more about it's gonna do a lot more processing than what the a10 fusion chip could do so the pictures are going to look different despite the hardware being relatively similar so bear that in mind there's obviously a big difference on paper with the a 11 chip versus previous generation I thought what's that going to mean to the end-user Apple's not about raw horsepower about user experience and it's a fast user experience on the iPhone 8 I never thought the 7 plus was a slow foam but you see the difference here opening up apps opens up faster on the iPhone 8 plus that's something you gonna notice and perhaps will add up over time to a lot of time other things you're gonna do like gaming of course are here a Ark it's gonna be nice and fast I think you're gonna be very quick on the iPhone 8 and if you want a phone that's going to last you for years I get the feeling the iPhone 8 and 8 plus are going to be a foam that's going to be quick for a long time the difference appears to be drastic over the iPhone 7 plus the A+ has a bit of a smaller battery but supposedly processor improvements on the a11 will know that milliamp hour difference they should get the same battery life on both devices price a big trimming factor now if you pick up any phone the iPhone 7 and 7 plus are still obviously less expensive options starting at 549 or $6.99 depending on the 8th of 7 or the plus the 8 got a $50 price bump or what they used to be when the 7 and 7 plus was new it's now at $6.99 or $7.99 as your baseline I want to thank my friends audible for making this vs. video possible you probably know audible chances are already using audible but if you are not you should definitely check them out this is what I use anytime I am in my car right now I'm listening to James Patterson's black a book it's my third book by him I really like the guy who's doing the narration on it but I change phones a lot so I love the fact that I can always pick up where I was in my audio book for that I'm using the new iPhone 8 or the Galaxy Note II transfers all the books over for me went on a bit of a kick with historical fiction now I'm back to kind of regular fiction I'm waiting for the new Dan Brown book to hit sometime next month it's the next one in the Robert Langdon series so I'll be my next book we've got more than books there - they've got original audio shows they got news comedy kind of anything you can listen to audibles giving away a free 30-day trial you also get a free audiobook to go with that if you want to check it out go to audible.com slash techno we link to it here and also down below so that's my opinion on the iPhone 8 and a plus but what I think doesn't matter when you think of what you do with your dollars do and are you gonna put that hard-earned cash towards a brand new shiny phone let me know in the comments down below find a comment that gives a good insight we'll pin it to the top and you can you can be be well-known there until next time I'm John Ranger and techno-bubble [Music] 
As a college student I've been dreaming
of this perfect laptop something between an ultra portable laptop that slim and
lightweight and something like a regular laptop that's powerful but not exactly
slim for the past month I've been using razors latest Ultrabook the Blade Stealth
and I have to say it's not the laptop of my dreams but it's pretty darn close i'm
Robert Rosenfeld from TechnoBuffalo and this is a review of the 2017 a Razor
Blade Stealth so first things first this is the gunmetal version of the Stealth and
it's only available in the 13-inch model and with that gunmetal stealth you're
gonna lose a couple of things you're not gonna get that backlit illuminated Razer
logo on the exterior of the laptop and you're not gonna get the option for the
all the colors of the rainbow RGB chroma backlit keyboard Razer is
really going for more of a business kind of an understated for lack of a better
word stealthier looking laptop for an audience that wants it and those two
things you're gonna lose but I don't think it's that big of a deal so one of
the first things that stood out to me about this laptop was just how it was
built and how light it is and I know that we live in this digital age and
it's kind of assumed that college students don't use textbooks anymore and
as much as I wish that was true it's not exactly true I still have to carry a
bunch of books for classes so the weight of my laptop really doesn't matter its
then it's lightweight it comes into under three pounds and it's just built
to feel very premium for the price tag that this thing comes in I wouldn't
really expect anything less so it's a slim and lightweight altra book but it's
made by Razer so the specs aren't going to be too bad inside this thing is a
dual core i7 processor 16 gigs of dual channel memory a 256 gig pci based SSD
and Intel HD 620 integrated graphics and yes it's got integrated graphics but
we'll go back to that in a minute one of the most important things on a
laptop is the display and the display on the Stealth is actually really good it's
a 13 inch quad HD plus display with a resolution of 3200 x 1800 like you're
getting a smaller version but it's a really good looking screen watching
videos on this thing was a pleasure colors just seemed to pop off the
display text was super sharp even just plain text on a webpage look really good
very easy to read it's a really nice display
it also has touchscreen capabilities built in which is really nice and it
works well in Windows 10 though I'd say for the 98% of the time I didn't care
about the touchscreen it was just a really good display I like that Razer
didn't make any sacrifices to push that touchscreen technology into the display
but as good as this thing is indoors outdoors is where it really starts to
crumble if I'm outside like this on an overcast day I just can't see the screen
very well the screen just doesn't get very bright and that's really my biggest
knock on this thing is that I love this display inside but outside it just
doesn't look good if it's even readable at all but for as bad as this display as
outdoors I can almost forgive that entirely just for how good this keyboard
is everywhere it's just a really good keyboard I've typed a lot over the past
month on this everything from notes in class to slack messages to emails to
papers and it's just a really comfortable keyboard to type on it
doesn't have as much travel as a full-size mechanical keyboard but if you
compare this to the chiclet style on the new Apple laptops like on the MacBook in
the MacBook Pro I would totally any day of the week prefer this keyboard over
that just because it has a little bit more travel and it feels more like a
full-size keyboard below that keyboard is a full-size trackpad which I also
really happen to like on the 2017 version of the Stealth it now supports
Windows 10'  s precision drivers that means it supports gestures it's very fluid
very nice to use and I just really had a good time using it and as a whole it's a
really good sized trackpad especially considering that this is an ultrabook
speakers built into the Stealth are pretty good they're laptop speakers so they don't
carry a lot of bass or a lot of volume but they're decent if you're just gonna
listen to music or watch a couple of videos I know that battery life is
always a very hot button issue when it comes to laptops especially ultrabooks
and I'm pretty happy to say that I got a really good battery life out of the
Stealth I was easily able to make it throughout a full day of classes with
note-taking and web research and reading a bunch of PDF documents online also
with a little video watching and maybe a little video editing sprinkled in there
as well but then again do keep in mind that this is an ultrabook
so any CPU intensive task is gonna eat away at that battery life though the
Stealth does have USB type-c so you can charge this thing with a battery bank on
the go if you want speaking of USB type-c let's talk i/o
the blade Stealth has two USB 3.0 ports a headphone jack a full size HDMI port and
a USB type-c thunderbolt port you can use for charging as well as any
fast storage devices or something like a razor core as a student I spent a
majority of my day researching things taking notes in class maybe watching a
couple videos in between classes and maybe a little gaming here and there and
happy to say that the blade handles all that really well I was able to  jump between
Chrome and Evernote and watching videos and email pretty much any multitasking
this thing was able to handle I was also able to do a little bit of video editing
in Premiere and I was able to edit 1080p video on the Stealth just fine
though I did have a little bit of issue with 4k as to be expected
I could actually still edit a 4k timeline but I'd have to drop the
playback quality way down I was able to do some light gaming with the Stealth I
could play rocket League at 60 frames per second on low to medium HD settings
I could play battlegrounds though it really didn't run very well this really isn't
targeted to gamers though it's made by Razer mainly because of that integrated
intel HD graphics system it's just not powerful enough to do a lot of heavy GPU
intensive tasks however with all that being said because this thing does
support thunderbolt over USB type-c plugging in a razor core with a decent
GPU in there totally changes the story at our office we paired the stealth with
a razor core with a 980ti inside and the results were completely different we
were able to render 4k video in premiere 80% faster and playback the 4k
video in the timeline at full resolution flawlessly we were able to go back and
play battlegrounds at high settings and easily maintain 60 frames per second
throughout as well as go back and play rocket league with ultra high settings
and get some crazy high frame rates obviously I know with the razor core
you're paying an additional price for that piece of hardware plus a GPU but I
know plenty of people who have a beastly gaming rig in their dorm room or
apartment and a puny little laptop or the opposite with a heavy desktop
replacement laptop with no desktop inside their apartment or dorm room the
razor core kind of gives you the best of both worlds you can have a super slim
lightweight portable laptop but take it back to your dorm room or apartment plug
in one cable and turn it into a beastly gaming rig so let's get down to it this
is a $1,400 ultrabook and for that price you expect a couple of things you
want a well-built laptop with good specs and a computer that will handle pretty
much anything that you're going to throw at it that's also going to be slim and
lightweight and portable and I think that the razor blades stealth checks all
those boxes the 2017 blade stealth is almost a laptop of my dreams
I love how portable it is I love that I can take it around with me pretty much
anywhere I liked how it performed and despite my issues with the screen and
the integrated graphics system I really can't recommend this thing more
especially if you're paying a premium price like this 1,400 bucks you want
something that's going to last you four years of college and well beyond that
I think this thing it'll definitely stay on the test of time so what do you guys
think of the 2017 razor blade stealth I've had a blast using this thing over the
past few weeks and I'd love to hear what you guys have to say in the comments
down below thanks so much for watching this video guys it's been a pleasure
once again i'm Robert Rosenfeld from TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you guys in the next video you 
It's time for the world to meet the
iPhone 10 just don't call it the iPhone X the true successor to the iPhone is
here and there's a lot of technology packed into its 5.8 inch OLED package
also getting announced today was the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus so
poor one out for what would have been the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s plus the
leaks were right the phones look like we expected them to look it looked like
this available in space grey or silver but there's a lot of Technology perhaps
we didn't know about first the screen technology it's OLED and Apple said they
waited on OLED for sort of obvious OLED reasons it wasn't the best in direct
sunlight wasn't the best for brightness they said they fixed all of those issues
creating a really bright and vibrant display and they are dubbing this new
display super Retina display and I think most exciting and probably most
importantly we finally have a true higher resolution display from Apple
this thing has a resolution of 2436 by 1125 you can do the math it's got a 458
PPI now it's by no means the highest pixel per inch of any 5.8 inch phone out
there but it is the highest PPI that Apple has ever announced and they claim the
screen looks absolutely beautiful at least it appears to look really nice and
it's got the same design that we expected it is edge to edge with the cut
out on the top for the cameras we're gonna talk a lot about those cameras
Apple is calling that whole cut out the true depth sensors that they do a lot
with the phone but the cutouts on the left and the right are gonna do a few
things so first one on the left is where you're going to see your time on the
right you'll see notifications like your Cellular strength you'll
see when it connects to Wi-Fi we're also gonna use those for the UI as well
our initial thought was that those areas are going to be kept for only those
notifications but actually that area the screen is gonna be used in a lot of apps
so if you're viewing a video there's gonna be a cut out your video picture is
the same way third party apps as well so we're on the home screen only we see
those notifications up at the top so bear that in mind no matter what you're
doing already have a little bit of a cutout doesn't look to be a giant issue
with the phone but the cutout is definitely going to be there this is
something I've been screaming at for years and we finally have it from Apple
we now have wireless charging and I give Apple credit for
using the Qi standard so any Qi chargers but not you've got a wireless
charger from Samsung or LG or Belkin or Mophie whatever you want you can now
charge your iPhone 10 and also be able to charge your iPhone 8 and iPhone 8
plus but of course it wouldn't be Apple without sort of their own spin on it
so they announced something new called Airpower the new technology it's gonna go
in conjunction with a new piece of hardware that can charge multiple i
things at once you can charge your iPhone you could put your AirPods on
it and your Apple Watch series 3 which got announced on it no kind of charg it
all at once with a cool animations on the phone that's not gonna ship till
next year but you got to know at least it's Qi wireless charging is here
powering this whole phone is Apple's new A11 Bionic chip in Apple's first
in-house design to GPU should get 70% better performance then last gen that's
the same chipset that's gonna be found on the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus
there's new sort of neural networking processing being done because thing
doesn't have a home button and without a home button don't have touch ID so enter
face ID this is facial unlocking this isn't like the old-school Android facial
lock and we sort of looked at your face and unlocked apples doing crazy stuff
with the cameras here Apple's using infrared and dot projection to actually
make a map of your face and using that reference when you want to unlock your
phone so the way it works you'll pick up the phone pull up to your face and it
will presumably unlock now the demo the Craig Federighi did didn't work the first
time didn't appear to be overly fast either perhaps that was just jitters or
pre-release software but I'm hoping it's going to be fast cuz a success of the
iPhone 10 is gonna rely on face ID if you want to unlock your phone aside from
just looking at it you can now swipe up from the bottom in fact that's where
you're going to get home any of your apps it's just a swipe up from the
bottom multitasking is kind of similar you swipe up from the bottom and then
yeah sort of wait a minute and then multitasking will show up and you can go
wherever you want to go and you can use the bottom to swipe between apps you can
go swipe to the left to get different apps or swipe to the right to go back if
you want to launch control center you go ahead and just swipe down from the upper
right and that's where control center is going to live it's a new way to interact
with your iPhone Apple talking a lot about a new experience with the phone
how the user is going to interact and it's all
centered around that camera system centered a lot around face ID so the cameras on
the iPhone 10 went from this way to that way but in that transition they gain dual
optical image stabilization the apertures changed a little bit
they got support for of course the portrait mode of the new lighting
portrait effects which will work in real time or after the fact and the
front-facing camera now supports both of those portrait things as well so you can
take beautiful bokeh selfies or do studio lighting with your portraits and
pricing we knew this wasn't going to be cheap it's gonna come in two
configurations it's the same as the iPhone 8 and the 8 Plus 256 or 64 GBs you're
going to be starting at 999 dollars you'll be able to place your pre-order
on October 27th and it's going to ship on November 3rd so in time for the
holidays but after the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus so I'll leave this question to
you what do you guys think about the iPhone 10 this is clearly the best that
Apple has to offer it's a competitive phone with a compelling feature set to
compete against the best of Android but is it enough to make you stick with
Apple are gonna go for the lower price iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 plus I really want
to hear your thoughts on this one I'm excited for the iPhone 10 I want to try
face ID I want to see how it works and if it works as promised it might lure
me back to Apple I can't wait to get my hands on it gotta wait a few more months
to do so give the video a thumbs up if you appreciate it for subscription
always helps as well till next time and Jon Rettinger from TechnoBuffalo

Elon Musk's master plan the he laid out
when you first joined Tesla is starting to come to fruition we got a much bigger
picture of what all of that is going to entail at the quarterly shareholders
meeting where we saw the very first render at least peek of the upcoming
small crossover from Tesla the model y and following along that'll mean Tesla
will have the Model s the model 3 which looks like an e the Model X and the
model Y Elon Musk and company really wanted it to spell out sexy. If you're
wondering why it's Model 3 and not model E Ford owns that trademark and
threatened to sue so model wide we now know a little bit more about it you want
to much first Jesus in 2015 we haven't heard much since then Ted claimed it is
released in 2019 but in Tesla time it's probably more likely 2020 or 2021 it will not be based on the model 3 platform that we
previously thought Elon claims they learned a ton developing the Model X
they built that on the Model S platform said it was disaster trying to build two
cars on the same platform so they're going to go for entirely new
architecture for the model y will indeed have Falcon wing doors which have been issue of
contention and I'll probably end up looking like a smaller Model X and I
expected to probably come in higher than the model three price point so expect
probably around fifty thousand when that hits sometime in the next few years we
also learned a lot more about the model three as Tesla is finally getting ready to
push a configurator live and if you saw what Tesla did with the configurator for the
Model S the model extras like uhh drooling to get your hands on all of
those options you're going to be picking your interior colors and to be picking
all kinds of stuff you're going to be out of luck the configurator is going to
be super simple when it comes online in July pretty much is going to be color
and wheel size either 18 or 19 inches and that's going to be it again
harkening back to the Model X Elon Musk said they offered way too many
options and a really messed up their supply lines so the model 3  launch
it's going to be a very simple car don't know battery size yet really don't know
what the final price for the options are going to be your options are going to be
bundled in and also you place an order today you're looking at 
an 18-20 month wait to actually get your car so bear that in mind that would be
enough of Tesla news but Elon Musk also dropped some warnings about the Tesla
semi that was unveiled a little while back there's going to be larger unveil
come September we'll know more about the car and Tesla is working with semi
drivers to make sure that this truck can actually do what they needed to do we
don't know range or battery size or anything else will be compatible
superchargers or have a modular battery packs but you also may see that
something else and something new could be housed the September event when they talk
more about the truck so who knows what it could be maybe they'll do like a Tesla
semi P like 5000 D and it would go 0 to 60 in like 4 seconds which is just
insane but it's kind of the insanity that Tesla likes to do so we've got a
much bigger picture about Tesla's master plan we did a whole video on the master
plan the link to it up here and down below if you want to watch it but the
moral was this Tesla wants to speed up the development of sustainable
transportation and that's really been their goal that's why a lot of their
patents they open sourced all the manufactures can use them and start
creating electric vehicles. We're starting to see that really now come to life I'm
pretty excited about the model 3 I'm reservation holder I can't wait to drive
it to try it I don't know how to feel about to look yet a little snub nose is
not my favorite but perhaps they'll change by time we finally see a
release candidate what do you guys think which car you most excited about is the
3 the Y excited to see was bringing sexy back for me I'm excited about the 3
but let's keep the wild looks like the semi is more of like a curiosity thing
for me but leave in the comments down below if you watching more Tesla
coverage video thumbs up to let us know we got a ton of Tesla videos sort of a
passion of mine so I love to talk about it. Till next time Jon Rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo 
so the iPhone 10 is here and I think for a lot of folks it is the iPhone that they've been waiting for full bezel this display the phone looks beautiful the screen is awesome finally high resolution and face ID and with that new way to unlock your phone came a ton of questions especially from me when it comes to security and also real world usage how's it gonna work in direct sunlight what if I grow a beer what if I change my hair Apple made some security claims on stage and it wouldn't work with masks we wanted to test all of these things and some more to see how face ID actually would perform out in the real world this is JB JB does most of our motion graphics and JB also can grow a pretty sweet man beard which he volunteered to do for the past two weeks as dudes our facial hair can change so we're gonna setup face ID with JB with with beard and then we're gonna shave it and see if it see if it works Hey [Music] [Music] so JB's clean clean shave JB embarrasses easily it's a big it's a big deal for him so first beer JB for shave JB leave in the comments down below most importantly let's try face ID and it's the first time we've tried it since he shaved unlock your foam it works so polarized sunglasses face ID if you're driving you're probably gonna have these suckers on and you're in a car see how it works unlocked so what about bizarre Matt looking polarized sunglasses let's see how these work that worked - so what about spider-man's wildered glasses alrights gonna shop nope I guess these crazy goggles keeping things keep my eyes out of it or it's not letting the dot see my face but if you're if you're a welder face that he is not gonna be a friend so one of the biggest security concerns I had with face ID was can somebody unlock your phone while you're sleeping let's let's test it doesn't work no dice your information safe and sneaky bag so like what if you're a really sound sleeper or maybe they took a sleeping pill no didn't work thank goodness house creepy so Apple made a point in their keynote to say face ID will not be fooled by a mask am I talking like Halloween mask I mean like a nightmare fuel mask that looks just like your face this one was made using only three stills you could get those stills from any video you might have of somebody so let's go ahead and see if this will work creepy Jabberwocky nope no dice so in another scenario we wanted to see a face ID could unlock in like the middle of a night if you're laying in bed and complete darkness unlocked no problem so a concern I know a lot of people had was what if you change hairstyles if you're a lady and you can grow bangs you grow your hair out your phone still gonna be able to unlock so we wanted to test it with some wigs alright I have not tried these on yet so we'll see how they look yeah does it work for me see if it works No No does not like this wig did not unlock wig number two my long flowing locks all right see this one works that unlock to the second try did not work the first time Georgie how about Pennywise [Music] Oh loves Pennywise I'm like no problem so a more likely scenario is that you go from long hip to short so we're gonna set up face ID with the wig on and then take it off and see how it works it's complete so let's just check to make sure it works lock no problem all right I'm having having a midlife crisis want to shave my head weight comes off get worried unlock no problem so earlier face unlocking technologies could sometimes be fooled by a picture or a video of the face so let's see how face ID does picture of my face not unlocking so direct sunlight obviously another use case let's see-oh face ID does unlock no problem and since we're outside a more likely use case for sunglasses let's try that again regular polarized unlock no problems weird and matte polarized lenses I'm locked no problem spider-man's goggles still doesn't work so overall I came away pretty impressed with phase ID aside from the notch stealing my hairline it worked about as well as I could expect I was surprised that it didn't work with that one wig but overall with almost everything else it worked well I had a bit of concern that direct sunlight and unlocked really fast when JB shaved his beard I don't you guys could see it but it unlocked almost instantaneously it seems like it takes a little bit longer than when you used to put your thumb on touch ID but there's at the time of you having to move your hand to put it on top of there so it seems like it's about a one-to-one came across at least initially pretty impressed with base I mean we'll use our iPhone 10 in there for to let you know if that changes but in almost every scenario where you expected it to work it did and Serio's where we hoped it wouldn't work it didn't perform so so far so good for face ID but if your expenses been with face ideas it worked for you not work from you I'd like to know leave in the comments down below so JB was choice number two for the beard this has been happening for a long time we tried to get Jesse to shave it for the video but it wasn't being a team player but I'm saying it on camera if we get 30,000 likes on this video Jesse's gonna shave his beard so like the video cuz I wonder what that face looks like without that happen [Music] 
so back in January Razer bought next bit the company that made the robbing an awesome and quirky phone and since that acquisition Ridge has been kind of silent about what their mobile plans were well now now we know meet the razor phone and typical razor fashion there's a lot crammed into this completely aluminum shell so razor took a different approach to the design a lot of manufacturers are going bezel lists and rounded rounded curves and rounded screen razors got a more industrial approach the phone is made as a material in there that's in their laptop so it feels premium it's got a cool metal feel to it it's also more rectangular than what we've seen before it looks very reminiscent to what we saw with the Robin quite obviously you've got a fingerprint reader in the middle the phone on the right hand side you can press in it's really nice to have it there and then you've got two buttons on top almost identical to what we saw on the rub and they're located right squared the middle of a phone coz rager tells us this phones meant to be used when you're playing games or watching movies in landscape it's let me get this one out of the way cuz they're gonna be a billion questions it's gonna cost six hundred and ninety nine bucks you're gonna get a lot for that money or you get 64 gigs internal storage of course you can expand it up to I think it goes up to two terabytes right now typical razor fashion they wanted to cram a lot in here so you've got eight gigs of DDR four RAM which is insane to have the screen is where a lot of the story I think takes place it's a 5.7 two-inch XO LCD panel it's two cases 1440 by 2560 we didn't get a little bit dressing those with the refresh rates 120 Hertz here and what that's gonna mean in like real-world usage and not just on a spec sheet scrolling through stuff is gonna look incredibly smooth it's like a psychosomatic it looks better but it doesn't really when you try this phone you can get it in a store you pick one up and start scrolling through anything it looks incredibly smooth and also when you're watching movies or YouTube videos because a higher refresh rate things should look also smoother tends to be the theme of the razor phone they also went for a wide color gamut so where other devices might give you kind of a bluish hue to the whites this is gonna look actually white so all that stuff is great but I think since it's ray the big reasons behind that refresh rate when it comes to games it's a variable refresh rate so if you're playing a game that needs the full 120 you can do it it'll scale itself down as well if using something that doesn't need the full refresh rate it's kind of dynamic so you can get an insane refresh rate on the phone so they're gonna drain battery which I should mention is four thousand two milliamp hours so you're getting a big old battery in this device other specs are things you'd expect from flagships right now it's got the Snapdragon 835 with the audrina 540 built into it so on the camera front it's got 30 of them and as is in vogue right now it's got two on the back both are 12 megapixel one's wide-angle and one is telephoto 8 megapixel on the front it's shipping with Indra and you get out of the box race has been pretty good updates on the laptop side and presumably a pretty good updates on the phone as well and they did say on the record that got plans for Oreo soon so we're gonna hold them to that when the cool things on the software front the phone is actually shipping out of the box with Nova prime as the default launcher which is awesome if you haven't used Nova it's my go-to for launchers it works really well on out of the box swiping to the right it's also gonna give you Google now so looking at this phone you're gonna you're gonna notice gigantic speakers on the top and the bottom this isn't like a fake like grill it's a sort of psyche out these are gigantic speakers that we had a chance to test out here and check my Buffalo offices and they wouldn't let us benchmark you to see how loud they got because their units still a little running some pre-production software but it got really loud I think more impressively than the volume didn't sound tinny it had a lot of bass especially coming from a phone it's not gonna replace your home theater system but if you want a phone that sounds really good and maybe easy to play some songs for some friends the razor phone does a really nice job with it so writing out the specs no headphone jack does have USB C and they're gonna give you in the box a dongle if you plug in set Dongo you're gonna get a THX certified 24-bit DAC so you can get some high-quality audio in those cans pre-orders are available now link to it down below it's gonna be shipping on November 17th at least in the US the phone will work right out of the box with 18 t-mobile no CDMA support here unfortunately for Verizon and Sprint I did ask her age about that and they said probably not so if you want to pick up this phone either switch to AT&amp;T or t-mobile or if you're on those two carriers then thumbs up for you so all the phone looks and feels pretty awesome there are some things here that might leave you scratching your head and wondering why first there is no waterproofing here razor set it's because of the mesh on the speaker grilles and also it's metal on the back you're not going to have wireless charging so if one or both of those things are important to you it could be a little bit disappointed so no wireless charging for me is a bummer but when you do plug it in to charge it didn't get access to Qualcomm quick charge for plus so it'll charge fast is really what it boils down to the last summation Bluetooth 4.2 it doesn't have bluetooth 5.0 in here so we need that long range bluetooth if you want to share music with friends it's not here so here's the deal with the phone at least for me and why it kind of stands out a little bit so at that $6.99 price point it's not the cheapest throw in the world and it's competing against really the creme de la creme of flagships you want to get this phone if that screen matters to you seeing the refresh is awesome if you watch a lot of movies on your phone you think you might play a ton of mobile games incredible device if you consume a lot of content you're gonna want to look at this phone if you're creating a lot of content you may want to see what else is available wireless charging is important to you if you take your phone in the snow or skiing then you're gonna want to make sure you get a phone that has sort of that IP certification in here it's competing in really crowded waters especially at that price point but the speakers are awesome the screen is really good we'll see how that fares though in our for you but first impression I feel pretty positive about the razor phone it's not cheap it's not bringing everything to the table you can get with competitors but what it does it appears to do what but is that enough for you guys to want to pick it up again six thing that I will put all the links down below if you want to preorder one and if you can pick one up on November 17th when those pre-orders start to arrive then what you guys think and let us know especially what you want us to test as we got this guy in our lab put it through the paces hope you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up we appreciate it the next time John right here [Music] you 
[Music] yes I've been using this laptop for a couple months now and I guess it's probably about time I did a review [Applause] [Music] first and foremost to talk about build quality is part of Dell XPS premium lineup and it feels like a flagship laptop one of my favorite things about this computer though is the screen it's one of the best looking screens I've ever seen on a laptop it comes in a resolution a little under 4k at 3200 by 1800 there's also a 1080p variant color vibrant everything is detailed and crisp and clear it's perfect for editing photos watching movies playing games any sort of content consumption it's going to look great on this device and the cool thing about it it's pretty much bezel is all the way around with five point two millimeters bezels on the tops inside those going this is a small 13 inch to and went on the market right now and the form factor is probably one of the most appealing things to me this is a great travel computer John I went to San Francisco a few months back I think the computer ought to be there now the first time I ever traveled with it since then I've taken with me on pretty much every other trip because it's such a great laptop for what I'm on the go it's lightweight comes in at 2.7 pounds a small form factor makes it really easy to get in and out of my backpack when going through security that's four different modes and you can fold it in there's a traditional tablet mode where you're holding it like a notebook you can also set it down like a kickstand and pull the screen up which is great for watching movies and you're on the plane drop down the tray table set it up the other one too is tent mode where you prop it up one things I wanted to see you there putting it into tablet mode I actually be able to trick some of flight attendant so I could actually use it before you're taking off and in the ticket process on the way there is then we get away with actually keeping it in this mode on the return trip one of the flight attendants spent a little bit of time inspecting my computer and determine that it was actually a laptop after all so I had to put it away that may be of interest to some of you guys that might be using this laptop primarily for travel the hinge is nice and sturdy doesn't feel wobbly or cheap I mean you could pretty much hold the laptop out like this and the screen will stay out on its own so that's really nice so it feels durable zoom embodied laptop feels really well put together very sleek and smooth the interior laptop has carbon fiber a going all around the keyboards nice and smooth it feels comfortable definitely great to type on so let's go comes with a fingerprint reader I didn't find myself using it too much but fast and responsive my preferential waive unlock the computer is using Windows hello I really like using a retina scanner to basically just look at the computer and immediately be logged into my profile let's talk about iOS this computer only comes with USB see we're all kind of moving towards that but if you're an early adopter you're probably gonna need some dongles it comes with you we see the type-a adapter so you will have one of those and the charging cable itself is also USB see it's porcelain of all three and also has a display port on the other side another thing to also keep in mind is that this computer only has a micro SD card reader there's also a headphone jack here and you have a small battery power indicator as well so let me talk a little bit more about this tablet feature the computer that's one of the biggest selling points I think of this device is the fact you can fold it over and you have a stylus and you can use this really nice display of the touchscreen as a writing device I thought it'll be really great for students that need to take notes in class my use cases we were we're doing a spider-man shoot over at the YouTube space I went in and use it furnish the length of a shoot as a thing to take notes on I had my shot lists on there I don't know if it's something that would use on a day to day basis but I really like the features there besides it's really responsive and works well and generally just like having the touch screen it's a really nice feature to have just because sometimes much easier is tap on the screen to select what you're looking for rather than having to navigate with a mouse or using the trackpad holding it back into a tablet activates Windows tablet mode I tried that a little bit personally I'm not a big fan of it for some of you guys that maybe you've been using other windows tablets in the past that might not be a concern for you but it is just there basically the idea around is that make some Windows interface options a little bit more friendly to touch screen use overall I found that I was able to use traditional windows just fine in this set up let's talk a little about performance day to day use it handled everything perfectly fine and that's just typical watching movies web browsing taking notes Word documents and so on I did a little bit like Amy on here plays a person own there's no dedicated GPU it's actually using Intel HD 615 graphics chip those relatively well for lightweight titles I wouldn't expect you to be playing far cry on here crisis or anything like that it's too intensive just keep that in mind if it's not I mean most you guys probably looking this laptop or not using it for gaming primarily but if you wanted to play a few games on there know that they can but it's not going to be the best option for that for this particular review unit we're using Intel 7th gen i7 processors 8 gigs of ram in this one but that can be upgraded 16 and then we have the 256 gigabyte SSD but that can also be upgrade to a terabyte let's talk a little bit about battery that's the most part it does relatively well it's able ops me throughout the whole day when I took it traveling I didn't have any Jews didn't have to plug it in had enough power to watch the movie on the flight San Francisco a little bit of work in between while we were there ingesting footage watching all the clips that we shot from that day and then being able to watch a movie on the way back I've still left with a good 30 percent the one thing that I did fine is a standby time on the laptop isn't the greatest so if I put my laptop away earlier in the week and got it out maybe like on a Thursday I found that generally had to plug it in because the battery be completely exhausted typing on the keyboard feels great it's very responsive it's pretty much what you expect from to any of the Dell XPS laptops if you've used other ones I've got backlighting which is really nice it looks great so in my couple months of using spots up I've really liked it a lot it's a great travel computer I've really been using it it's just between work and home because I'm usually using a desktop at those places but going on trips to San Francisco and other sort of media events that we have this has been excellent for content consumption I didn't find myself on the weekend sometimes just kicking back on the couch watching some movies and using this to spin the tablet mode responding email to take care of any other sort of over new taps that I have it starts at $9.99 which is a relatively competitive price point for laptops of these specs it goes all the way up to fifty 99 which is the model that we have so on all it's been a great travel computer I've really enjoyed using it on my trips if that's something you're looking for then definitely take a look at it hope you guys liked the video until next time I manage it from techni buffalo I'll catch you guys in the next one all right I'm ready for my close-up I know you've had a cure to the surgery because my persona supposed to be not trying to be I was trying to be the douchey tech okay how about a lot of those 
this video is brought to you by LastPass the world's online leading password manager so as we come up to the iPhone 8 announcement I feel like it's time to talk a little bit about Apple before you groan again I want to give a bit of a history so I actually owe my career to Apple all my early videos were Apple focus whether it was my first video talking about the Santa Rosa MacBook Pro or spending way more time that I should talk about the little nipple scroll ball on the former Mighty Mouse apples what got me started in industry I love the products the innovation that went along with it the fact there was a forefront of new technologies I loved what Apple was doing around with the iPhone 6 I started to kind of lose interest in what Apple was doing despite you guys say in the comments I like what I like at a time I don't really have much of a brand Allegiance my phone time since the iPhone 6 and split between Samsung splits between LG HTC s and one plus is that Google made devices and sometimes back to Apple but I don't have a brand that I have to choose or I feel legions to and I need to use I kind of just like what's good for me at the time the past few years that hasn't been abom other than lacking things I think other manufacturers have had things like wireless charging which is very important to me quick charging previously water resistance and a high resolution screen to name a few you look now it's er the flagship Pantheon it's very design a style centric you've got a device like the galaxy s 8 which is mostly all screen when you look at what the iPhone has it's got that giant chin it's got a big button to reminiscent as for the pixel design which to my eye does not look that good it is actually important for me when I pick a phone so it's kind of gravitated away from apples but enter the iPhone 8 at least the rumours of the iPhone 8 is supposed to be and that passion love and excitement is kind of being rekindled the first design I love that Apple is finally moving forward with that screen to body ratio of close to 90% it looks absolutely gorgeous I don't mind if they have to serve the cutout on top for the earpiece make it looks really good the touch ID when it came out I think was pretty revolutionary and how fast and well it worked but it's held back without particular design because it had to be on the front so some mock-ups and renders touch ID on the back I've had it going away using faith in the screens I'm of the mindset the touch ID is going to migrate to the back of the phone for argument's sake on a pursuing that's going to be gone an applicant relying on Anastasia recognition system allegedly going to be called space ID if Apple is relying on face ID enough to take away touch ID it better be damn good I think it's going to be it's got to work in all different conditions gotta work in direct sunlight it's got to work in low-light with sunglasses on with glasses on ones legs flat on a table if it can do that if it can do that really well Apple will be revolutionary again as a new technology you know we've seen iris scanning we've seen other facial recognition systems they never worked that well it worked desc flawlessly if Apple is so confident they're going to remove touch ID for face ID that says a lot no it doesn't work going to be a huge disappointment probably a big still disappointment for Apple I'm starting to get jazzed about what Apple is going to do to design such exponent Apple going back to their roots I think it's gonna be a really cool device and one that might actually bring me back to Apple I'm not cool I do miss IMS its kind of fixing that always have got me back to Apple in previous years I think if Apple pulls off this phone if it's got an OLED screen it's going to out Samsung in a display front which is not easy to do if it ups the resolution to qHD it should look gorgeous it's got the rich true tone display pictures are going to pop text is going to look great I'm starting so you can see them trying to get excited about it you're probably wondering great John like I don't care what you gotta say about this but instead of conversations we have around the office I want to know if I'm alone I know a lot of folks have left Apple me a lot of folks have come back to Apple you guys in the same boat are you waiting on your phone sister so you're waiting on a galaxy update and reading out a note 8 to see what Apple does it already made up your mind you're going to leave or made up your mind or you're going to stick with Apple leave a comments down below before we end this video I want to thank LastPass for sponsoring it and making it possible I'm incredibly forgetful a multiply one that's been hacked in the past so having laptop man in my password relieves all that anxiety I've got a lot of log in for stuff a LastPass automatically filled in with web browser extensions there's a desktop app there's a mobile app stores have my past with me for example I was the first one in the opposite of the day it's got my key card with me and I used my key to unlock our door and the alarm is armed never going to put my password was able to open up black cat find my password and put it into the alarm system before the alarm went off all in about 25 seconds so if you got a hard time remembering passwords or use the same password for everything like a lot of you guys do the last task will help it can create passwords for you to generate passwords with some parameters that you want it's cross-platform we're fun everything that you want to be on whether you're on Windows whether you're on Mac or Android or iOS there's an extension or a dedicated app it's going to work for you you want to keep yourself secure and you're just worried about your passwords or you wanted a versified sort of what you use to keep yourself to cure LastPass is a really great way to go I trust my information to them and you guys should give it a shot as well I want to learn more we'll link to them down below so iPhone 8 what do you guys think again I want to hear your thoughts on it thank you again to LastPass for sponsoring this video even the comments down below let me know if you're excited again for the IFO day if you're coming back to Apple's camp until next time John rende you're from TechnoBuffalo [Music] you [Music] 
for the past several years razors treat at CES it's kind of a showcase of their latest concepts that may or may not hit the market last year we saw a crazy three screen laptop this year they're back with a new take on an old idea that you can just dock your phone inside of a laptop ish thing and give you a brand new experience aside from what your phone's going to give you meat project Linda and before I get into everything that this is let me just say that razor was super clear that this is definitely a concept and they may or may not make it which is surprising because when I held in use it actually worked really well so first looking at this thing it's essentially a blade stealth a bit of extra thickness on the bottom to account for the dockable razor phone you push a button and a retractable USB Secor just does its business with the razor phone with a very cool noise and then you get a full desktop ish OS so there's a lot about the software blink tell you about the hardware first when you put the really beautiful 2k 5.7 inch screen razor phone inside of that dock it becomes a trackpad in the second screen and because it's a glass display actually feels pretty good and the responsiveness was also really good you can do normal desktop ish stuff to fingers to right-click and scrolling was actually really smooth on it the version we saw was clearly not final like it's a concept but razor's ultimate vision is to give you kind of one-to-one versus the phone versus a big screen that you're looking at so they want it to be 13.3 inches in 2k 120 Hertz so that it'll match what's in the razor phone but I'm going to put 200 gigs of storage inside of Project Linda so that if you use a video editing app for example you can have all your files loaded up there or you wanna watch the movies on an airplane you can put whatever you want into that on the other i/o side also has a 3.5 millimeter headset jack they wanted to point out so if you missing that on your razor phone you're gonna have one option there as well it's also a webcam built in the dual array mic so you can do Skype or video chat you want of course USB C is gonna charge this thing and it's got a fifty three point six kilowatt hour battery pack so they're saying you can treat it almost like a portable battery bank you plug it in and it'll be charged cool design Q that razor did was the power button on the razor phones on the side so when it gets docked that's the power button for Project Linda also means you can use a fingerprint reader as well to keep it a little bit extra secure so on the software side you're getting like a desktop ish OS it's actually kind of razor worked with Sentosa to make this experience but it should be pretty familiar so this is where things get tricky I'm not sure who this would be for certainly the Chromebook set might be interested but you gotta have a razor phone in order to use this so perhaps it's more of a proof of concept for what the razor phone can ultimately do there's the kind of product that usually companies don't develop publicly so I give raise your credit for showing something that may or may not ever make it to market right now if it does ever make it to market how many people are gonna be lining up what I imagine will be an expensive offering has yet to be seen but it is really cool and it's cool to see a concept and a company develop out in the open so we got a ton more CES coverage up of course so be sure to subscribe int that little bell icon to know and the next CES videos are coming at you let you guys think about project Linda down below until next time Jon render and TechnoBuffalo [Music] [Music] [Applause] you [Music] 
so let me get the obvious out of the way
right now I am not Jon Rettinger my name is Robert Rosenfeld and I'm on the
video team here at TechnoBuffalo some of you may also know me as Berto from Facebook or
Twitter or Instagram or snapchat but this is not the time for self promoting
I've been given the task the honor to review this Motorola 2017 flagship and
I'm here to make a case for it I'm not here to say this is the most amazing
phone on the market and that you need to go out and buy it right now but I'm not
here to bash it and tell you about all shortcomings and tell you that you
should just completely write it off but I'm here to make a case on why you
should just consider it I want to give you the pros the cons share the specs
and share my experiences with this phone and give you all the information you
need to make an educated decision on whether or not this is worth your
hard-earned money and at least a few years in your pocket so let's start
things off with design this phone is sporting a 7000 series aluminum chassis
and it feels really good in the hand it feels premium but it's also
lightweight and durable there's a bit of a chin on the bottom where the
fingerprint sensor sits there's a little bit of a space of top for the
front-facing camera and the flash so it's not a completely bezel less phone
but it doesn't have to be Motorola didn't go the S8 route and
it looks just fine I think it's a really good looking phone so the phone is
comfortable in the hand it's thin and it's light but all that does come at a
price last year's Moto Z Force had a 3,500 mAh battery inside and this year's newest phone that has all
the latest and greatest technology packs a smaller 2,730 mAh battery inside and as a significant battery decrease in capacity and it does
show I use the phone heavily throughout my four days of testing with replying to
emails and playing games and sending messages on slack and watching videos
and I got through the day comfortably with about 10 to 15 percent remaining
though it wasn't as much wiggle room that I would have liked the phone does
support turbo charging over USB type-c but if you're going to be away from a
charger or an outlet during the day the decrease in battery capacity is
something to keep in mind I don't think it's a deal-breaker but it something to
think about though the battery on this phone was a
little bit of a disappointment the screen on this phone is anything but the
Z2 Force has a Quad HD Super AMOLED display that looks really good colours
pop and they're super vibrant text is sharp and clear watching
anything on this phone is a real pleasure and I really like to display I
think on par with the other flagships
currently on the market besides looking good Motorola's also built some rugged
technology into the screen called shatter shield it should keep it
protected from falling on the floor or falling facedown on concrete but it is a
little bit more susceptible to nicks and scratches if the phone display did
happen to shatter Motorola is backing up their claim with a 4-year warranty that
will cover it so below the display is the built-in fingerprint sensor which I
actually really like it's fast responsive it has some haptic feedback
so it even feels like you're pressing a button and the fingerprint sensor also is
big enough to double as a gesture pad so if you want to remove those on-screen
navigation buttons and just use the gesture pad to navigate your phone you
can do that and it works pretty well on top the phone has a built-in earpiece
which also doubles as its only speaker so if you want to listen to music or
watch any YouTube videos it's good it gets loud enough but it's not going to
give you any kind of 3d sound effect or carry a lot of bass with it it's okay
for listening to some things but if you really want to listen to music on your
phone I'd pick up a Moto Mod one of the biggest differences between last year's
original Moto Z Force and this year's phone is the addition of a new rear shooter
you now have two cameras to work with both are 12 megapixel both have an f/2
aperture but one shoots color and one shoots monochromatic which means it
shoots completely black and white and it's cool for a couple of reasons
Motorola says that this sensor data can be used to make your colorful images
stand out with deeper blacks and better color data you can also go back and
after the fact and choose which part of the picture is black and white in which
part is color it's cool in that sense but I really don't know anyone who would
rather have that over just throwing a black-and-white filter over their photo
and getting a different focal length or or something else that could have
been done with that lens to make it a little bit more interesting photos the
phone took look really good colors are sharp and vibrant I thought the camera
was on par with others on the market currently the front-facing camera is
also pretty cool it has an 85-degree wide-angle lens which is cool for those
selfies there's also a true tone flash if you're in a dark situation and all
your friends are crowded around trying to get a selfie you'll have that flash
to get that natural skin tone and bump up that selfie game so let's talk quickly
about performance this phone is certainly no slouch and it handled
everything that I threw at it inside the phone is packed with a snapdragon 835
processor four gigs of RAM 64 GB of on-board storage so you can expand that
to your heart's content up to 2 terabytes with the inclusion of a micro
SD card slot throughout my days of testing I played
games watched videos did a bunch of multitasking and
messaging and the phone handled all of it quite well it's certainly no slouch
it ran smooth like butter and I think you're going to be really happy with the
performance you're going to get out of this phone so the biggest story with
this year's Z 2 Force is actually going to be the same thing we saw last year with
the original Z Force and that is Moto Mods it's all about the Moto Mod and I
think Motorola should be applauded for that the phone uses smart connectors and
a series of magnets so that these mods can snap on super easily they're not
intrusive they work right out of the box and they work really well and it's
pretty cool to both these mods that were released with this new phone as well as
last year's mods are all compatible so if you've got new mods this year they'll
work with your old phone and vice versa now Motorola has some pretty cool Moto Mods that'll do just about anything and actually address a lot of the phones
shortcomings there's a battery mod that'll put all your battery worries to
ease there's a JBL sound mod that sounds really good there's even a 360-degree
camera mod that we had a ton of fun using in the office but you have to look
at this with the bigger picture and understand that these mods are cool but
you are buying into the Motorola ecosystem take for example the 360
camera it's a lot of fun but it's $300 and it's only going to work on these
Moto Z line of phones just take into consideration that when you buy these
mods you're limiting yourself to just too the Motorola phones and you are
going to spend probably a considerable amount of money on these mods though
they can enhance your experience with this phone it's going to come at a price
so let's get down to it if you're already invested in the Moto mod
ecosystem and you have a phone that already supports these mods or you're
really interested in this whole idea of Motorola's modularity
I think the Z2 Force is a no-brainer it's a great phone it's fast it has
really good cameras and there are some things I don't exactly like like the
battery life but you can forgive that with how cool the phone is as an overall
package especially with those mods but if you're someone who's a little bit
skeptical of what Motorola is doing and if you really want the best value for
your dollar I highly recommend taking a step back and looking at all the current
flagships currently on the market and choosing wisely whether or not this
phone is worth your hard-earned money and at least a few years in your pocket
so what do you guys think is Motorola's idea of modularity enough to get you to
jump ship over to the Moto mod ecosystem and there's Z Force line of phones or
are you going to stick with your current flagship are you waiting for something
else to come out leave a comment down below and let us know what you think of
this phone it's been a real pleasure thank you guys so much for watching this
video I'm Robert Rosenfeld from Techno
Buffalo until next time see you guys later 
it is versus time here at TechnoBuffalo
and for this battle we've got the two kings of Android and I'm ready to piss
off 50% of you in one corner we've got the latest from Samsung this is the Note
8 in the other the latest from Google this is the Pixel 2 XL on paper and
objective tests these two sit atop the Android throne I'm sorry for you LG V30 or Huawei P10 fans out there these are the two phones to beat it is 2018 so you change
up the categories a little bit we've got six categories to pick a winner and like
all of our verses it will not be a cop-out whatever is best for you type
answer we're gonna declare a winner so to round out our six categories the
first is Hardware this is now including the build and specs of device we've got
camera display software battery and intangibles so our first category is
Hardware this used to be build in previous verses but now encompassing
everything inside and outside of the phone so on paper these phones are
extremely similar the US version the Galaxy Note 8 which we're talking about
the Snapdragon 835 the RAM stories a bit different the Note 8 got 6 as
opposed to the 4 in the pixel 2 XL I have not had any sort of slow down at
all with the note 8 in fact performance has been incredibly fast and things that
are usually pretty intensive things like multitasking no issue with that
whatsoever really intense gaming no issues I have had no OS slowdown I've
had no OS stutters and no OS issues so if you had issues with other Samsung
phones in the past leave that aside the Note 8 is incredibly quick for the build
side of things aesthetically this might be one of the most beautiful phones ever
made in my opinion I love the way this phone looks I love the way this phone
feels the glass on the back certainly makes it fragile but from a purely
aesthetic standpoint the Note 8 is a work of art so we'll talk later at
length I promise about the display but the infinity display on the phone rounds
out the way the phone looks and feels I love the curve and how it sits in the
hand and on the negative side I've talked long and hard
red in the face like the stupid location the fingerprint sensor I don't care if
you use a case or it's fine for you I'm the one making this video and for me that's
a stupid location I wish they'd put it somewhere else which we'll probably see
in the upcoming Galaxy S9 so yeah so the story for the note it's fast it's
beautiful and it's really quick but it's not to be necessarily outdone by with
the Pixel 2 XL brings to the table and you think just cuz it's got to be
server and less it gonna be slower not the case it's amazing what can happen
when software and hardware at least for the most part get vertically integrated
this phone is a beast on the design standpoint the Pixel 2 is a nice phone
it's a goodish looking phone it's gotten bigger bezels than we've seen on late
2017 I guess now 2018 standards but you do have front facing speakers which are
nice the screen is still pretty good so the two-tone look of the pixel is not
for everybody's taste I like the metal feel I like the way the metal
complements the glass least aesthetically on the device I've said it
quite a bit in other videos I do not like the ridge that comes around the
side of the screen my finger hits it I prefer the infinity edge that I've got
on the note it's a functionally designed phone it is function over form here
that's what Google is known for it's this phones not gonna win any design
awards and might win awards later on but it comes to design it's certainly not
going to take the cake from the gorgeous things that we've got from Samsung and
on the positive side they put the fingerprint sensor we're fingerprint
sensors belong not next to the camera sensor where you can reach it without
having to turn your phone around so hats off to you google for actually doing
what you should do the fingerprint sensor I know a lot of this is probably
the hardest category that I've had to pick a winner that was a theme that came
through throughout all these categories but I'm not gonna cop out and say
ending in a tie for me when the best features about the Note 8 that I use
all the time and that is the s-pen having that option to use the s-pen
being able to plug in headphones listen to music are things that I have used
that give the Note 8 a slight but I'll be it an edge over the pixel 2 XL
Samsung takes this round so next let's jump into camera and I want to say these
are two of the best smartphone cameras on the market it's hard to take bad
pictures with either of these but there are
many factors to make one of them better let's start with what we've got from
Samsung and the Note 8 just in case you can't recite phone specs from the top of
your head here's what the Galaxy Note 8 is packing so it's a 12 megapixel dual
pixel sensor F 1.7 aperture and 2 times optical zoom and dual ois so portrait
shots are all the rage on smartphones it's no exception that it's in the note
8 and it takes incredible portrait shots I love they can do the focusing
afterwards it's really easy to bokeh and blur out the backgrounds incredible
job on portrait things and low light things in highlight any picture that I
take with the cameras just tend to look good perhaps by some taste a little a
little bit saturated I like the poppy colors you can adjust it in settings if
I really like what Samsung has done out of the box with the cameras and the
front sensor is no slouch either it's got smart out-of-focus 8 megapixels it
takes really good selfies I made that I take probably more selfies than I should
and often times I find myself reaching for the note 8 the moral with the note
days is it's hard to take bad pictures in fact you got to be a really crappy
photographer to take anything that's bad in any sort of light and that's a theme
that colds true with the pixel as well and just looking at the spec sheet you think
this would be a blowout because you know one sensor versus two but damn Google
did a great job this time around anything I threw at the pixel 2 xl
just took good pictures and that's true with the note 8 as well where I became
really impressed with what the pixel 2 xl could do was with its portrait modes
uses machine learning and neural networking to get better it's recognized
what a person is recognized hair to recognize the area between fingers
junkit strange spider-man webbings and I think that's where the pixel 2 xl
starts to shine while the note 8 is awesome as is the pixel 2 xl is
going to be getting better and already seen it get better over the two ish
months as I've been using it yeah it's not perfect I wish to 4k wasn't capped
at 30 frames per second but I can overlook all those things for an
incredible rear facing camera and incredible front facing camera with
portrait mode if I had to pick a device just based on camera in fact if I had to
pick any phone in the entire world based just on camera
going to be hard-pressed to find one better than the pixels 2 xl
and that's saying something because the Samsung is really good but the 2 xl is
definitely taking this round alright so next let's go to display and I'm not I'm
not gonna belabor this point much longer than it than it needs to we've told a
lot of stories I made a whole video about how this display on the pixel 2 is not as
bad as everybody says and it's really not especially after the November update
it looks a lot better you look at the saturated colors that people tend to
like and it's a fine display in its own right when you compare it against the
best display that I think has ever been on a phone 6.3 inch display on the Samsung
Note 8 is incredible pictures look incredible the Black levels are
incredibly black obviously the colors are extremely vibrant I say this a lot
it looks like there's a sticker on this display I've had this phone for now a
better part of three and a half almost four months and I'm still impressed with
how good the screen looks even direct sunlight you just cannot beat the screen
on the note 8 I'm gonna short this category a little bit because it's not
necessary you should have seen this one coming for a mile away Samsung's clearly
taking a display category alright so next let's jump it to software this is a
new category for us one we reserve we're comparing two phones running the
same operating system and at least on paper they're the same operating system
they're both running Android albeit aesthetically very different takes on
what Google's OS can offer so I'm not Samsung on the past for their take on
Android TouchWiz modern UI or whatever you want to call it it's gotten way
better but they're still fighting that stigma from the galaxy s5 and earlier
when they threw everything at the kitchen sink at a samsung phone
if you haven't used a modern Samsung phone if you haven't used a device since the s7
you are missing out it's gotten a lot better and maybe it's exactly just to
say this maybe I'm I'm gonna be screamed at by the Android purists but there's a
lot of things that Samsung does on their version of Android that I like better
than what Google does on stock OS I like the setting menu I like the dialer like
how gestures are integrated I like how handles multitasking and app pairing there's
a lot of really good things inside of the note 8 there are some annoyances
though of what Samsung's done having duplicate apps versus Google
stock apps are super annoying I don't wanted a separate Samsung only
app store super annoying but I guess they can be hidden
suppose but I think one of the biggest compliments I can give to the modern
Samsung skin Fork of Android whatever you want to call it so that when I use the
Samsung device I'm not putting a third-party launcher on it it's not
something I can say for many phones they've done a really nice job here
utilizing what their phone can do and taking advantage of all the features and
sensors that are built into it and the mortal this section here is don't knock
the Samsung skin till you've tried it on the negative side though Samsung is
notoriously slow for software updates so assume the version of Android you get
when you buy the Samsung phone is pretty much what you're gonna have for a super
long time Oreos been out for a while we're still stuck on nougat I wish
Samsung was faster with the OS updates I get that it takes time but it's
frustrating when devices like the pixel get updates much faster which brings me
to the 2 XL so this is pure Android as Google
intended or I guess now it's pure Android as Google intended on the pixels
I know a lot of Android purists holds a pixel and the previous Nexus line up to
this huge esteem for what Android flagships phone should be and to say
anything negative about it is completely sacrilegious but there are some things
that I don't like about this and I'm just gonna say it I don't like the
weather widget at the top I wish I could change it resize and remove it all
together I don't like the search bar at the bottom for my eye and my aesthetic it
belongs at the top and maybe I'm just not used to it I wish I could change it
which I could tweak that's Google doesn't let kind of strange they took a
bit of Apple-ish approach to telling you how things should look on their phones
and obviously I know if their party launchers can fix app talk about the
experience just out of the box so having said that really like a latest version
of Android the most up to date the most secure the latest that Google has to
offer I know I am always going to have on my Pixel device and that's a peace of
minds that you don't get with something like Samsung and quite honestly I just
enjoyed the experience it's fast everything about this phone just feels
screamingly quick I like the way the things work together I like how Google's
services are presented the way they were meant to be this one's tougher to call
than I expected but a slight edge this round is going to Google and the Pixel
2 XL but credit to Samsung freaking incredible UI alright so next let's jump to
battery in previous verses videos I've just told you my use case and which one
lasted longer but it's a new year we wanted new test to see which battery
is actually better and going to last you longer so here's what we did we took
both phones the note with it's 3300 mAh battery and the pixel XL
if it's slightly bigger 3520 mAh battery and we drained them to 0
which is harder than you think and we use the in box accessories to charge
these phones up and see which ones charge faster so after one hour the note
8 was at 59% and the pixel 2 was at 62% so we wanted to try and drain the phone
so we charged them up to 100% we turned max brightness on be close all apps we
kicked on airplane mode but kept Wi-Fi working and we streamed the same three
hour YouTube clip and that's where things got interesting they were exactly
the same after 8 and a half hours both phones
died so those tests were surprisingly close we gave this category a slight
edge and I'll admit it I'm aware of the irony of giving a battery category to
the note this one goes to Samsung by virtue of doing more with less milliamp
hours last but not least let's jump into intangibles all the little things that
come together to make the phone and awesome package of both of these bring a
really long list of intangibles on the note side you've got things like the
s-pen wireless charging Samsung pay which is different than Android pay ip68
expandable storage you've got a headphone jack a lot of little things
that make this an incredible device to use and to hold the Pixel 2 XL brings a ton of awesome things to the table and I can't overstate this enough
one of the things that brings is a fingerprint reader and they're really
nice to use location but aside from that you're getting incredible speakers
the latest updates from Google you're getting stock Android is important to a
lot of folks and of course Android pay is built into this of course you're
missing some things you get with other phones like expandable storage that's
been oddly a staple of the pixel line and the Nexus line before that and that phone
jack is gone we look at the laundry lists of extra features that phones
bring to the table the note 8 just taking intangibles so now that I've
got your foaming-at-the-mouth either with happiness or because you are super
pissed off let's recap and declare our winner of this versus Hardware went to
the Note camera went to the pixel display went to the note software it
went to the pixel battery went to the note intangibles went to the note in
any great battle Ali Frazier there can only be one winner no matter how hard
both people fight there's no participation trophies in vs. and
despite the pixel to being a badass baller phone only one winner and that is
the Galaxy Note 8 they did an incredible job with this device I think everything
about it is borderline perfect but... it's pretty crazy that I just happened to be
texting you on my Google Pixel 2 XL and you said that the Note 8 was
better so I just kind of had to come here to argue that. Ladies and gentlemen
it's a starting tackle from the LA Chargers Mr. Joe Barksdale. Philip Rivers
was only sacked 18 times this season sorry. He's the guy that's
protecting mr. Philip Rivers so I'm saying I'm saying the Note is the
winner and as somebody who's used both phones we've talked at length about both
phones. I actually have actually had the note and I was probably one of the
most excited people for that phone I had to know 7 and
you know we all know the battery things and all that but
in that time also you know waiting for the note I had a Google pixel XL and
when I got the note I really missed the pixel XL and what I meant by that was
the software features the user interface the ease of you know notification
dismissals I mean it's just an easy phone to use it just works you know it's
not the sexiest or most extravagant but at the end of the day you know this is
the phone that I would want to have every day. For the record before for anybody
yells at me about why I picked the note or how much Samsung paid me I convinced
Joe to get the pixel 2 Xl. I legitimately love both phones. The week
we played the Patriots yep you convinced me to get it he was just sitting there
at hotel bored I was like going to make now it just came out you loved it.
I limped on over and got it. I just didn't know that you were gonna abandon
your first love of the Galaxy Note 8 I didn't know you were gonna be
so wrong with your assessment. Are we going to fight again I thought I taught you I
can't even say that laughing. Are you physically intimidated by me. Very. Do we
look the same height sitting yeah cuz standing up is super funny. Joe
thanks for coming Joe has a new album coming out 25th. It's
called butterflies rainbows and moonbeams and I'm sure you know you guys
are here music and hopefully you Jon will have me back again. We'll link to where people can get the album. No pre-orders but when it's out  it's out Check out a pretty talented musician and a good friend Joe thanks for finally coming on but I'll take it easy
on you next time you 
The iPhone 10 is predictably different
it's the first design overhaul Apple's had since the original iPhone and like
Apple itself it's predictably polarizing I tend to be pretty agnostic when it
comes to mobile OS's splitting my time pretty evenly between whatever Android
flagship du jour is out and the large screen iPhone at the time for me the
iPhones become a commodity an entry into iMessage
but with the iPhone X it was the first iPhone since the 6 plus I was generally pumped about
but now two weeks in the initial enthusiasm has started to wane the
iPhone X for me though is a tale of two stories for the first six days I found
it frustrating and oftentimes super annoying I wasn't starting my swipe far
enough down to go home accidentally set off the SOS alert trying to turn my
phone off which probably the police to call me back it was annoying that I couldn't see
the battery percentage without swiping down from the right but then the second
week of testing something happens I stopped thinking about these UI tweaks
and just started using them after that initial learning curve I started to
really enjoy the phone but I'm getting a bit ahead of myself let's start back at
the beginning the iPhone 10 at least on paper is a phone that I've been hoping
Apple would make wireless charging OLED badass camera setup and a design that
can finally rival the best of Android so aside from Apple stealing my
hairline for that top notch at least aesthetically the phone looks stunning
Face ID these sounds like a gimmick but now two weeks in and I'm still not
completely sold but I'm way more convinced that I was at the beginning
but we'll get to that I usually skip over software my phone reviews because
it's iOS but with the iPhone X you can't just pick it up and know what to do
I've been reviewing phones now for over nine years this is the first device that I can
remember where I had to look up how to power the device off I had to ask how to
take screenshots and how to close applications there's a lot of nuances
here it takes time to learn but the more I used it the more I saw that Apple's
feature while looking surprisingly like the Palm Pre software is incredibly
bright the gestures became more deliberate and the swipes became second
nature I still have a hard time understanding
why Apple didn't put an on screen home button or at least something force touching
the dock but I did at least get used to it
so software aside the next big story is the 5.8 inch OLED display and I just
want to say thank you seriously finally and thank you the 2436 x 1125
make the 458 PPI screen look awesome in my recent Samsung reviews I praised them
for the incredible screen technology and for the iPhone X Apple cozied up to the
frenemy Samsung to build the display while Apple maintained control of the
underlying tech so predictably when those two get together the screen is
incredible but not perfect I turned off the true tone display
I thought the constantly re-white balancing was unnecessary and a possible battery
drain and also to my eye caused a bit of a yellow hue but others in the office
absolutely loved it so personal preference thing color reproduction is
awesome the wide color gamut really helps with that and the black levels are
very black it's one of the incredible things about the OLED technology I was a
bit worried about brightness but with Auto turned on I never felt this screen
looked washed out I never had issues seeing it in direct sunlight this is
clearly the best screen Apple has ever put on one of their devices and can
finally rival the best displays from Samsung and LG despite having a larger
display than the 8 Plus the phone feels noticeably smaller in the hand it kind
of feels reminiscent of a Galaxy S8 and it's only slightly bigger and frame than
an iPhone 8 I usually opt for the larger sized phones but it's hard not to admit
this is the sweet spot for almost everyone's hand size I really love the
feel of the phone the glass on the back feels awesome and I thought that I lost
the feel of device when I put in a case so perhaps foolishly I made the decision to
go case free and instead opted for Apple care it's hard to not feel like a chump
after shelling out about 1200 bucks for the phone that extended warranty I have
laptops that cost less than apple claims the glass on the back is
the strongest glass on any smartphone but when it comes to the accidental drop and
the subsequent battle of glass versus concrete I'm going with concrete
every time and the drop test that we've seen and reviewed tend to confirm the
fragility the band around the side is made of surgical grade stainless steel
and I'm not sure what surgical grade has to do with anything here but hey it's
there the space gray version and I've been testing does show plenty of finger
prints so keep a t-shirt or a cloth handy to clean that sucker up the
speakers here are also 25% louder and they sound pretty good for a mobile they
don't distort the sounds when you go to high volumes but if you still want
better audio you're gonna want a headphones but make sure those
headphones are either wireless or lightning because still no headphone jack here so
I promise I talked about Face ID and in all honesty I'm still not sure how I
feel about it but how I feel doesn't really matter it unlocks about as fast
as touch ID and I found myself having to use a passcode about as often as I did
with touch ID anyway so I think that's a win using it in apps though is we're
really shine things like Apple Pay and one password just feel effortless
camera time so Apple changed orientation a 12 megapixel sensors from
landscape to portrait so you know they mean business it's expected combo of
wide-angle and telephoto lenses and Apple's marketing machine will tell you
it uses a state-of-the-art seven magnet solution but to the end-user the
pictures just look really good both cameras have OIS and they do a really
admirable job of stabilizing video where I think it really shines is in low-light
situations where the pictures still end up looking really good pictures look
really incredible without being overexposed and even in almost no light
I was able to see the true color reproduction in the photos another thing
I love is portrait mode and I try and use it almost every chance I get to take
pictures of my kids it just works incredibly well the true depth camera on
the front enables portrait mode selfies that just looked really bad
hopefully software updates will fix this but the background sometimes where I'm
blurred properly ears seem to trip it up I just wasn't that impressed but you do
get an emojis which I'm not gonna lie I use more than a grown man should the novelty will probably wear off soon but I love shaking my head and seeing the
poop sway and I can't be alone battery life for me was about 10% worse than
what I got on my iPhone 8 Plus it's good but not great I could get through a full day
so that's at least what I need and I commend Apple for not going full Apple
and creating their own wireless charging standard instead opting for the pretty
much ubiquitous Qi standard it also rained one day while we were testing so
it was nice to have the ip67 obviously I would have preferred the
ip68 that standard now across almost all
Android flagships so that notch it's it's there on one hand I can see why they did
it it creates two distinct swipes to bring up different things in this case
control center notifications and I get that it also for better or for worse serves as
brand identification for Apple but when watching full screen videos or apps and
aren't yet optimized it's kind of distracting it a bit of an eyesore it
did start to fade in the background in the latter part of my usage but then I'd
watch a full screen YouTube video and I'd be keenly aware that notch was there
I'll say this though it detracts less than I thought but it's definitely a
slight blemish on otherwise gorgeous canvas the A11Bionic is powering
the device and it's predictably fast sometimes it feels overkill but I
imagine the extra horsepower is there to help the iPhone 10 aged gracefully into
iOS 12 and 13 which I think are gonna focus a lot on gestures so the iPhone 10
it's not for everyone in the way previous iPhones were my mom for example
has been an iPhone user for five years and took one look at the lack of a home
button and said no thank you face ID and gestures are gonna take time
to get used to not because they don't work because they're drastically
different than what people have had before the price of having the cutting
edge from Apple is a steep one to pay starting at a grand the barrier to entry
is crazy high even for Apple if you decide you want to come on board or get
a device that's finally at feature parity with the best of Android and predictably
performs better than any iPhone in recent memory I can see the direction
Apple is headed here and while not perfect the iPhone 10 is definitely top
notch 
guten abend that's my my attempts at German I am in Berlin at about 10 p.m. at night for going sleep because I want to show you the latest move away as quickly as humanly possible this is the make book X their made book family is growing and this is a flagship for 2017 there's a lot of technology in a super extend twelve point five millimeter package so the first thing that I always wonder when I see a really thin computer is power usually the trade-off is always been if you want thin you're going to get a really slow processor now you can option to make book X up to get the seventh gen Intel Core I use there's a process or none of that core and stuff so that's also a wall way for that there's also a lot of world's first stuff happening in here and the one that I think much about it generally think that much about sound in my laptop usually I've got headphones in but you're going to want to think about the sound in the X the world's first notebook that Dolby Atmos certified and these speakers that put out is previous down they're kind of innocuous looking but the sound is incredible we had a chance to take a look at it in a display area and hear movies and music and you will not believe the fidelity of the sound of something so thin so really awesome that's always able to do that I'm pretty clearly worth the dough Beats or bring that out to the market other world's first it's got a fingerprint reader built for the tower but if you're worried about security thing is incredibly secure uh and perhaps the most important one to me and it's not a world's first something that is awesome as a father and someone who is legitimately ruined two laptops by spilling stuff on it and you might not think that you need a spill proof keyboard because maybe you're better than me maybe you're not as cavalier with your coffee when you're reading the news or browsing Facebook but still proof keyboard which is awesome to have because trust me that one time you need it you're going to be happy that you got it I'm thinking of keyboard there really nicely laid out Chiclets about keyboard and usually with thin kind of the throw is not so good it's a pretty decent throw and Yuki's it actually feels really nice what will we talk about how fast the SSD is so I asked them ask what kind of SSD unfortunately they really went for fat is the PCIe SSD this would go from off to ready to use in about nine seconds it is nice you could option it up to half a terabyte so five seven twelve gigabytes you should have plenty of storage and also plenty of speed another crazy thing about this actually used technology found in spacesuits to cool the processor I'm clearly no scientist but what I got out of it was there's a material inside of here that will change its taste depending on the heat coming out of this so it'll be like a gel and it'll be a liquid to keep your computer cool what that boils down to for consumer is it's totally family so while your gel is changing its state you don't have to worry about hearing any sandwich which is really awesome to have also hats off the ball way for putting two USB type-c ports on here one on each side one you can use for charging and data the other one is just for data and also it's like such thing I have to mention now got a headphone jack so each other computer on here to be greeted by an incredible almost bezel list display when I say almost bezel is talking four point four millimeters of bezel it is almost not there at all and it's a 2k display so 2160 by 1440 and things look absolutely beautiful in it a couple other things to know it's also covered in Gorilla Glass so keys you're worried about scratches you should be okay it's pretty well protected they spend a lot of time talking about a unibody design and how its sandblasted it just feels nice in the hand this is not the only laptop notebook that fall way launched at their event they also launched the meets book deep on the mate Book II these kind of cool it's a tablet and it's a laptop you can take the whole computer out with you and get this or the power of a PC in a tablet but also that really cool keyboard gosh and put it in it's got three pogo pins which is a new word I learned through the presentation it kind of just goes in almost magnetically and you can adjust the hinge 250 degrees any way you want it to have the best typing angle I play the keyboard for a few minutes and it felt really nice it's a pretty cool option if you won't really spin ultimate portability but Silvio's actually do like normal person work and also it's a great 2k screen you want to watch music just sort of consume stuff on it so that's the ladies room hallway this is when I'm probably most excited about the main book X it looks awesome to keep here that I think I can use a lot for travel which is important I'm in Berlin right now I want to carry a giant computer with me so what's the thing that's powerful you can put in your bag but also have crazy good speakers this looks like a really good choice so what if you guys do a full review on it let us know down below and of course any questions you've got about the computer well it's know I'll try and answer I do the floor review so next time I'm John Renick from TechnoBuffalo I'll do my German friends a favor and not try and massacre the language anymore see you guys next 
so LG's V series of phone used to be like their playground they would try new stuff dual screens Dax and see how things worked and eventually that would make its way into the flagship line the G line of phones they're scrapping that whole method now and the V 30 clearly sits atop of their portfolio and this is kind of what the G 6 should have been we're still testing the be 30 before we do a full review but I've already found a lot of stuff to really like about this phone so as you guys decide what phone you want to buy or think about buying here are five reasons of e 30 doesn't suck so I was gonna go in reverse order and start with five and worked my way up but I'm just gonna jump right into number one the screen holy crap that OLED screen looks insane I didn't think that I was gonna find a display that looks better than Samsung Super AMOLED panels on the no date the SAT si plus but damn LG did it this looks better than the Samsung display OLED looks insane on a phone LG's makes awesome OLED TVs but seeing it on a smaller phone form factor a six inch screen it looks so good so the black levels obviously look awesome you expect that with OLED what surprised me was actually the visibility in direct sunlight that's not where old legends I can still see this in direct sunlight your screen gets crazy bright if you're in a dark room and turn the brightness all the way up it's like burn your retinas bright you like the Eclipse glasses to look at it so that has been really surprising colors also obviously look really bright and vibrant but you can see a difference with OLED maybe it's psychosomatic I don't know actually excited to see an OLED phone but hotdamn is a screen look insane good job LG number two so a lot of people were annoyed with the g6 in the US we got wireless charging other mah career markets you got a quad DAC you didn't get both LG righted that ship here you now have quad DAC and you've got wireless charging with the V 30 so if you plug in compatible headphones gonna take advantage of the full audio fidelity wall wireless charging which is really nice to have number 3 battery life I don't know Ola is using less power LG software's just gotten better by the 3309 power batteries pretty good so by comparison on my s8 when I plug in my phone into the night genuinely I meant like twenty to twenty five sometimes thirty percent at the v3 and the same usage I met thirty to thirty five percent so I'm getting pretty good battery life here it's something I'm really happy to see with LG I wasn't the biggest fan of battery life on the g6 so it looks like the trend continues they fix the machine with the g6 the V thirty can last you easily all day so I don't mean for this via the turns like a g6 bashing but number four is speed the GC kind of Snapdragon 820 one for a lot of things didn't matter but where it did matter was using LG's multi window and trying to do two things the phones tend to slow down oftentimes stutter especially well one of those windows with streaming video 8:35 on the v 30 same four gigabytes of RAM and the same issues I had with the g6 are gone with the V 30 same four gigabytes of RAM are here but the Snapdragon 835 make things way quicker than I had with the g6 no slowdown no stutter for doing exact the same test that had at the g6 so speed pretty good and number five intangibles so I just finished playing with the essential phone and that phone is really solid and sewn right but it's missing some stuff LG checks almost all the flagship boxes that you'd expect so you've got quad DAC you've got wireless charging you've got expandable storage you've got fast charging and you've got USB C you also have IP 68 water resistance things you're missing removable battery and an IR blaster if that's important to you bear in mind but it does check almost all the boxes for flagship phone that's nice to see and all that stuff plus a headphone jack makes a V 30 at least appear to be really solid choice looking to get a new phone over the next few months if screen is important to you you gotta take a look at the OLED screen maybe it's not gonna sell you on the phone itself but damn does it look really good the screen is super important to me and LG hit this one out of park so the V 30 it's pretty solid phone we're still doing our test though anything you guys want to see us check out in the full review leave it down below and let us know mashup thumbs up button really appreciate it or if you didn't like the video there's button for that so next time I'm John Ranger you [Music] 
thanks to nucleon by Kingston for sponsoring this video smartphone design hasn't changed that much over the past few years bezels have got a little bit thinner display technologies gotten better but we haven't seen that giant leap forward that we've seen in previous years that is until now and it's due to the clear ID sensor from synaptics and it might not mean much to you what the technology does is something we've been dreaming about for years and then rumored about for even longer it puts a fingerprint reader under your display and I've got it here and I've got it working so it's working on a vivo phone some version of this is eventually going to hit the market probably not in the US but the technology here is absolutely incredible alright so first just as English as a geek it's incredible to actually see this working in a prototype that surprisingly let me set up and try and it worked as advertised so the unlock time is like 0.7 ish seconds it's about 40% slower than what you see with just normal fingerprint readers but to the end-user I don't know as much of a slowdown at all so anything on this magic essentially works so the sensor is sitting below this point if you catch it in the right light you can actually see it down towards the bottom it's set at an angle that they told me was for improved accuracy and speed it's barely there but it's kind of cool to see it and because it's under the screen you can do a lot with design you'd have to worry about taking up a chunk of space with a fingerprint reader on the front on the back of devices if you make things look more elegant materials put in bigger battery put a generally other components cuz you don't have to worry about trying to find a spot for that sensor because there's an actual spot for it software kind of comes into place as the phone moves or you pick it up it's a text you want to unlock it it's gonna illuminate essentially where you should put your finger put your finger right there and it unlocks and the rest of how it works seems kind of pedestrian which i think is the point it works the way all your finger parameters working out set up was very simple unlocking it is very simple but it looks like magic when you turn your phone off and the screen is blank and you know as a fingerprint reader actually under there so it's a simple answer of how this works it's actually going through the pixels the OLED panel so it's optical it's different to what we're gonna see from Qualcomm later on in the year it's abuse of ultrasonic technology to do similar things but this is here and right now I could get a lot more about the technology but as a fan of smartphones and what they represent this is a gigantic leap forward this is the stuff of science fiction a few years later in the palm of my hand hopefully we'll see this technology make it to a ton and more smartphones in 2018 so this video wouldn't be possible without nuclear and we've actually been using this a ton at CES it adds way more functionality to new MacBook and MacBook Pros with USB C so the big thing it adds seven ports seven ports of things that you need USB a and actually USB C port SD card readers and more and most importantly I think at least to us is you can use all seven ports at once it's color match to the MacBook it's a must-have accessory if you've got one of these new computers it's one dongle and one cable that just adds way more functionality than you get right from Apple so I don't learn more link to it down below so do you guys think reach excited as I am are you pumped you prefer some sort of other biometrics to unlock your phone this is an incredibly elegant solution leave a comment down below let me know of course subscribe hit the little bell icon T notify the more CES videos are coming your way till next time I'm John rende your exact no Buffalo I'm holding the future they're not gonna take it from me [Music] 
As a tech reviewer bias is something
we're always trying to fight against we have preconceived notions going into any
sort of testing but our job is to push those to the side and review a product
objectively I'm gonna pull back the curtain a little bit when the iPhone 8
and iPhone 8 Plus were announced I was not excited about it I didn't think
it was anything revolutionary or giantly new and I expected to be
overwhelmingly disappointed with the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus but in my
five days of testing I've actually been pleasantly surprised with what Apple has
done here so I'm going to talk about the iPhone 8 in the iPhone 8 plus its review
for both devices and I'm gonna try to not talk about the iPhone X and focus
on these devices as they exist on their own let's get started for me one of the
most appealing things about Apple products in the past has always been the
design and a look and feel and this is a very familiar design for an iPhone it's
the fourth iteration of the same design that we saw with the iPhone 6 when you
flip the devices over though it's an entirely different story these things
look much different than the press photos or even hands-on videos led you to
believe Apple has no uniform color for Space Gray at all this version around is
almost a dark gray and I love the way these colors look the silver is kind of
an eggshell white the gold is now a more muted gold all three colors tree looked
drastically different and I think very much improved over their namesakes from
last generation the glass back to make the phone feel pretty different as well
if you've held a modern Samsung device if you've held you know an s8 or Note 8
you're gonna know what that glass back feels like a lot of people like it I'm
one of those if you get the darker color it's gonna be a fingerprint magnet and
it can't make it a little bit slippery so if you want to sort of protect that
you can put a Dbrand skin on the back of it link to them down below
at long last wireless charging is here and maybe you don't care about wireless charging but for me it is a giant deal and I am so happy that it is here
and I give Apple credit for using the Qi standard not going with some weird
proprietary Apple only wireless charging I've got the Samsung quick charger I use
with my note 8 put this on it and it worked
immediately which is really nice to have I will say though the charging rate was
definitely slower than most modern wireless charging capable Android
devices I've tested but for me I put it on at night
turn off the phone wake up in the morning and it's charged so for that use
case why those charging works and works as advertised so I mentioned the
beginning I was surprised by the iPhone 8 and 8 plus I've primarily been using
the plus for my testing and battery life has been way better than I thought I
could have not only on a mobile device but on an iPhone in particular by the
end of the day I'm generally at fifty five to sixty percent battery life left
and that is a staggering number for me and about twenty percent higher than
when I'm at with almost any other phone including when I was with the iPhone 7
plus but if you're traveling got a day trip you almost don't have to bring your
chargers you put on battery saving mode and you turn off some app so you turn on
your screen brightness so might be able to push it to two and a half three days
hats off to Apple making a phone with pretty damn good battery life which is not
something I get a chance to say very often performance here is .  really fast now
with performance and might be a little bit psychosomatic I know we've seen the
Geekbench scores and it's crazy fast off the charts so it seemed fast to me but
the things I notice that I can quantify boot up is stupid fast now on the iPhone
8 and iPhone 8 plus apps open and definitely faster on the iPhone 8 and 8
plus vs. previous gen phones everything else just felt zippier to me I never
felt that iPhones were slow by any stretch of the imagination but it handles iOS 11
smoothly I can multitask without any problem or at least how Apple allows you to
multitask without any problems games worked really quickly the phone is just
quick and it's probably going to be very quick continuing into the 12 18 to
perhaps 24 months that you might have this phone screen there are two schools
of thought when it comes to Apple's Apple screen you're like I don't mind 1080p
for battery life and why can't I get a high res screen on the iPhone 8 plus I
think that I maybe somewhere in the middle I don't want to be a hypocrite and
say battery life is awesome but it should have a higher res screen I know there'd be
a trade-off there but as far as 1080p screens go it looks good it doesn't look
best in class anymore I think by any stretch of the imagination it is above
average though in direct sunlight which is odd because it's not the brightest screen in
the world but you can definitely see it when you go out and if that trade-off
for battery life is important you you're gonna be fine with the screen
if you've been sort of longingly looking at Android phones with 2k and a higher
resolution screens then you might be disappointed here but know that going in
the screens fine it's serviceable it works well it's just not the best
anymore in the business so true tone is a new addition to the 8 and 8 plus it
mattered like between 0 and next to 0 to me I guess you only notice that we have
another phone next to it that doesn't have true tone but it really didn't
impact my impressions on the screen at all here cameras are perhaps the biggest
reason people choose phones a generation over generation if you look at just a
spec sheet between the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus versus the last gen and in fact we did a
versus video comparing the two you might think they are identical same megapixel
same apertures but that is not the full story at all especially when it comes to
the 8 Plus this is an instance where the processor makes all the difference
these cameras are incredible in direct sunlight photos look beautiful they're
not as saturated to get with the Samsung phones the color reproduction is more
true to real life in low-light they were great the shutter speed is incredibly
fast the video capture looks great I like still having a 2x optical zoom I
very rarely used a 10x digital but it's there if you need it
portrait mode we had with the last gen with the iPhone 7 plus it's here as well
but now it processes that portrait mode way faster than the 7 Plus so portrait
lighting is also here on the 8 Plus and that was a cool almost like a cool party
trick I liked trying it I had inconsistent results but when it worked it
worked really well we've done some portrait lighting for
our headshots here at the office and they looked pretty close I'll forgive
inconsistency though since it is definitely still in beta but it does come damn
close to working exactly as every time I get a lot of questions I reviews on the
speakers on the phones so I'll run through these really quickly the speakers
are actually pretty good about 25 percent louder that we have for the last
gen they don't sound this tinny as the iPhone 7 plus they sound loud they sound
fine they're on the higher end of average when it comes to phone speakers
so another instance where I was surprised was actually when it came to
storage so these phones ship either 64 or 256 which are big size discrepancies and you're probably like me think you
need the larger size I set up my iPhone 8 Plus from scratch and I haven't done
that probably the past five gens of phones and I was shocked when I set the
phone up from scratch and I had all of my photos backed up in the cloud I was
using less than 18 gigs of storage Apple's got a new file system with iOS
11 I'm sure that plays a big part of it You might want to even consider that 64
gigs for the $699 or $799 depending if you go for the 8 or the 8 plus you might
not need as much as you think but obviously you're used to a very I think
I would be completely fine in the 64 I never thought I would say that so if you
can't tell I came away impressed with the iPhone8 and 8 Plus and I didn't think I
was going to there's a lot of little things that make up a really nice whole
when it comes to the phone I like the way it feels I like to speed the
speakers are surprising coming back to iOS has been a nice experience it was
kind of a welcome home I still wish a lot of things could change but the OS
still is what it is it's still the grid array of icons and if you like that or
if you're okay with that this is the best implementation of it
quite obviously now there's a specter of what's coming next from Apple what the
iPhone 10 is going to be but this phone as it exists in the market it's still a
really good choice it brings it up to close to parity with those features
and specs that Android has and that's what a lot of Apple aficionados and a lot of
Apple fans have been asking for you've got things like wireless charging you've
got water resistance here and it just works out of the box and for a lot of
people that is the ideal mobile experience and it might be one of those
folks again so that's my take on the 8 and the 8 plus what matters is what you do and
what you do with your wallet are you spending your hard-earned money towards
an 8 or 8 Plus are you waiting for the iPhone 10 you switching to Android let
us know why down below 
it is the Battle of the eighths we've got the iPhone 8 plus and the note 8 to buy he myths going head-to-head for your phone buying dollar I want to do this versus with five categories and no cop-out at the end whatever is best for you we are going to declare a winner let's jump right in so as I run through these categories you'll notice one category is not going to be there and that is performance I could talk about the a11 the Snapdragon 835 and six gigs of ram but they are different operating systems all kinds of different experiences so it's not a fair comparison to go head-to-head on the performance of both but both are incredibly fast both can handle games with Kendall anything you throw at it so performance for two different operating systems it's not apples to apples so to speak so the five categories that we've chosen for this versus battle are design screen camera battery and intangibles so the first category let's start with design and this one should be as no-brainer category as we've got and I think even those diehard Apple fans would even give the design award to the Galaxy Note 8 this is a fourth generation of the same design that we initially saw with the iPhone 6 plus it's not ugly it just hasn't modernized like we've seen on the Samsung side of things you've got an infinity display almost edge to edge the phone looks and feels incredibly premium and if you're gonna buy a phone based solely on design I'm going for the one without the gigantic bezels Galaxy Note 8 easily takes this category alright so next let's jump it to high perhaps the most important category the screen since the book pretty much all screen and what you're staring at you might think at least on paper this is going to be blowout favorite the Samsung but Apple has quietly and I think under the radar refined their screen technology culminating in the screen on the iPhone 8 plus so a bit of a weird aspect ratio I think on the note it's 18 and a half by 9 it works to make a thinner phone with a larger display I kind of prefer the 16 by 9 on the iPhone what's new here on the Apple front is a true tone display wasn't that high on it in the review tomorrow I used it I think the more I started to appreciate what it can do both decent viewability outdoors and that's a big one for me on the note side it's got an incredible brightness of 1,200 nits it's like 20% brighter than the galaxy s 8 plus you gotta outer brightness turned on if you want to see it in direct sunlight so leaves bear that in mind despite how bright the screen gets you turn their brightness all the way up to see it when you are outdoors I love the way the screen looks on the Galaxy Note 8 it looks like a sticker to me I'm looking at pictures looking at movies watching movies playing games the screen is absolutely gorgeous and I've in the past been very mad on Apple's 1080p screens on their Plus devices this one looks better it looks almost higher resolution text looked crisper your calvess lead can't see any pixelation and Apple has definitely improved the display on the A+ I think the plus size display is something Apple was really far behind but it's much better here and much closer when it comes to screen hundred of hundred times I'm still picking the Galaxy Note 8 all right so next let's jump into camera both these flagship feature dual sensors on the back and both take incredible pictures and take very similar approaches to what they do both offer portrait modes which will so reviews technology to blur the background apples got portrait lighting in beta that'll sort of simulate different lighting effects they both have live photos it'll take sort of bit of movies beforehand they do a lot of the same things here but one does it a bit better the iPhone 8 plus I think takes better shots in low light I personally prefer the higher contrast shots that come out of the note in direct sunlight but that's gonna be up to you the iPhones camera looks a little more true to color I like sort of the poppy processing that Samsung does but it's a lot on the processing side portrait shots on the note eights look much more like normal portrait shots and they do on the A+ A+ sometimes blur the wrong stuff portrait lighting though is damn cool even though it's still in beta it doesn't work all the time but when it does work you look really well and presumably it will only get better as time progresses video looks incredible coming out of both of these but if I had to pick one of these to take and use as my camera going I'm gonna pick the iPhone eight plus I think it's a better overall camera in every environment if I want to get those low-light shots gonna be great if I want to get those portrait shots and my kids are gonna look beautiful I have the option dad portrait lighting in here it's an awesome camera on both devices and it was tight but no cop out of a tie if I have to pick one I'm going to camera on the iPhone eight plus all right so let's talk about battery and this would have been a blowout win for Apple if it had been like 2016 or even 2015 but not the case any more symptoms of an incredible job with software and battery management on the galaxy note 18 you might think it's not fair we talked about specs that no day is pushing way more pixel that's got a brighter screen it's got a bigger screen in the iPhone but we're gonna pick up one of these phones you're gonna want it to last and I want to give you one gigantic caveat if you use snapchat that's not even going to be close snapchat on Android is there horrible notorious battery drain so the difference for me with auto brightness turned on on both devices throughout a full day's usage was about 7% and 7% better on the iPhone that is an incredible victory I think for Samsung despite having a power way bigger screen way brighter screen and way more pixels but if you want a phone it's going to last you longer throughout the day you're gonna want to go for the iPhone even with battery saving modes on both I can still eat out a longer life on the iPhone then I can on the Samsung and the fact this is close is an incredible testament to what sampling has done maximizing battle aid because the past years this would have been a complete blowout when it comes to battery I'm sticking with Apple so if you were keeping track at home we are tied 2-2 heading into the final category design went to the note screen stayed with the note camera when the iPhone battery stuck with Apple our last category here's intangibles what makes the phone the phone what separates it from the pack what makes it not a rectangle in your pocket what it brings to the table in the entire package and Apple has brought a lot to the table this Jen we now have wireless charge apples ecosystem is huge for a lot of people things that live inside of it like iMessage and FaceTime Apple pay is almost becoming ubiquitous for mobile payments you've got water resistance with ip67 we're getting a nice display you're getting a good camera and you're getting quick charging capability now built into an apple device on the Samsung side you've got wireless charging you've got fast charging we've got a little better water resistant with ip68 got a headphone jack on board you've got expandable storage you've got the s-pen and you've got Samsung pay and for those reasons be able to use a pen and being able to expand storage being able to plug in any headphones you choose I am giving this category to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 so I mentioned expandable storage is a big reason to get the Galaxy Note 8 if you want to narrow that gap a little bit you want have expandable storage with the iPhone the folks at Kingston have you covered with the data traveler bolt duo this plugs right into your lighting port there's an app that you download and does one thing and one thing only that is store your pictures and you can do it a couple different ways you can take pictures and video directly to the bulk duo you can backup certain folders in your backup your whole library anything you want to take storage off of your phone so how to hold off on upgrading your phone and maybe the only reason you were gonna upgrade to an iPhone 8 plus or an iPhone tennis for more storage size it's an awesome way to hold out available you the 32 64 128 you can backup everything you need it's really thin too so it'll stay flush with the table whether using it on an iPhone or an iPad it's not gonna give you a weird balance it's put it in your pocket kit in your backpack it's an awesome way to backup whatever you want to suit your needs I want to thank our friends at Kingston for making this video possible with their data traveler bolt duo if you want to check it out go into it down below so this is one of the most hotly-contested verses we have ever done and that was not the case in recent years I was harping on things like Apple missing wireless charging Apple missing quick charging those things are here now the gap has narrowed quite a bit based on all five of these categories I pick the new eight if one of these categories of what's important to you if it's camera but screen if it's intangible as a battery life you know where I stand on those and perhaps that might sway your purchase decision but if you want one based on the breadth of phones that are all fast they're all going to work well the Galaxy Note 8 still reign supreme [Music] you
