Hi 😊  today is big for me because I get to share with everyone my story about acne.
     
      I was a late bloomer in high school  and I never had any acne. People all the time used to touch my face and ask how my skin was so clear. It wasn't until out of high school when I started getting really bad acne. For me this cause a lot of depression and anxiety to go out in public. Even worse  fans would see me in person at the time & I used to have to convince people that I was who I was  I used to get made fun of by people that would see me in public  I used to hide from people that would see me and ask for a picture. For me  it sucked because I already had fans at this point  but I felt like I hated myself because I didn't look like I used to anymore  I didn't have that smooth skin  instead of people asking me why my skin was so clear  people would ask "what happened to your face" & say "why don't you have acne in photos" which completely destroyed me on the inside & my self confidence. It got to a point where I literally had to use photoshop to Edit Out the acne myself  LITERALLY. But then a fan gave me Proactive at Magcon  and I started using it  that's when my acne started going away... and it worked.... but the only thing is  is that it was wayyy to many steps. I would always forget to use them or I wouldn't want to spend 5 minutes washing my face in the morning  so when I stopped using it my acne came back... Starting to try a bunch of different products I started to break out even more so and couldn't fix it. 

UNTIL  someone showed me X-Out  it was by the same company that did proactive but it was only one step  WHICH I LOVED. And I started using it. Within a month people started asking how my skin was clearing up and I started noticing that all the big red spots form old pimples were fading  acne stopped popping up as much  and I didn't have to worry about big white bubbles sitting on my face all day. 
Before I knew it  I had clear skin!

Today is super exciting because I get to share with everyone on a big scale my story and my battle with acne  DONT let it stop you  DONT let it keep you from being YOU

just yesterday vine prankster Cameron Dallas he was arrested for vandalizing his own apartment well it's a sad day everyone's favorite short filmmaker Cameron Dallas has been arrested in Los Angeles for paint being thrown over a six floor balcony which almost hit someone that was walking by well when cops showed up the evidence was literally everywhere cops showed up and this time found out that they were throwing a makeshift paint party and Hartman and the whole thing was covered in paint Cameron Dallas was then promptly arrested and held on $20,000 bail for a felony vandalism charge yeah so what's up guys let me tell you what really happened all right so the day starts off I invite JC Keon and their friend JJ he's their photographer over to my house basically we invited I invited them over we're going to shoot some YouTube videos for 20 days of Dallas and we filmed my prior video signed someone likes you we filmed that and then I was like all right Keane you need one for you for your channel so me Jesse and key and we pull out this twister just twister board and put it out with you guys as you can tell we are doing twister with pain what we actually bought for paint they're like little like bottles of acrylic paint that you get at the craft store like Michaels or something and I was like they're they're non-toxic and they're washable so so we end up uh playing twister okay go do the dad can't handle that and then we're playing and all of a sudden a knock on the door we're like who could this be and we're like listening and also we hear it's it's the police banging on the door and we're like what like why would the police be knocking on the door I'll have my feet please I opened the door the first thing he says is who's the legal owner of this apartment and I was like I mean I'm not the legal owner I just lived there so I said he's not here he just left I'm here because of a revolt so I'm in the doorway and I'm not sure what's going on he was like well you guys need to get out and I was like why he said cuz you guys don't live here and I was like no I live here but I'm just not the legal owner but logic my nigger huh cuz I knew liquor you just told me you don't live you know he said I don't know about the legal owner okay so where's the legal owner he asked me to step outside and speak with him without fully explaining like why this this whole time he had his foot in the door like on our property like inside of our house and he's holding the door open so he told me one more time to step outside and if I don't he's gonna pull me out and that's essentially what happened step outside come on step no sir don't I tell you step aside step aside for you hey can I record this oh here's no record oh you didn't do anything you can't touch him JJ one of the videographers he was filming and I told him to come outside and film what they were doing so he comes outside and he's filming and the cop sees that the cop grabs his camera puts it on the wall and then puts him in handcuffs and tells everyone inside to come out and put them in handcuffs thanks for never here all of us miss all of you and he told us that we were under investigation for a battery charge because apparently someone was throwing something off the balcony and it almost hit someone and since we were covered in paint they said that it was us so they hold us there for about an hour two hours just in the hall sitting down a couple more officers come and we were waiting on their sergeant to come so the sergeant just explains to us that we're going to go down to the station and we're not being charged with anything but they just want to further the investigation the only two people that they took into the precinct was me and JJ the videographer he let Keane and JC go now kita JC they had acting class but I guess back in coach said that they were covered in paint and just to come back next time so hey they were like all right let's go check up on JJ and cam so they come to the precinct all of a sudden I'm sitting there they they had his hand cuffed to a bench and we're waiting to be processed order I don't know and we're sitting down in all sudden I see two kids walk in with paint covered all over them and I just start laughing because it's Keane and JC out of nowhere right when they walk in they get arrested he was like dude we walked in here to bail you guys out and they handcuffed us and arrested us and we were just laughing so hard we're like like Kim Keane was like the first time I get arrested I turned myself in they sat us down and we sat handcuffed to a bench like this for like six hours and then they finally processed us they dismissed everything having to do with the battery case and they ended up charging us with vandalism of our own apartment like looking back the whole thing was the whole event then the event as a whole was blown out of proportion we went from playing twister paint twister to landing ourselves in jail for no reason really I definitely think that the whole the whole thing could have been avoided if me and the officer were in like a pissing match I guess you would say and we both weren't being stubborn because it was kind of like oh well you can't do this and he's like well you can't do that and like we're kind of just arguing so I definitely realized that that's something I need to work on and that's something that I can improve on and I will say I'm sorry to the officers yeah it sucks that it happened but some of the positive things that I took away with it is that I definitely don't want to go to jail just going going through the whole the whole process and like being in a jail cell it really sucks and that's not a place I want to be and that's not a place you want to be so it was good to experience that and know that I never want to go there again so ultimately everyone's charges were dropped and we just wanted to come out and explain what really happened a lot of the times these YouTube videos that get really messy or if you do a challenge video and now I see these comments like oh who's who has to clean this and it's like I have to clean it we have to clean our own mess but that's part of the process I mean you have fun and you clean up after yourself and that's how it's supposed to go so yeah I just wanted to have you guys hear it from me what really happened and you know what I took from it

hey guys I'm clay casuai and I'm Cameron Dallas and today we thought about answering some questions a lot of you guys tweet both of us questions about dating and advice and what to do on the first date what are your preferences are you ready yeah let's go what dad dad what is the worst date you've ever been on ooh I feel like I haven't had any like particularly bad dates yeah but I feel like a lot of times it's like not really working that thank youing I don't know I'm not really dates anymore well I read this they wouldn't even me no I'm just saying I feel like our society and our like culture it's a lot about kind of just hanging out and you don't think you know on real dates at least I mean I wish it's still it like that I like I don't know I feel like a lot of times guys don't ask girls on real dates anymore which it's kind of I was the worst thing I guess done okay to answer the question um I don't think a guys it's never been like something really bad that's happened I just feel like an awkward date home and I've had it at the end of the date with like I went in for the hug and he went in for the kiss and it was oh wait were you into enough no not really but it was like I want it to be nice and then I was just awkward in I remember I was driving home and the whole time I was driving home I was like I'm so awkward like you know innocent right yeah yeah I had a actually went on the date and she didn't kiss me but she wanted to make me wait like two weeks just to kiss it damn but it hard to get very hard to get goes are tough I'm supposed guys don't ask you on dates I mean I just feel like well I also went to college like last year I was in UCLA and so that's that's cool yeah so yeah it's really fun but it's definitely like you go on date parties with guys basically you take this bus and you guys all go to a club and it's really fun and you get to take dates and most of the time you take dates from from so you know you invite a guy from a frat and you guys go and have fun and it's a gaff and invited me to one of these really yeah yeah I got was that magcon and she was like all I go to the college right down the street we're having a date party and I was like I can't go to that like do you like hang out with fans a lot hmm um sometimes like when I'm in areas that I don't know and I'm like by myself a big Oh what's up like do you know any like cool restaurants anything like that my fans and Atlanta or what was it I forgot where were they drove me to like the airport mm-hmm I like sometimes I like my family Airport which I mean yeah it's really cool when they're like you feel like you have friends all over the world like what are your relationship pet peeve Oh relationship pet peeve I hate when people break up get back together break up get back together yeah and when you have when your friends would like someone in one of those really yeah it's horrible when especially when your best friend because I remember he would like break up with her and object yeah like she was sad for you like I didn't like this to see her like that so much better and then he goes and tells her what I say and then they get back together and then we'd all hang out I'd just be sitting there just like yeah that's so awkward I thought that that person okay you think exes can return to just be friends mmm well I did actually because I dated my best friend and then kind of okay I kind of didn't work out like we were best friends for like five years and then we decided to date and then it was just kind of like oh it was but it didn't really work out and then we just went back to being one of the run um I think we're just like gotten too deep into the front if at that point that like like we were so close we told each other everything to the point where it was just like hanging out as friends I don't know like we okay it's not the perfect like I guess look like we went on a date I don't think ever if there was no like actual chemistry like romantically wise you know oh basically is what I'm saying so your best friend gotta step up his game yeah what is the best date you've ever been on it was it was the same girl that made me wait um two weeks so basically and the first time I met her I met at a carnival and I walked straight up to her she I was with my best friend and like I wasn't familiar with the area I walked straight up to and I gave her a hug right but I didn't know her boyfriend was right there and I was like I am Cameron and they got mad at me like my best I was like bro you can't just walk up to people's girlfriends and I cut them and I was like just saying hi like it's not about right so that's the first time I met her the second time I met her I was going to a party and I was with a girl who had the same name as her right and like the some of the guys are like trying to starts up with me so her and her boyfriend at the time they like he was like helping me and like we walked out together and like he was talking to the girl that I was that I brought to the party and then I was talking to the girl well I was talking to her right oh yeah talks a little bit then the third time I saw her was at the US Open and I was like who is that and my friend was like oh that's so-and-so and I was like bro she looks like an angel I found out she was single so I ended up Oh bro he looks like an angel yeah yeah I was like because she's beautiful yeah cordia's I'm arrest I was like so um I'm still like that like she's really pretty but she basically I ended up talking to her that day I got a number and then I asked her out on a date that night right and she's like go do and watch movie and I was like who is that so before I went right I got in my car and I drove and right before I made a left outside of my community there were a bunch of roses and I was like oh I might as well like do something cute so I'm legit spat like ten minutes looking for like the perfect rose yeah right got the relic drove all the way to her house right said what's that she walked outside what's up gave her the rose it was cute and then I walked in and her dad was watching TV already and I was like oh I might as well just act like who wants to watch the movie with us because I feel like a lot of people wouldn't ask the dad yeah you know so I was like yo do you wanna watch a movie what that she was like yeah so then he ended up watching half the movie with us and then leaving but it was like I I thought I was like the cutest date with like the whole row thing for me that's nice I don't know I really like this what's the best thing you ever had you tell me a full-on story of how you met this girl yeah but yeah that sounds cute the roasting what are three things your ex would say about you I don't know I feel like I'm trying to do this is like things I would say about myself but I guess do you think I don't know I'm sure he thinks you're funny right okay guys you I'm just I'm sure you tell me three things about me yeah I'm sure you think you're funny I mean he'd be like oh she's my best friend you probably you probably think you're someone nice like you can be he can try yeah right so you're probably very trustworthy yeah we talked about everything together so I think just like very close it's kind of weird though because it's like it's like your best friend so it's like you'd have a lot of answers but it's also your XO is kind of like we well I I think I didn't misread wait how long did you guys date it was a very short it was like a month it was very like and I was your ex yes how long ago with that um it was like last year oh okay cool yeah and you're single now yeah I haven't been in like a really serious relationship that's why I thought this is a kind of funny video for me to do so it can be two different perspectives like from someone I mean I don't know if you have either I've been in one relationship and that's my junior yeah I see I have not been in like an actual like serious committed relationship and maybe that is a different way to answer some of these questions No would you date someone who lived with their parents yeah yeah I mean I'm only 22 I feel like and I know you like to go on base with it were you hang out with the girl your dad yeah I don't think I don't think that's a big deal my sister still lives with my mom yeah I think at our age it's like fine I think if it was if we were a little older but I don't know would you if I mean it depends what age you're at like if you guys are in your 30s or something and they still would live with their parents I think that's a little a little weird but it's a super big house I mean yeah I got save their load yes I don't like section about yeah this is my section yeah of not my house and I think actually it's becoming more socially acceptable to move back in after you go to college like to go back to your house so was it I think just because it's a lot harder to get jobs nowadays coming right out of college so I don't know I think as long as they're still going towards something and working towards something and they're not just like living out their parents living off their parents yeah if they're still like trying to become something and make a career for themselves then I would who pays for the first date okay well I think it's a guy yeah okay this is a good one especially with the whole like gender roles and everything but I think if the guy wants the girl to know that it's a date he should pay not that it's like he should always pay but I just feel like if you're hanging out with a guy and it's like you both pay for your own I want to go to know that we're on a date I pay ya cuz then like you for sure knows that this is a date like you know you wanted to do you think do you think girls would get confused if I could I was just friends and then I was like all in the paper and I just paid for it yes I think both people on a date should make the move to pay mmm oh definitely definitely the girl should like most people should for sure and make the move to pay yeah but also I think all the way I was raised my mom like taught me to pay so like that's just how I was raised so I would I would pay for the first day exactly I'd probably pay for it like all of them uh I don't know it just really depends I feel like once you're in a relationship and if you both are making money and you you know I think it's fair to kind of split it or to go back and forth which I would like oh I think I think I was like oh let's go on a date and it's like okay but if it goes like oh I want to take you somewhere yeah and it's like a mutual things like all right cool yeah but for the first day I think it shows that it's a date regards oh yeah what is your favorite rom-com movie Wow you know someone literally asked me assess today I was like I have no clue uh that's what I said I honestly I said Rock was like what is wrong call it romantic comedy okay uh rom-com I guess like the cliche answer is the notebook but I've never seen that is that a comedy actually probably not how do you feel about long-distance relationships I think if it's right you know you know it and if you think it's worth it and I don't know I don't think it works I feel like it does not work yeah and I feel like at first it's like I don't know at least if you meet someone and then you guys live far away it's like the distance makes it stronger it's like what's that that's not free is it I couldn't do it like I have to deal with like that yeah it is that I'm not much yeah I'm not I'm I'm personally not a fan yeah but like if I really like some of them which I'll do it mm-hmm top three celebrity crushes hmm Rihanna Margot Robbie and would be the last one I think I think jail is pretty section yeah I think for me I have one and it's kind of it's Charlie puth no way yeah it's such a random like I don't know why and everyone like like his eyebrows thing was his neck on I don't know why I'm it just like so into him but he's like my one really nice yeah he's really cool and like the toys was amazing I'm just so attracted to like no I don't know him but I'm very attracted to musicians and people who can sing would you rather have really bad breath forever or body over odor forever I hate these questions seems like you have to choose one of the others I probably rather have bad breath just because if you have a wife than like you wake up in the morning you're gonna have bad breath like you gonna have bad breath for sure yeah and I guess I'm like I wouldn't care yeah I'm washed up now like dumb hair look at myself go I think accent agreed with the bad breath thing because also it's only people who are really close to your face who will be able to know and I feel like body odor like everyone would know yeah so my wife had bad breath I had to be like I don't care like yeah like and I bet her that's a gentleman King guys and girls just be friends yes I think so yeah I think so did definitely you just go for it we'll just do a couple in a row how long do you wait to text after meeting a guy sighs a girl I hate I hate our society honestly with the way that like you have to wait and you have to play games yeah yeah I need to see the type of you like send multiple texts no like I do it I mean I got the person whenever I want even if they don't taste like yeah see like I I do play by the game and everything but like I don't like it so what you do so you hate it what you do it yeah I'm more of like an in person type solution I don't like to be on my phone with people so it's like you could text me but like why don't we just hang out what's the worst pick-up line you've ever received you I have one yes I use as a joke but it's turned up bad it's just like the worst pick-up line in the world so basically when you actually measure take a line on a guy yeah like imagine going up to someone and just whispering in their ear and being like someone farted let's get out of here oh you did that yeah that's that's actually kind of funny like God make you guys like oh so it is a good pick-up line good conversation I'll be like no I'm the one that for days how much times you put into your first date outfit I'm I want to know look it up it I want to do it depends where you're going probably like if you're going the beach or you know yeah what and then on top of that it depends like were you doing nothing and then you have the date and then you got like got ready for the day or it's like you were ready for the day and then you had a date you know like you know yeah I don't know I don't know I don't think I put too much I throw some stuff on have you looked through your significant others phone hmm yeah I haven't done that I think that's just I mean significant other like we just got does egg we don't even have like there was how long ago no yeah um if I were to have a significant other I don't think I would because I just feel like this you wouldn't know I feel like that so I thought he was cheating and he is like like me like if I'm RELIGIOUS it like I'll straight up like I won't even have a passcode like I don't care Wow you don't even have a password I mean I do now yeah but like I lost my phone and it didn't have a passcode on an oven it yeah yeah whoa no I feel like I guess if you suspect something but I feel like it's you could just so you would you would do it i don't know i don't know i don't have you today was code and he went to the bathroom you knew like he like had a burrito maybe I was in the back like an hour maybe maybe had a burrito yeah cook at home or go out to a restaurant okay I would say make something at home put it in a picnic basket and then bring it somewhere and eat it and like let's go more cute yes that's a cute type of date like I think I'd be happy with either like going to a restaurant I couldn't at home I actually just recently started like having like a couple you go over and we'd cook together and like pretty funny that's cool would you rather date someone who is the funniest or the most intelligent shoot that's so hard because I feel like I don't know I honestly feel like it has to be a mixture and that's what the cheesy answer but like if you don't know you have to take typically I don't know super funny because if you don't intellectually like connect with someone it's hard to get past a certain level with them you know yeah but what if I don't know I think I'd go with someone that's funny just because okay it would like be really funny I think for a relationship I would say funny just because it's like fun and casual but I think maybe for life for life like him I live like for the one bringing that up again the one yeah but ideally right in the middle all right guys so we're going to do a little speed round so I think basically we just like say words and then can decipher some other person you wanna go first ready yeah laughs Angela's uh my apartment you can't say oh you have to just do it my part okay I have to think a little bit like oh my god me the color green blue Coachella fun cereal uh cinnamon

hey guys so today something happened and I it stuck out to me so much that I felt like I should share it with you guys it's probably gonna be really tough for me because I'm usually not one to like show my emotions anything like that but yeah I basically wrote it out in like a long story like all my notes and I wanted to post it on Twitter but it's like nine screenshots and then on Instagram it was too long so someone was like oh why don't you do a YouTube video and I was like aha like yeah that would be perfect but I guess I'm just gonna read it I haven't posted YouTube video anyways in a while so I think it would be good for you guys to see and I have it right here I printed it out so it's like two and a half pages oh but I guess I'll just alright a couple weeks ago I was going to my friend's event I was in a huge rush because he was about to perform and as I was walking in there was a bracelet company and they're like we want to give you a bracelet basically they have like these big metal things with like a word on it and they put it on like a little brass ring and like they hammer it in and that's one letter they they engrave like whatever word you want they're giving me examples like you can engrave your own name you can engrave a loved one's name a significant other you can engrave like a cool word you can engrave like a little saying something that means something new is something that could help you whenever you're feeling down or something like that so I was in a huge rush and I got the real sudden urge to get God has a plan engraved and when I did that he kind of like gave me like a weird look like I was crazy or like I was weird I don't know how to explain his look but after he gave me the look you slowly walked back and then told the person actually hitting the hammer what I wanted and I like rushed over saw my friend perform and then when it was over he brought it up to me he's like oh here it is and he put it on for me then we got to talking how but he's never had like a young person write something like that like it's always something like cool word I don't know their name or like their girlfriend or boyfriend his name but he was happy that I wrote what I wrote you're talking about what makes it so rewarding for him is that people will come to him like dude your bracelets help me so much I can't thank you enough and when he was telling me this I was kind of thinking to myself yeah that's like a once-in-a-lifetime thing but I was very thankful for the bracelet for me I'd rather wear a bracelet than a watch because I always lose watches and you don't have to worry about breaking a bracelet the only problem that I that I found with the bracelet is that every time I would look over at it it would be upside down or people someone would ask him like oh what's out on your wrist I was like oh it's a cool bracelet I would have to go turn it around show them and explain everything so it kind of like bugged me that the ring wouldn't stay at the top of my wrist it would always just fall down and every time someone would ask me about it I would have to like go turn it around and show them and like the only person that could see it was me and that's when I was like doing something where my wrist was facing out anyways I went to the extent of making new knots for and practically cutting off my circulation in my hand because I was like tying it so tight so I wouldn't the freaking move I mean it just ended up doing its own thing and it just went back to dangling down at the bottom of my wrist like that so I finally came to terms with it hanging down at the bottom of my wrist and I kind of forgot about it unless it was like the occasional me getting super hungry and there not being any food and I would just sit there and like chew on it like this so fast-forward to the beginning of today I woke up feeling like really different not like the usual me like when I get out of bed I woke up feeling more depressed I feel really stressed out I felt really down and I just felt that that emotional side of me just coming out when I woke up and uh and I I'm not really one to like weigh in on those emotions so I kind of like tried forgetting about it by going on Twitter and talking to you guys and going on YouTube and watching funny videos ah but I I don't know I just couldn't shake it like I couldn't I don't know I just couldn't um get over the feeling so I decided to take a shower shower is a funny place it's where I wash my body but uh not only did I get the shower because I needed to but because I wanted to kind of think things through and talk to myself I guess it would be yeah I just really wanted to like collect myself and all my thoughts and clear my mind so I turned the shower on and I waited for it to get warm and turn my music gon put it on shuffle you would expect some hype song like a lot of my songs are really hype you know yg Dre just a bunch of people but it played all back by Chris Brown it got me remembering all the good times I've had these past couple of years so I texted one of my good friends I kept asking like oh do you remember this do you remember that we're just talking about that for a little while after that song after I was like done talking to him I just I still didn't feel right if anything it made me feel worse I just felt like crying oh so about like 30 seconds into the shower I couldn't bottle anything up anymore and I just started crying I I think that all the times that I should have cried or I should have got emotional but I wanted to keep my strong person image to the people that look up to me I think that really just just flooded out I felt stressed out I felt depressed I I felt sad I felt like everything was turning against me when I was only trying to do the right thing I felt like everyone was being turned against me by people that didn't really care about them I felt confused I felt like an idiot for caring so much and being the one to stand up for not only myself but putting myself out there and standing up for other people even if they don't see it yet I felt mad at myself for letting things get so far I felt like not only did I let myself down and all the people that look up to me but most of all I felt like I let God down I guess I was just blaming myself for so long for all the things that I saw happening even if it wasn't about me I blame myself for people going I blame myself for people going down the wrong path I thinking myself if only I tried a little harder I blame myself for a lot of things and I I just sat there in the shower crying a really long time I kept asking myself why like why did this happen how how did this happen how could I let such dumb things happen when I was sitting there crying when I was sitting there bawling my eyes out more like I just being mad at myself there's screaming at myself I've never experienced that but I don't know what it was I just crying I just started screaming I was just sitting there being in a state of so many mixed emotions feeling angry depressed sad stressed out and just in that moment when I've honestly felt a Louis in my life I had my eyes covered with the palms of my hands like this and I was just bawling my eyes out and I could barely even catch my breath I I took my hands away and I saw something shining right back at me and it was a brass ring on my bracelet I read it said God has a plan after reading that I had a sense of like calming in myself a sense of relief I had a sense of joy at a sense that everything was gonna work out I had a sense that no matter what odds were stacked against me even if it looked impossible that I would come out with a smile on my face because I knew that I was doing the right thing even if the people that I'm helping don't see it that way I had a sense that and I knew everything would be okay and everything would be alright if I had faith in trusting God I wanted to share this experience with you today and I usually never do it with anyone because I know a lot of you guys are going through tough times times in your life where you might sit in the shower like I didn't just cry to yourself just feeling a million different emotions being mad at yourself being mad at others feeling depressed feeling like there's no way out feeling like there's no light at the end of the tunnel well I'm here to tell you that there is a light at the end of the tunnel you will get through it whatever is happening in your life you will get through it there's really nothing you can't do I mean besides like fly just to continue to push forward and do the right thing and everything that you do be fair don't let people tear you down don't let people convince you that what you're doing is wrong just because it goes against their own selfish ways and one of the biggest ones don't let yourself get peer pressure I mean I know I've done it and I came out being mad at myself and there was that point where I was thinking like no this is not me I shouldn't be doing this but everyone around us like come on come on come on and there's a point where I was almost convinced like maybe it is me maybe this is me maybe it's all right maybe it's okay but it's really not and just because other people have fallen into the wrong things are they're doing the wrong thing so they're trying to convince you that you should do the wrong things doesn't mean you should do it don't let them convince you because you're doing the right thing and they're not yeah I wrote this and I just wanted to share with you guys I do want to give a big thank you to all my fans especially the ones that have been supporting me since back when I was on Instagram by myself and thank you too even the new ones that saw me today you

it's really exciting that we went from just regular kids to building ourselves to being this I mean we're in a movie like a D how do you when I first read it I like I love the script it was just a very well-written script and got me really stoked and and when we started filming it I don't it was fun it was probably like the most fun I've ever had on a set so my character is Frankie he's a very confident guy but unfortunately I think the things that go on behind the scenes like that that go on not during school but like at home I think that that's what really like defines Frankie but he doesn't like to talk about it and he doesn't open up and there's definitely a conflict there and throughout the movie you see him just trying to he's trying to find any way to get out of that situation and be able to to get out of this small town Peoria I love acting it's fun one of the biggest challenges was like when I first started acting was being comfortable on camera and like having that many people around you like watching you and I think at first when you first start acting it's like you feel like they're judging everything when in fact they really like they're just doing their job and they're paying attention to what they're doing and I think on this movie I was very comfortable with everyone on set and I I had a really good time on on set a people should go see it early because it's something that I'm very proud of and I think people are gonna be really surprised to see me and Nash and everyone else Joey act in like a drama and like go from where we started on vine to being like goofy and like this weird kid that has like these weird kids I have like a great personality on line two playing characters that have real emotion and like real problems and backgrounds and things that they're going through and they're playing like real life things and I think I think it's going to be a big surprise for everyone to see you

hey everyone today we are doing something really cool and it's gonna be called dear Cameron there are a lot of people that have interesting questions about love relationship and other things and they want to always hear my take on it so I'm gonna be going through and answering some questions from some fans the first question this is a personal one how many girlfriends have you had I've had one official girlfriend that was my junior year her name was jasmine Gonzales went to Chino high school we talked for four months and went out for three and the reason why we broke up was because we just kind of we didn't like grow apart as people like it was only seven months but like who just realized that we were better off as friends and that's that one the second one and this is one that a lot of people really have in mind when they meet me and a lot of girls will ask me this or assume that I'd do this have you ever cheated on someone and the answer is no I have never cheated on anyone I've only had one girlfriend on top of that like it's just not something I would do it's kind of offensive that people like assume that I'm like that type how is your love life Cameron well not that it's anyone's business but I love life is kind of chill I'm more so working on like self-improvement and working on you know like expanding myself and learning more about myself and understanding who I am and getting to know what I'm about I feel like for my love life before I love someone else I really need to experience Who I am I'm only 22 so I'm still learning about myself [Applause] what age do you think is too young to have your first kiss now a lot of people go back and forth depending on how you're raised depending on a million different things religion parents your own beliefs your own wants your own needs I think I got my first kiss when I was young I'm not sure I remember I was in like third grade and this girl she she handed me a this little tiny notepad that she had and it said do you want to kiss I would literally took it I flipped the page over and I wrote know all over it and then I wrote one little tiny yes and basically I'm not sure if we kissed after that or if I told her I liked her but there's a little story for you what should I wear to go bowling for the first time with my crush most likely you're gonna end up switching your shoes out so I wouldn't worry too much about your shoes you're gonna have different shoes on and they're gonna be goofy the whole time what would be cool is if you told the person you're going bowling with is saying hey you want to dress up for a certain thing like my sister just had a bowling birthday party and we all dressed up in like neon because it was like one of those bowling alleys where you go at night they turn on the neon lights and everyone like starts glowing at me as a guy I don't really think too much as like oh what is she wearing when we're going bowling she asked to wear something cool it's more so like I'm thinking what conversations can we start like how is this gonna play out more so than what you're weighing so I wouldn't think too much about it what's the best way to get a guy to notice you in school a lot of times like guys are oblivious to the signs that you give them like for me for someone to come to me and be like hey and for me to like notice him it would literally be that like come with me and be like hey what's up I'm so-and-so it's like oh hey and kind of just start basic conversation and just see where that goes is it okay to break up over text no I don't think it is okay to break up over text I'm more so of an in person type and I think conversation can be misread over text in the context of it can be misinterpreted so I like to be in person I like to be able to feel how they're saying yet when you break up with someone you don't want it to be a bad breakup at the end of the day you always want to clean a good breakup I know there's a lot of situations where it's like someone did something horrible or you did something horrible and there's no way it could be like recovered but if you decide like oh we just want to be friends I think there's a way to kind of do it the right way and to do it in person so I would definitely say it's not okay to break up over text or even worse email just because like who emails that's worse I think a friend of mine is secretly hooking up with my boyfriend this is one of those cases you guys were I would like to know like a little bit more information and you guys can let me know down in the comments below like he did this and she did this and that's why I'm assuming that they're hooking up because as of right now it could it could be that they're hooking up it could be an insecurity that you have it could be just that it might seem like that and nothing really is going on what is the best place to meet someone for a first date once again guys keep it simple it's not a big deal if you wanted to go meet up at the person's house and go walk around do it if you want to go to the skate park do it if you want to go to the movies cool if you want go go-karting awesome I wouldn't necessarily say there is a best place to meet up but there are definitely cool places to go maybe like the batting cages that's kind of cool because like you like show some vulnerability if you suck at softball and on top of that like maybe the person can help you play if they're good or maybe you can help them or maybe you're both good and you guys get competitive with it or you can go it's like one of those like self cook restaurants I don't know you can go to Color Me Mine and color something and see how creative the person gets or maybe you want to just go get ice cream keep it simple go to the mall and just like chill walk around people watch together there's a million different things you can you can do it's really just about what you like and how creative you are it's not necessarily that there's a best place it's about making the place or the thing that you do the best thing do you think jealousy is always good I think for me personally like I remember when I was young I always thought like oh like if a girl's jealous that shows that like they're always into me and like I feel like I sought that out just to comfort myself but at the same time that's wrong because you don't you don't want to constantly be thinking like oh I want them to be jealous or like that's that's just not healthy I think for me I I would rather me be okay and take the chance of like I'm not gonna assume anything's going on but I feel like it's always good to give the person like the benefit of the doubt until they do something that's when you're like okay but jealousy is tricky because people are naturally just gonna get jealous and it's just something that you have to work on and also communicate with other person like I feel like communication is big when it comes to jealousy like if you get jealous when I talk to someone like communicate that and maybe maybe they can let you in on some insight like oh maybe they don't think that way towards that person and they just want to be cool with your best friend because and it looks like they're flirting but they want to be cool because that's your best friend and they want to make sure that they have a relationship with them so when you guys all hang out together it's not like weird those were the questions for today if you guys have any other questions comment them down below I want to know kind of like what you guys are thinking what's going on what the situation is I'm here for you guys I'm ready to answer them let me know what you thought of my answers for this one let's make a discussion right now because I would love to see what you guys thought about my answers right now give it a thumbs up if it kind of answered some of your questions or if it gave you a little bit of insight anyways peace out have a good day bye bye
