In many ways aerial photography has consumed my creative process. I can’t travel anywhere without imagining what the perspective might look like from above. I’ve shot out of just about every type of craft you can imagine but my favorite is still the light weight aircraft .. Cessna or Piper Cub. .
A selection of my aerial photographs are hanging at the Ritz Carlton in Laguna Beach alongside some incredible surfboards shaped by my friends at @albumsurf @albumatt . Check out the show titled “Winter Waters” if you are passing through Southern California. Partial process go supporting Halendid.is - a non profit working to protect Iceland’s rivers by creating a National park.
This photo and others are also available as a print on my website.. Meredith June Edwards and Jason Schlarb running through pristine mountain landscapes in China. Roam. To the women who Inspire me today... and everyday. Thank You 

#InternationalWomensDay. How I yearn to know all the secrets hidden among these granite walls. To see what they have seen....From Viking faerings to modern ships the settlements in Reine fjord are like a history book being opened. 
Shot from a Cessna 172. Never has Sand & Mountain collided in such a beautiful way. 
Separated by the faint dry riverbed of Sand Creek... this is the seldom seen NW side of the Great Sand Dunes.. A kaleidoscope of color dances & reflects off the Swiss granite that lines this river. Despite the freezing temps  I felt compelled to make sure it was real & see it without my goggles on.
My favorite part is the silver trail left behind by @deepleigh ‘s wetsuit.. It's important. Go Roam.. Flying through castles of ice & rock throughout the northern patagonia Ice field. I still feel left in awe when I’m able to work with such talented people as @renan_ozturk & @uavantage . Flying in these conditions were extremely challenging and technical with wind gusts well beyond anything I feel comfortable flying in. Shot during our last conservation project for @tompkins_conservation. Until I traveled to Alaska  I don’t really think I ever had a full appreciation for real wildlife. The biodiversity in such a small area was incredible and every trail & road led us to a new vantage where we would take hours to just sit & watch. Less photos were taken and binoculars became our best friend. At times you would even get an up close encounter. Grateful for places like @denalinps who have set a benchmark for how we can protect & preserve wilderness while still making it accessible. #WorldWildlifeDay. Love in the Valle Verzasca.. If they only knew what was down here.. A the low point my loaded bag & feet were almost dragging in the swollen river below. The Tyrolean traverse  a classic Patagonian commute  is one of the most memorable experiences from my trip. My smile was big as I whipped across this river passing through mist and wind en route to the glacier. 
.
@blackdiamond 
📷 @_ryanhill_. The crew came back with some beautiful footage from this adventure. Nice work guys. Roam. Surfboards in a forest may be an odd sight to see  but some of the worlds best breaks are usually the most secretive. The search for waves is always a bit of an adventure  but exploring a forest illuminated by early morning light on your way to a remote beach is easily as good as it gets for me. Add a few good friends (and a possible sasquatch) & it makes the trip worthwhile even if there are no waves to be found.
.

 @thetorpedopeople. I remember pulling over the car at a lookout & @jamesqmartin saying ... “You are really gonna love this winding road. After this thought  it all turns to dirt and the real adventure begins.” He was right .. 6 hours down windy rocky roads led us to Parque Patagonia through the night. Often food & gas & spare tires were sparse ( we learned the hard way) so you would have to ask locals or carry your own.. Every photographer knows that a part of you never leaves Patagonia. It’s a place that stays fixed in the front of the memory bank for years to come.. Pursuit Series for a workshop in Austin  Texas on April 27-29th. I'll be there leading an immersive  full-day photo workshop on Saturday the 28th to help sharpen all of your photography skills! It's going to be an awesome weekend filled with hiking  mountain biking  paddle boarding  photography  and a ton of other outdoor activities. Think of it as a summer camp for grown-ups who love the outdoors. 

Stoked and hope to see you there!!

http://bit.ly/2EzeraR. Nothing good in Patagonia is ever easy to get to and that is exactly how it should be. Our thin hiking trail cut through the trees below and led to two small boats stashed on the shore. The path to what the locals called  “the secret glacier” was a long one. Involving a drive  river boat  hike  tyrolean traverse  and finally one last boat to get there. The entire crew was left in awe as we saw one of the largest glacier calvings of our life. 

@jamesqmartin @renan_ozturk. I remember @ellithor saying the reason he has such a hard time as a photographer on days like this is because he gets too excited  loses his mind a little bit  and wants to surf all day like a Grom. When we pulled up that is exactly what he proceeded to do.

This image & principle cinematography was shot by @renan_ozturk . Watching him work and operate a camera in this confined space was impressive & challenging. 
@shotsfromabove. My last trip to Japan was years ago. I chased a typhoon for surf to the island of Shikoku. At the time I had no idea that beyond it’s world class surf  Japan also has unreal snow. Maybe some of the best in the world. I flew directly from NZ after a month long commercial shoot to learn a little more about what makes the Japanese winters so special... it’s been less than 48 hours & I can already say it’s one of the funnest trips of my life.

High tide on the estuary creates a maze of paddleable water. Low tide on the other hand is an impassible mud bog where birds feed on the surface. What a difference 6 hours will make.. Happy Birthday Ansel Adams. 
Thank you for a lifetime of inspiration with & without a camera. It was your work behind the lens that speaks to me most. Your voice for wild places & advocacy for preserving the ones you loved most. You truly lived the motto that wilderness is a necessity  not a luxury. 🙏🏽. A photo of seemingly nothing... but also everything. 
.

During a commercial shoot for Fjallraven a few years ago  I created some TV spots & photo library introducing the brand to the US market... we explored the rainforest of the Pacific Northwest as our backdrop  this was one of my favorites from the project. So much wonder amongst these trees.. Cloud patterns amongst the newly formed Patagonia National park. The wind here is like nothing else  I’ve never seen clouds or weather move this swiftly. 20 seconds later It was raining.. I have a pretty thick skin. I’ve learned the subtle art of not really caring what people think & just being myself over the years. But yesterday as sweat dripped off my hat & soaked my shirt during the 4 000 ft of elevation gain on the hike up Coromandel Peak  I had a moment where it was actually hard to enjoy it’s beauty. Years ago I read an article that talked about the overuse & popularity of this location after my 1st visit. In essence it had “blown up” so to say & I’m sure some of my images played a role. I definitely wasn’t the first person to photograph this spot nor was I the first to be drawn to its beauty   grandeur & feel the urge to share the incredible experience of looking over its surreal vista. But like many things where a finger needs to be pointed sometimes people with a large following can be an easy place to point it. 
Today on the trail I paid close attention. I couldn’t find a single piece of trash  there were less trails that led off route. Families and people of all race & color were going up to experience all 8 miles of its beauty & steepness . At a certain point it dawned on me  “isn’t part of reason we share nature is to inspire people get out of their cars & tour busses  stretch their legs  and earn these beautiful locations?” An undertaking like this hike is bound to leave a mark on someone’s memory bank. Even if just for a photograph... these experiences where you have to suffer a little bit mean so much more than any roadside pullout you can drive to. And although the “secret is out”  I think it’s better to have these places appreciated by many  rather than a select few  because that is how they become protected for the long term.. Cruising through the trees in Montana with Shawn Neer and Jubal Davis. Roam. These views always come with a price. Fear has to be set aside & a calling greater than yourself must be followed.

If you have 6 minutes to spare. Take a moment & watch my new short film ‘Shot From Above’. It’s a message I think the whole world might need to hear right now.

This is the story of Chris Dahl-Bredine who built an experimental aircraft in his garage to help immerse himself in the landscapes he loves. For Chris the 'ultralight trike' isn't just a tool for exploration  it's a way of filtering a complicated world. Through his camera  Chris has been able to bring us visions of earth seldom seen by way of aircrafts  helicopters  or drones. 
Watch Chris' journey through Colorado's Great Sand Dunes National Park as he captures images from one of his favorite landscapes with the Sony a7R III.. Working on this project with Chris Dahl-Bredine and Renan Ozturk was an amazing experience. Flying ultralight trikes above the Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado.

Somewhere on a remote beach in Kamchatka Russia @cyrus_sutton ‘s lonely longboard washed ashore.  
2012. An Indian sandbar at the far end of the archipelago peaked our interest. From afar it appeared to have clean surf. Turned out to be a small island with nothing more than razor sharp reef & hand size hermit crabs. 🦀 🐚. Currently doing some last minute packing & repacking as I shuffle my gear & question every piece of equipment I’m bringing to New Zealand. The Otago region is one of my favorite places on the planet & i’m excited to return and see what summer has to offer. It’s been years since I’ve seen these greens.. I have a real affinity for San Dunes. Next to the Ocean It is probably my favorite landscape to photograph because it’s constantly in a state of change... never the same twice. It’s possible the attraction is even a little bit deeper than that  the way dunes seem to ‘embrace the winds of change’ is a message I try to consider every time I am in their presence.. I'm really stoked to be teaming up with Pursuit Series for a workshop in Austin  Texas on April 27-29th. I'll be there leading an immersive  full-day photo workshop on Saturday the 28th to help sharpen all of your photography skills!

http://bit.ly/2EzeraR. This road can be pretty treacherous at times. It’s no stranger to black ice  avalanches  and you can absolutely forget about a guardrail to protect you from the steep cliffs that lead to a freezing Atlantic Ocean. But compared to the old road (seen above) that exposed you to the furthermost point of the peninsula & the full force of the arctic weather.... this is actually pretty mellow.. As much as I admire the explorers traveling to the ends of the Earth on large scale Expeditons. It’s the everyday man (or women) that truly explores & appreciates their own backyard that I admire most. Guys like Chris Dahl-Bredine @shotsfromabove who built an experimental aircraft in his garage in order to bring a new perspective to his life & creative vision. There isn’t much glamour in this type of exploration.. no sponsors footing the bill. Just hard work  cold mornings & sometimes a bit of duct tape. Part cowboy  part artist... chris’ work blends a blue collar work ethic that I have found really inspiring. So much so that I asked @renan_ozturk & @sonyalpha to help tell his story.

Video releasing next week. Stay tuned.. Keith Ladzinski was the eye in the sky on this mission. Capturing Mike Libecki stand-up paddle boarding and climbing in Greenland. Roam. I'm really stoked to announce my 2018 workshops! There will be international 7 day trips  6 day domestic adventure classes  and single day workshops. 

What you should expect on our 2018 workshops from Colorado to Norway and beyond:
Learn to walk like penguins. Battle sea sickness. Eat sardines and whale fat. Question the meaning of life. Drop camera into water by accident. Dress up in Coyote costumes to sneak up on bison. Make contact with a UFO in the sand dunes. Get lost. Find God. Dodge attacks from aggressive Icelandic sheep. See the Northern Lights. Cry. Call your Mom and apologize for everything. Take only one photograph. Best photograph you’ll ever take. Retire from photography.

But in all seriousness  this is an excellent opportunity to learn all things photography  with and without the camera. Come join me in one of these epic places! If you would like to see more info  please visit the link below  and I'm excited to hopefully see you in the field!

http://www.chrisburkard.com/Workshops. Other than the planet Mars  North Iceland has the largest concentration of fully formed pseudocraters & volcanic craters we know of. These rootless volcanic vents are a marvel to behold. Before you lies Hverfjall which is one of the largest explosion craters in the world. Walk along its rim & explore its core  you may for a second feel like you are on Mars.. There are few people that can connect with their subject like @ben_moon . I’ve looked up to him as a photographer & storyteller for many many years. His ability to be vulnerable is what makes his work so powerful. His personal story or surviving cancer told through his short film ‘Denali’ is a tear jerker & one of the most inspiring films I have ever seen. Google it.
.

During a workshop we taught together in LA last year he pulled me aside & asked to shoot my portrait. We ended up behind a dumpster using a food tray from the trash as a reflective bounce to light the eyes. I laughed as I tried to envision what Ben shot in these less than ideal conditions. But as always... he made something pretty special. To see more of his ‘Moon Faces’ series check his account at @ben_moon. Wedged between the Norwegian Sea & the North Atlantic  the Faroe Islands’ coastal landscape is dominated by cliff faces. Located halfway between Norway & Ireland  the Faroe Islands have the highest sea cliffs in Europe  and some of the highest sea cliffs in the world. The highest reach up to 2 893 feet  (882 meters.) Pair this geology with a trip during the winter months  and the northern lights and you get a whole new level of wonder. 
.

I shot this 5 years ago on a surf trip to the islands. I used a Sony A7S with a 24mm lens & long exposure settings to capture the Northern lights. Waterfall was slightly lit with a flashlight and ISO was around 8000.. Few things are more powerful to witness than a Father teaching his Son. 
.
Moms too. More from this experience soon.. Life finds a way.. Sacred waters. 
The churning confluence of the Rio Baker & Neff. Chocolate milk on one side & sapphire blue on the other.. Within minutes of the glacier calving  ice was spread out almost a quarter mile across the lake. Creating a nearly impenetrable barrier (at least in my kayak) to get through. I floated along its edge as it moved like an organism with the subtle shifts in the wind. It’s hard to imagine that all of this was a wall of ice 100+ ft high just moments prior.

https://albumsurf.com/pages/chris-burkard-surfboards. We moved through the Ice at a snails pace in these conditions. You could have walked or ran faster than we were moving. The captain only had only one rule in these conditions  don’t block his view. Navigating through this was a constant back & forth across the boat making sure the we didn’t make contact with the bigger icebergs. As the wheel spun back & forth in what seemed like a haphazard pattern I was amazed we never made a sudden impact through this busy fjord. A testament to the skill of our captain aboard the @auroraarktika. A dead Juniper near the rim of the canyon. I photographed this tree most the morning studying its twisted roots emerging from what seemed like pure rock. Living trees are always more stunning but there‘s something special about a dead tree that is still deeply rooted.. Follow along on a seemingly endless spine line with Travis Rice. Roam. Beyond just taking photos of the beautiful Z shaped river bends from the air  my job was to spot the kayaker & make sure they made it safely to the eddy under the foliage. Past the second bend the river quickly turned into a heinous series of tight slot canyons & waterfalls. Virtually impassable without going for an unwelcome swim.. For a brief moment  with a tiny bit of rain  California does it’s best to disguise another dry year. It’s amazing how quickly these hills can come back to life. Nature’s resilience is always astonishing.. The moment ... after the moment. Compared to the boil at the corner of this pool  the waterfall was mellow @jlancasterkayaker said. Getting pushed into a cave under the foliage is the real fear. From Patagonia earlier in December.. First rays of light touching down on the central coast. One of my first aerial photographs I ever shot. Another image from my California Disaster Print gallery on my site.. A lesson in friendship care of British Columbia.. Check out a recent podcast I did with 'By Land' where I share the importance of storytelling through photography. With every photograph I take  I hope to inspire people  through both the image and the story  to go out and explore the world we live in.

But unlike water or Ice you never see it work it’s magic. I love this image of the @greatsanddunesnps because you can truly see the wind whipping this lenticular cloud into the iconic disk shape  and below  the largest dunes field in the USA all created by that same wind pattern flowing over the 14K ft Sangro De Cristo Mountains. This year I am honored to be working with the National Park Foundation @goparks to share the beauty of some of my favorite places in the West. Places that inspired me to pick up a camera as a young kid & have been the driving force for me to inspire others to get outside. #findyourpark. Photography continues to push me into uncertain situations. Some which of require persistence and a bit of luck. Action and lifestyle photographer  Blake Jorgenson  has continued to pursue his vision with the world’s top adventure athletes documenting some insane mountain sports photographs. Check out some of his story here:

The sun creeps slowly into the valley giving life to a new day. Our trip to Patagonia was eye opening in so many ways. Learning more about the efforts of the @tompkins_conservation was a highlight for me as we used technology to help tell a full circle story about how land preservation can create opportunities for future generations. 
This image is a favorite from my trip while testing the Mavic Air drone. Today I am excited to be in NYC (despite lost bags & delayed flights) to speak at the launch event for @djiglobal . Thanks for letting me test such a unique piece of technology in such an otherworldly location. 
#MavicAir. To support those suffering in California from the Thomas Fire & Montecito Mudslides I have put together a collection of my favorite California photographs I’ve shot over the years. 100% of the profit from Print sales goes to aid in the relief efforts of these natural disasters & those affected.

#EveryLittleBitHelps  @ Link In Bio. My first real Patagonia sunrise was written down on a list of experiences never to forget.. A Guanaco & it’s young Chulengo take a moment to examine us atop a windy ridge in Parque Patagonia. It didn’t matter how high or remote you climbed  if there was grass  a Guanaco would be there. To survive in this harsh terrain these animal have to be resilient. We silently watched this family eat for hours as males fought over mating territory. I’m excited to finally be able to share more of my experience in this park and the conservation efforts by the @tompkins_conservation in the following weeks.

@renan_ozturk @kristine_tompkins @jamesqmartin. Even when the sun is out of sight  it makes its presence known.. Even when surrounded by all the beauty in the world there are moments while traveling that can feel incredibly lonely. Mostly when I know I have loved ones at home I had to leave behind. I sat down this week & talked about how I cope with these experiences & others while working on the road for long stretches of time with my friend Rachel @yoga_girl as apart of her Podcast series. For anyone who wants to learn more about balancing travel  family  work & some thoughts on conservation... check it out. .

Hard work and the needs to support one another through it tends to transcend race  religion  sex and many of the other barriers we create in every day life.. Moving under the pressure of a breaking wave can be addicting. There is even an acoustic sound created can change depending on the ocean floors surface.
Shot years ago in Tahiti w/@thetorpedopeople. Kai Lenny getting creative at Jaws! Roam. For a moment I thought the Mountain was surfing a cloud.. My 2-day online Outdoor Photography workshop continues to be one of the most popular courses on CreativeLive . If you can’t make it to an in- person workshop then this is the next best thing. Covers everything from Post processing to photography business to night photography & much more. Check it out in my bio link along with some of my other favorite courses. You can purchase the class here: http://cr8.lv/cburkard. If there is something I have learned about exploration it is that often the greatest journeys you ever take will be the internal ones. Deep inside yourself. In the end its not about the photos you took  waves you rode or the mountains you climbed... its about how the experience changed you & forged into somewhat of a better or different person. That process takes introspection  sometimes a lot of it. This is the time of year where I start to fill up notebooks & emails threads with potential expedition locations. Sometimes there is such little information that the planning process feels like I’m trying to decipher a hidden language. From tiny Russian Islands in the middle of nowhere to the ultra remote tip of South America & many desert landscapes in between  my list of places I want to explore has grown exponentially. I know I will never get to them all.. but one can always dream. I wonder what has been on your must explore list?

My next expedition will hopefully be this upcoming spring alongside my friends at @montblanc   a brand rooted in exploration for over 100 years.
#SpiritOfExploration #SIHH. I’m now convinced that birds truly have the best view of anyone.. I’ve found that often right before the Ocean humbles you (in this case it was a waterhousing to the face & a wrestle with the reef) it typically shows you a beautiful view. It’s one of those rare places where things can be incredibly peaceful and almost hypnotic one second then total chaos the next.

@prana. A visual summary of a few of my favorite things.. Sunday morning in Greenland.. As a kid my Grandpa played a huge role in my life. During my early years without a dad his influence & mostly his time was critical in fostering my love for the outdoors. I vividly remember my first road trip with him starting in the Sierra. One of my goals this year was to finally buckle down & build a van so I could share those same joys with my kids. Something brand new was out of my price range so I opted for a used Sprinter van. Something with tons of character and well over 100K miles. I made a short film about my relationship with the road  my van build and the importance of these experiences for the younger generation.

For a short list of products we used in the build. @kammok @goalzero @thule @polkaudio @prana @gnarbox @rigracks. Good things take time. Last year was a perfect example where I got to cross off one of those ‘maybe someday I’ll be able to shoot this’ scenarios. A record early season snowfall provided a short but epic window to experience Glacier Point like I had never before. The snow set up perfectly as the conditions stayed cold. This year  sadly  is a different story & doesn’t look anything like this. Here @kcdeane feels the reward of leaving a Canadian winter for once in a decade Sierra snowfall.. It’s pretty comical when I tell people I’m colorblind. What results is usually a game of someone pointing at things while I try to identify the color. I would deny it for years but my grade school tests would prove otherwise. It was always colors next to one another. Blues and purples  browns and greens.. never a single color in isolation. Patterns were always confusing on clothes. Last year my wife bought me a pair of glasses to help correct color blindness but when I wear them it gives everything a purple haze and usually results in a headache. How do you edit your photos ?! People always ask. When I was the sole person color correcting my images it always presented some unique challenges for me.. my workaround was usually just to look for an overall tonal value or temperature (cool or warm) instead of trying to add a bunch of overall saturation I couldn’t really identify. I’m not totally sure if the world is truly a more vibrant and colorful place than I see it. In the grand scheme I don’t really think it matters too much either as good photographs for me are usually defined by their composition and how they make me feel as opposed to how they look.. Sediment brushstrokes near the confluence of the Dirty Devil & Colorado River. An area often void of color variation tends to give you a different perspective from above.. One of the coolest parts about having interns is watching them go on to have their own projects and adventures. Chris Eyre-Walker outdid himself with this one. Check out his new film about high-lining in the Faroe Islands.. I'm stoked to see how this interview with Resource Travel Magazine came out! It's always  great to go more in depth into what the film didn't cover. Check it out here: 
http://travel.resourcemagonline.com/2017/12/under-an-arctic-sky-an-interview-with-chris-burkard/19140/. Seemed like a path worth following.. Words from my good friend @kcdeane ”Stoked to see the photo in the Powder Magazine photo annual which was taken by chris burkard.  This was one of the craziest trips I've ever done  and started over a year ago as a hair brained idea to ski off Glacier Point. Chris called me and said conditions were lining up so I jumped on a flight and we drove to Yosemite National Park to make the 16 mile tour out to Glacier point.  After 10 hours of touring at 2am ; Me  Chris  and Wezzy (ryan) found ourselves exhausted  hypothermic  and still 2 hours from Glacier point huddled in a Forest Service bathroom. Chris and I woke up a few hours later in order to make it for sunrise & ski this place.  After two days we made the long tour back out sore  blistered  and thankful that for one we didn't die from hypothermia  and two that we got to ski here in perfect conditions. This was the last run I skied the morning we left and is one of the most memorable lines I've ever skied.”

@_ryanhill_ @powdermagazine. Over 1 000 ft deep  the Goosenecks of the San Juan River give us one of most perfect examples of a meandering river. It’s the almost mirrored perspective that really gets me. You look close and begin to see a symmetry that is hard to fathom.. That short window when the Sun is still setting and the Moon is just rising.. A few years back I had the chance to create a project alongside one of my favorite photographer/ filmmakers @ladzinski . We spent 2 weeks surfing & climbing with an all star crew along Iceland’s east & south coast. Many of the areas were unexplored. Keith & I always bonded over our fascination with the landscape & wildlife. So I called my friend Omar  the landowner here & he let us photograph some of his younger horses & trainers. I had totally forgotten about this footage until Keith texted me today. We usually get so focused on the epic Climbing or surfing that these subtle moments take a back seat. Brought the whole experience back. 
📷 @ladzinski. Getting a good ‘Astro’ photograph in one single frame takes some patience & practice. It may be one of the hardest things to photograph because of the fact that it’s all happening at night. It’s typically cold  dark & sometimes you’re fumbling with equipment while wearing thick gloves. Unless you know the landscape or shoot location well it can also feel very foreign at night. With practice it all gets easier. If there is a few pieces of advice I can offer to dramatically improve your astrophography ‘in-camera’ it would be.
.

1 ) Use the best lenses you can. This is one aspect of photography where the equipment makes a huge difference. Try to get a wide angle prime (something between 15-35mm) that has a minimum opening of F2.8 or lower. These lenses are sharper  focus easier at night & let in way more light.
2) Don’t be afraid of a high ISO. People often think that by shooting a lower ISO they are preserving the quality of the image even if though the photo comes out dark. Trying to bring a photo back to life in Lightroom or during Post processing always brings out a lot of noise & artifacts that typically wouldn’t be there if you just shot a bit higher ISO and tried to get the correct exposure in camera. 
3) Your lens MM controls your Star movement. If you are after tack sharp stars with no movement (like the image above) or blurring then you will want to understand this simple concept. The ‘Wider’ the lens the slower the shutter speed you can have without star blurring  the tighter or more compressed your lens  the faster the shutter will have to be. A quick rule of thumb follows : 15mm lens up to ~ 25s shutter. 20mm up to ~ 15s shutter. 24mm up to 10-12s shutter. This calls for experimentation but it’s important to realize that even changing your lens MM by just a tiny bit will force you to adjust shutter speed/ ISO.
.

Happy shooting and remember that’s its always supposed to be fun! 📷💥

I shot this with @sonyalpha A7Sii & @sigmaphoto 20mm f1.8 lens. Iceland offers the opportunity to explore almost endlessly. There’s always more to see! Andy Best | Roam. We laid on our backs for what seemed like a long time & listened to the wind move through these arches  it sounded like a symphony just for us.. The more time I ride out here  the greater my fascination with the West grows.. New year  new roads.. Finding a beach...let alone a calm one  is rare along the Arctic coast. Tiny waves even managed to wrap their way into this cove. This was the starting point of the 24km hike from the Sermilik Fjord over the mountain pass to the town of Tasiilq. We made a point to swim in as many alpine lakes as we could. You couldn’t pack a more diverse terrain into 24km at that much elevation. Flowers  berries  bogs  glaciers  snow  tundra  and some of the more perfect granite I’ve seen outside Yosemite. 
@blackdiamond @auroraarktika. I can’t seem to make resolutions last. Maybe it’s because in the past I’ve had a few too many goals. So this year my wife & I tried to keep it simple. 
•Keep Bees & learn a bit more about the family tradition from my dad who’s made honey for 20+ Years
• Tell the people in our lives we love them every chance we get  especially when its challenging.. I can’t seem to make resolutions last. Maybe it’s because in the past I’ve had a few too many goals. So this year my wife & I tried to keep it simple.

• Tell the people in our lives we love them every chance we get  especially when its challenging.. 2017~2018 What a wild ride that was. 
Beyond some of the unique assignments I got to photograph  my favorite part was being able to meet so many of you through touring my film internationally  speaking  presenting & teaching. Taking photographs for me will always be super satisfying...although infinitely more fulfilling when I’m able to share it with all of you. 
.

Pic of me departing the @auroraarktika by none other than @_ryanhill_. I have a real soft spot for India's surf scene. I remember talking to Kishore for almost 4 years about returning to India for this wave. It always sounded a little to good to be true  as most remote waves do. He would always joke that it would 'NOT' be an easy trip. 
. 
The swell window is tiny & it coincides with an erratic ferry season that often gets canceled at a moments notice. It's not your typical "see a swell & book a ticket" scenario as permitting & visa access took months. It felt more like a hope & pray type of deal. Some years it just simply wouldn't line up. After spending some time with Kishore & his partner Ram you realize there's something pretty special about these guys. Their love for sharing waves & surf culture in India is beyond anything I have seen. They are the furthest thing from a "tour guide" as you could possibly get. Here @desi_surfer sits in awe on the shoulder as a perfect one rolls bye.

Short film coming soon from @prana  @benweiland   
Article in 2018 @surfersjournal
all right my name is Chris Burkard and I've been asked to shoot a little bit more of kind of how I pack and reason why I packed what I do for certain trips and I have this kind of interesting opportunity this next month I'm doing two assignments one to Greenland and then directly to India and so I'm going to take you through two parts one is going to be that the gear that we're packing the clothes equipment etc etc and then one is more of the Camry gear specifically and so keep in mind before you watch this or comment or whatever understand that this is for a commercial assignment for myself and multiple people working together to basically fulfill a client's needs is I'm not backpacking through Europe or going on a lightweight adventure this is something where I need to bring specific stuff probably more than I normally would but I'm just kind of here to share some of the knowledge I've learned of how to pack you know a lot of gear in a in a small way and how to get the really the most out of your bags and what you're using and so to start I'm gonna just take you through my my two duffles that we're gonna be checking through so myself and Ryan Hill and my assistant we're going to green them together teaching a workshop and shooting some work while we're there and we have to bring kind of a variety of different gear the bags I always travel with are these shuffles I have a 120 litre Eagle Creek duffel here and I have a 120 liter Eagle Creek duffel here this one is wheeled it has wheels in the bottom this one does not these are really lightweight super water resistant on top not waterproof the reason I have one wheeled and one not is because some I put the heavier stuff in the wheeled one the lighter stuff like clothes down below because this one usually can kind of fold into its own pocket and go from there keep in mind this video is gonna be fully nerdy and we're gonna geek out a lot on stuff so sorry if if that's not we're looking for so inside this pack I'm just gonna break everything down here what do I have first thing I'm gonna be in the water so I'm bringing wetsuit fans right wetsuit fins right here as well as our wetsuit right here this red bag what is this this red bag is basically a waterproof bag that allows me to keep the wetsuit in here in case it gets wet or nasty I don't want to put it with the rest of this stuff Plus this is a great bag to always bring these waterproof bags in case you need to coat your backpack and you're gonna cross a river or something like that so wetsuit this I have a 5 millimeter wetsuit inside here these two things in here I have a sea2summit event compression sack there's two sleeping bags and a pillow in here to 30 degrees sleeping bags in here that's basically four if I'm gonna be sleeping in a you know hostel somewhere on a boat and I want to just be in my own stuff or say for example if I'm gonna be I want to you know do a time-lapse and stay on the beach it's gonna be freezing cold I want to have this extra warmth something that I know is waterproof and I know I can just kind of throw my pack or something like that and basically take with me so this is for me and somebody else keep in mind in here I have radios okay or radios we have these for super small radios as you can notice there's no button settings it's because they're really minimal there's four of them I'm on a walkie my assistant shooting somewhere or somebody's on a kayak and they need to shoot right I need to instruct them what to do or whatever if you're on a you know on land or on both these are always great to have there's no cellular communications in a lot of the places I'm going so these are important also always carry a multi-tool if you're going on a trip it doesn't require a multi-tool then you might want to question if it's gonna be a great adventure or not we're using a gerber one right here so yeah these are great these walkie-talkies are awesome because they charge by USB so that's what we bring what else do I have I have a Patagonia dry bag okay this dry bag is awesome I've use it all over the world one of the reasons I like it is because it has a zipper a dry bag zipper so I can just throw it over my shoulder jump on a boat on a kayak would ever go to shore go wherever or I can even strap it to me in the front and pull my cameras in or out right inside of here I've actually packed something else I've packed a Solomon little day pack and this is actually a waterproof day pack there's a waterproof compartment in here that can hold here so in case you do want to go on a kayak or something like that and you know you want it ashore there's another super lightweight compressible bag right here so these are kind of two little day packs that I'm bringing with me in here tripod right this is this is the get so mountaineer ultralight tripod one of my favorites I bring two it's the season where Northern Lights are starting so I want to be able to have something I could shoot slow shutters or whatever I always pack one tripod with me in my bags of camera gear and then one tripod in my duffel checked this has just got like a little cover covers a tripod it also works for like a singular lens if I need a pack a lens individually hammock is a kamek kamek just their tiny wallaby on the boat there's a lot of places to string up a hammock so this is always something that comes with me also to your in somewhere and you don't want to sleep on the ground so it's nasty these are amazing - trekking poles between me and Ryan we just bring two trekking poles why because usually I'm only using one my other hand is free for the camera so we're just bringing the Black Diamond ultralight poles keep in mind you guys this is just a personal video that I'm sharing with you guys this is not an ad and I do shoot a lot for a lot of these brands but I'm using this gear because it's the best when I go on assignment whether I'm shooting or not I always want to take this that makes the most sense so this is the stuff that I've really found over years of expedition to be the most functional cocoon this is kind of a little secret tip years ago my wife bought me some of these because I was traveling to really hot places cocoons are basically these cool max fabrics that are like a super thin liner like a sleeping bag liner and it actually adds 10 degrees of warmth if you're gonna sleep in a sleeping bag so you can bring a lightweight sleeping bag use one of these as a liner there's two of them one for me one for Ryan to basically warm your bag up or you're somewhere hot you want to just have like a five six degree bag this thing's great it's also natural fiber so you tend to sweat less it brings sweat away from your body these are also great for bug nets they double for like multitude of purposes I always travel with these these are great really really really important these are called beastie bags these are super moisture removing bags that basically will help your camera's come to life they've gotten wet even if you're shooting on a boat you're shooting surf you have salt spray hitting you these bags at the end of the night I put my camera in there and they just absorb and suck out all of that moisture I always bring to use them from everything from a cell phone to a camera they brought my cameras back to life this is a Nemo sleeping pad super lightweight sleeping pad we just shrunk down just something just in case we we're gonna be sleeping somewhere with a hard ground we want to have protection so inside of this bag one of my ultimate hacks is I always line my duffles with a really lightweight therm arrest why because say you want to go shoot on the ground and it's wet or muddy you can lay this down and shoot on the ground you want to put your knees on something so you have a firm base a glassing pad whatever this is such a good little hack I've cut this to the shape of my sleeping bag to go inside and then one of the best parts is it these bags are really loose some nice people don't like them because they're so loose this adds structure it actually helps it just literally roll right in here so something that I like before there's one more pocket in here in the front right here and this has got a couple things in it okay let's let's check this out first thing I use a lot of these you'll notice these are like tiny Eagle Creek packet systems lightweight things in this one what do I have well I have more of these why because when your clothes get dirty and you've been on the road for 20-plus days which is what I'm doing you want something to separate your gear what else do I have I have a waterproof sack okay so I'm gonna be getting on a boat going to land something bad happens I need to protect my gear and have a waterproof this is a lightweight waterproof sack but I can just bring with me and it all kind of folds into this one little tiny pouch so it doesn't take up any space weighs virtually nothing and super super good to have for safety this is another lightweight travel tote Patagonia backpack just like it folds out to kind of this little thing right here and this is a great I always bring one of these say you're gonna go shower in someone's house you're gonna go to the climbing gym or you're gonna go do whatever I don't know on a trip who knows you just need to carry your essentials you know your your toothbrush your boardshorts a towel this is just something you can fold out I also like because I can hang it in my room under a deck or whatever and I can hold all my essentials kind of hung up right there weighs nothing this is this is kind of interesting so I always bring one of these this is there's a lot of brands this is a me Joe I just bought this on Amazon honestly I've never used it before but it's similar to a lot of other tripods where it literally will just attach to the guardrail of a boat right or to something and give you a firm really unique perspective one of the problems with tripods they don't just attach to anything so this is critical say you want to shoot the time-lapse of car or something like that you need to bring something like this so this always comes with me these are these kitaru pull-out skiff ruzek company out of Montana that makes kind of hunting gear and I use some of their stuff sometimes really good this is two things first of all I like it because they're clear so I can see what I'm looking at when I need a grab stuff quickly this is what I want this is just hand warmers bug repellent and a small adventure medical first-aid kit right super simple this other one is just a miscellaneous camera gear an extra headlamp some tape for a jacket in case it gets torn plus two really lightweight camera coverage is like plastic covers that go around your camera and cinch down as well as some rubber bands in case they need a rubber band around my camera I'm just a couple little essential items for keeping stuff dry you know the sometimes you don't only have a certain space for these things so you just kind of put them in whatever and that's sort of exactly what these these pull outs are for and I like to sort of take them together alright last thing I forgot always bring a little bit of gaff tape why in case I need to label something maybe there's a hard drive or a memory card that got you know corrupted I want to ride on this I always bring one of these and a Sharpie really important to have okay so this bag is a bit big for me usually I would bring a little smaller bag but I'm traveling with somebody my assistant Ryan so we both are packing into the same bag basically so let's just break this thing out one of the things about these they have shoulder straps they work really well and you can tighten these down or you can undo them and totally take them away well start with the front another kit root pull out what's in this mostly Clif bars and maybe some peanut butter and some electrolyte shops I'm going to India I'm also going to Greenland and there's going to be a limited supply of the food that you want so I always bring one of these again I like these cuz I can hang them up in my room or my cabin or something like that I can string a bunch of these together and have this like great accessible visible thing boom this another thing for dirty clothes right or say you want to wash something it's kind of like a wash bag or whatever you can put something in there and it basically just a sack this is my dock kit we'll notice I use these things a lot these are basically Nemo sleeping bag ties right they're meant to loop around and attach and sort of tighten something so this isn't Arc'teryx a little Dopp kit I like it because it has a little attachment here I can use this carabiner it opens up as well I have all my stuff in there so I'm not going to go through the details of that but that's that and I usually use this guy to tighten it down so just gets nice and small here bug spray always keep anything like this something that's deed in it or whatever in its own ziplock these are infamous for leaking always doesn't matter if it's perfect so that's that let's open up the main compartment now we did this one a little bit differently I'm just gonna empty everything and then kind of go through on the table so this this this these in this towel and then inside of here is another one of these plumber SP right adds rigidity as well the last compartment here is basically one more of these okay let's go through with these on now okay in the far compartment I have a lot of shared gear here this is a lot of shared stuff for being Ryan this right here is gloves I have a lot of gloves I actually have had really bad kind of loss of feeling in my hands from being in frostbite situations so I bring a lot of extra gloves and I also bring some balaclavas this is a thicker balaclava you know basically goes over here and it's pretty awesome this is something that works really well this is a this is what brand is this I'm blanking but it'll come back to me here Oh air hole air hole makes it's really good it's a thinner top thicker neck right little insect shield this is a net for mosquitoes okay let's go over a couple the gloves I'm gonna lay these things out here so you can see what we're bringing keep in mind I'm going to Greenland for a variety of activities hiking kayaking photography etc etc I don't know what the conditions are gonna be like right now it's saying rain for eight days might be snowing and most likely so I'm preparing for any situation okay now I'm bringing a variety of gloves everything from kind of a lightweight pair of ski gloves in case we're gonna be trekking through some snowy stuff going up and over if you're these are a little thicker not great for photography these are some buff gloves that basically have fingerless they're really good for photos you can usually use these inside of some of these other gloves I really like to bring glove liners thinner gloves that can kind of slide in to your thicker glove so that's that's usually how I operate another pair of just like I said not waterproof these are just fleece gloves for cold days work really really well and I always try to keep these sets together just in case I lose them these are just the heavy duty just in case gloves if you get really awesome handle more pockets I don't know the brand these are the heat company these are awesome about these like years ago and they work insane they have a big pock in the front right for hand warmer to go in here it has a zipper so literally all of your fingers can just pop out of here inside and even your thumb can pop out these are supposedly some of the best gloves for photography the pack the top piece comes back and snaps onto here so you can use the full dexterity of your hand if you get cold you just pop this thing in right works really well you just in my favorite glove these are kind of a mid weight layer right and these are made by aqua tech and I love them because they have these little openings that allow you to take out this finger and take out this finger boom and you can literally just use your gloves like this you can also put a heat warmer right in top there awesome book I also have some Gators lightweight Salomon Gators to go over my shoes okay so that's literally everything that is in this bag right here and this is the gear for me and Ryan so that in case we're in a situation where you know obviously we're bar or sharing a lot of this gear in any case we have stuff I also in bringing stuff for other people that might need it too so a little more than I normally bring so a towel right super simple this is just like a microfiber towel it's actually a towel that I made with these awesome folks and it's got a couple a photograph of mine on it we made it simply because we wanted to create something that you know could dry really easily it was made of eco-friendly materials and it's made by no maddox we sell them too I always keep anything like this with a rubber band kind of tied up just to keep it nice and tight always need a towel in case you're drying off camera gear so this stuff let's talk about these two layers a rain layer this is a black diamond shell I always roll my stuff up into the hoodie and oftentimes I'll just cinch it with the hoodie to keep it nice and tight a black diamond Shelley you always need a good rain layer 100% no matter what also doubles is a really good camera cover in case okay so that's that this is kind of a mid layer it's a it's a thick sort of wind resistant shell that could go over an insulation layer maybe it's misting it's not quite raining you don't really want the rain layer this is a great mid layer will add a lot of warmth to its also thin right I'm a big fan of layering systems another Black Diamond piece I'm not sure on the name so let's open up this this is one of these Eagle Creek packet systems super lightweight really minimal in here full nerd right I just rolled up my pants right why because I like to pack stuff tightly and simply in here is just four different pairs of pants plus or three pairs of pants plus thermals right and including the pair of pants that I'll be bringing on the trip with me like wearing on the plane so I'll take these out one cotton pair of pants right everything else is synthetic materials I always give myself one piece of cotton I'm gonna be hiking sweating trekking I don't care about you know wearing natural fibers and stuff although they're a little comfortable they might look a little better I find that this is the most effective thing so I'm bringing a pair of black prana stretches iron pants I always bring these everywhere they're what I hike in everywhere I go if you really want to get crazy about your you're kind of packed then you can basically take this thing and you can put a rubber band around it and that's one of the ways to do that anything that's next to skin is merino wool always if it's gonna be a base layer shirt if it's gonna be you know pair of underwear or whatever I always go with merino it doesn't stink helps really well holds up in great conditions so that's what I'm bringing there I've also got just one more pair of Khurana pants the Brian stretch pants Brown why black Brown because I'm gonna be getting dirty and it's nice when your stuff doesn't look thrashed at the end of the trip I'm like most of my stuff does so so there's that that goes in there okay this guy medium right packet system this one has double sided so I can separate stuff I haven't folded this stuff so keep in mind it's all kind of jumbled up here these are my shirts and upper layers okay normally they look like this so in here rubber banded rolled right my one cotton shirt black prana organic cotton why black because I'm gonna look like hell at the end of this adventure and I want something that's not gonna look like every stain of food on me this is a merino layer from my friends at a what's it called a good name is the Patagonia merino layer as well something that works really really well for these things for these situations just next to skin a little warm this is basically one of my favorite pieces of clothing I wear this I will wear this almost every single day the reality is I could probably get rid of this because this long-sleeve hooded shirt by Duckworth is one of the best pieces of merino wool they make the best merino wool hands-down I've ever worn I've worn this stuff skiing hiking everything you can imagine works flawlessly this is a long-sleeve hooded I love stuff with hoods it's one more little insulation layer it doesn't really get in the way it's it's super nice to have so again I'm also going to India so keep in mind I've got to pack these lightweight layers - this is a long-sleeve hooded shirt yes it's white or whatever and it's going to show a lot of stains this prana peace one of my absolute favorites I never leave home without this why it can stink a little bit but the truth is it's amazing for sun protection and it keeps you super cool you can unzip this thing right here and have just this big opening vented system really great for that has thumb holes as well so when you want to protect your hands or whatever wipe the sweat off your face these are awesome this is a prana piece one of my absolute favorites I bring this on every trip I go on no matter what I have to kind of really really lightweight ships from Black Diamond these are just vented shirts they have like a venting system on the side work really really well for stuff like this and for kind of performance outdoor activities that get wet they dry super easily so I have a blue and a grey shirt of that one more prana piece this is a stretchy sort of sort of a wool fabric that's really nice for when you want that heat layer say you're going to go out and do like not a really high performance activity but you're gonna be just needing that extra warmth this is just something I can throw in it's also hooded I'll probably travel with this it's a great shirt to travel in it doesn't stink at the end of the day works really well again this is probably these are all the top layers that I'll be bringing so there's that needs to be three packs let's look at the bottom layers okay I am bringing two pairs shorts that's it okay these are prana green stretchy walk shorts they work amazing in the water they dry superfast one of my favorite pieces of equipment where are these all the time now in Greenland I'm just gonna be potentially you know jumping off the boat showering whatever maybe a little bit of hiking if it gets cool out or it gets warm out probably won't at all so I'll barely use these okay this is another pair just a little bit lighter pair walk shorts which means they have pockets and whatnot so I can actually use them not just board shorts if I need to swim around in them or jump on a hot spring I'll have the opportunity to do that and those are going in here I do have some one meeting me in AI India an assistant of mine he's gonna bring a couple items I'm gonna show you at the end of this he's gonna bring with me with him another pair of board shorts that are slimmer and tighter for swimming and shooting in the ocean as well so onto the next thing this big kind of weird sack right what's in this okay we have inside of this is basically another Eagle Creek package inside this is a couple different things right I've got I just pulled these out one two three and then the rest of this is just literally underwear just Molino face layers so why do I keep this nice and loose because a lot of times I just won't be able have something simple I can just reach in to grab out of I'm willing to pack this down I can take something like this and just cinch it all the way down nice and small here what's in these okay I like to keep things separated because it's really easy to do so and it actually makes life a lot easier when you're digging through bags and a headlamp or something like that so in here I've got socks okay these are my lightweight socks I'm bringing to India okay thinner socks basically that I have for that trip you know I've got a couple of basically like super thin I really like to use two brands of socks one is features and the other one is this guy right here and I do not work with either of these companies fits why they're both made a merino wool they don't stink and they have stretchy fabric in the sock so it holds to your foot which basically allows you not to get blisters okay so really important socks are always something that's really kind of a weird personal preference right like you know do you want your feet warm you want your feet running cold not exactly sure everybody's a little different so so this one right here this is my headgear beanie black diamond beanie really simple boom and then I have a duckworth beanie which is basically just a merino wool beanie but in two of those and I have three buffs buffs are basically just these like kind of neck gaiters that go around your neck like this and you can pull them up thrown over or whatever you can also you know put them on your arm in case you're you know hiking you sweat something I love these I bring three of them why because they work great as camera cleaners right they also are awesome to shove in your bag and clean off your camera if they have a not sweaty or whatever so I bring a couple of those shove those in here with my beanies and I kind of know exactly where those are and what their purpose is so last little pack here this is my heavy weight socks for Greenland first thing compression socks I always fly in these no matter what's going on always fly in these then I've got a couple layers of thicker thicker socks right I also have a sea line waterproof sock this is a really important thing that I started use a couple years ago I'm bringing a like a lightweight boot that isn't waterproof so this is actually a really great layer to bring and use on a trip so these are basically that the socks that I'm bringing to ice on the heavy weight socks I've got a really heavy weight you know expedition pair another heavy weight expedition pair and then one of the things I realized a long time ago is I was sick of getting these waterproof boots that weren't really waterproof and they were just getting wet and heavy so I started bringing these sealskin waterproof socks basically throwing them under a normal pair of quick-drying boots and they worked amazing so I bring two pairs of these and that's kind of the setup that I use and then like I said before just compression socks are critical for when I travel they help you feel less lethargic help me sleep easier on a plane my legs don't feel restless I wear these every time I fly somewhere especially for long-haul trips so all of these things like I said they just pack into this kind of little tiny pouch here and and that's it so this is essentially the gear that myself and Ryan I left that bag a little loose so that Ryan has some space to throw in some more gear to not as the the gear we're doing for for Greenland in India and that is part one 
all right so just want to quickly move on to the travel bag section of things and how I what else I'm bringing with me occasionally we need to bring a drone or on a job or something like that or it's a place that we can fly so we try to bring one and usually I just keep it really simple I use the 3d our robotics drone and nice thing is it's already simple dialed easy to go in this background not a lot of you know repacking needs to be done the whole entire thing this basically sits right inside here and usually what I'll do is if I'm if I'm traveling with this I'll put a couple extra GoPros and even a gopro gimbal inside this because it's just nice to have it all seamless in one place you got no spot for your memory card spot from extra batteries everything else it's all about so that's kind of the its own self-contained kit which is actually really nice for me now for myself a lot of times I usually will check in one bag I can if I can try to just check into one I'm really stoked and I've used a lot of different things from North Face duffels to Big Agnes waterproof kind of packs and what I really like to do is have something that's large that I can kind of shrink down a little bit or tighten down or expand if I need to put in wet stuff or I need to put in more gear I like the ability to have a little more stuff in there so this right here is just a very very used and worn the bag that I've been traveling with I still have a flight thing on there um this is basically one of the granite gears new travel bags the coolest part about it is that it has wheels but no rigid back so if I'm running around the airport and I really don't want to put this thing on my back because it does have backpack straps which is awesome or you can use this as one shoulder strap I can just pull this up and wheel this thing around the airport right so walking with it's really nice and easy takes a lot of the weight off you've got a heavy camera bag on this is just a really nice option to have that variety but like I said before it doesn't have a big rigid back it's actually got a really really durable material that's pretty dang waterproof too so if it's raining outside and stuff like that you know I've got that protection if I need it so with this thing the beauty of it is that I can put a lot of stuff aside and I usually tend to try and pack a little bit better but I just want to break down all the stuff I've got in here I'm just going to go try and go over this really quickly now pair of waterproof boots usually I'm traveling in pair of shoes it's a lot more comfortable but yeah pair of waterproof boots these are insulated Solomons I love them to death now every job is different everywhere you pack is different everywhere you go is different any different essentials a lot of times I'll be filling this bag up even more with something else whether I'm going somewhere where I need more rain protection or whatever but this is just the essentials that come with me on almost every trip so I have another book Kinesis bag holding two walkie-talkies walkie-talkies why because most places you go it's a lot cheaper to use these and it is to use cell phone service um this little guy this is a mind shift camera bag unit that basically allows you just to go around your waist and you can just shove the camera in here it's very very lightly padded something is just really easy for if you're kind of on the go rushing going anywhere and you just are going to be backpacking and need like one little camera with you I like doing multiple ways to carry cameras because you never know I mean there's been trips from I'm on you know seven-hour kayak mission and I'm like wow I wish I would have brought in that little tiny lightweight pack also my bag a little tiny medical kit is just a waterproof basically ziplock sort of thing that has an awesome medical kit that hopefully I never have to use but it's always smart to have it being you know the more you know the less you need and ideally I like to be as prepared as I can so what else I've got trekking poles save your knees save your back these things are awesome and also just you know if anything great as a prop as well to shoot and great you know to photograph your friend you know when you're doing something or whatever the job is I've always I always need these they also work great as a little camera stabilizer too so pair of black diver trekking poles also you know you can bring baskets if you're going in the snow uniform winter use I've got a small tiny little lightweight Joby tripod so this is just great for if I'm using action cam or a GoPro or smaller camera or even my sony a6000 and then putting this on a time-lapse I'm just letting it go this thing's awesome to attach to a window or whatever so always kind of comes in handy for me um essentials usually I bring a bag of bars and energy stuff it's like three times the size I'm here I've just got handful rise bars three or four rise bars in here I like these because they last long but they're actually really fresh I've also have some energy shot blocks from Clif Bar that I love to death apparently they're not candy but I sometimes I eat them like they are and these are great little green superfoods from amazing grass now I travel in places like the Arctic and Norway and Iceland a lot so usually not putting a lot of greens in your diet so it's really nice to have something to put in there and those are something I just go through all the time amazing grass looks kind of a whole plethora of that stuff a wheatgrass product so health isn't kind of big importance to me when I'm on the road and that's what my always bring with me - this is my third goal zero solar charger now this is a larger unit this is called the triple 100 and what this guy will do is will actually charge a laptop it will charge you know full-on 12-volt it's got you know basically all the power you need and it can be recharged by solar which is great so I usually bring a tiny little panel like this with all the plugins and doctors and I would plug this thing straight in to guy I really really can't express enough how important you know being able to be self-sufficient is on the road I think that that's one of the biggest and most important things I really try to emphasize what I'm traveling is the ability to get out there and for have the means of doing that then you're stuck you know stuck relying on energy somewhere which kind of sucks this is a guy tiny little lantern from gold zero as well um I love this guy because often times I'm editing in the back of a car or I'm you know editing in a tent somewhere so you can hang up inside the tent it's also got a couple different power settings right I want to go half power or full power and it can also charge just by USB so I could plug this into this unit or I can use its own plug to charge a cell phone or something else like that so super tiny makes a massive amount of difference terms of emergencies always bringing with me a SteriPEN this is basically a water filtration device that uses UV light no I don't if you ever use a SteriPEN but you basically turn them on you spin the thing around in water it does not take out debris but it will kill 99.9% of any bacteria inside so this is crucial to have to be honest this is one of the things like drive with all the time and really no matter where I'm going whether it's a national park or wherever it takes up no space and it's you know so much smaller than the water filter system so also always trying to bring with me a little Gerber multi-tool I often break stuff on the road and having something like this where I have you know a knife some tools everything I need actually like a good pair of pliers you can really use you know I've often found it if you're not going on a trip with a multi-tool you can almost guarantee it's not going to be an adventure so that's important as well am I will sometimes bring a little camp stove this is one of the Primus ones this is some camp gas you can't actually travel with camp gas usually so if I'm traveling stateside you know I'll bring gas picks them up but usually I'm using a Primus tiny little kind of almost like a personal stove unit but this is a little bit larger one if I'm traveling with people and the nice part about this guy is that you know if you need it we got everything to cook you know all different types of gas as well as just different modes of cooking whatever we want so this is a unit that you can use for treating people which is really great so what else um right here this is another tiny little camera bag if I'm bringing my you know waterproof camera if I'm bringing you know a couple of action cams or whatever I'll just shove this in my bag this can also be something to hold a lens and these d-rings right here or basically where I put my peak design strap on and hold this camera bag right now I'd have a filter cleaning kit so this is just a visible dust little filter cleaner as well as an Arctic butterfly by the same company and these things work great use them for a long time you basically charge it and you can put on your sensor and it'll clean it off right write that in there and has a light on it too so this is actually a amazing tool for sensor dust kind of bring that everywhere I go because I'm always finding dust on my sensor I don't know about you but I am um all fits into this little tiny kit here this is an entire bag of just a Sony action cam stuff I have two two of them really small 4k action cam awesome to have throw it on this tripod over here set up for time-lapse you know if you're videoing yourself you can put on your camera you can do so many different things with it and they just they are really really good at getting beat up and surviving so in here I've got a couple different mounts beauty of this is all fits in a kind of a small little bag and you need it's there it's not it's no big deal but I always find that the trips I don't bring it on that's what I needed the most in here I have a Nemo two-person tent this is one my favorite tents it's called the dagger 2 and it's not even packed down right now back down in something really really small um just to show you it basically opens from both sides you have dual vestibules which is really clutch if you have camera here so you're not all your gears not stuck against one side that has a closed side and there's tons of debris and precipitation getting on it he also opens space you know for two people it's pretty it's pretty large but it packs down to less than four pounds so it's like three points to something stakes as well in here for that tent in here sleeping bag as well as a sleeping pad this units this thing's not even packed down all the way it can actually shrink down even further so this is something that I'm always bringing with me it doesn't you know it's funny too because oftentimes you know the trips are I'm not camping or when I'm using my sleeping bag a ton as well you know if I'm in somewhere where they have seen my accommodations I'm trying to save some money I'll bring a sleeping bag and they don't charge you so much because they don't do their sheets right so that's really helpful and then kind of last two things just my clothing bag which is all shoving to here and this is rad because this little guy is a granite gear ultra light ultra light little packable pack but it's also completely waterproof so what I'll do sometimes if I'm doing a little kayaking mission and I need to shove some gear into there I mean this whole thing can be can go really really small as well and this is kind of what I'm brings just jackets clothes extra stuff I usually try to take on the plane with me a variation of everything I need like a jacket you know pair of shoes I can use in case all my stuff gets lost then checking I like to make sure that I've got enough stuff that I can use and last but not least this little guy is my foam roller which is another little massage tool to save your back and save your muscles when you get to where you're going if you've been carrying a camera bag around all day this guy comes in handy that gets made by TP therapy and the beauty is you can always put your email poles like through it or your tent through it it takes up like a literally no space so like I said all this stuff sitting inside here plus I've got plenty of extra space as well so that is kind of the essential for what I'm usually bringing with me on a trip if you have any questions hit me up in the comments and I'll try to do my best to get back to you guys as well as get any brand names that you guys wanted to know so thanks 
the Aleutian Islands it's called the cradle of storms I mean for good reason - because this is where the biggest most powerful systems in the world originate although Deadliest Catch evie shows that are stealing it kind of makes sense we are in the middle of the ocean and it's absolutely freezing if something happens there's nothing they can do out here there's no medic there's no doctor there's nothing this to me has been the biggest surf adventure of my life not being able to depend on anything other than putting your shoes on going out the door and exploring I'm just looking at my and this this is why I'm addicted to surfing and this is why I'm addicted to traveling showed up to this rifling right slap it was absolutely pumping there was just draining barrels spitting barrels it was one of the craziest things I've seen Wow sir from empty ways with two good friends looking around and the only people are you sharing it with her the reindeer the wild horses and the cows on the beach on the bald eagles flying overhead oh yeah man there's a snow-covered volcano in the distance this trip surpassed anything I've ever seen in Alaska by far that really just happened I know we were hoping for good ways but I don't think anybody thought that was gonna happen how do we pull this one off yeah and this is one for the memory books and I think for surfing history something that will stand out for a long time for sure 
I think that we say a lot about who we are through our work I'm just trying to understand how to get back to being patient it's kind of hard it's a it's a trick you almost have to trick yourself into thinking I've only got ten more shots make them count it's such a personal thing take your pictures it really is it's it's an incredibly personal craft it's something that is hard to share sometimes but if you aren't sharing your work what are you doing you know to be inspired in your work it's probably the most important thing to be surrounded by people and places that make you want to work creatively and do your best it's really the essence of like what everybody's searching for and their jobs and their careers so much can be said for where you're sitting on your deathbed and you're thinking man I wish I would have shot more contest photos you know it's like I know that that's the last thing I'm gonna be thinking but you know what I will be recollecting is every moment I sat in nature and just enjoyed every moment of it and soaked it in and maybe took a photo and had that memory just to share with my family or hang on my wall somewhere something that mean something you 
so if I told you that this was the face of pure joy would you call me crazy I wouldn't blame you because every time I look at this Arctic self the ice shiver just a little bit I want to tell you a little bit about this photograph I was swimming around in the Lofoten Islands in Norway just inside the Arctic Circle and the water was hovering right at freezing the air a brisk negative 10 with wind chill and I could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands feet and face and rush to protect my vital organs it was the coldest I've ever been but even with swollen lips sunken eyes and cheeks flushed red I found that this place right here is somewhere I can find great joy now when it comes to pain psychologist Brock Bastian probably said it best when he wrote pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness it makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment it brutally draws us in to a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation if shivering is a form of meditation then I would consider myself a monk now before we get into the why would anyone ever want to surf in freezing cold water I would love to give you a little perspective on what a day in my life can look like yeah I know we were hoping for good ways but I don't think anybody thought that was gonna happen I can't stop shaking I so cold so surf photographer right I don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest my parents definitely didn't think so when I told them at 19 I was quitting my job to pursue this dream career blue skies warm tropical beaches in a tan that lasts all year long I mean to me this was it life could not get any better sweating it out shooting surfers and these exotic tourist destinations but there was just this one problem you see the more time I spent traveling to these exotic locations the less gratifying it seemed to be I set out seeking adventure what I was finding was only routine it was things like Wi-Fi TV fine dining in a constant cellular connection that to me were all the trappings of places heavily touristed in and out of the water and it didn't take long for me to start feeling suffocated I began craving wild open spaces and so I set out to find the places others had written off as too cold too remote and too dangerous to surf and that challenge intrigued me I began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane because if there's one thing I've realized it's that any career even one is seemingly glamorous as surf photography has the danger of becoming monotonous so in my search to break up this monotony I realized something there's only about a third of the Earth's oceans that are warm and it's really just that thin band around the equator so if I was going to find perfect ways it was probably going to happen somewhere cold where the Seas are notoriously rough and that's exactly where I began to look and it was my first trip to Iceland that I felt like I found exactly what I was looking for I was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape but most importantly I couldn't believe Eve we were finding perfect waves in such a remote and rugged part of the world at one point we got to the beach only to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline they created this barrier between us and the surf and we had to weave through this thing like a maze just to get out into the lineup and once we got there we were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves it was an incredible experience one I'll never forget because amidst those harsh conditions I felt like I stumbled onto one of the last quiet places somewhere that I found a clarity in a connection with the world I knew I would never find on a crowded beach I was hooked I was hooked cold water was constantly on my mind and from that point on my career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments it took me to places like Russia Norway Alaska Iceland Chile the Faroe Islands and a lot of places in between and one of my favorite things about these places was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there hours days weeks spent on Google Earth trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to and once we got there the vehicles were just as creative snowmobiles six wheels Soviet troop carriers and a couple of super sketchy helicopter flights I helicopters really scare me by the way there was this one particularly bumpy boat ride of the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot where we ended up watching helplessly from the water as bears ravaged our campsite they walked off with our food and bits of our tent clearly letting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain and if this was their spot not ours but to me that trip was a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches now it wasn't until I traveled to Norway that I really learned to appreciate the cold so this is the place where some of the largest most violent storms in the world send huge waves smashing into the coastline we were in this tiny remote fjord just inside the Arctic Circle it had a greater population of sheep than people so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found I was in the water taking pictures of surfers and it started to snow and then the temperature began to drop and I told myself there's not a chance you're getting out of the water you traveled all this way this is exactly what you've been waiting for freezing cold conditions with perfect waves and although I couldn't even feel my finger to push the trigger I knew I wasn't getting out and so I just did whatever I could I shook it off whatever but that was the point that I felt this wind gushed to the valley and hit me and what started as this light snowfall quickly became a full-on blizzard and I started to lose perception of where I was I didn't know if I was drifting out to sea or towards Shore and all I can really make out was faint sound of seagulls and crashing waves now I knew this place had a reputation for sinking ships and grounding planes while I was out there floating I started to get a little bit nervous actually I was totally freaking out and I and I was borderline hypothermic my friends eventually had to help me out of the water and I don't know if it was delirium setting in or what but they told me later I had a smile on my face the entire time now it was this trip and probably that exact experience where I really began to feel like every photograph was precious because all of a sudden in that moment it was something I was forced to earn and I realized all this shivering had actually taught me something in life there are no shortcuts to joy anything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer just a little bit and that tiny bit of suffering that I did for my photography he added the value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me than just trying to fill the pages of magazines see I gave a piece of myself in these places and what I walked away with was a sense of fulfillment I had always been searching for so I look back at this photograph it's easy to see frozen fingers and cold wetsuits and even the struggle that it took just to get there but most of all what I see is just joy thank you so much my wings with the buddies feel my kids now say 
my name is Chris Burkard I'm a child of Tiger and she lost surfing as well as adventure sports and I was taking all the world and I get a lot of questions on what I take in what I bring and I found a couple items that I take around the world pretty much worth their weight in gold so I want to share basically my packing list with you and kind of what I found to be the most useful in drama bro first things first I try to travel light and I try to use one checking bag if I can pretty much trust a lot of my equipment to just one bag which is crucial and I've been through logging when I found it which the best is the a Big Agnes Steve what role Ernest it's basically a 80 litre duffel bag has backpack straps roller wheels it's great for when you're in a rainy Airport somewhere in Norway or Iceland and it's just handling and so you know the contents are gonna get wet aside it's not submergible but it pretty much does the trick first things first there came this is some I've taken everywhere with me because after you know 15 20 hours of travel you know your back is shot and having a little some day to you know get off the kinks and everything really makes a huge difference so that is one piece of criminal ponytail a lot of my work is based on the ocean and shooting the water shooting surfing so bringing a wetsuit is crucial this is my five mil suit and when I travel to location I like to I like to make sure this one is is open and dry and so none of the seams are getting bent or stretched or the thing and it's just basically preparing your suit to last night honor that as well as them as well as you know washing up clean water is crucial this suit I have here is a five note I also use five mm gloves and 5mil booties sometimes seven build and hold water ease but this triple packing for right now is actually Norway so this is a Bible suit and pretty much everything I need to say warm water so this thing is worth its weight in gold kind of smoothie front smoothie back which really helps you wind chill as well super crucial Idol um fins those one item that I really value is a little gold zero lantern which basically it's awesome recharge their cell phone actually the front it's all rechargeable via USB which isn't stuck right there or an emergency you can also crank it up and have an emergency light as well I can't tell you how many times I've been you know packing outside late at night on raining have a big source of light is really crucial be able to camp anywhere at any at I basically last minutes notice is really crucial me I it seems excessive sometimes but I didn't bring a lightweight camping kit with me at all times I just stuffed this a little even basically dry bag and so the bad guy the sleeping bag device debris everywhere is my Z packs 10 degree water treated down bag and it's a a ultralight backpacking sleeping bag lay up down the reason I love is because if there's no foot so it's great for if you're like you know hospital somewhere sleeping in the car I'm usually where jackin anyway so that provides my hood my head warmth and this thing is just is it's worth its weight in gold will basically ultra compressible ultra light under two pounds ten degrees I can pretty much go anywhere and pack down to the size of a Nalgene and so this is just something I throw the bag it's also great for you know extra padding and like soaring around and you need things also also with my ultralight kit is a new air sitting paddle can't say how many times I'm out shooting order lights or shooting something just freezing cold although as your padding so I'm not sitting on frozen snow or something that makes all the difference right there in this pack and I also have my um Big Agnes if you like Fly Creek platinum ul1 which is a sub 2 pound tent that is worth its weight in gold once again this thing all packs down to super super fit waterproof three season tent something I've used everywhere and I pretty much you know I'm using snow rain you know desert heat you name it it's a tent that kind of always goes with me everywhere um moving on dot kit just essentials in here and I think of anything crucial except for some good lotion your skin gets dry and cracked this is my clothing bag pretty much everything I need for a more from five days to two weeks on the road I really dig this thing because it's a Patagonia ultra light ultra light duffel packs all the way down into its own pocket but it basically has everything need for you know for traveling on the road and can fit a large amount of stuff socks you know beanies Oh more stuff under layers I'm not going to go through all my stuff here but there's one piece of clothing that I love for cold weather and that's just like a killer mountaineering cognitive where the having a knife blade pass a lot of times when I'm when I'm out you know running around through the snow and pretty much everything but you know a full on you know submerge down or these things you keep you super dry they were traveling or without board shorts I'm a big fan of merino wool the layering systems that you know are just basically meant for next to skin comfort as well as breathability so merino is something that I travel with everywhere mainly because you know when you're going somewhere for two weeks no laundry this stuff will basically hold your order like nothing else so that's super value in as well also in this thing it's kind of like never-ending I have my endure a tripod ultra lightweight with a really right stuff head this is just you know my standard all this tripod I can hold everything for my big lens heavy kit to something super small to and it's like back to a background of the heat right there bring ultra hot towel as well this is something that I always travel with getting you know having wet wet suit wet water house and be able to grab something in this super compressible absorbs a lot for really great to have a really small Jovi tripod you never know when you're going to need something like this the other one gets you know stolen lost whatever it's great to hold back up these are great you know ground level can wrap around something cool for long exposures if you just go on super ultra light goes here a solar panel I have my charging units in my other bag if we get to in a second but this guy is great you just you know charge everything by the Sun going straight into there as well as can we charge double-a triple-a batteries these little larvae unit so that's inside my bedroom this is pretty much you know everywhere with me it's a it's durable lasts a long time I think the key is since it has needles it really allows the material to last longer because you're not dragging across the airport floor and when it comes to you know waterproofing this is something that is crucial because all these seniors get thrashing on you know all right let's move on to the carry-on equipment that I bring with me when I travel I usually try to try to bring as much as I can on a plane obviously of you're dealing camera gear sometimes you can but this is why I found what's the best this is the f-stop lightroom roller it's a awesome lightweight packable kind of multi-day bag also fit in here perfectly their ICU units which is like their internal camera units I usually have to set the ones one two three four water housings will be from extra cameras first things first a little ditty bag inside here just extra head map little Phoenix one Center cleaners batteries long exposure just extras you know whatever whatever I need to walkie talkies waterproof totally lifesavers for a trip because basically anytime you have opportunity to you know save on you know texting using your phone these things are gonna make a world of difference of your lost or in different country always bring extra batteries to right here I have a NEX water housing and inside of it is a Sony NEX this little guy is just a lightweight kind of cheaper water housing that has amazing results and I tend to use of all the world love this thing it's great for like long lines 50-millimeter has every button gets but you can imagine and it's really awesome use I love this little kit made by some Asian company I'm not sure who the blower kit another water housing this is just a PW a green bag supply seen these before they're they're basically as you know simple as they get just like little plastic bags the clamp top these are great for when you just want to get something unique perspective you know maybe we shoot from waterfall and you want to get halfway in the river or kind of shoot some pool or for me I use a salat when I am shooting surfing from shooting little empty waves and I'm just standing out in the shore break I mean seems actually look really really good so again just trying to pack as light as I can in here I would also have a sony a 77 DSLR but it's being used to a cordless so this is a backup lens you know backup telephoto lens 70 to 300 G series Sony lens love this thing works really really well really light small shot a lot of photos with this for magazines this is a little Sony or Nikon aw1 this is a fully waterproof fully dustproof shockproof little basically mirrorless camera that at first I thought was a gimmick but after trying it out the files are incredible and I've been really impressed by how fast the autofocus is shoots 15 frames a second things awesome show a lot surfing with this empty waves it's great to have some when the weather turns absolute crap you just have this out you know shooting in full downpour and still get some great moments so this thing is great I would recommend you know having something like that with you chargers another lens for the sony a 10 millimeter will say fisheye power we're always good to have the car a lot of times i'm spending so much time in the car that be able to drive and be a little charged while driving is crucial chargers another lens 10 to 18 millimeter for my sony NEX and here I also got extra headland just some basically water housing materials this is basically one of my favorite pieces of equipment I bring this is SteriPEN and it's a UV filter for water and I've used this in India and you know backpack near 70 it's basically one of the lightest weight you know water filtering systems you can have it filters where you oughta be like not really made for you know debris or anything like that in the water but this thing is awesome the green love having it with me it's a it's a super super worldwide on there like under 100 bucks reading material and that's about one of the one of the coolest things about this bag is that you know a lot of times you'll be you know going the small commuter flight and all of a sudden they're like hey you can't bring this size carry-on and all the sudden you have to check it so being able to pull out and I see you will just be able to grab bring it with you is a huge advantage so that to me makes this bag grab because I can pop it out and put it in my backpack or I can show her anything their Airport compatible it's a really great bag down the road okay so my very last bag and this is basically the pack that travels with me everywhere this is my workhorse this is the f-stop mountain series to lobha and this is basically their lightest weight that they make in the mountain series they actually just made a ultralight version of this but for this trip since I'm dealing a little more weather and harsh conditions all the other series so first things first I can only travel with knives or multi-tools on the flight I like to be able to have them on my pack as soon as I land so basically these guys are two pieces of equipment made by Gerber I bring these pretty much everywhere I go just having a good knife on you and a good multi-tool that kind of does everything it's great to have always a lot to make sure that a piece of equipment that has like a screwdriver so I can work on tripods or cannons whatever second piece of Awesome gear that goes my back is my hard drive usually I was traveling with this once I get to locational put this by my computer but this is made by Western Digital just to my passport but it's a inside of basically a small Pelican case it's bar sealed shockproof air tight you know basically anything happens this thing is going to protect it which is pretty awesome Alec little dedicated case for your hard drive and when I go on trips I usually bring a copy of all my you know best court flow of images with me just in case something happens always really have a minor's on your body that's why I made sure it's a backup right there in my pack you'll always find some Clif Bar like the wet or something like that these are always going to be good great shown to a wetsuit too if you're going to be swimming for a long time doing something like that summer hair flavors I'll bring a bunch more less on my big back to brown this pack see top leg another headlamp just just a video that always bring with me as well memory cards are always going to stay up in here in this top pouch there's a nice clip here so I usually clip this into here just so they don't get this place to fall out for any reason I prefer SD cards simply because the waterproof and there you know shockproof and they're just a little more resilient there's no you know open prongs or anywhere like you're linking inside I've got a lot of CF cards get moving because of that just because we're traveling my conditions are super ringing kind of little sorry so basically when I when I'm on the flight and I like to have a little digging bag that I can space apply my pack and shut down my feet and this is that the beauty of this little pack is actually a full choc back glory and I love this thing because when I'm on location and I just want to going around town or shooting at the beach or somewhere like that I'm not shooting actually this is a great camera bag for my small ASA in this bag you just have some good reading material ever an a/v book a little white dog if they're playing like just with you know sleeping stuff and you know chopstick and all that things you extra pair of sunglasses earphones or headphones I mask basically kind of all that stuff you need just for flight including a little cellphone charger port one my goal zero it's a cold switch and this thing's nice and light compress way way down there's nothing in it which is nice so like I said I try to make sure that I always have everything on my back that I need for the trip and so essentially this bag everything else got lost this bag helped me to get and shoot ever I need first time I really hate loose cable so it's nice to have a small lightweight ones these are paid by skosh this is a iPhone 5 charger lightning bolt as well as micro USB so most of my headlamps and my charters all charged with my curiosity and my camera so having this awesome I don't have a bunch of loose cable on here I just have you know those the countries this is a possible best way of multi charger for depressed batteries laptop extra batteries MacBook Air this is all just a ruddy key item library a lightweight range shell is awesome because I found how to dedicated you know camera or a backpack powder water that I cover in a camera cover and also it's great but you know I like something that can multiply for bunch of different uses and this is great because it can cover over a camera they can go over my backpack and cinch down I can wherever get wet you know or any more protection and I find that this is your something it's lightweight how about anyone can pack in the bottom like that and it's always there wasn't all f-stop products which is cool okay they all make sure yeah they're all ICU compatible and the ICS basis was this internal camera unit right here and so for this pack one thing that's great about these two is they have extra padding that while you're chopping you can use and though you're done traveling you take that out and just have a super lightweight stuffable on right here so this is basically the travels with me everywhere especially I was shooting you know action assignments or D the length this is a Sony $8.99 as well as need 70 to 400 and the camera on the lens is just for precipitation I'm going to wet climates I like to use something that can absorb some of the salt water so the sea breeze it's not just for looks the $8.99 is a great camera saw a lot of editorial assignments covers with it it's rad because six frames a second it's one of the lightest you know DSLRs on the market or it was before the a7 and a it can shoot also a crop mode so if we want an extra you know a burst of a print a second you can put it in crop and you can shoot a faster frame rate this lens and this cameras just yields incredibly sharp results I've been in here somebody along this thing is I'm this pretty much that you know as good as it gets for kind of traveling and being able to shoot on location so this is pretty much my everyday go-to camera for everything else this is my a seven and on here I've got 24 seventies ice lens I love this camera super light always have a tripod adapter on it cuz I'll show you a long exposure is like shooting waterfalls and Northern Lights or whatever it is this is my go to the sets are on this thing is incredible why I step up from here quality's unreal and I've actually got a lot of you know action with it all the focuses is pretty great too in here is keep electronics cleaner a lot of times would be you know see my sharing stuff and I just want to go clean that out rag for a little you know cameras off a 50 millimeter f-18 Zeiss this is great because you wouldn't want to shoot portraits like I said I try to keep everything on me I need for the trip so I've got my all-around lens I got my action lens and I've got this nice you know epic portrait lens too so that kit can cover kind of anything I need if in fact everything else gets lost and then a bunch of extra batteries so lastly I always carry this little kind of side pouch in my pack which is great to your brunch gear for you PACA lasting more news take it off and grab out something easy like a cell phone charger so in here basically is another grab little scotia item which is a wall mount charger as well as a as well as a cigarette adapter charger you can just pull out pops into itself with that I have a iPhone 5 charger it also has a micro USB so this pretty much charges 90% of the items that I'm bringing with me this thing will charge it I've gotten here a so lastly in here is just another little lens cleaning cloth I'm just always kind of have a bunch of these all over your bag it's great when you need them and reach in your pocket we're just there and then I usually have a little set of polo clips and these are just like awesome little portable camera lens clips that you can use on your iPhone there's you know wide-angle adapters just telephotos there's macro doctors or these are awesome to use I love using these things and I'll travel with them and shoot stuff out of the airplane and the cool thing is that nowadays you have lost your scenic stuff your eyes are kind of works pretty awesome so there it is that's basically everyday go to the travel kit right here thanks for sitting with us through this and if you have any questions feel free to so you know write in the comments below the video and I'll turn it back to you as best I can with the gear I'm using and like I said I think that you know for me a big part of traveling is keeping it light all this doesn't seem light it feels pretty light to me so thanks again a chance you're getting out of the water you traveled all this way this is exactly what you've been waiting for freezing cold conditions with perfect waves and although I couldn't even feel my finger to push the trigger I knew 
I'd trade white sand beaches for icebergs any day you're never going to be crowded on the beach in Iceland the frozen fingers and cold lips and your chest is heavy from just your breath its adverse but it's so worth it I started my career you know as as a landscape photographer that's all I ever cared about I think that there's a simple beauty that comes to being able to have a tool that allows you to capture something as vividly and as as graphically as you remember it and for so much of my life as a photographer I've been searching for that tool I think these places remain empty because they just they just don't know what's out there you know there's there's a willingness to want to go farther go deeper explore more and that's what drives me as a photographer that's what's always driven me to want to see what's around that next bend it's what really drives you know the human soul to want to document and create and discover I always wanted the opportunity to be able to shoot a picture of these Northern Lights and the best quality that is available today and bringing the phase one here that was kind of what I set out to do there's really few cameras nowadays they can really do justice to these dramatic rich landscapes that you find and being able to get my hands on a phase one was like a dream come true the ocean for years has been considered by a lot of the locals in these places such a dangerous scary place and the easy you know these professionals working in such an amazing way 
[Music] we're sitting there at the beach all of a sudden this idea kind of dawned on us like what if this is possible if the stars align and we got lucky this could actually come to life this is it this is it right here if they get a wave but I don't think we have any idea what we were about to get ourselves into [Music] I mean the whole idea in the beginning it was just this sort of trip with friends we wanted to go out and explore this area that we had been researching really for I think like two to three years I was on the phone really trying to gather up any willing soul who would come with us my assistant Russ and then we talked to Ben Weiland and then we were calling the guys you know one after another trying to kind of hide the fact that this might actually be pretty dangerous I basically just took two red eyes to get here it was pretty cold from the from oh I hate it here so just was in Florida and I was in New Jersey there's a blizzard like I want to go but I don't want to go [Music] [Laughter] already I mean who wouldn't be excited to join Chris on an attorney to Iceland but at the same time I had a lot of doubt that we could actually pull off some of the shots that he was talking about in that kind of environment you're fighting a lot of limitations of not only your body but the gear and everything involved there was some death contemplation there hey if I just dive down off this rock face he'll all be over I don't know how this is gonna work out I'm gonna hang over the edge here and try to get a shot of the ice cracking day one not good yeah broke a few things Taylor my wife who both of us have been all kinds of big mountain Himalayan adventures but this was something a little bit different we were packing our bags the night before throwing in our heaviest weight puffy jackets being pretty confused about exactly what we were getting into I was going to press record on the camera and when I was bending down my puffy jacket hit the obscure series of commands that you have to do to power up this drone it powered up and started to take off so I batted it down it was pretty much emergency mode after that after the stitches after the hospital I think it definitely made me question if I should go home I don't know what that is I basically didn't want to be the link that made the film not as powerful as it could be I made the decision to stay from the very beginning the project we kind of built the whole thing around the fact that we were gonna be there with 18 hours of darkness a day and being there in the middle of winter there was really only one camera we can use to shoot in this low of light so when I traveled Iceland I brought with us maybe four to five a7s2 s the a7s2 was our was our go-to is our workhorse even of the most heinous of conditions this thing performed whether there was snow encrusted on the front of it or salt spray hitting it or at the beach and it's negative-20 like my finger I couldn't even press the butter plaster over the camera I was just well you would try to go to the beach and I think we just realized how absolutely unprepared we work the wind off the ocean is like you're just unprepared for it's freezing when we were sitting on captain city's boat and he told us that this storm was coming and we had the base to turn around the worst thing you could do as a freelance photographer freelance directors to come back empty-handed so we were kind of driven by this idea that we wanted to salvage this trip for everybody involved and so we left against his orders and we basically drove through the West shores and it ended up being the largest storm in 25 years and as everything kind of evolved now someone descended upon us it was like call it quits and go home or stay and see what else this place has to offer it just starting to see some flickers of the Northern Lights so we're hoping maybe if we can motivate the guys that they'll get out there and surf I suppose life come out so hard to sleep when you know what could happen you couldn't design a more challenging shot take surfing you have to deal with the wind as well the tide the athlete and then you as a part of Rio are you ready for really anything and that all of a sudden you taking Northern Lights this incredible celestial event that really it only happens on the coldest and clearest the night it's rare to see them low on the horizon or over the ocean all at three o'clock in the morning when it's pitch dark normally you call it a night but when you have cameras that can shoot at 10,000 ISO you have to keep going because you're forced to keep up with the technology this is probably like that for their visit in a row we've been out trying to get this you good to go like this rounding up the guys and trying to convince them to get a wet suit on and go out under some of the most brutal conditions you ever Maggie and the guys are out there freezing their asses off so your head goes numb and the winds hitting you in the back you could feel your wetsuit just freeze to your body I think this is what I feel yeah crystallized here but it was cold you have ice it's all ice dude it's so happy I know this is the fourth night without here trying to get something a little frustrated the cruise hire the surfers are tired we're all cold as hell but hopefully we get it when we were adjusting the settings in the camera moving between ISO 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 I can't even see them with my naked eye the only way I can see them is by looking through this camera a lot of times trying to adjust our shutter speed you know 15th of a second twenty-fourth of a second so a big key to this was matching the right lens the right camera and my favorite combination was essentially the 35 one for that lens kind of enabled me to capture really the landscape around plus the Northern Lights and the wave we found that the most optimal scenario was going out right when the moon would rise over the hill and it would just send this big beam of light down on the water and basically we're using the a7s2 which with time lapse out built inside to do all of our time lapses we're leaving cameras out like all ours tonight this tripod gets the Northern Lights we're attaching this a7s2 on to the drone and having to tape over a lot of the lights emitting from the drones so that they wouldn't reflect into the surface of the water [Music] dude this is it this is it right here they get a wave he's going when I look back in my career over the years the highlights like the most exciting times when you're like right on the brink of failure we're using this light on the beach to illuminate the back of the wave and the Northern Lights are doing the rest [Music] and I think it just became that much more real for everybody when we knew that so much effort kind of went into making something like this every time I see them I look and we know we have that experience that like that was something that happened we all witnessed it and it's so much more surreal to be able to share with people all over the world now even if they weren't there it's like something you dream about you know but you never think is possible I can't believe that just happened I'm like looking at the photos and it feels fake I don't honestly I don't even know if it's real that's a really an inspiring thing to see people go beyond what they thought was possible for themselves and makes me want to push harder and do more and I think that's part of what made this project a success [Music] you know all of us had hoped that this film would in some way inspire people to seek outside of the safety routine where's the fun in just having something guaranteed all that work you put in the money of time you definitely have something to remember you know it's why we do this why we put up with this struggle in the pain when you find yourself in those moments it's like there's no place you'd rather be really it's about embracing uncertainty when you embrace a moment you know that there's a high chance of failure then that's that's really a space that you've grown at the end of the day I guess you look at the photos you got and the experience he had and it's there's nothing else in the world that I'd rather be doing [Music] Oh [Music] you [Music] 
I grew up in the small town of Pismo Beach it's a coastal community in central California that's probably more known for its clam chowder than its perfect waves but for me it's just always been home I feel really grateful to be inspired and where I live there's so much to be said for being excited to come home and produce imagery close to your home close to your family close to your friends there's really something special about that we as a photographer we're always seeking that moment of peak action but to me the images that mean the most are the ones that find the true emotion as well those the photographs that the viewer get where they relate to we the ocean is a special place for me like it's given me so much and honestly I feel like I owe my career to it I feel like I owe some of my greatest experiences in my life and some of the greatest lessons I've ever learned but it is an unforgiving teacher and as soon as you step into the ocean with the camera you realize how small you are you realize how insignificant the power that you really have is it's not even about harnessing the energy it's just about learning to go with the flow and if there's ever a teacher for patience it's the ocean I love to shoot surfing because it presents such unique challenges for a photographer you're always dealing with ever-changing conditions wind swell tide and always the athlete for me these types of challenges are I feel what make me grow and make me stronger there's never some controlled environment that you can just go to and on your skill as you're always in the wild and there's always an element of surprise something always goes your honor or some reason you know it makes you appreciate those days when everything comes together perfectly because when the perfect moment comes together it's truly beautiful it's been said home is where the heart is for me that couldn't be any more truth I feel just as excited when my plane touches down and I get home to central California as I do and I get all the way across the world in some remote destination I know that there's just as good of images to be taken right in my backyard as it is halfway across the world now honestly it inspires me to know that there's new things to see these things to photograph it makes me appreciate living in such a place that has endless possibilities 
hey everybody this is Chris Burkard and I'm here today to do a gear review I'm really just going to go over some of the essentials that I take with me on my trips I did one about a year ago and that was really focused on a cold water surf trip and packing wetsuits and fins and all kind of the essentials and this gear review is a little more packed for kind of going into the mountains maybe going traveling super light and just kind of any normal photographic assignment that I would go on now this is going to be really techie so anyone who's not into all the essentials in the year bear with me first things first never travel without a solid neck pillow this thing is basically save my life on a lot of different trips I can't I can't express enough how much of a bummer it is to get somewhere and just feel like the plane totally wrecked you so this is basically the first line of defense I have in terms of being prepared when I'm when I get to my location know these are my two essentials I always bring on the plane with me everything I need to shoot the job or whatever the assignment is nothing comes with me that I don't need for that so camera essentials laptop stuff to back everything up it's all with me right here I usually try to only take with me what I can carry meaning like I don't want to have to bring some of the extra to carry bags or anything like that and obviously some instances you can't really help that but try to avoid it as best you can so when you're dealing with late connections you're dealing with getting your locations it really helps now a little preface here what I have right here is I have two bags and what you'll notice is neither of them are actually camera bags this is a mountain Smith daylight lumbar pack and it is outfitted to use with a camera but it's not a dedicated camera backpack this is a black diamond is the black Tyminski pack and it's like a 40 liter pack and as you can tell it's also not a camera bag and one of the reasons I do that is because I don't want to scream that I'm photographer it helps to make the experience more rich I feel like it also doesn't give you a big you know hello I'm photographer signed to people who might want to steal your stuff or whatever so this is a ski backpack extremely waterproof materials on the outside extremely rugged I've always found that anytime I use a backpack that has a back opening like a camera bag it tends to compromise the pack ability and the way that the harness system works so for me I want to have something that I could haul up the mountain I can go wherever I'm going so I tend to find that by using a backpack that's dedicated for that use really helps me along the way then using some kind of camera bag that sort of meant to go into those situations so like I said this is a Black Diamond revelation 40 and I'm going to break down the way that I use this thing and but first let's get to this guy so this is the bag that I shoot with every single day day in day out this is my camera bag I will usually have a backpack on me but this is this is kind of what I end up packing my cameras in but when i travel to the location I'm going to this bag doubles as a pack that I use for my essentials for the plane books sunglasses things like that my cards my passport all those things usually sits inside here so first thing laptop I've got a MacBook Air really lightweight really small this thing is really just used for two things backing up images and browsing the internet or booking flights or whatever in addition to that iPhone 6s this is kind of the two essentials I feel like and you know what I find is that nowadays no phones are so powerful that I'm probably using this more than anything to post images when I'm on the road if my job I'm doing is actually for social media or sharing content so those are kind of the two you know computer devices I'm bringing with them in this bag on the plane I'll also have just an essential kit full of all of my cables things like that everything from you know inverters European inverters something like that to iPhone or sorry to laptop charging cable I've got a a skosh kind of two-in-one wall charger as well as a little car charger there I try to pack everything super light and go minimal so I'll have things like this where it's a it's a USB charger to three different you know microUSB lightning bolt and the older Apple charger as well as some small Lightning USB so if I need to charge my phone I don't have this big long cable coming out it's something I can put in my jacket pocket or something I've got you know a couple different awesome little essentials in here one of them being this little charge card it's made by a company called Nomad I think and it basically is just a lightning pin iPhone charger but it's really thin and actually can fit in your wallet so you always have one with you second one of my favorite things is these are these Bose headphones that are noise cancelling and you'll see this little deal on here right here and basically you turn this on and it just cuts all noise so when I I don't know about you but I'm a terrible sleeper on planes so this is extremely helpful for traveling and going places where I just need to sleep need to zone out your editing or something like that always bringing an auxiliary cable I mean these things are essential just for basically being in a car stuck with one CD that thing will really help out also micro USB a couple different USB wall chargers now these are really crucial I'll get to why later but I'm using mirrorless cameras small Sony mirrorless cameras and these chargers actually can charge the camera so the beauty of that is that you can a smaller capacity batteries like lithium ions that are used for mirrorless cameras you can actually charge through the camera through a USB port so this is all I need in addition to my you know battery charger as well but this is just an emergency backup and the great part about this is I can charge my cameras on the go with this system and bigger cameras they can't do that so that's that's one of the perks now I also bring these little guys you can is on Amazon not sure if you can see him these are little tiny just lightning pin adapters for iPhone so if I'm in a bind I need a you know charge up my phone or download some images I can stick this guy onto one of these and it doubles so rather than bringing a bunch of iPhone cables and a bunch of you know USB I've got kind of both from one um that's that little kit there Ursa Major little wipe for planes whatever it is you're sweaty you're on the plane you got to go to a meeting who knows these things are amazing and they're pretty much game-changing I like shove these into every packet and orifice of you know places I travel my bags what else I have this little bag sunglasses Northern Lights sunglasses I spend a lot of time in in cold freezing conditions and your eyes take a huge beating when you're staring at water all day when you're staring into the snow so I actually helped develop these glasses with Northern Lights and they just have some sun shades on the side and you feel super cool so this is why I wear these guys usually I'll bring like a backup pair of sunglasses if I'm going to be thrashing them or like in kayaking or doing something else as well in here as well spot locator Sat phone I've got three different devices used by spot and this is just my emergency Sat phone device and I really you know I never really turn the thing on ever unless it's a absolute emergency situation I need a text home or call somebody or whatever but this is a great option if you are going out for a couple nights in the backcountry into the woods the mountains whatever we're on a boat always bring a small Petzl headlamp I usually be in a couple headlamps but the one I like to put in my baggage this really minimal light weight room it all zips into the back here runs off triple-a batteries so what else do I have in here batteries I've got handful of batteries for my camera I usually carry two battery packs usually a total of about ten or twelve batteries on the road including what's in my cameras as well but these battery packs and my memory card wallet always stay a right in my bag with me all times okay so this is a memory card wallet I'm traveling with usually a mixture of Sony and SanDisk memory cards 64 and 128 gigabytes I'll explain why such high caste later but this is essentially my basics for that one of the things you can never have enough of is just cleansing cloth I usually put like wipe cloths like three or four of them just in every bag I'm using in just so that if I need them they're somewhere I know that I can reach into a pocket and I'll be there this bags got like four of them I think so I'll show some of the others and whatnot but that'll be in there and one epic hack that I've used a ton is if you guys are in wet conditions you know that the hard part about this is I can't go over every piece of gear that I would bring for every scenario because it's all different you're going to be in a really wet environment one of the best things to do is to bring is to go get microfiber cloths actually a microfiber towel and what I would do is just cut them into four pieces right and one of the best parts about that is you can just like punch a little hole through get a little tiny carabiner and you can attach that to you know the inside of your bag or something like that so you always have that microfiber cloth and the beauty of that is it's soft enough to clean your lens but it's also dry enough it'll absorb enough water to like drape over your camera if you're shooting a time-lapse you don't need condensation on there I also really works well for just pulling water off now all the bags I have they have this little kit on there it's basically just um it's a little carabiner that's attached to this little clip in my bag and on this thing I have a light I've got another lens cleaning cloth as well as a little multi-tool like I need to change a tripod play if I need to you know who knows there's there's like 20 different little tools on here as well as chapstick so I can't say how many times someone's like oh you know do you have chapstick you have chapstick oh it's in the front of the bag just so this is kind of like my essentials I always just have it in there it really helps because I feel like these are the things I always need so that really is awesome half let's find out what else is in here so that is it for the sides nothing on the side this side cool first charger so this is my um this is my goal zero flip 20 and the beauty of this guy right here is that it will charge your phone it will charge your camera it's powerful enough to you know recharge an entire battery or two on the Sony cameras as well as recharge my phone twice so this is something I've always got on me and probably one of the most important things you can have in any of your pockets eye bags is a nolo clip so this is the olloclip for these six and the 6s or the 6 plus rather and it's got I use the telephoto in the wide-angle you can kind of set these up however you want but this is the one that I like because I tend to use these two lenses the most they're really helpful for video too if you want to shoot something super wide but you have to crop in for video right so this this lens allows you to really widen out a bit prior to that crop olá clips are super helpful you know being able to just pop your phone on here and use the thing anytime is pretty awesome so yeah anyway um cool moving on we have this is this bag I think this is really all the essentials that we're inside of it so that's that now I want to show you how this bag it ultimately works with the rest of my kit so let's push all this kind of off the side here and let's first of all go to the backpack so backpack like I said boom um you'll notice no exterior pockets it's really streamlined I really the nice thing about is actually fits to your back and really works well there so first things first water bottle some easy water bottle one of their glass coated ones the reason I like this is when I'm in locations where you actually to filter water you need to be able to get in there and actually filter it with my stereo pens so I need to be able to have a big opening can't always use a metal bottle for that this thing travels super well never had any issues with it also tripod fits right in the front of this whole entire pouch this is a really right stuff tripod and they are a local company in San Luis Obispo use their tripods for years some of my favorite pieces of equipment they are just super strong really really stable and they can hold like a hundred pounds or something ridiculous not that I ever need that but the beauty is being able to have a really stable foundation for time lapses leaving your camera overnight long exposures things like that so um this tripod is something that always just always travels with me and usually I'll bring a smaller tripod in another bag as well for a littler tinier cameras nice thing about this is for the size and the height it's actually one of the tallest tripods you can get I love with me having something else that fits into that small of a package that's this large is hard to come by so um front pocket all right another really useful device now this is a spot locator now it's different than the satphone because you can't actually call anybody out but you can pre-program messages three messages you can send to people now this is epic because if I'm going on a super-lightweight mission in the mountains and I just want to bring something just in case this guy takes up literally no space it can fit in your camera bag it's no big deal I'm going overnight usually I'll bring the Sat phone or something but this one is just it's awesome to have and the reason I keep it in this bag is because it doubles as a locator beacon as well in case this bag gets stolen or something like that so it's kind of awesome you can send an SOS signal you can send three text messages send a message to your wife to your friends your family whatever as well as you know locate where this is which is awesome so nothing else in the front pouch let's move to this top lid what do I got in here in here um so in this top lid right here I have my second goal zero charger this is the venture 30 the reason I love this one is because its hydrophobic ports waterproof basically shockproof frees group the whole deal it also has a built in cable that allows me to charge microUSB so I can actually charge the camera directly off of this with nothing else also has a little built-in light which is awesome and it can tell me when it's fully charged this is something that really was the game changer for me I'd help develop with them and it's been something that's made me able to go out further deeper and not worry about battery life Western Digital hard drives I usually travel with two of these I think I love about this is it's actually a little baby Pelican case for the hard drive made by Western Digital and this system is great because you can keep your hard drive in here you never have to remove it put your put your cable in there and upload to your computer whatever you need also is a carabiner hook and it's super safe to kind of get beat up and stuff as well so I usually carry two of these one to have a backup as well so I'm never storing anything on my computer another thing too is that memory cards are the smallest lightest weight storage you'll ever need now they're pretty pricey at the same time but if you're in an emergency situation what I recommend doing is just never deleting your cards in addition to backing this up because that's a third storage that you can have so that's that I also have my second light which is a usually I try to always have a waterproof one and this is the storm by this is a rechargeable one from from Black Diamond the beauty of these USB rechargeable ones they usually have a good waterproof rating so if I'm in really bad weather you know kayaking whatever this thing is awesome to use this is my little ditty bag and I'm not going to break up everything in here but basically just so you know it is a tiny little kit that I put in my camera bags when I'm out shooting night exposures whatever I've got a remote infrared remote I have a little cable release electronic cable release cable that I can plug in if I'm shooting a time-lapse or shooting something else I have an emergency memory card a little 64 gig mergency memory card in here I also have tools for my tripods right here little baby carabiner another lens cloth rubber band and these guys now you're probably wondering what these guys are and we're going to get to them in a second but these are basically these little locking systems that you can use with the peak design neck straps so they go on your camera so you can lock in they can also go on bags if you want to make a neck strap really easy these are worth their weight in gold my carry a couple extra in case I want to throw them on something else now let's get into the meat of the bag so - I'm going to first just take everything out of here so you can kind of see what's what's inside boom bag is now completely empty as well so um what do I have in here first things first I have my filter kit now this is the the number one filter I probably use on trips as a grad graduated neutral density filter meaning the top is dark and the bottom is light so if you're shooting into a sunset you put this in front of the camera right and it darkens the sky and evens the exposure out awesome filter to have I believe this brand is luke roit is the brand that makes these ones and they are based in Europe but there's a lot of other brands that make them personally I don't have a absolute preference this one's really good but there are others that work awesome as well I've got this guy - this is another filter kit that I'm using this little strap just in case you want to tie it something or attach it make sure I think falls out and in here I've got a basic set of filters what these are is there's only two types of filters I'm using it is a neutral density meaning instead of being the graduated or it's dark and light this is just purely dark so when you're looking through this it'll darken your exposure like eight stops and what it allows you to do is go and shoot that you know waterfall in the middle of the day and darken it down so that it slows down the exposure allowing you to get milky look or longer exposure whatever it is the other filter that I have in here is a circular polarizer so I've got a number of circular polarizers meaning they they basically spin and rotate and what that does is the circular polarizer allows you to enhance and bring contrast to your images it also cuts reflection which is really important for if you're shooting into bright Sun or you're shooting into a surface of water and you want to you know bring out that really green deep rich color blue whatever it is polarisers work really well I use them actually almost all the time except for night exposures oftentimes people think that they're only for bright blue skies but they actually work really well cutting reflections out of leaves and trees and grass and it brings a lot more color to your image so um I've got I kind of have one for each of the main lenses I'm using this why I've got like six filters in here this is a really small lightweight kit all fits together so let me just go over first these cameras and I'll show you how it kind of works in this little side bag let's see first setup this is my main camera bag this is the the main the main two lenses I use on almost any trip everything else is really in addition to these or specialty I would consider it what I have here is I have my 24 to 70 it's just a all-around great lens it's the Zeiss model made for Sony and this is a 1635 Zeiss lens made for sunny and these are both kind of just my go-to lenses I used on almost every trip as you can see around here I have my circular polarizer already on there right so you basically rotate the polarizer until you get the enhancement that you like I find that between these two lenses I'm usually covering almost every length that I need the 16 to 35 is really what I use for a lot of my landscape work a lot of my close-up kind of long exposure in nature usually when you're shooting things like Northern Lights you're shooting the stars you want a wide lens because you're showing not only the ground but the sky as well so you're going to need like a 24 16 18 something like that 35 is almost the longest length I ever used for nighttime work or landscape work so the camera this camera is the sony a7r - it's basically my favorite camera I've ever used it is shoots 4k internal it has 40 megapixel sensor and the package the entire thing is ultra lightweight small and it can almost fit into a large jacket pocket the reason that I started using these was mainly because I like the reactionary feel the fact that I could turn it on and look through the screen and see exactly what the exposure was and I wasn't fiddling chipping with my images I was able to just look and see so the sony a7r - amazing camera I have been using Sony for about six years and it's these small mirrorless cameras that I found to be the really powerful also the sensor is just incredible that's 14 stops at a net dynamic range which is kind of unheard of in in its class for its size and which basically means that you know you can approach a scene that's extremely harsh light you can bring a lot of color a lot of contrast out of it as well a couple other things I really enjoyed the tilt table screen being able to look down on the screen while you're shooting if you're shooting a subject or something you can keep your eye contact you can just kind of fire away and that that's the shutter right now you can kind of fire away without losing breaking contract contact with the eyes or you can kind of aim the screen down and look above your head right and shoot something um it has a stabilized sensor meaning that it has basically five tiny little stabilizers on the sensor that and that allow you to basically shoot this at a fifteenth of a second or a little slower handheld I've had really good results with that it also helps a lot for video or shooting in the water um so enough about this camera you know if you want to look at more specs I'll try and put a link in the bottom of this article but I love this thing it's my go-to I usually travel with two of these on every trip one and a backup and it's kind of my go-to system now these little things you're seeing as little wings on here right what are they how do they work well this is like one of my favorite piece I've ever used from peak design it's a company based in San Francisco and they make amazing camera straps super light really thin like unbreakable material and I've I guess after having enough cameras just fail on me or cameras break I went to a system that I knew was reliable and so the nice thing about this is you just have it on have it off cameras on you right now you can adjust the strap super easily and if you want to take it off you just literally pop this little guy off and it has like a little plate that allows you to pop it in pop it off so these are called anchors these little guys and I'm just a really great system and really easy to use for when you're switching cameras or when you're kind of getting to where you want to be and you want to throw these on I also use their straps for a lot of bags I use on the bottom here I've got one of their plates it's basically a just arca-swiss plate that works universally with almost any tripod head and these things are something that you know use all the time so we pack those back in here once again 2470 I find that most of the time I'm often shooting the longest length is at 70 millimeter I also bring a 24 to 70 that I'll get to as well but I feel like this lens length ends up covering almost everything I need so back in there another side over here let's go to my next camera bag now what you're looking at here these are these are these little tiny camera pouches made by Crumpler I don't work with them at all but I really like these these pouches and the reason why is because I'll show you but they can actually fit into my shoulder bag but these things just cinch up really quickly you know I can kind of protect them from the rain like this they're padded and they're not too pad or not like this big bulky thing that I have to shove in there so they they really are easy to use Mac capacity in here I have a 7200 with a polarizer on it this is the Sony's 7200 f/4 for me I love this lens it's really small light weight and I've never actually had a reason to have or want a 70-200 2:8 because usually when I'm shooting that lens like I'm shooting action or surfing and I don't really need that shallow in the depth of field but that's just my personal style of shooting in here I have a sony a7s this is a specialty camera and it's actually made for night exposures now this a 7s is is amazing alternative to the seminar 2 they're very different though typically on most jobs I would bring to a 7 R to s because I like those a little more but if I'm going to shoot specifically night exposures long exposures or high ISO the a7 s usually comes with me and because that's what it's made for it's made for high ISO shooting still has all the great features right it's got direct manual focus too which means when you go to focus on your image you can zoom in and really get accurate focus which is really helpful for the Stars this lens I have one here is interesting it's a it's a fisheye that is on top of a 28 millimeter so it's basically two lenses in one and a lot of times that would seem really gimmicky but these lenses I've found to be really sharp I've tested them this is the sony 28 millimeter right and then this is the fisheye adapter you throw it on here you only lose a like a half of a stop so it's like I think it's like f28 and you get to like F 3.5 by putting this on this lens is really sharp corner corner I've used it a lot for night exposures and long exposures some of the recent stuff I shot in Switzerland was with this setup and I think that the amount of chromatic aberration and stuff is actually really surprising there's there's hardly any so this is a really awesome setup that I use or I bring often times these guys are here now this little bag um you'll notice this guys kind of set up to be its own little shoulder bag and the reason I have it like that is in case I need to go somewhere and use a little bit lighter weight setup this is kind of what I'll do and this inside here I've got quite a few things this is where I'll store my extra cameras extra lens and stuff that I'm not usually bringing because typically I'm working in and out of one of these time I'm never working out of two I'm usually just bringing what I need I'm shooting night exposures all bringing something different if I'm shooting normal daytime stuff it's this but in this kit I've got a couple of specialty lenses that I really like this is the new batise zeiss lens it's an f2 extremely sharp it's one of the most amazing image quality lenses I've ever used and it just came out I've been using that quite a bit use a lot in Switzerland on my last trip and in the Dolomites in Italy so that goes into here I also have a sony a6000 now this a six thousand is the camera I've told a lot of people this it's basically the little brother to the a7 r2 meaning it has a tiny bit smaller sensor but it actually has a lot of improvements over the other camera meaning it has a it has 11 frames a second shooting capability meaning you can shoot really fast action with it it also has a much faster autofocus so this camera is kind of optimized for shooting sports when you pair this thing with a 7200 it makes it epic epic setup because the crop sensor allows this thing to be about a you know 100 to 300 so really cool for shooting action the lens on here is a 16 to seventies ice which basically equates in thirty five-millimeter terms to about a 24 to 105 this cameras great really enjoyed using it pretty much everywhere I go and it's kind of the one the one thing that I've always bring if I'm shooting somewhere where it's cold I'll throw this guy on my jacket you know all shove underneath if I'm shooting it off a snowmobile or jet ski you're off somewhere that I just want to protect something and have get little snapshots this is kind of the one that I'm bringing and also it's great too because you can just you know you can look at the screen scroll with one finger and get your exposure than fire away you don't really have to use the eyepiece although the eyepieces are really amazing tool as well so in addition to that I also bring with me on all my trips just because I like to bring this Nikon aw one and what this is it's basically a fully waterproof camera that has interchangeable lenses and looks a little crazy but it's actually a really powerful little system the sensors are tiny bit smaller than this but still really good and usable for print or any type of campaign you really need to shoot most the time the beauty of this camera is this is use what you see is what you get no housing needed so a lot of times I'm traveling somewhere especially shooting landscapes or and I want to get a different perspective I will bring this guy and I'll just you know shove it halfway in the water or shoot something underwater it just allows me to really expand my creativity right here this is like a 10 millimeter so it's like a kind of like a fisheye and this is a little zoom lens that they have for it right here that's a 11 to 27 so like a 24 to 70 kind of thing these two things really small really light easy to bring break down what else I have in here this guy I always bring a little doctor because most the time you don't want to be bringing multiple ports like this you just want to basically bring something you can shove into the wall charge as much as you can this has got two USB adapters which is great I've got kind of a plethora of cables here everything from iPhone to microUSB to whatever just a backup I have my camera charger now I said one of the great things is that these smaller cameras I was showing you like this you don't need to charge the batteries in this you can actually just charge it from the USB and one of these little micro USB cables straight into the port on the side which is really nice so just having the option is nice I tend to usually charge cameras from there from this guy as well as for this so extra batteries as well here is my you know seven eight extra batteries in addition to the ones I have in the camera so this kind of bag right here doubles is like my charging kit my extra cameras anything else I need in there that I might potentially potentially need for the trip so it all shoves in and my favorite part about this thing is that it actually tightens up really essential really easily and it's made by a brand called Kinesis it's out of Utah they make kind of like almost custom camera bags really lightweight stuff this guy's great no I'll move on to now that kind of way over my cameras I want to just really quickly show you how this system works meaning I'm off the plane I get to location I finally you know where I need to be whether it's in my car and I'm traveling by car for two weeks or on the road or whatever it is a lot of this stuff I don't want to bring with me on my day to day walking around shooting it in my backpack right so what I usually do is I'll put this stuff somewhere safe whether it's in my roller bag or whatever it is and I will take one of these guys and I will just shove this thing inside of here and it's good to go so this is now my camera bag right and if I'm outfitting my camera bag what am I going to put in here well I'm gonna put my memory cards my batteries I'm gonna put my cleansing cloths on my little kit right here I will have a charger on me at all times just in case the batteries go dead or just in case in a charger phone I have this entire little ditty kit that I will shove in here and ultimately this whole system right here is basically everything I need for a day out shooting in addition to like a little lightweight headlamp and I'll shove into the side so the reason I love this system right here is because basically I can wear this thing over my shoulder I have plenty of space to work with it right here um get into my cameras get out of my cameras it's nice and open and it's lightweight and I'm not putting my backpack down to grab cameras in and out all the time because it's not the way I like to shoot I like to be able to get into my cameras and get out they frequently so um this thing tends to work really well and if you are dealing with rain you can just cinch this up or you can really quickly kind of zip this guy's like that and it's totally good to go can tighten it do whatever you need whole things like that and then again I'm going out at night you need to shoot at night exposures I'll just swap these I'll put this into my backpack or all you know switch the lenses out and I will just put this whole entire kit into here if at any time I do to go to location and have a lot of gear with me I got my backpack I can bring the whole tire kit caboodle but this is kind of the way I like to travel and it makes it kind of seamless these bags can kind of double as two different things if I need to go into the backcountry and I need to take out all my cameras and just bring something small I can bring one camera one lens and use this backpack as my you know multi night whatever bag so that's kind of it for the camera bags and the camera systems now I want to go in just my normal travel bag and what I'm using it for that as well

Oh hands are so cold boil it there it's freezing but absolutely pumping when the right one comes in it's flawless at the offshore way or offshore snow I should say some of these places I go they feel like a photographic purgatory it just feels foreign it's like you know walking on the moon or something like that you know when people think is surfing the last thing people consider is you know surfing in the Arctic the contrast of going in these partial environments and having surfing be your means of exploration that's doesn't get any better than one I feel almost driven to document the Arctic and in a lot of ways Arctic surfing Photography for me was a release I wanted to immerse myself in the beauty of what I was seeing with my own eyes I felt like it became this kind of symbiotic relationship that really it was the perfect medium of expression for me as soon as I got a camera I realized this could be my vehicle to go experience the world I love to travel you know like I'm a cold water fanatic that's why I go to these cold harsh environments the clouds the moodiness the Northern Lights and it truly is beautiful and epic and surreal landscapes that come out of this North Atlantic Sea has really drawn me in this morning we had to shovel out the car for about an hour before we could even get out of the driveway we had about five to six feet of like snow drift last night it's just packed beyond belief being from Southern California it's the complete opposite from what I'm used to it's just a different kind of beauty it's real wrong we're just getting to see this side of contribution is super rad it truly is beautiful and an epic and mystical all while being some of the most harsh conditions I've ever seen I have such a respect for the guys that they get out there in the water they really have the tough end of the deal I kind of feel like it I'm going to war or something like I got my combat suit on you're putting on five to seven millimeters of rubber then you're hopping in water this we have a 35 to 45 46 degrees it doesn't really get much better for traveling to cold destinations surfing between these giant cliffs good waves it's the raddest thing ever when you're first paddling out it's kind of a shock and then two minutes you start feeling your core temp drop and you make one little turn the wrong way you let tickets flooded and it deals electrifying the ocean for years has been considered by a lot of the locals in these places such a dangerous scary place and Weezie you know these professionals working in such an amazing way rioting storms certainly crazy under toes and huge currents and winds from some of the roughest seas in the world but it all kind of comes together this beautiful way when when those storms do subside and there's this glimpses in between it's harsh moments where you get perfection it humbles you and makes you realize how immerse II of the ocean and the elements we are I know that the server's are out in the water suffering just as much as I am if not way more so I feel like you have this extremely heavy task on your shoulders of making sure that you document what's going on accurately and appropriately and doing them justice because you're only going to get so many moments today is looking like a perfect day to get in the water so I'm going to jump in and see what I get it's just a matter of trying to get everything warm before you go in you know when you want to get these images when you want to get these moments you have to be out in the elements really experiencing it and for me you know like I loved suffered the idea of having cold fingers you know little skin and chapped lips and you know really putting yourself out there in the elements I guess that's when you feel like you're really paying the price but the greatest rewards come real deal right now it is so so slick I think the surf community it's a passionate Bunch I mean it's just such a beautiful way to interact and share experience with people and I think that that experience is what draws you all closer it makes you feel like you're part of a group we all want to see what's out there you know we all want to push past that next headline and see if there's a better way on the other side and I think that that experience is what what draws you all closer that community I feel like that's the gifts like family I think it's photographers our goal or at least my goal is always to inspire people if you're not sharing your work than what are you doing I just want to stoke people's passions for for adventure and getting out there and I want people to drift away when they look at my images you know I want them to feel like it's taking them so far from where they are at that moment that they're immersed in they're feeling I think that the adventure that comes from going these places where you know you could easily go there and never get a single rideable wave but what you do get when you get that it's like the reward of you know bagging a new summit or like climbing the top of like some unnamed peak it's it's just I don't know there's a surreal victory that comes from that and I feel like those the ones that mean the most to me maybe not even the most beautiful images but the ones where you come back and you're like well I really gave something of myself to get that shot I think that that's the beauty of of going those places learning new things about yourself every time you take a photograph
