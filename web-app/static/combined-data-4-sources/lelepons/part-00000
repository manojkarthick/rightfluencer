Halloween is probably a really fun time for you, right. Yeah, I know. Since you were little, your parents used to take you out. You know trick-or-treating You know, eating all the candy you want, going on a school night. WRONG. Halloween is not all fun and games. It's a competition! In my school, there's a thing called "Halloween costume party" And if you didn't win, you would sit alone at lunch. I know that 'cause this been five years I've been sitting alone at lunch. Here's a look at all the costumes I've been wearing.   So not only did my costume suck, but I sucked at the game. But this year, I'm gonna use the CoverGirl Katy Kat Collection. This year, I'm gonna win the "Halloween costume party" ! And I'm gonna get a boyfriend - but that's another story. So I'm telling you right now, Halloween is no joke. Tonight is gonna be my night. Let's see what happens.     LELE : *clears throat* EVERYBODY : Meh. THE PARTY ORGANIZER : Hey! Everybody quiet ! I'm about to start the contest, alright. Um, let's start with "The mummy" EVERYBODY : Woo ! Let's go ! Yeah ! The rules are ; you gotta cover your partener as much as you can, whoever has the least amount of skin showing by the end, wins the game. Alright, GO ! THE PARTY ORGANIZER : You can't spin. *mumbling* LELE : We better win this thing, we better win. *mumbling* Spencer is coming in for the lead. He's coming in this year ! LELE : Not this year, this is my year. Y'all are clearly disqualified you were spinning. THE "MUMMY" : What ?! THE PARTY ORGANIZER : That's obviously cheating, yeah. Spider-man... a good effort, but your elbows is out... you feet, you top, your head.. You didn't try it hard enough. You're going. Sorry. Now that leaves my man Spencer and Lele. Y'all killed it SPENCER : We... THE PARTY ORGANIZER : So Lele is the winner ! *celebrating* SPENCER : We did it ! LELE : I did it ! Alright guys, the next contest is we're gonna be guessing how many candy corns are in this jar. Is y'all ready ? EVERYBODY : Yeah ! THE PARTY ORGANIZER : Alright, let's do it ! SPIDER MAN : *whispering* Four fifteen... WOLVERINE : 999. THE PRINCE : I say 1 753. THE GIRL : A million ! LELE : 750. THE MILITARY GUY : There's gotta be at least 48 in that mom. SPENCER : 1 302... THE DOCTOR : I would have to say... 1 400 ! THE PARTY ORGANIZER : Right... Good guess. There's 1,400 and one in here so Kevin wins... you're off by one I don't know if a stethoscope works like that, but hey.. THE DOCTOR : Ah yes ! Doctor My wins and you guys are all losers ! THE PARTY ORGANIZER : All right guys just called monster-freeze, so we're gonna play music and then stop it, and whoever moves after he stop it, loses That first person's out and everyone else... EVERYBODY : Woo ! *applause* SPENCER : I'm the best at this game ! THE PARTY ORGANIZER : And... Play the music ! *music* SPENCER : I can't help it, you know I gotta DAAAANCE ! Ou- out of here ! THE PARTY ORGANIZER : Alright guys, this is the final round ; "The costume contest", so if you pick Lele raise your hand. Alright alright if you vote for Dr. My, raise your hand. EVERYBODY : Woo ! Yeah ! LELE : WHAT ?! Are you serious ?! *phone ringing* THE DOCTOR : Hello... oh. Upon our surgery ? I'm on my way. THE PARTY ORGANIZER : Wait. Bro, this is-- this is not a kind of-- LELE : Wait, are you a real doctor ? THE DOCTOR : Dr. My, yes. THE PARTY ORGANIZER : Oh you disqualified. THE DOCTOR : What?! THE PARTY ORGANIZER : The new winner ! Lele wins now ! EVERYBODY : Meh. LELE : What ?! THE PARTY ORGANIZER : You won ! LELE : You suck ! *outro's music*

Hello my Name is Vera and I am a bull -I think it's about time you get out of the closet huh Miss Buck I just wanted to say you're a very beautiful lady and um.. -shut up -alright.. who here is getting bullied? Who here doesn't want to get bullied anymore? You guys don't want to be bullied anymore? Yeah, yeah, well that's not gonna Happen, okay? I'm not here to tell you that tomorrow you're not going to get bullied. You are probably gonna get bullied. Especially you, you whiny nincompoop. I don't even know ..if..I'm gonna &lt;unintelligible&gt; Ok nerd worm. I'm here to show you how to avoid getting bullied When I was little.. -Were you bullied too? -No! I used to be the Bully -You were a bully!? Please don't bully us. -Don't Talk to me. There's three things that I'm gonna show you today for you guys to not get bullied anymore The first thing to do is: Verbal Abuse You're gonna talk to the bully and outsmart them, okay? They hate that. All bullies are dumb. -What if that doesn't work? Then you do, Physical Combat I highly doubt that's gonna work because you guys look like you can't even lift a pencil. So I have the third one for you. -Is it science?! No. It's not science. -Well, technically, everything is science. You think you're smart? You're not. The Last Thing you can do is you're Gonna Get A third Person and Record Everything so you can Show the Parents and that's it. -What if that doesn't work? -You die. Okay any questions? -Does that really gonna work? Hate kids. I freakin' hate kids Let's go.. The first thing, we're gonna do today Is that you're gonna talk back to them okay?! -Well I got a 99 in Public Speaking -Yeah, you guys love talking I know. Okay, if they say something you're gonna outsmart them. -Well I'm the smartest one here, actually -No.. that's actually not true -I can use a science fact -I don't care if somebody tells you hey, your face is deformed you can just be like, that's what happens when I look at you. -That's really mean If that doesn't happen Then you can just compliment them. Most of the time they feel good and they don't punch you in the face alright? if you're lucky. -Oh, well I give great compliments I like your sweater. -You smell like roses in a butterfly nest -okay cool so, the last thing you can do is that you can threaten them for example if they do something you're gonna be like, Oh I'm gonna tell my parents that you're doing this. And that usually scares them but don't worry guys! If they punch you, I'm gonna have it recorded and that's gonna fix everything, ok? Alright, are you guys ready!? Let's go! -Today, you will learn how to be physical. -Kids, meet my ex-boyfriend. He's going to teach you how to be physical You see, me, I'm a product of Suffering and Pain &lt;weeping&gt; -It's okay, honey. -Give me 10 Push-ups! NOW! GET DOWN! Keep coming, let's go. -A flower, hehe -You're a flower! Let's go! jab reverse punch jab reverse punch What are you doing patty cake!? -Are they ready? -No.. I figured.. Nope! No, stop! Okay, so, where are the bullies? -There
-On the seesaw -They're girls Ok, do what i told you, but don't do the physical part because you can't hit girls you might get punched in the face but it's okay, because I'm gonna record it okay? Alright good luck guys, uh, okay.. ..oh God. -Hey Guys, ready to get beat up again? -Actually, Scientifically speaking It would be a beatdown because Gravity pulls you down -Your smarts won't help you -We're not scared of you -Shut up nerds -We're going to tell our parents if you beat us up. -we don't see any of your parents -Chrissy, punch him. -Wait, wait, I like your shoes, wanna go out some time? &lt;thud&gt; -..oof &lt;whimper&gt; -And that's a cut! I got it! Nice job, okay Well Girls Um, Yeah I recorded you Guys Punching him I sent it to your Parents and they're about to be.. okay babe Is that your dad -Nicole! -Crystal! -What Is this video?!

&gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Every year, people all around the world celebrate magical figures. In December, we celebrate Santa Claus. On Valentines Day, we celebrate Cupid. On Saint Patricks Day, we celebrate a Leprechaun. And during Easter, we celebrate the Easter bunny. And last but not least, there's one member of the group that no one gives a [BLEEP] about. Me. The Tooth Fairy. Hello. I'm the Tooth Fairy. I'm sick of it! There's no holiday for me. Even though I work every [BLEEP] day. While the others work, I don't know, once a year. [BLEEP] I give you money! And you know what, while everybody is celebrating, you know Santa Claus and Cupid and the Easter Bunny, what do I get? Exactly. I don't give a [BLEEP]. It's fine. But let me tell you how this all works, okay? First things first, how they lose their teeth. One way, you can either get punched in the face for saying something stupid. &gt;&gt; BOY 1: So why are you talking to my girlfriend? &gt;&gt; BOY 2: She's hot. &gt;&gt; BOY 1: So now you're using her? &gt;&gt; BOY 2: Yeah? So what? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Really? She's hot. Other ones get hit by the ball. While other people eat something hard and break their teeth. You know what, I don't even know what this guy is doing. &gt;&gt; BOY: A dare is a dare. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: I'm sorry, what the [BLEEP]? And, you know, to be honest some days when I'm out of work I do it myself. What? Once they lose their teeth, that's when I come in. There's three things that happen during the night. You either deal with the heavy sleepers. I hate my life. Then comes the light sleepers. Go back to bed! Oh and my favorite of all, when my parents come in to take my job. The parents! &gt;&gt; DAD: I can't believe she still believes in the tooth fairy! &gt;&gt; MOM: What is the tooth fairy? &gt;&gt; DAD: Come on, let's put a dollar under. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Oh hell no! &gt;&gt; DAD &amp; MOM: What's happening? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: This is my job! This is my job! &gt;&gt; DAD: What is going on? Oh my gosh! Run! &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: What! Anyway. Oh and my favorite part of the year, the meeting day. This is the day where we all meet together and discuss what we do in life. &gt;&gt; SANTA: He couldn't find [BLEEP]! &gt;&gt; CUPID: Yo, yo, watch this, watch this watch this. Usually I got good aim. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Okay first of all guys, I'm sorry guys, why am I here and why are you guys there? &gt;&gt; SANTA: This is the lit side. We lit. &gt;&gt; CUPID: We actually do stuff. See we have days of the month. &gt;&gt; SANTA: All the best holidays on this side. &gt;&gt; CUPID: Come one man. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Then why the [BLEEP] am I even here? &gt;&gt; SANTA: Uh, it's the law? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Well, what about the leprechaun from Saint Patricks Day? He hasn't been here in years. &gt;&gt; SANTA: Wait, where's the leprechaun at? He's probably drunk somewhere still hungover. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: You know what, I have movies you know. &gt;&gt; CUPID: You got one movie! You got one movie! And it's not even played by a woman, it's played by a guy, it's played by The Rock. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: You don't even have a beard. &gt;&gt; SANTA: I don't have a beard? Bam! &gt;&gt; CUPID: Do you even have Twitter? Do you have Twitter? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY? Twitter? &gt;&gt; CUPID: Do you got a Instagram? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: I've got Vine! &gt;&gt; CUPID: It died. &gt;&gt; SANTA: Wait, wait. What did you say? What did you say? [LAUGHING] &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: He didn't say anything. He didn't... [LAUGHING] &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: He didn't say anything. &gt;&gt; CUPID: Oh wow, wow that's a good point. Wow. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: What is he saying? &gt;&gt; SANTA: The bunny wants to know, where do you get the money from to pay the kids? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Huh? &gt;&gt; SANTA: The money. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Okay, now that you know my life, let's go to present day. Who is that? Brats! &gt;&gt; BOY 1: I don't think you've noticed, but... &gt;&gt; BOY 2: We've been watching you for days. &gt;&gt; BOY 3: Especially me, I was always watching. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: So what do you want? &gt;&gt; BOY 3: You forgot to give me my money. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: I forgot your... No. Oh yeah...you're that kid... &gt;&gt; BOY 3:  I want my money. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Here. Here. Keep it. &gt;&gt; BOY 3: Woah. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: What the [BLEEP]? &gt;&gt; BOY 3: I told you guys she'd give us more money. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: You should give me that wand. &gt;&gt; KIDS: Give me money! &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Keep it! &gt;&gt; GIRL: Hey!

&gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Every year, people all around the world celebrate magical figures. In December, we celebrate Santa Claus. On Valentines Day, we celebrate Cupid. On Saint Patricks Day, we celebrate a Leprechaun. And during Easter, we celebrate the Easter bunny. And last but not least, there's one member of the group that no one gives a [BLEEP] about. Me. The Tooth Fairy. Hello. I'm the Tooth Fairy. I'm sick of it! There's no holiday for me. Even though I work every [BLEEP] day. While the others work, I don't know, once a year. [BLEEP] I give you money! And you know what, while everybody is celebrating, you know Santa Claus and Cupid and the Easter Bunny, what do I get? Exactly. I don't give a [BLEEP]. It's fine. But let me tell you how this all works, okay? First things first, how they lose their teeth. One way, you can either get punched in the face for saying something stupid. &gt;&gt; BOY 1: So why are you talking to my girlfriend? &gt;&gt; BOY 2: She's hot. &gt;&gt; BOY 1: So now you're using her? &gt;&gt; BOY 2: Yeah? So what? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Really? She's hot. Other ones get hit by the ball. While other people eat something hard and break their teeth. You know what, I don't even know what this guy is doing. &gt;&gt; BOY: A dare is a dare. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: I'm sorry, what the [BLEEP]? And, you know, to be honest some days when I'm out of work I do it myself. What? Once they lose their teeth, that's when I come in. There's three things that happen during the night. You either deal with the heavy sleepers. I hate my life. Then comes the light sleepers. Go back to bed! Oh and my favorite of all, when my parents come in to take my job. The parents! &gt;&gt; DAD: I can't believe she still believes in the tooth fairy! &gt;&gt; MOM: What is the tooth fairy? &gt;&gt; DAD: Come on, let's put a dollar under. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Oh hell no! &gt;&gt; DAD &amp; MOM: What's happening? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: This is my job! This is my job! &gt;&gt; DAD: What is going on? Oh my gosh! Run! &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: What! Anyway. Oh and my favorite part of the year, the meeting day. This is the day where we all meet together and discuss what we do in life. &gt;&gt; SANTA: He couldn't find [BLEEP]! &gt;&gt; CUPID: Yo, yo, watch this, watch this watch this. Usually I got good aim. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Okay first of all guys, I'm sorry guys, why am I here and why are you guys there? &gt;&gt; SANTA: This is the lit side. We lit. &gt;&gt; CUPID: We actually do stuff. See we have days of the month. &gt;&gt; SANTA: All the best holidays on this side. &gt;&gt; CUPID: Come one man. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Then why the [BLEEP] am I even here? &gt;&gt; SANTA: Uh, it's the law? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Well, what about the leprechaun from Saint Patricks Day? He hasn't been here in years. &gt;&gt; SANTA: Wait, where's the leprechaun at? He's probably drunk somewhere still hungover. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: You know what, I have movies you know. &gt;&gt; CUPID: You got one movie! You got one movie! And it's not even played by a woman, it's played by a guy, it's played by The Rock. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: You don't even have a beard. &gt;&gt; SANTA: I don't have a beard? Bam! &gt;&gt; CUPID: Do you even have Twitter? Do you have Twitter? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY? Twitter? &gt;&gt; CUPID: Do you got a Instagram? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: I've got Vine! &gt;&gt; CUPID: It died. &gt;&gt; SANTA: Wait, wait. What did you say? What did you say? [LAUGHING] &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: He didn't say anything. He didn't... [LAUGHING] &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: He didn't say anything. &gt;&gt; CUPID: Oh wow, wow that's a good point. Wow. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: What is he saying? &gt;&gt; SANTA: The bunny wants to know, where do you get the money from to pay the kids? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Huh? &gt;&gt; SANTA: The money. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Okay, now that you know my life, let's go to present day. Who is that? Brats! &gt;&gt; BOY 1: I don't think you've noticed, but... &gt;&gt; BOY 2: We've been watching you for days. &gt;&gt; BOY 3: Especially me, I was always watching. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: So what do you want? &gt;&gt; BOY 3: You forgot to give me my money. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: I forgot your... No. Oh yeah...you're that kid... &gt;&gt; BOY 3:  I want my money. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Here. Here. Keep it. &gt;&gt; BOY 3: Woah. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: What the [BLEEP]? &gt;&gt; BOY 3: I told you guys she'd give us more money. &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: You should give me that wand. &gt;&gt; KIDS: Give me money! &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: Keep it! &gt;&gt; GIRL: Hey! Where did you get all this money from? &gt;&gt; TOOTH FAIRY: You know what happens next. Oh...that's a very good question. I get my... &gt;&gt; SANTA: Hey Tooth Fairy, I just wanted to apologize about the other day. We're really sorry. [BUNNY SCREAMING] [LEPRECHAUN SCREAMING]
