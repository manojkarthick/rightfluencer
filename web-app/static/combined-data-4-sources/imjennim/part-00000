It's the last day of February and I've got a fresh pile of faves for you! Watch it here: https://youtu.be/MgMLdq9DnNc. #ad Public speaking used to make my stomach churn. Actually it still kinda does  but I have a few tips on calming me down when I'm on stage. Dress in an outfit you feel amazing in  starting with a comfortable base layer  like my Hanes bra and underwear. It's crazy what a killer comfy outfit can do to your confidence. Last year I did four panels and before I went on stage  I looked at my outfit in the mirror and told myself that I'm worth being heard. It's okay to take a pause and gather your thoughts. Time goes a lot slower in your head  especially when you're panicking. The audience can wait so take your time. Find a loved one in the audience and make eye contact. My friends will give me a smile or a funny face and I instantly feel better. #BeComfydent. A unisex look 4 u 💫 http://ift.tt/2EZCXik. Rainy days are ahead!

- Hi, everyone! It's your girl, Jenn. And today, I am doing a
really fun styling video. Since it's finally starting
to get cold around here, I thought I would bust out
some of my outerwear pieces and show you guys how I style them. I am so happy to announce that I have partnered with Nordstrom Rack
who is sponsoring this video. They have such a great
selection of outerwear, so it was really fun
getting to make this video. I also filmed a video on
their YouTube channel, so make sure you check that
out after you watch mine. But for this video, I
am styling three looks, so let's get started. The first coat I'm styling
is the puffer coat. Puffer coats are
notorious for being bulky, but that's why I decided to choose one that's more elongated. I love that this is in
a neutral olive shade, so it's really easy to pair
with anything in my closet. I went ahead and styled it
with a gray turtleneck sweater, and then I streamlined with
some simple, black skinnies for something chic and classic. For shoes, I'm wearing
some classic black boots. And then I wore a beanie
to cover up any bedhead. I think this is a really
great, everyday jacket that you can rock to school or
running errands around town. Nordstrom Rock has a ton
of amazing puffer options, so make sure you check it out. This next outfit is how I
would rock a faux fur coat. I found this color one at Nordstrom Rack, and I love that it's reversible. So it's like you're
getting two coats in one. Since the coat is on the
more extravagant side, I'm going to show you how I rock this baby in the evening for a date night look. I popped on the coat, and I'm showing off the white faux fur side. I feel like it gives off a more chic, winter wonderland vibe. Underneath, I'm wearing a cute, lace dress and then paired it with
some over-the-knee boots for a cozy winter feel. This is a great look to wear to a concert or even a nice dinner. I also styled these boots over at the Nordstrom Rack
channel, so if you'd like to get more ideas on how to style it, definitely go check it out. I'll leave it in the cards
and the description box. The next coat is perfect for those who are traveling for the holidays. I highly recommend getting a bomber jacket because they're so multifaceted and can be worn for so many occasions. Here I have this really
sick, black bomber. It's so comfortable, and it has this cool graphic on the back. So this is how I styled the bomber to wear at the airport. I paired the jacket with a comfy hoodie and some sweats. This is like a really chilled out look, and it's insanely comfortable. So that way, you can travel in leisure. Now here is how I wear the
bomber for the evening. I paired it with a patterned,
over-the-shoulder top and my navy disco pants. This is a flashy ensemble you can wear to a house party or drinks with the girls. So, yeah, that's why I
love bombers so much. They're light-weight, easy to pack, and really go with any occasion. All right, guys, those
are my three outfits featuring outerwear pieces. If you'd like more fashion inspiration, head on over to Nordstrom
Rack's YouTube channel. I filmed something on there. I will leave a link in
the description box, so please check it out. You can also shop similar
styles on Nordstrom Rack. They are having an additional
30 percent off sale on Black Friday, so if
you love a good deal, make sure you right in your calendars. Please let me know what other items you'd like me to style in future videos in the comments down below. I love reading what you guys have to say. And yeah, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! 
(calm music) - Hi, everyone! It's your girl Jenn and today
is such an exciting day for me because my clothing line
Eggie officially drops today. Like, even saying that
out loud is so surreal. I have been working on
this for such a long time, since the end of last year. So I've been keeping my
lips sealed since then and now I get to just,
you know, break the news! Eggie is baby in Korean and growing up, I was always
the Eggie in the family and now this clothing
line is Eggie of my own. This is a full blown 27 piece collection. There's a lot to go through. And I thought for this first video, I would just, you know,
break down each piece, explain where I got the inspiration, and showcase the items to you guys in a good old-fashioned haul. There's a lot of items in this collection, so let's get crackin'! So I'm gonna start off
with the tops first. Here I have this white ribbed T-shirt. This is called the Fuzzy Baby T. And I think it's a really
great, easy everyday top and it has Eggie in Korean on the corner, and I thought it'd be really
interesting to make it 3D and fuzzy so it just has
like a quirky texture to it. I went for a mock neck
just to make it stand out from the rest of the
graphic Ts on the market. Moving onto the next top, here I have my Try Again Cropped T. This comes in three colors: this blush, yellow, and then black. But then I forgot to film black. When I was showing this in
New York at my press preview, a lot of people were asking
me like what this meant. It's just "try again" but all jumbled up so it implies the viewer to
try again to decipher it. White tops have always been
such a staple in my wardrobe so that's why it was
really important for me to sprinkle a couple in my line. This is my Ruff Haus Blouse
and I absolutely love it. It's this really flowy looking number. It's got kind of like
an Edwardian theme to it with color and the ruffles
and the sleeves as well. It's got this lovely white
polka dot pattern all around it and it just gives it a nice,
beautiful, dainty feel. I also recommend wearing
this with a nude bandeau or a nude camisole, just
to keep you more covered. I've always loved items with
little catchphrases on it, so that's why I made the Now What Blouse. This is the perfect
fitting white button down that's a little sexy but put together. It also has the words
now and what embroidered onto the lapel and I
feel like this is saying that, you know, it's applicable
for a lot of situations and you could even like say "What now?" So they're interchangeable. Over here, we've got the Eggie Hoodie. This is an incredibly
oversized, slouchy, comfy hoodie and I just wanted to make
sure that the sleeves were extra long because I
thought it would be really cool for the proportion. On the sleeve, there's
also Eggie written on it with like an Old English font. There's also Eggie on the hood in Korean, so that way you can just kinda flash it to tell everyone who needs to be babied. I've got another top that
is perfect for the fall. This is the Eggie Long Sleeve. I'm holding the orange one
but it also comes in white. I love both color ways and it's made in the softest material. It's just like a really cozy fabric and I could totally
see myself wearing this as like my pajama shirt during the fall when it gets a little colder. This is also one of those
shirts that you can sleep in and then, like, wake up
and go out the next day in. Very comfortable and easy on the go. This next item is the item to
layer with during the fall. This is my Mesh Bodysuit. I love pairing this with
just little baby doll Ts that are fitted, because it creates a really cool 90s effortless look. I could also imagine
myself layering this over like a fitted turtleneck or
even off the shoulder tops. This is just a really fun
piece to experiment with. Sweater weather is quickly approaching, so I wanted to have just
the nice, snuggly jumper into my collection. This is in a beautiful lilac shade and it's, like, so perfectly 90s. This is in, like, a beyond soft material. I swear, like once you put it on, you don't want to take it off. And this is actually like a happy mistake because this was supposed to
have like a fish cake print all over it but it didn't
embroider correctly so we decided to just X out the embroidery but keep the actual sweater. So now we are done with the tops and I want to talk about this skirt. I think red is such a
power color for the fall and I wanted to make sure
that I really utilized this fun color into this nice skirt. I really love this light, breezy material and I think that the grommets on the side and the lace detailing
really make it unique. Now let's move on to the
jumpsuits and the matching sets. I want to talk about the one
that I'm rocking right now. This is called the Dolores Jumpsuit and it comes in two prints. The first print I want to talk about is the Korean national flower print! Wanted to incorporate some
of my Korean background into my collection. When I was going to Korean school, we sang this song called like
(speaking in foreign language) and it's basically just like praising our beautiful nation flower (laughs). And I thought it would
just be the perfect print to put on this jumpsuit. This jumpsuit like
literally fits like a glove and it's got pockets and it
hugs in all the right places and I absolutely love the back as well. This also comes in
gingham, as you can see. And I guess this is incorporating more of like my American background. When I think of gingham,
I think of picnics, and I named it Dolores
because of Dolores Park in San Francisco. I had a lot of picnics back there and it just reminds me of good times. And I feel like this jumpsuit
would be perfect to wear eating outdoors and
enjoying food and friends. Next up, I've got the Eggie Tracksuit. This is in a nice beige color but it's got a little kick to it because of the checkered
striping on the sides and the armpit. I thought that the checkers went perfectly with the gingham print. Like, look, it's literally the same thing. But I don't know, I just
thought it would go really well together and tie in a nice theme. This is a perfect little
outfit that you can wear at the airport or school or whenever you just want
to blast through errands but stay comfy. So I love wearing matching sets and this one is extra special to me because it has my favorite
fruit printed on them. This is the Korean melon and it's called the (speaking
in foreign language) and I ate these so much
while growing up as a kid. My mom would cut these up after dinner and we'd eat them for dessert. And these are just absolutely delicious. If you've never tried a Korean melon, I highly recommend that you do. This is a really fashion forward piece and I love the pockets on the skirt. Those are a game changer for sure. And if you don't like the melon print, it also comes in a striped version! This is identical to the melon set but it's in a slightly different fabric. Like, it's a little thicker so it'll keep you kind of warmer, so if you live in a colder place, this will keep you maybe 5% warmer. Let's chat about the Knotty
Top and Wide Trousers set. I feel like this is perfect
for the in between summer to fall transition phase because the top is still very
appropriate for the summer. And for the bottoms, these are
just a great fitting culotte. They're such an amazing fit
and you can rock these pants in a business setting. This also comes in black
so it's even easier to mix and match with items
that are already in your closet. Alright, everybody, let's move on over to the outerwear pieces. This is my Tuxedo Blazer
and I am just obsessed with the stripe print. It's so bold and it
coordinates really well with the Stripe Set that I showed earlier. I just love statement jackets and you'll really be making
a splash in this one. This also comes in a black color. And I find that these types
of jackets are always my go to when I want to find a
coat for the evening. So this next jacket is my favorite one, it's the Truck Along patent jacket. This is in a really flashy material. It's so sick and just so unique and it's fun to wear. I wanted to make sure that
it came in red and black, depending on everyone's comfort level. I would say to try the black one if you're just kind of dipping
your toes into this material. This jacket adds so much
personality to any look and all eyes will be on you
when you're rockin' this. Next up in line, I have the Eggie Bomber. I love huge oversized bombers. This is basically supposed
to be like a bomber that, like, your boyfriend's
letting you borrow. Or you stole. It's got like a nice slouchy fit and it's perfect and warm for
those fall and winter days to come. I love cardigans that double as a blanket, so here I have my Cozy Cardigan. It's so long, it's like floor length, and you literally wrap around
in it like a little burrito and you're just so comfortable and cozy. You throw it over anything and
it instantly elongates you. My last coat is a blazer. It's called Gingham Thing. Obviously I wanted to keep the gingham and the checkered theme in my collection, so I thought we'd just bust
out a blazer in this fun print. Throw it on over any casual
look for a polished feel. And also this blazer is so well made. It's lined, it's got pockets, and it's just everything
you would want in a blazer. I can't wait to style
this in a future video. So we are at the last category now. We're gonna be tackling the dresses. This is the Cheeki Slip and I have obviously named
this dress after my dog. This is essentially a bodycon
dress but with a twist and it's perfect to wear on nights out where you just wanna dance
and just have some fun. The next dress is called The Dalva and I actually named this after a bar that Ben and I used to go to. It's in the Mission and it's just like a really romantic spot where you sip on cocktails and get to know someone really well. And this dress is just
a really cool in between of just like casual and formal. It's casual because of the material but formal because of the silhouette. My last dress is called the Shine Slip. This is just my version of the
classic little black dress. The straps are adjustable and we tried to make
them as thin as possible so we could make it even more delicate. And it also has these
sexy cutouts on the side and the material has a
nice soft sheen to it. Alright, guys, that is the end
of this massive Eggie launch. I can't believe that each
and every one of these pieces are in my own line and I
feel so proud and excited to share this all with you. Feel free to shop all the
pieces online at eggie.us and please follow out
Instagram, @eggieshop. We will be posting
exclusive content on there and it'll give you just more ideas on how to style everything. Before I left, I just
wanted to thank you guys for giving me this opportunity
to even have a clothing line, because without you this would
have never, ever happened. I have been on YouTube for seven years and I have been putting my
everything into this channel and building this
relationship with you guys. If I told my 18 year old self that I would have my own clothing line, I wouldn't have believed it and I also would have been terrified because when I first started
YouTube, I was so lost. I was really struggling when
I first started this channel. I got rejected to all my dream schools, I was going to community college, I was working in a smoothie shop, and I just felt like I was
letting everyone down in my life. And YouTube was my little escape to showcase what I knew and
what I felt good expressing, fashion and style. I honestly don't know what
I did to deserve you guys. You guys are the best,
those most loyal subscribers that I could ever wish for and I just appreciate you guys so much. You guys have given me this beautiful life and you guys inspired
me to just work harder, bust my ass, and just try and
produce like the best content and produce the best items that
I possibly can for you guys. I will never stop thanking you because I'll never forget you. Thank you for everything
and I love you guys, you guys are all my Eggies. I also have to thank my Eggie team. Without them, this would
have not been possible. This is not a job for just one person, so I am so thankful that I
have a group of solid people behind my back. Thank you so much. (sighs) I feel like I'm
accepting an award or something but this is literally one
of the biggest milestones I've ever had in my entire life and I just wanna thank you guys so much for being a part of this journey. Thank you a million times. I'll see you guys in the next line. Bye. (calm music) 
(electronic music) - Hey, everyone, it's your
girl Jenn, and welcome back. We are doing a favorites today because it's the end of the
month, you know the drill. Honestly, October was
kind of scattered for me. I felt all over the place. I held it together, but it was kinda hard. (laughs) I don't know, how was your October? Let me know in the comments down below. Yeah, let's focus on the positives, and let's dive right into the favorites. First up on the agenda, we
gotta talk about these boots. These are from Dolls Kill, and I love how chunky and '90s they are. I have always been attracted
to big, clunky boots because they just look badass, and they're also very
comfortable because of the heel, and these are no exception. They are a little bit heavy, but I just consider
them like ankle weights, so it's just making me work out harder when I'm just wandering around. It's like a two in one, you look good, and you burn more calories. They have a really cool
ring detail on the zipper, so they're very easy to slide up and down, and I think they add a perfect
amount of edge to any outfit. Whether it's a dress,
or pants, it looks sick. Now I'm moving straight into a book. I don't really have that many beauty and fashion favorites this month. I think I was just really focusing on what was in here, and
one of my favorite books that I read this month was What I Know For Sure by Oprah. I have always admired and respected Oprah, but I was never curious enough to really see her path, and
how she got to where she was. I just knew that she was self-made, but my friend Amy is obsessed with her, and she said a quote by
Oprah about, I don't know, something about people's journeys
and people's experiences, but basically, that propelled me to just download the book on my Kindle, and it has been so amazing. Basically, this book is about Oprah explaining what she's
learned throughout her life, and believe me, she is not only wealthy, but she is rich in knowledge and wisdom. I just really look up
to her even more now, and my respect for her
has doubled tenfold. She's incredible, and if
you're looking for a book that is gonna inspire
you, and to remind you of the simple things in life, like finding joy in the
first sip of coffee, or walking your dog, or
just breathing in sage, it's just a very relaxing book to read, and it's been really nice
to finish my nights off with pages from the book. Highly recommend you check it out, and it's a very easy read. For my next favorite, I
have this reading light that I got from Ben. It was a present from
him because, obviously, we sleep in the same bed, and sometimes, he wants to go to sleep,
but I want to read, but I want to read in bed. The light situation has been
an issue, but not anymore. I have this amazing portable little light. You clip it right on your Kindle, and it has two light settings. One's bright, and then
one's even brighter. It's just really, really convenient, and you can travel with it,
and it's gonna be amazing to read on planes,
especially for night flights, because I know there's
a reading light on top, but I just feel like, when it's on, I'm inconveniencing
everybody 'cause it's like, "The light is on." Even though it's just
directing, technically, at you, it's still illuminating the general area, so I feel like this would
eliminate that problem, and I just love it. If you have a Kindle, I
highly recommend this. If you don't have a
Kindle, I highly recommend you get a Kindle, because, I mean, a lot of people ask me, "Oh,
Jenn, how do you find time "to read so much?" I really think it's because
of my Kindle because, if there's a book I want to read, I'll literally just go
on the Kindle store, and I just get it. I mean, some books are, like, 12 bucks, but all in all, they're all
roughly five or six dollars, and it's totally worth it, very immediate. I just highly recommend it. Next up, I gotta give a shoutout to Raw Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar. That's a very provocative name. Yeah, I've heard so many health
benefits from drinking this, but I didn't get around to
start drinking it until now because I'm getting older, and I just want to live as long as I possibly can, so I want to take care of myself. Basically, every day,
around the afternoon, I'll get one tablespoon, put it in a cup, and then I'll fill the
rest of the cup with water, and I'll just chug it. It's very, very crucial
that you mix it with water, or else it'll just burn your throat. This scent ... (bottle hisses) Oh, wow. If you don't like vinegar,
you're definitely not gonna enjoy drinking
this, but I kinda like it. It's kind of like a savory drink. It's like kombucha with a mix of kimchi. I don't know, I think it's good. This is one of the earth's
oldest home remedies, so there are so many
things that it benefits. I was reading this list, and it was like, it regulates your pH levels,
it lowers your blood pressure, it helps you lose weight,
clears up your skin, supposed to prevent wrinkles, so it just seems like a magic product, and honestly, I can't claim
that I see so much difference because it's only been a month, but I'm gonna continue drinking this, and we'll see and reassess after a year to see if it's done anything. As much as I love routine,
my gym regimen has been kind of monotonous because I
go four to five times a week, and sometimes, I just don't
want to do the same thing, so I recently signed up for ClassPass. I've been doing it this entire month, and it's been amazing. If you don't know what ClassPass is, it's a website and app
that helps you search and find workout classes. When you sign up, you
put your location in, and it'll find all the workout
classes that are around you, so whether you like TRX,
hit training, pilates, yoga, it has everything, so you get to just pick your classes that you want to go to. For my plan, I pay 60 bucks
for five classes a month. There are different plans you can do in case you want to go more
or you want to go less, but for me, five is good for now. I might bump it up to 10 classes because I'm enjoying this a lot more because I feel like it
really switches things up, and it's exciting to go,
especially with a partner. Me and Amy have been really
on it with our ClassPass. So far, we've done kickboxing, a bunch of high interval
intensity training. Yeah, basically, we've
done a lot of classes, and it's a really great
way to bond with someone because there's nothing like
sweating next to your friend, and dying, and then getting lunch after. My last favorite is super random, but I had to talk about it because I've just been really enjoying it. It is my new Cheeki treat jar. This was a gift from my mother-in-law, A.K.A. Ben's mom, A.K.A. mum. I never called my mom mom. She was always Umma to me, so I feel like the title mum is still,
like, up for grabs, so I'm gonna try that out, you know. It's very, very detailed. Even the ears are in this cute
beige color that Cheeki has, and it's just, I don't know, it just makes me so happy, and it makes Cheeki
happy when I reach for it because she knows that,
inside, I got all her treats. She was actually confused why I was carrying the treat
jar into the office, but yeah, it's been nice. I feel like every pet owner should have a little jar in the form of their pet because it's just cute. Like, where else are you
gonna put your treats? All right, guys, that is
a wrap on my favorites. Before I left, I wanted
to quickly thank everybody that's helped translate my videos. Seriously, I know it
is very time-consuming, but it is being appreciated so hard by me, and I want to specifically thank those who have been translating
my videos into Korean because, now, my mom can
finally watch my videos and understand what I say, because me and my mom have
a really close relationship, but sometimes, that language
barrier is so intense, and we find a way to communicate, but if she watches my videos, she has no idea what I'm saying because I'm talking in English so quickly. Now she can read the Korean captions, and I don't know, watch my favorites, and see what I'm up to, and it just means the absolute world to me. Thank you to everyone who has translated in Chinese, Italian, German, Arabic. There's been so many volunteers that have helped me do that, so I want to thank you guys so much. It is not being not appreciated,
and I'm so grateful. As usual, I would love to know what your guys's favorites are in the comments down below. I just love hearing what
you guys have to say, and what you guys are up to. I feel like this is a good
thing we've got going on. Anyway, I hope you guys have a really beautiful rest of your day, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. Mwah. (electronic music) 
(calm music) - Hi, guys! It is Monday. Welcome to the first day of
the September Part Two vlog. It's 5:42 p.m. and things
have finally calmed down but I've just had so much work to do. I turned in my rough cut for
my 24 hours in New York video and then I filmed this fall makeup look which I am rocking right now. I love it. I just feel like it really
goes well with the bangs. This fall makeup look is due tomorrow so I'm gonna spend pretty
much the entire evening editing this guy. Also I got metal straws finally! You guys proud of me? It's something I've been wanting
to get for the longest time because I like drinking out of straws because I don't want to stain my teeth and I drink a lot of coffee, a lot of tea, so the straw really helps. But anyway, I'm gonna
continue to chug along and I'll talk to you guys in a bit. So I'm just taking a
little break from editing and I wanted to show you
guys the gifts that I got at the housewarming party Ben and I threw on last week, I think? Yeah. And everyone like brought
gifts and it was so nice. I like really wasn't expecting it. We had never seen our house that full. There was over 50 people in our house and it was cool going to like
every story of our place, seeing everybody get along and hanging out and just having a good time. And I just wanted to
showcase the gifts that I got because they were just so thoughtful. The first item is this. This is a picture frame that
my friend Jonathan gave me. I think this is my 25th birthday and these are all my high school friends. I've known Brianne
since I was five though. Or six? I met her in the first grade and we're still friends today. But it's so cute, I love it. The second gift I have is this Palo Santo. I believe this is kind of like sage and you're supposed to like light it up and you're supposed to,
I don't know, get rid of any demons or bad juju in the house? Palo Santo literally means holy wood. Shamans and healers traditionally burn it for its energetic purification
and healing attributes much like sage. Bingo. This is from Teresa. She couldn't physically
be here but Voo made sure to give this to us. So thanks, Teresa! This next gift is from Sophia. She got us this beautiful chip bowl. Me and Ben are always hosting parties so this is gonna be great
to, you know, put the chips and then put the guac in here. This is gorgeous. Looks like a hat. Okay, and then she also
got Ben this apron. Ben's always cooking and splattering stuff so this is gonna be perfect
for him when he cooks. It also looks like a
really cute dress (laughs). Now for Stephanie's gift. She got us this beautiful aloe vera plant. Unfortunately this is the
only pot we have to fit it and I feel like it's gonna
outgrow this pot pretty soon but it looks awesome. If we ever get sunburn or... Yeah, if we ever get
sunburned, we can chop it off and put the aloe vera all over the wound. So this is awesome. And it just looks like a work of art. It kind of looks like something
from Beetlejuice, huh? The next gift is from Waylee and Wa. They got me this beautiful diffuser. I'm gonna open it actually. I'm so excited. I love things that just make
the house smell nice, you know? They got me this beautiful diffuser. They got me this soy candle,
it's called Dawn Cube. Thank you guys! I might as well just feature
all the other candles but this is a candle that
Emily got me and Ben. This one is for Ben actually because she chose the more
masculine scent for him. This one is vanilla husk and sandalwood and it definitely smells,
it just smells like a man but a good man. This next candle I do
not know who got for me because it didn't have a card. But this is a Kush candle,
so there's cannibis in here. But (coughs). Doesn't smell like it at all. It just smells more like tulip
actually, tulip and amber. Next up, I have these
coasters from Jolene. Thank you so much. These are just beautiful marble coasters in this one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight. Octagon shape, and I've got four of them so this is gonna be great
for saving my countertops. Then from Andrea, she gave me
this gorgeous orchid plant. It's holding up pretty
well, I'm very surprised. And my battery's about to
die so let me go change that. I believe this is also from Andrea but I haven't opened it yet. Oh, okay, oops, I forgot to
show you guys the packaging. She taped a little
sprig of lavender on it. Oh, nice! Okay. And she got me this huge torpedo of sage. But yeah, I believe you're
supposed to burn this and it's supposed to
purify the space as well. Thank you, Andrea! Alright, so this gift
is from Aaron and Jamie and I believe it's one of his prints. So excited to see this. Wow. Whoa, cool! Oh my god, this is so freaking sick. I love Aaron Kai's work. It's very colorful,
psychedelic, and shroomy. Can't wait to hang this up somewhere. This is so beautiful. Thank you so much, you guys. And I also have one last gift. This is from Rebecca. We already framed it on the wall but it is a photo that she
took at our engagement party and it is amazing. It finally replaced the Flying Lotus flyer that I've had since college. So this is a lot more sentimental. So thank you so much, Becca! And then we also got a ton of alcohol so we're pretty much
stashed for, you know, probably end of the year (laughs). So Ben went grocery shopping today and he brought back something
that we normally don't have in the cabinet. He got a wild card item which are Everything Bagels. And I haven't had a bagel, well, I haven't had bagels in the
house since I was like a kid. Actually like got too
excited and I ate half of it while it was still cold. For tonight's menu, Ben
is making shrimp tacos! - Very excited about this. Usually we do it with tilapia fish. Shrimp today. We got some guac, we got
some yogurts and sriracha. Cabbage and cilantro. - And a glass of white wine. How many avocados did
you use for the guac? - One. - Wow. Bang for your buck, huh? - Bang for your buck. (mumbles) like the yogurt but let's see. We got so many sauces so
there's some sriracha here. I put it in the sauce as well. - I'm pretty sure this
is the perfect amount. This is the finished shrimp taco. (laughs) (mumbles) (calm music) Okay. (audio fast-forwarding) Hi, Cheeki. Oh my god. Look what just came in the mail. This is from Ashley and Vanan. And this is the biggest bouquet
of flowers I've ever seen in my entire life. Jesus. It's so big! So on top, there's a giant bouquet and underneath there's
like this water tank with orchids inside and
then there's rocks and sand. And this is from my favorite
flower shop, The Empty Vase. It's Wednesday. I'm doing the exact same
thing as I did yesterday. Working. And yesterday Ben and I filmed
our Google Assistant video. I tried to vlog but that whole
video is a vlog in itself so that's why there's just a gap. Today I am just finishing
up the last touches. I am feeling good though because I am checking off
everything off my list. There's nothing more satisfying
than checking boxes off. I haven't been to the gym in a little bit so I'm kind of feeling
a little cabin fevery. Later on, I'm gonna go
get dinner with my family for my early birthday dinner. We're gonna have Korean food. What a shock! Honestly, my mom genuinely
doesn't like any other food besides Korean and that
just mind boggles me. She doesn't even like pizza. She likes spaghetti and steak. I took her to Boiling Point one time, which is like my favorite hot pot place. I was watching her eat the soup and it was just so underwhelming for her. And it's just freaking bizarre, man. I think it's because when she was a kid, she really didn't have anything
other than Korean food. But the thing is, even food
that I didn't eat growing up, I still like. For example, I didn't have Indian food until I was maybe 18. I didn't have dim sum until I was 19 and you know, that's obviously
one of my favorite foods. So I don't know. Maybe it's like a preference thing. What do you guys think? Is your favorite food
something that you grew up with or is it something that you
just had later on in your life? Alright, a little update. It is 2:00. I am going to the gym. It is the last thing I want to do. But I haven't been to
the gym in like five days and my brain could really
use some endorphins. And I know I really don't want to go but I know after I'm gonna feel amazing and I'm gonna wash my hair and I'm gonna have fresh hair for today. So let's go. I'm gonna bring this
little vlogging camera. Okay, I'm off. (calm music) (water running) Yeah. (sighs) I feel like a new woman. Oh my gosh, this is literally
the best feeling ever, how you feel after you take a shower. I'm just gonna get a wide tooth comb and I'm just gonna start brushing
my hair out a little bit. Just so it's not too tangled. Then I'm just gonna get It's
a 10 Miracle Leave In product. And I'm just gonna spray this all over. I just like this because it
doesn't get all over my hands and it's just super easy to use. I'm just gonna show you guys
what I do with my bangs. They're already so long. Don't kill me, Anna. My bangs are still a mystery to style. I'm just gonna let that calm down. The best drink in the world, La Croix. Oh my god, it's so good. I just got this new Charlotte
Tilbury eye shadow palette and it is gorgeous! It kind of just looks like-- Okay, thank god. I didn't want to dig my
nail into the shadows like I did with the
Fenty Beauty highlighter. I didn't. They even categorized the
different eye shadow looks that you can do, so this
one is day eye, dusk eye, date eye, and disco eye. I don't know what is
calling my name though. I think I'm just gonna hop
around and see what happens. - [Cal] Does being exceptional require an exceptional amount of work? By Cal Newport of calnewport.com. - [Jenn] We are at Mr. Bossam. There's my brother James. Virgo season! Hi, Appa! - Hi. - [Jenn] There's Eomma. - Hi. - And then yours truly. - Hi, guys. Very happy. - We are here for my

some drinks after this with some friends, then
go away for the weekend. So lovely day. (calm music) (laughs) ♫ Happy birthday to you (cheering) - Okay, so this present is from (mumbles). - Cheeki got this one for Mummy. - Oh, you wrapped it so well, Cheeki. - Well done. (mumbles) the tape. (gasps) It's another Chippo. - It's another Chippo! Oh my god! She loves her. - [Ben] Chippo, right for the neck. Right for the neck.

must when you drive out of LA. - Pretty much every time we leave LA. - Always. - When you go in and out
of LA, go to In-N-Out. (calm music) - Alright, we made it to the
cabin, we're in Big Bear! And obviously this is even
better than the photos. It has such a nice rustic cabin vibe. It's crazy that this is
only two hours away from LA. It's insane. But I'm so excited! Let me show you around
before everybody gets here. This is the kitchen area, lots of seating options for people. Let's head outside. What do we got here? - I made it in my very first try. - [Jenn] Really? - Yeah, I was like "Oh, shit!" Nobody saw that. - [Ben] Get it. - [Jenn] Aww. Aww. - And then the creepy... - [Jenn] Oh, shed? That's Stephanie's room. (laughs) Just kidding. What's in it? - I didn't even walk in. - [Jenn] I bet it's floaties. (growls) (shrieks) - Oh god! Oh my god. - So everyone finally made it. - Cheers, everybody.

Yeah, it's really nice. - So we just finished our hike. We climbed on so many rocks today. - Yeah. - Good job, good job, good job. Hi, everybody! It is Wednesday. It has been several days since
I last picked up the camera. I came back from Big
Bear, I guess on Sunday, and I had such an incredible time there. I didn't vlog too much. I think some people got
like bits and pieces but I wasn't doing like my normal vlogging because I just wanted to go
over there, unplug, unwind, and just be with the
closest people in my life. When I came back from the mountain, I was just, I don't know about you guys, but after like a big, big fun trip, when you come home you're
just kind of like (sighs). Like you're just sad that it's all over. So I think I was just
kind of decompressing and just coming to terms that it's over. I was looking forward to
this trip this entire month. But yeah, that was one of
the best birthdays of my life and it was nice. It was very intimate and it
was nice to just get away from the city. Today, Ben and I are heading to the beach. I just wanted to have
like a really chill day because I feel like the past year, I have been constantly on the go. And so I just kind of wanted
something fun and relaxing and serene. I haven't been to an LA
beach this entire summer so I thought that, I don't know,
might as well squeeze it in during this month before it gets too cold. We are taking Cheeki and it's
gonna be really exciting. I just cut up some Korean pears and I'm just gonna get ready. (calm music) We are at the dog beach. - Rosie's Dog Beach in Long Beach. - [Jenn] (laughs) Rosie's
Dog Beach in Long Beach. - It's our first time here. It's really nice. We wanted to have a nice
date day, go to the beach, and this is the closest one to us that dogs are allowed. (calm music) (waves splashing) - Brought this book to the beach. It's called Death Note. Hey, everybody. This is as recent as you'll see me. I'm about to add this clip
in and then export the video. So I just wanted to pop in
and thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys have a
wonderful rest of your Sunday and I'll see you guys
in the comments section. Bye! (kisses) (calm music) 
- Oh my God, I can't
believe it's already time for you guys to start
heading back to class. I know it's really depressing
that summer break is over, but you know, starting a brand-new year in college is actually pretty exciting. It's a chance for you to
reset and start fresh, and in this video I've styled five outfits that I would march into my classrooms. If you enjoy Lookbooks,
hit that subscribe button so you don't miss a single video, and with that said, let's
get started with Monday. The first day of school always
gave my stomach butterflies. It's generally a chill
day where the professor just hands out the
syllabus, and you get just get a feel of who's in your class. That's why I went for this casual look that still feels put together. I'm wearing this thin, patterned blouse, and tucked it into these
sequined denim shorts. Then I slipped into my comfy suede Mules to tie in the blue hues of the look. (upbeat music) Moving on over to my Tuesday look, I went for something a
little bit more moody. I'm wearing this
all-black number but added a splash of color with
my Dead Kennedys tee. I love rocking band tees,
because if someone loves a band too, then you guys already
have something in common and it's an instant connection. To spice it up, I've added
this interesting lace top underneath to layer, then
I streamlined the look with my black skinnies and black boots. (upbeat music) Yay, it's hump day, and I'm wearing the most comfortable outfit of them all. I'm rocking my big old
checkered top from Japan, and I chose to go pantless. Wearing huge shirts as dresses
is like my guilty pleasure on days where I literally can't be bothered to make an effort. I put on fishnet stockings
to add a nice texture to the look, and then
slipped into my favorite sneakers of the moment. (upbeat music) This is my Thursday look and quite possibly my
favorite outfit of them all. I'm wearing these sick
custom overalls by Kaemi. And these illustrations are
hand-painted by the Aaron Kei, and I just love the
little details he added. I feel like it really
spruces the overalls up and gives them new life. Underneath, I wore this
beige turtleneck top from American Apparel, and then carried on with my Vans from the previous look. (upbeat music) It's finally Friday, and I saved the most polished outfit for the last. I'm channeling my inner
Gossip Girl with this outfit, and I'm just loving
how scholarly it looks. I picked out this cream satin blouse with these amazing ribbons on the sleeves, and then paired it with this
tartan skirt from Related. (upbeat music) So that is a wrap on my
back-to-school Lookbook. This is definitely geared
for the college student, so if you're in high school
and you have a dress code, I'm sorry, just pick and
choose what works for you. These videos are meant to
be a source of inspiration, not just like a carbon copy. So if you can't wear shorts, definitely wear something that's longer. If you can't wear sleeveless tops, wear something with sleeves. Just, you know, adhere
to what works for you and what you need to do. I just wanted to emphasize the beauty of dressing up for yourself. Every time I upload these
like back-to-school Lookbooks, I get like a handful of
comments of people saying like, who wears that to schoo? Or why do you look so dressed up? It's a choice, and when
I was going to college, and even in high school,
I loved dressing up. I realize that when I feel
confident in my outfit, I feel confident in my classroom. And feeling good and
comfortable in the classroom is what really helps
you absorb information. And for me, that was to
feel good about my outfit. A lot of people are
scared to truly wear what they wanna wear because
they care what other people think about them, and I
know it's like a tough pill to swallow, but the sooner
you wear whatever you wanna wear, the easier it becomes. Remember, college is
such an exciting time. I know it's easier for me to
say because I'm already done. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Please write in the comments
which outfit was your favorite. And let me know when you
guys start school, too. I feel like everyone
starts at different times, but it's like generally, end of August to end of September. So good luck with your studies, work hard, absorb as much as you can
and learn as much as you can. Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. School, studying, knowledge. ♫ Ooh-Ooh-Ooh, it's something ♫ You and I 
(upbeat electronic music) - Hi everybody. - Hi guys. - Welcome back to the channel. Here I am with a lovely guest here. - It's me. - We're back because we gotta finish off the styling challenge. And previously on styling
couples challenge, Ben put me in clothes that he thought would look good and he did a really great job (laughs). - He thought a good... No one else did. - Really, no. Ben did an amazing job. If you haven't seen that video, I'll put it in the cards,
please go check it out. But today, we are switching
the tables around. - I'm much more happy
about this way around. I get clothes and I don't have to have that stress of trying to find it. And I'm excited to see what you, I think you've got good taste. - Well thank you.
- I think you know what, - You've had to deal with
me struggling to find anything I like so you get
to have a struggle today. - He's very picky, so... - I am. - We'll see what we find. I'm gonna get him four outfits. First is everyday Ben, which
is a casual little look. Number two is lads night out. This is, you know, all the
boys goin' out together. The third look is the date night look, so something a little bit more polished and kind of swanky.
- Yeah. - And the last one is a wildcard. So I get to put him in
whatever thing I want. So now I'm going to go to just like a little shopping area
and try and find some clothes for this man over here. - Thank you. (upbeat electronic music) - [Ben] Um, excuse me
Jenn what are here for? - You know, maybe for the wildcard? I look like chic. (laughing) (upbeat electronic music) Last stop is Urban Outfitters. We're gonna get most the basics here and also the wildcard. - [Ben] Oh. (upbeat electronic music) - One for Be, one for me. (laughing) Alright, we are back from shopping and I must say it's a very
good season for Ben right now. There's a lot of good stuff in the shops. So, I think you should
get into everyday Ben. - Do this.
- First look. - This is really nice. I don't have to change for once. - I like it.
- Oh my gosh. - Have you ever seen...
- Hey gus. - this much color on Ben? - I haven't. - This looks incredible. - I actually really like it. - Ben is actually pretty
bold with patterns but it has to be the right pattern and I thought that this
floral print was perfect. - [Ben] Zara, right? - Yeah, this is Zara.
- Nice. - [Jenn] The pants are from
Urban, the shoes are from Silas. - [Ben] Adidas. - Adidas, yeah.
- And Silas. - And the crew.
- Exactly. - Yeah, I'm very happy. I think out of 10, I shall give this a, I'll give this a nine actually. - A nine? - Yeah.
- Holy crap! - You know obviously I'm gonna be nice, it's Jenn and stuff anyway. But no, I do really like it. You didn't go with a safe option. I think everyone would be annoyed to see I've got black jeans and a black t-shirt. (laughing) - Yeah, I like it, nine out of 10. Good job. - So the next outfit is
going to be lads night. - Right
- Oooh. - Well for starts I feel very comfortable. - What a stud. - I like, oh? (laughing) - [Jenn] I wanted to put
Ben in an outfit that he would feel comfortable just hanging out with the lads so
that's why I put him in kind of like a all black
slash gray ensemble. I absolutely love this coat.
- Me too. - [Jenn] This is from The Kooples. It's got this really cool
quilted detail on the lapels. I feel like with Ben,
there's not too many options for accessories so you gotta
throw 'em on the pants, next is, they're like
an advanced jogger pant. - [Ben] Smart casual. - [Jenn] I think the shoes work though. - I love the shoes, yeah.
- It's like a nice... - [Jenn] Like, leather material. - It's nice, smart,
especially for lads night. You gotta think about logistics. You know, you got pants,
you're going for some drinks, "oh no, your wallet's safe." Black t-shirt I think just
ties it in with the outfit and again, if you're
out, you know the guys spill a drink on you...
- True. - No problem. - So what would you give this out of 10? - Ooh, you guys are gonna annoy me so, I'm gonna have to do nine again. - Nine?
- Yeah. - What's the one point? - I think I can't give a 10 just because there's quite a lot of black and... - Oh okay, that's a good point. Yes. - Just for you being kind
of fishing out there, this is great. I would definitely buy one of this easily in the shop, so thank you babe (laughs). - Nice, yeah. Well it looks incredible. I feel like we can go on a date right now. - Alright. - Look, we're ready. - Let's do it. (laughing) - Alright, so now let's
get you changed into the actual date night outfit. (hand clasps) - Oh.
- Oooh. - Oh la la. - Hey guys. - Ready for date night, eh? - I feel very ready for date night. - Yeah, you look very smart. I know girls have all the options of like skirts, dresses, et cetera. A man's item that really
shines through is outerwear. By far. I absolutely love this coat. I's long, it is in this
cool hounds tooth pattern. It's got this cool pin on the lapel and I just paired it
with a white crisp top that he already had in his closet. And then for bottoms,
he's wearing these really comfy lounge pants but they
still look quite smart. - [Ben] I like that it's quite
an English looking outfit. - [Jen] Yeah. - The Doc Martins with this kind of, especially the long coat you know, I really want to wear this
when I go hack in London. "Oh hi mate." - It's in like this kinda stiff material. So that if something spills, I feel like it would repel off or something. - Should be fine. Yeah, I'm very happy. I think I would give this, I have to give it a nine again. - Nine?
- I know. - Okay, alright. - Well I think my point
is, I would give it a 10 purely just because of the coat. - Oh. - You know like, and that's so I couldn't be happier about that. And everything else you paired nice but again, there's not too much color, so I think you dropped a point there. - Okay, well you're looking
incredible, very dapper, but now it is time for the wildcard! So go change into
- Oh. - The little fun little
number that I got you. - Ah, see you guys in a sec. Sorry in advance. (Jenn laughing) - Oh my gosh. - Hey guys. - This is the first time I've
ever seen you in overalls. - This is the first time I've
ever seen me in overalls. Palm trees, what are
these little goin' on? - I know, these patches are
just, I know, Chippo approves. - He likes it (laughing). - So I wanted to find Ben the trendiest male fashion trend
that's goin' on right now and I would probably say overalls? I don't see it very often
but Urban Outfitters - So many options.
- There's so many options - For overalls, if you're
looking for overalls, head over there. - Checkered, if you want like... - Plaid, black navy...
- Anything, anything you want. - So I went ahead and
found this patches one. The thing is, I would wear these overalls. - They're awfully comfortable. - Yeah, oh my God (laughs). There's like a nautical star, checkered... - Checked lightning there. - Flags, yeah it's...
- Everything you need. - So what do you think? - I don't hate it but I don't like it. - Yeah, the thing is if you
picked this out yourself, I wouldn't stop you, I'd be like "okay, if you really
like the way that looks." - Really, really want this (laughs). - No, I mean I wouldn't, I would just been "oh, Ben's been more adventurous." - I'd be down to try a pair that, you know, didn't have all
this nonsense all over it. But again, you know if you
like it, you like it, you know? - It's kind of farmer-like. But it's like street style farmer. Alright, so let's go, let's go out! - Let's go show..
- Alright. - Let's go paint the town red.
- Oh for God's sake. - I'm ready. (upbeat electronic music) - Alright guys, that is
a wrap on the outfits. I would say I did a pretty good job! - A great... - But you guys let me know how I did in the comments down below. I mean, I got straight
nines across the board. - Just try to remind them. - I know I am. - Don't be that mean because, you know, I did get straight nines. (laughing) - 27 out of 30. (laughing) If you'd like to see more styling videos, please write it down in
the comments down below. We'd love to hear what
you guys have to say. Also before we left, we have a
really exciting announcement. Actually Ben has a really
exciting announcement. - I do, I just started a YouTube channel. It's been something...
- Woo hoo. - I've wanted to do for awhile and I wasn't sure what
I wanted it to be about and I was trying to
think what I could offer, what I feel like I'm
okay at and my positivity is something that I wanted
to spread and kind of have a channel would like
give good advice about tryin' to be the best
version of ourselves. But it's got a bit of a twist to it. Some comedy. I've doin' some videos
where I clone myself as the alter ego and
there's two of me talking. It's really hard to explain so you just gotta watch it, really. - Yeah, you just have to
go see it for yourself. - Just go and watch it. - Ben has been working so hard on it and I'm so proud of him
so please go subscribe, show him some love and, yeah, let him know what you guys think. - Yet, be nice. I always say please...
- Be nice. (laughing) - Alright, I want to thank
you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one. - Bye guys. - Bye. (upbeat electronic music) 
(soft music) (upbeat music) - Hello, welcome to our beautiful room. (upbeat music) Good morning. I have ordered the Thai omelet. Ben got the-- - English breakfast.
- English breakfast. - Yeah, we are very
happy people right now. I mean, look at this place. - These chilis will be the death of me. I freaking love these tiny little chilis. They're so hot. Hello, everybody, today is Day One. We landed this morning, around three a.m., and surprisingly I feel pretty fresh. I slept pretty much the
entire plane ride here. So I'm feeling pretty good. Ben and I are here with Revolve, and it feels so crazy to just
start out 2017 like this. This is incredible. So far, I have already had
breakfast, I went to the gym. Today is our free day, so
we pretty much get to do whatever we want, and
then we have a dinner later on tonight. So this feels really
good, I'm not gonna lie. I feel so happy to be here. (upbeat music) Hello, we are here in the Night Market. Decided to grab some nibbles,
some souvenirs perhaps. - [Ben] Ohhhh. (upbeat music) - Good morning, another
day, another breakfast. I got the Thai stuffed omelet again, and Ben got the two eggs any style. And we are currently in the bus to go to a boat. - Boat day. - Yeah, it's boat day. - That's all we know. It's gonna be hot. I'm gonna be very burned by
the next time you see me. But it's gonna be fun, right? - Yeah, it's gonna be really great. I'm really excited to see the ocean. We made it. (upbeat music) Delicious. (upbeat music) (cheering) (upbeat music) Good morning. All right, for breakfast today, we've got some avocado
toast, a fruit platter, and then Ben got two eggs any style. - And more fruit. - [Jenn] And more fruit. - And coffee and bread. A little bit delicate today, after a pretty incredible
day yesterday on the boat. - Today, we are going to
the elephant sanctuary. That'll be really cool. A lotta of the elephant rides
that are here in Thailand, a lot of the elephants
are actually abused, so we wanted to make it a point that we weren't
participating in that at all. So we still do want to see the elephants, but we're gonna go check
them out in the sanctuary. - But first, brekkies. - So we are on the floor now. I am just finishing up getting ready. A lot of you guys were wondering how I did this hairstyle here. It's kind of very old
Hollywood, glamour curls. So these curls are very simple. All you need is a curling wand. This is my trusty one from
ConAir, it's the Ucurl. I've had this since college, and so you're just gonna wrap
your hair all around the wand. Hold it for five seconds. And then let it cup into your hand, and you hold it here for another like five to eight seconds. The longer you cup the curl,
the more springy it is. So it looks kind of crazy right now, but it's gonna drop, and
since it's so humid outside, these curls are gonna drop like crazy. So by the time we're outside, it's gonna look very natural,
and just kind of effortless. And you just need to curl all your hair in the same direction,
and that's pretty much it. All right, hair is done, and now I'm going to apply this. Superpower sunscreen mousse. It's got SPF 50, and I love it. It's kind of like a shaving cream. Okay. It doesn't smell like sunscreen. I mean, it kinda does. But it doesn't have that
quintessential cool smell, which is nice. I actually got kind of a
tan yesterday on the boat. So gonna try and even out these lines. So this is my outfit today. I am wearing a bright yellow
dress from Privacy Please. It's just a little easy breezy little guy. (upbeat music) All right, so here we are
at the elephant sanctuary. - I'm very excited. - I know, we already saw three elephants, and we're about to get
closer to one, so woo-hoo. - And the good thing about this place, it's like a retirement home for elephants that have been abused or
have been through stuff. So it's like they're treated really well and it's just a beautiful place for them. And there's an elephant just there. - Oh my gosh, speaking of elephants. (upbeat music) (laughing) (upbeat music) I did it. All right, so this is our
dinner situation right now. Dinner by the seaside. Wow. This looks so delicious. Look at that. (upbeat music) We are here at Baba Beach Club. Maybe like a 45-minute drive out, but we got our coconut,
we've got a beautiful pool in the back, check it out. (upbeat music) ♪ Ooh, baby, baby, baby ♪ ♪ Ohhh ♪ ♪ Oooh baby, baby, baby ♪ ♪ But now we're back to stay ♪ ♪ Ohhh. ♪ ♪ Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby ♪ ♪ Ohhh ♪ - Hello, everybody, today is the last day of the Thailand trip, I'm so sad. It's already over. I feel like it's been the quickest five or six days of my life. It's insane. Today, we are doing yacht day. I didn't know what would top boat day, but today we are on this incredible yacht. It is absolutely massive. There are three stories on this yacht. And it's been incredible. We are going island hopping today. We're gonna have lunch
on one of the islands, and then I think we're
gonna some sightseeing. (upbeat music) All right, we are hopping
to an island right now. Check it out. Okay, look at that. This way. (laughing) (upbeat music) All right, we are at our first island. This is Khai Nok Island, and it is so beautiful here. What do you feel about this
island so far, first impression? - It's bloody lovely. It's very nice, it's lots of activities, it's lots of options to do things. We got a little dinghy
over here, then lunch. - Yes. - Koh Island. (upbeat music) - We are at Kanoa Island,
the correct island for lunch. We have a lobster thing, and Adam's really excited. We've got everything, we've got coconuts, we've got seafood, we've got Thai food, we've got everything. - [Ben] And we've got Kelsy. - Yay! (upbeat music) - Hello, everybody, today
is our final day in Phuket. We're leaving back to the
United States in a couple hours. Our flight is at six p.m., and got a couple hours left. We've had a really relaxing
and peaceful morning. We had breakfast at the lobby. It was really beautiful. I had another Thai stuffed omelet. That has been my gem here. That and the sliced Thai chilis, That has been delicious. It's so spicy, but it
doesn't give me heartburn, so I think I found my
perfect fit for me, honestly. This trip has been so incredible. I wanted to share with your guys a couple of my favorite moments. First was being on the boat with Ben. We were laying down on the sun beds, and I was just looking up at the sky. The wind was rushing around, and it just made me realize, it just made it more
aware that I was on a boat in the middle of the ocean in Thailand, and it was just a really
surreal moment for me. Also, the elephant
sanctuary was incredible. Do you have any words to say
about the elephant industry? - A certain amount of awareness
for how bad the trade is and how elephants are treated, yeah. - And how they're treated in
the industry, it's horrible. Whenever you see an elephant
that is forced to paint or do tricks, please know that the elephants were
tortured for a long time in order for them to be
domesticated and lose their spirit. - Yeah, they literally
break them down until they, they wanna give up, and
that's when they have the power over them, and
it was so sad to see, but at the same time
it's so nice to see there are sanctuaries like the one we went to where they actually bring
in abused and elderly and disabled elephants, blind elephants and let them live the rest
of their life like freely and happily. So that was really nice, very inspiring, very emotional to see that. It was unbelievable experience, wasn't it? - Yeah, we got to feed them too. - Just hang out with them. - I know, chicaburs and bananas, but yeah, that was really incredible. - Yeah, that was amazing. But this trip has been so good. - But yeah, even though the
trip's coming to an end, I am very excited to go home as well. We get to see Chickie! I'm so excited. It'll just be nice to
be at our home again, get in a little routine. By the way, I'm gonna pack up and get ready to go to the airport. (upbeat music) 
(uptempo music) - Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn, and once again, the time has come to send another month off into the past. This time it's the month of May, and as usual, I've gathered my favorite products and items to share with you, and also, if you're not subscribed to my channel already, please do. The button is somewhere down below, and with that said, let's
get this video started. I need to feature my
Vans platform sneakers. I feel like everyone and their moms are going through a Vans phase, but honestly, I'm not mad at that. These shows are just
undeniably comfortable. They're effortlessly cool, and these have become my everyday shoe. I personally love these shoes because they still have a little platform. They give me an extra inch,
and me being a shorty, I can use all the height I can get. I'm currently in the process of creating my top favorite books of all-time video, and I know that's highly requested, but before I filmed it,
I wanted to make sure that I reread every book on
that list and to save time, I'm so happy that I've
partnered with Audible because instead of rereading
every single book on the list, I can listen to them as audio books, and if you don't know
what Audible is by now, it's a service where you can listen to just like a massive
library of audio books. There's radio, there's
news, like the list goes on, but one audio book that I finished is The Picture of Dorian
Gray by Oscar Wilde. It's about an attractive
young man named Dorian Gray and he's this muse of this artist, and he's getting his portrait done. The artist is painting,
and he ends up befriending this person named Lord Henry
Wotton, and Lord Henry, he has a very interesting
philosophy in life. He just believes that people should just enjoy the pleasures in life. Dorian ends up getting very
inspired by this lifestyle and he ends up kind of picking it up, and so Dorian sells his soul
and he gets to look young and just have like, eternal youth, and he ends up just living it up. He does like, the craziest stuff, and he just has this nasty,
shallow, materialistic life, and every time he does something bad, his portrait kind of shows like, a flaw. It gets more and more
disgusting and it deteriorates and it just kind of reflects
how he actually is as a person. I remember reading this
book for the first time when I was 19 and it just really
radically changed my life. Honestly, it was a little tempting just to kind of like, live it up and kind of see the beauty
in just being spontaneous and doing what you want
and doing things for you, but obviously that
lifestyle isn't sustainable. You can't just be a selfish prick, and if you guys are
interested in reading it, Audible is having a free 30 day trial. All you gotta do is go on
Audible.com/clothes, check it out. Honestly, Audible has
such an amazing library. They've got so many
different types of choices. They've got business, self
improvement, the classics, I don't know, erotica, like everything. My next favorite is a pair of sunglasses. These are from Perverse, and I have just been obsessed
with the way they look. They're nice and oversized so I can rock them on no makeup days. My requirement is that
the sunglasses can cover the eyebrows, so, see, it's totally fine. So these are great for
just running out the door and there's just like a
nice chic element about it. I think it's probably the cat eye. Even though most cat eye frames are pretty difficult to pull off, these are great because
they're on the larger side, so they really suit
any type of face shape, and lastly, when I wear
these sunglasses and I smile, my cheeks don't touch
the bottom of the frame, and that's good. That's like, a requirement
for all my sunglasses to not touch my cheeks,
so these pass the test. So now I'm gonna move
onto a skincare item. Last month I tried a new eye cream. This is Korres' Black Pine Eye Serum, and let me just talk
about the packaging first. I know that doesn't have to
do with the actual formula, but let me just talk about this, because this is so innovative to me. So, what you do is you just click the back and it distributes the
perfect amount of eye serum onto each eye, and I enjoy the precision because for a lot of eye
creams when they're in the tub, I end up just putting
way too much on each eye, so it's nice that this is already pre-portion controlled for you. And now about the actual formula, I really like it because it's quite thin. It's definitely a serum
instead of a cream, so I feel like my skin
really drinks it up. Also, on the directions it says to put it on your eyelid as well, so that's like a first for me, because for most eye creams
they say to only put it on, like, the bottom area,
like your under eyes, so I like the fact that
it's going on top though because I'm pretty sure
that the top of the eyelid will start to sag, as well, so I want like, to put product on there. I feel like I'm always
kind of hopping around different eye creams, but I think I'm gonna stick with this one for now because I'm really diggin' it. Next up, I've got a lip color. This is called Tryst by Urban Decay, and this is part of their
Vice Liquid Lipstick line, and this was actually
a very unexpected find, so I filmed a truth or
dare challenge video with my girls Waley and Sophia, and one of the dares we did
was to put liquid lipstick on each other using our
mouths and this was just like, a random color that I kind
of found in the drawer, and I ended up just loving it
when Sophia applied it to me, and it's just been on
my lips ever since then. This is just a really flashy fuschia shade that I think is great to rock on days where my eye makeup is a
little bit more subdued. I feel like it just really
enhances the whole makeup look. My next favorite is a beauty tool. This is a lash applicator by Velour and I have no idea where
this has been all my life. This has changed the falsies game for me. Prior to using this, I was just like, using tweezers and I
thought that was fine, and even if my lashes and my falsies weren't completely aligned,
I just dealt with it. With this, that is not an issue anymore. You pick up the lashes
with precision with this and you just can align it so perfectly onto the like, the band, and once the falsies and
the lashes are together, you just kind of squeeze this tool and it just melds the lash
and the falsies so perfectly. Like, this is just a must
if you're doing falsies. Like, I don't know why I
didn't use this before, but now I know. My last favorite is a TV show, and I wanna thank you guys
for recommending it to me. You wrote a bunch of comments
in my last favorites video and I wouldn't have watched
it without you guys, so thank you for putting it on my radar. It's called The Handmaid's Tale, and this is actually a show based on one of my favorite
novels and I had no idea they were gonna make it into a TV show, and honestly, I was a little
skeptical before watching because most of the time, book to like, film slash like TV adaptations, they're always like, pretty bad, because I feel like nothing
is as thorough as the book. Not with this case. Like, I really, really like the
way they're going with this. It takes place in the
future and it's a dystopia and women in the United States have completely lost their rights. They're not even allowed to read, and all these women are divided
into different categories, like there are wives, there are handmaids, and there are aunts, but this story follows
a handmaid named Offered and a handmaid is someone
who is like a concubine, so the handmaid has to have sex with the commander every month. She's forced to have sex with
him while the wife is there, and it's just a very freaky transaction but this is the best
solution they came up with because the birth rates are so low. Like, it's a long storyline, but I swear, it's very interesting, and like, I really like
the way the show is going because it's going beyond
the book, which I appreciate, so yeah, it's on every Wednesday. It's on Hulu, and this is
the first time in a long time I've been very excited
for each new episode, so I highly recommend it
and you should watch it. All right, that concludes my
May favorites for this month. As always, please write
your recommendations in the comments down below. I really love it when that
section becomes, like, an open discussion for
inspiration and ideas, and by the time you are watching this, I will be moving out of my apartment, so this is gonna be the last
time you see this little setup. Well, you're gonna see the furniture, but it'll just be shifted differently. I'm gonna really miss this apartment and hopefully this will be my last move in a very, very, very long time. Yeah, I'll tell you more about that later. I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (uptempo music)

to vocalize how you're feeling in the political sphere because people get very very offended people write you off I've been getting some comments a handful of comments saying that I don't even have a right to March because of my mistake in the last election and I don't think that's fair because everyone learns at different times and at least I'm doing something about it as opposed to continue feeling apathetic about politics I'm I'm I'm researching I am participating in events that I believe in and I think that's a huge step and I want to thank everyone that has been super supportive and understanding and also sticking up for me I really really appreciate that anyway I am very excited to vote in the midterms next year don't you think that I forgot I sure as hell did it I just uploaded my Q&amp;A with Sarah it's going down really well a lot of you og subbies and and you subbies too are enjoying it which makes me super happy I will leave the video in a card on the side of the video so please open that I think later on the and Ben and I are going to be making dinner I think it's gonna be shepherd's pie something nice and English and perfect for this weather two cups is one pint [Music] look at that mom they finished fish pie hey guys it's probably not the best angle but Ashley and I just got back from a meeting and we're just having lunch at this place called all those doughnuts got a sandwich oh my goodness I'm at Graham's place guess what she's filming hoarders for an entire year I brought her to the garbage from my old place to here and it's been over a year why

while Ashley is out and chicky has some good company I could literally watch this for hours you guys I'm wearing this big jacket because I think it's been ingrained in my brain to not turn on the heater I I don't know it's just I don't know man it's just age and parents you're never supposed to turn on the air-conditioner and you're never supposed to turn on the heater just a deal with it by wearing more layers of clothes I should probably turn on the heater though because it is pretty chilly so right now I am writing the treatment for my January favorites video I just feel like I'm on a roll right now I think in December I I pre recorded a lot of things maybe and now I'm able to upload two videos a week so I'm feeling pretty good I'd only have much else to say to you guys there's no huge updates this die is going away slowly but surely it's minimizing I got I don't know if I told you guys this but when I went to the doctor they gave me this antibiotic ointment that I put in my eye so that's been that but it's been officially ten days since I haven't worn my makeup and to be truthful this lifestyle is really freeing like getting ready it literally takes me five minutes maybe six minutes because I just put some concealer on powder bronzer blush highlight okay when I say like that it sounds like a lot of steps brows but it's a lot quicker than I normally get ready and I get

(upbeat progressive music) Hey guys, it's your girl, Jenn, and for this video I've
partnered with Clinique to show you the Face of the Month. I'll be using their Beyond Perfecting Foundation + Concealer, and I'm just gonna sit down and do a little talk
through makeup tutorial. I don't do this very often, or ever, so I thought I would just
kind of switch things up. If you enjoy makeup tutorials make sure you subscribe to my channel, and if you'd like to see this look, then keep on watching. So here is my bare face. I tweeted out saying
that I was gonna do a Q&amp;A because I'm not the type of person who could just talk
without any guidelines. So, I thought I would just
simultaneously do my makeup and answer some questions. So let's start. First, I've got my primer. I'm using Tarte's Clean Slate
Timeless Smoothing Primer. Do you have any advice for
someone who lives in a small town so their fashion always seems so over the top compared to others? I feel like this is something that every fashion oriented person kind of struggles with,
especially in the beginning, because the more bold your
fashion choices become the more you stand out. And while I was going to college in Davis like the first couple of
weeks it was pretty daunting because Davis is a pretty
sleepy small farm college town, and I definitely stuck
out with my hell raisers and my five inch red platforms. But, it's only the first two
weeks that feel kind of weird, because after a while
people just get used to you and your eclectic style and
that just becomes the norm. It's just the first couple
of weeks that are awkward, but after that it's just smooth sailing. So now that primer is done I'm gonna go in with foundation. Here I'm using Clinique's
Beyond Perfecting Foundation + Concealer. This will look familiar, because I put this in my March favorites. I love this foundation. I've been using this for
a couple of months now, and it's awesome. It's only $28, and I love the applicator. Something about a doe foot applicator just always gets to me. It looks like a cute little animal foot. It's so cute. This applicator makes it really easy to put as much foundation
or as little as you want. You really have control
on how much you wanna put. So see, the applicator just
makes it really precise on exactly where you wanna apply it. And this is a full coverage foundation, but I just use as much as I need. So I can go with a light
hand or a heavy hand depending on what kind
of look I'm going for. Today I think I'm just
gonna do a light layer because I just want something fresh, and my skin is behaving, so I'm not gonna do too
much to cover that up. It's really great, because I don't have to
use a separate concealer because this foundation doubles as one, so it's like a two in one
product, which is awesome. So I finished the first layer, and now I'm gonna go in again and I'm just gonna really
target my under eyes. I know with some foundations you really have to rush
on blending quickly because it just dries too fast, but I really like that you
can take your time with this and blend at your leisure. Alright, so I'm pretty much
done blending this out. It's got like a nice,
natural, matte finish, but it's not caky whatsoever. So now that it's all blended
I'm going to set that with a translucent powder. This is by Laura Mercier. And then with my beauty blender I'm just gonna grab the product and I'm just gonna set it
like underneath my eyes, around these smile lines, and then a little bit on the forehead. And then I'll grab a big fluffy brush and then just kind of
wipe the powder away. Now it is time for the brows, and I'm using this brow pencil by Dior. And I'm also going to answer this question by beruru12. "How do you organize your schedule? "Do you have a planner? "If so, could you perhaps
make a video about it? "Love your work and best wishes." Thank you. I pretty much live off of
the calendar app on my phone. Literally the second I get a plan I'll just jot it down
onto my phone that second, because I know if I just
put it off and I don't do it then I'm just gonna completely forget. So I always say that the
mind is a terrible office, so the second that you have a plan write it down in your phone. Whether it's something digital or whether you have a hard
copy like a physical planner, just jot it down. It'll help you segment off
different projects you have. So for example, if I have
like a huge video project I like to space it out. One day I will brainstorm what
is gonna happen in the video, another day I'll flesh out
a full creative treatment, and then another day I'll just
do all the filming that day. Instead of just cramming it into one day I intersperse it into like a nice week. So that way I don't feel
too stressed and pressured when the due day actually comes, and that's exactly what I did for school. So habits from school are
definitely incorporated into my work life, which I think is cool. But yeah, it's better to
just space everything out then just feeling crammed and pressured to do everything all at once. I live off my happiness planner. Every night before I go to bed I schedule everything that
I need to do that day, things I'm excited about it, and it just gives my life
structure and balance, which I always appreciate. Man, talking while doing your
makeup is not an easy thing. I think this as good as my
brows are gonna look today. Let's move on to eye shadows now. I am using my Jenn Ne Sais
Quoi ColourPop Palette. I've been meaning to
use Trois in a tutorial, so this is that day. Here's Trois. It's like a nice brick red, and I'm just going to
pop that all over my lid using a synthetic brush. The next question comes from Lauren. She asks, "What's the best
dish Ben has made for you? "And what's Ben's favorite dish of yours?" Lately he's been making this
delicious breaded chicken. Hoo, it is such a fire dish. He makes a breaded chicken
with a bit of mash, and it is just the most
succulent but crunchy thing ever. And his bolognese is
always a good one, too. He makes the best pasta. When Ben and I first moved
in, like the end of 2015, I was just gaining a bunch of weight because he just kept on
feeding me such delicious food. But now I've learned to
like kind of pace myself and portion control, but yeah, he's definitely an amazing cook. Alright, so I brought you
guys in a little closer so you can see the color on my lid. To blend it all out I'm using Deux, and this is just gonna
smoke everything out and make it look more seamless. As for my cooking, I feel like my cooking skills have deteriorated a little bit since Ben and I have been living together, but he always loves my dakdoritang. That's like my classic Korean
dish that I always made. It's just like a spicy
chicken potato dish. He also knows how to make it now, so he makes it better than
I do now at this point, which is kind of sad. I feel like Ben and I have a
pretty good system, though, because he'll cook and I'll
help like chop and stuff, and at the end I'll just wash up. So I like the system that we have now. I think we should just keep it. I'm not mad at that. Alright, so now I'm using Quatre. I feel like everyone always kills me for the pronunciation of this, I'm sorry. But this is four in
French, quatre, quatre. I'm trying. But this is just a dark brown, and I'm going to use that to
just really intensify the look. That's what dark colors do on the eyes. So I'm just gonna pop that right there. Not too much, because I still
want the red to show through. Okay, so I popped that into
the corners of my eyes. It looks a little messy now, but I'm gonna grab another blending brush. Blend out some more. And then I'm gonna go back in with Trois. I'm gonna get a flat dense brush. I'm gonna pop that onto the bottom lid just to give it a little
bit more dimension. I know reds can be a little
intimidating for the eyes, but I swear, as long as
it's like a nice brick red and you've got some dimension on the top I think it looks amazing. Now I'm grabbing Un and
I'm going to apply this right in the inner corners of the eyes just to kind of highlight this section. And then I'm gonna pop that
right on the brow bone. I'm pretty happy with the way this looks. I think we can move on
to the eyeliner now. Alright, for eyeliner, using the same old Kat Von D Tattoo Liner I'm gonna do a little flick. Sorry, I cannot talk for this bit. This requires too much concentration. (smooth jazz music) That's fine. Chugging ice coffee was not a
good idea before filming this. I'm just so shaky. Ooh, okay, cat eye is done. Now I'm gonna do a little bit of mascara. I'm using this one by Lancome. This is their Grandiose formula. And while I'm doing that I'm going to answer another question. This one is by Paola. "What's one of the most challenging things "about being a YouTube creator?" Ooh, this runs a little deep but I thought I would mention it because I think it's good to put some of this information out there. I think for me the most challenging part about being YouTuber is definitely the constant pressure to feel like you always need
to be evolving your content, always coming with something
fresh and different, especially at a high frequency, and I feel like this is what is expected in the arts and entertainment field, but as just one person it's a lot. And I feel like I've never truly taken a break from doing this. I've been doing this for seven years now, and it's, you know, there were times where I
definitely felt burnt out. I feel like the YouTube community has changed so drastically. There are a lot more people that are dumping content into this space, and I think it's amazing, but it's, the fear of being irrelevant
and being stale is real. And the way that I kind of was
able to not be so burnt out is by expanding my team. And so I've got my manager, Ashley, who helps negotiates all my deals, who manages timelines. I've got Don, my amazing graphic designer, so I don't have to stress about figuring out how to do
all this Photoshop stuff. I've got Ben, who is pretty much my in house videographer and photographer. And now I even get some help
from my friends at LR Creative who help me pump out some
really highly produced stuff that I wouldn't be able to film on my own. I just feel like YouTube isn't just a one person show anymore, and it hasn't been for a while. And if you choose to just handle all these projects on yourself, you are gonna drown and
you're gonna burn out. And so I'm learning that I
need to just expand my team, relinquish some control
over some of my projects, and just delegate these
tasks out to other people, and that's how you have a
good, functioning business. I also find it very difficult to separate myself from my work, because in the end my work is myself. So let's say a video doesn't do well, or people are nitpicking about something personal in my life, there are some days where
it really eats me up inside, and it hurts, because
I think people forget that we're just people, too. And on our bad days, it's really hard to separate work from myself. But in the end, it is what
comes with the territory, and the positives that
are in this career path totally outweigh any of the challenges. And every day I feel so
blessed to be able to do this, and I never ever forget that, and it's all because of you guys. You guys have blessed me
with this incredible life, and this is why I work
so hard for you guys. I try to put out content
that I would wanna see. I wanna just do my best for you guys, because you have transformed
my life in so many ways, and I never ever forget that. Everything has a pro,
everything has a con, but in the end I am living my dream job and there's no negative that I
can't overcome because of it. So I know we spent a bunch of time coating my lashes with this mascara, but I'm just gonna go in
with some falsies right now just for the top just to
give it a little boost. Alright, lashes are on and in full force. That's better. So we're gonna move onto contour. I'm using the Pony Palette in Marvelous. So while I'm contouring I'm
going to be answering this one, more light hearted question. This is from Esther Shiin. She asked (speaks foreign language). "What is your favorite katalk character?" My favorite character is definitely the little mushroom guy. I don't really know what he is or it is, but when he turns around the back of his head looks
like a but and he's so cute. I always use that guy. And I only use KakaoTalk with my parents, family members, and just
pretty much anyone in Korea. For blush, I'm using this little
peach guy in this pallette. Gonna pop that onto the
apples of my cheeks. And then for highlight I'm going in with this Stila Star Light
Star Bright Pallette. I'm going in with Kitten,
which is the one in the middle, and I'm just gonna give
myself some dewy skin. So this question comes
from Mel, and she asks, "How do you motivate yourself
to do better in every way?" I would say that my motivation has always kind of been inherently in me. I feel like this drive is in all of us, but it's just the actions you do to make this drive stronger. In my life I've always been
an action oriented person. If I see a problem I don't wait around for
someone else to do it. Like if I can do something about it, I will go ahead and do it myself. Maybe it's because I don't
really believe in plan Bs or I don't have something to fall back on that I just put 100%
in everything that I do because I don't see any other alternative. And even though my best may not be the best in
someone else's eyes, it's my personal best, and
that's all that I can do. And I think as long as you're improving, even like ever so slightly, whether it's personally,
professionally or emotionally, I think you're on the right track, and that is what motivates me. Okay, so I think we're pretty
good on the highlighter. For my lips I'm using ColourPop's Knotty, and this is a really nice nude. (smooth jazz music) Alright, nice. (smooth jazz music) Alright guys, so this is the finished look and also the Face of the Month. I hope you enjoyed this segment. I think it was quite refreshing to just kind of sit down
and talk with you guys and be a little bit more candid. If you guys enjoyed the video
please hit the Like button, and also feel free to leave me a question for the next Face of
the Month Q&amp;A segment. Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye, mwah! (smooth jazz music) 
(upbeat music) - Hello, everybody.
- Hello. - It is September 1st, Labor Day weekend. We're at her house and
she has a really fun drawer with snacks. - It's actually a bunch of
stuff that I got from Japan that I just never opened, so. It's a little old, but
it is sealed, right? - Okay, let's see the expiration date. March 2017!
- Oh! - Okay, that's fine.
- Okay, that works, yeah. - Whatever, whatever.
- That works. In a cool, dry environment. If there's anybody in Japan that knows these chips.
- Knows, what is that? - Wow. - Oh, I smell already. - You smell it? This smells like wood chips. (laughs)
Doesn't it? - Cheers. - Cheers. What are these? - It's like--
- Really bizarre. - It's like little, those
little ramen snacks but in circle formation. - The heat is slowly starting to build up. - Oh, it's building. - It is building.
- I can feel it. - I like it, you have to get to know it. (laughs) - What do you grade it? - Okay, out of five? One, two, three, go! (upbeat music) Hi, everybody, happy Saturday. Ben and I just finished the
B-roll for my August favorites. We got this new monopod, check this out. - Very happy with what I got.
- Yeah. Ben's been doing a lot of research on the best camera equipment and this is like a total game-changer. - It's good. You can really get in there, you can move it around and it's sturdy. Recommend it. - Ben has gotten our picnic
basket because today we are going to Echo Park Lake. And take Cheeki out and about, which should be nice.
- She's gonna love it. We were gonna go to the
beach but because it so hot and we might drive like an hour-and-a-half to get to a beach and then
Chippo might get too hot within, like, 20 minutes, so.
- Yeah, and also it's Labor Day Weekend,
- That's very true. - And it's probably the
busiest weekend of the year. - Yeah. - We're just gonna go somewhere close
- Park. - Yeah, going to the park. - [Ben] Just 100 fahrenheit
for the old park today. - [Jenn] All right, we
have the park shop here. - Done it, there's a lovely breeze. We found some shade, Chippo's happy. - [Jenn] Yeah, she is. - We've got some nice
sandwiches from Bottega Louie. It was only like a half-an-hour, out of the route.
- Detour. - Detour, so they better be good. Obviously. And there's some sour cream and onion. - [Jenn] Yum. (upbeat jazzy music) Go pee-pee. Wow, that's a long pee. Good girl. (upbeat jazzy music) So this is pretty much my daily breakfast. It is a low-carb tortilla
with one scrambled egg, a bunch of arugula, and,
of course, sriracha. - [Man] We're just starting
with the eyes open. Nice, soft focus. And then when you're ready, beginning in the usual way,
some nice, big, deep breaths. In through the nose and
out through the mouth. - So I just finished my meditation, I do this every morning for 20 minutes and right now I'm on patience. I finished two packs already. I finish self-esteem and
then that was for 30 days and then I did a stress package and that was another 30 days, and now I am on patience. There are so many other
packs that I want to finish. I think the next one I'm
going to do is change, appreciation, and then
creativity, happiness, anxiety, anger, there's
a whole medley of packs. And I'm on my 35th day. This should be longer but
when I was in Toronto, I skipped a day and
then I ruined my streak. I have meditated for a total of 23 hours, 77 sessions, and then my average time
is around 18 minutes. Overall I do feel a huge improvement and it's just something
that I've been really liking to incorporate in my daily routine. Today is Labor Day. I think I'm just gonna
take it super easy today, just gonna go to the gym
and then edit my video and then have dinner
with my friend Charlotte. Yesterday, I didn't get to vlog because my parents came over and they
basically helped me clean the entire house, it was so sweet. But before they came
and cleaned the house, Ben and I cleaned the house before. So we cleaned the house in order for them to clean our house. And now my house is so
clean, it feels so amazing. I feel so lucky that my parents live just, like, I don't know 30 minutes away. It's such a blessing. September is my favorite month because it is my birthday month. Okay, let's get going. (upbeat hip hop music) Get a man who can cook for you. Not just every once in a while, but every single day.
- Every day. Got some chicken drumsticks, some mash, and some sweet corn and peas. - Chippo doesn't that smell good? Today's workout was really good. I did some waist exercises from Cassey's little Instagram video. So, we'll see if we're sore tomorrow. That's, like, the, that's how I evaluate
how hard I worked out, if I'm sore the next day, you know? - It's the only pain you want to feel. - Yeah, right? - I'm not in pain today, that's a shame. - I know, like, goddamn. This is one of my favorite meals. - Jenn is a specialty on the mash. - Oh, that's tasty. You got to put this mustard in. - Either English or Dijon. I like Dijon in with mash, it just gives it a slightly
creamier mustard feel. And then just save the
English mustard for the side. - Exactly. - Think we'll have an early
lunch before the lunch. - Pre-lunch, yeah? Do I need anything more? I've done it again. - You've done it again. She's smashed it. - I mashed it. - She smashed the mash. - I smashed the mash. All right, lunch is served. I've got some of my favorite
condiments of all time. Tapatio and Colman's mustard. Oh my God. It's so good. Thank you! (upbeat jazzy music) You guys, here I am at
the Chaz Dean Salon, with the lovely Anna, of course. So, we're thinking if I
should get bangs or not and it's just escalating so quickly. I just did a poll on Twitter,
so we'll see what they say. Okay, 61%.
- See, you're winning! - All right.
- Chaz is doing it. - We did a poll, already, 61%. - [Chaz] They're saying
that you should do it? - Yeah, 61%. They said do it. Oh my God. I'm terrified. This is really happening you guys. - [Chaz] Ready? - Oh my God, I'm scared. (upbeat jazzy music) This is CeCe. I have bangs, you guys, I have bangs now. Hey, guys, so I am back home with Chepo. Hi. And I also have bangs. I haven't had bangs since I was 21. So, wow. That's like five years, that's nuts. So, yeah, they're back in full force and I really like the way they look. It's the change that I've been wanting because at first I
thought I was gonna cut it into a bob or something
or, like, an A-line. Do you want to leave? She's leaving. I thought I was gonna get,
like, an A-line cut but I don't know, I think bangs
are less of a commitment because they just grow
out so fast, so, yeah. I went for it and I'm super
happy with the way they look. I posted a photo on
Instagram, and, of course, because it's such a change, it's become a topic of discussion. But thank you to everyone
who was nice to me about it. Because at the end of the day, I'm the one who has to see them every single day. But, yeah, now I'm home and I'm just gonna get a couple of treatments done and then I'm gonna go celebrate
my brother's birthday. I'm so happy for him, he's 30 now. And we're gonna probably just celebrate by eating Korean food. That's, like, our
favorite way to celebrate any sort of event. I also wanted to thank everybody
for 2 million subscribers! I can't believe it. It's definitely been slow and steady but I'm so happy and grateful to have even reached this milestone. It's been insane, thank you guys so much. Ben's best friend from England is here. His name is Sam and he is gonna be spending the week with Ben and me. Ben is so happy. Right now he's at the Marina del Ray and they're doing, like, water sports and it makes me so happy that there's a person from home here
because he hasn't been back to England for,
like, almost two years. Okay, the battery is about to die, so I'll talk to you guys in a little bit! So I'm wrapping my brother's gift. I got him these Bose headphones. These are supposed to be
the best in the market and I thought that he would enjoy them. He is also a musician, so
if you guys have SoundCloud, please follow him at oh my muu. He's so talented and I think that these
headphones would be a good way for him to make more music, y'all. (upbeat jazzy music) Ta-da! In addition to headphones,
I'm also getting him a roundtrip ticket to
anywhere around the world. I'm just, like, putting it
on this little flash card. Because I thought that this
would be a really great way for us to spend time together. He also only turns 30 once, so, I wanted to get him something
really, really special. I'm gonna put it in this
card, which I got at Ralph's. It says, "Life is an
adventure, enjoy the ride." I thought it was very fitting,
so I'm gonna pop this in here and then we're all done! We're gonna head into some severe traffic. (upbeat music) Happy Birthday, James! - Oh, wait. - What is that? - Oh, nice! - [Jenn] It's from Ben and me! - Oh, what? - Round-trip ticket?
- Dude, are you serious? - [Jenn] Uh-huh! - Thank you, seriously.
- Of course. Happy birthday.
- Let's go together, then. - [Jenn] Yeah, let's go! Do you like the headphones? - Woah. (laughs) - [All] Happy Birthday, dear James-y. - He's just so close. - [All] Happy Birthday to you! (clapping) (upbeat jazzy music) - [Jenn] Having dinner
with my lovely friend. - Cheers. - [Jenn] Cheers. - [Stephanie] We also have
some zucchini noodles. - Hey, everybody, it
is Saturday afternoon. I'm just in the office
finishing up the video that I'm uploading tomorrow. It is gonna be the second
part of the August vlog. It's the footage where you
get to see my Eggie brunch and just, like, other
day-to-day activities. If you haven't seen it, I will
put it in the card section. Yeah, just trying to get as
much work done as possible because tonight Ben and I are
having our housewarming party. I know we've lived here
for several months now, but this is just a good time for us and a lot of people are around, so we thought we would have it today. Ben and Sam are currently
at the grocery store grabbing the snacks and just, like, other miscellaneous items
you need at a party. I just made sure that the house was clean. I vacuumed, I cleaned
the bathrooms, so, yeah. I'm excited to have everybody over. The food is prepared, or,
I guess, just the snacks. I like to make sure that
the guests are nicely fed. Chocolates, M&amp;Ms, sour patch
kids, birthday cake Oreos, the cheese and cracker
platter, got a veggie platter for those who are healthy,
got some chips and dip, my favorite, Hot Cheeto
Puffs, and the fries, yum. We got some cups where you peel that off and you can write your own name, so, it saves from not knowing
whose cup is whose and hopefully it'll reduce
the amount of plastic. We've got two handles
of Tito's and Jameson, the other handle is inside the freezer. And I've cut up some limes over here. Should I put a little
bit of Sprite in as well? - I think that's a lovely idea. Little bit of freshness. - [Sam] Yeah. - We're creating our own house cocktail. - Yeah, it's basically, our
favorite drink is vodka, soda, lime, just not too
sweet, nice and fresh, clear. But we love cucumber as well, it's a lovely little added touch. And we're gonna do some blueberries just to mix it up a little bit. - This is Sam, the guy
I was talking about. This is Ben's best friend from childhood. - Hello, everyone. (laughs) - We're very happy to have this guy here. - Yeah.
- He's the best. - He's been amazing to have. - You've been great hosts. - It's easy, you know. What have we done this trip,
we went to Santa Monica, to Venice, paddleboat, that's
why I got a little cut there. - Turns out paddling's quite hard. - Paddleboarding is quite hard
- When you do it in the ocean. - Especially when it's really wavy. (doorbell rings)
(dog barking) - Our first guest! (upbeat jazzy music) (overlapping chatter) 
(relaxed music) - Hey everyone, welcome back. Today, I'll be revealing
my skin care routine. I've partnered with SK-II to show you how I get
unready every single night. Also, if you're not subscribed, please do. The button is down below so hit that, join the family and let's get started. Right when I get home I
immediately take my makeup off, especially if I don't
have any plans after. So my first step is to
go in with a Simple wipe. These wipes are definitely
no stranger to you. I've been using them
for the past year or so and I think they're the best wipes ever. They're not scented, they're very gentle, and they do a great job moving that first layer of makeup off. Blech. You guys know that I double cleanse. I'm using an oldie, but a goodie, Origins' Checks and Balances face wash. I'll just take like a
little pea size amount and then I'll start
working that into my face. It's really thick,
creamy, and also gentle. Every night I need to wash my face twice because I just need to make sure that everything is off. Now that my face is squeaky clean it's time for toner. I'm using SK-II's Facial
Treatment Clear Lotion. I'll drop maybe three or four drops on a cotton round and I'll
use this to even my skin tone and level out my Ph balance on my face, and this step also removes
any traces of remaining makeup in case it wasn't annihilated
in the double cleanse. Now it's time for my holy grail item SK-II's Facial Treatment Essence. If you have been following
me for a while now then you know that I've
been using this twice a day for over three years now and I just feel like this
product is the secret weapon for my smooth skin. The magic ingredient here in pitera which has amazing anti-aging qualities that increases resilience to wrinkles. It keeps my skin luminous, firm, and it gives it a nice smooth texture. If I wanna treat myself that night or if I have a special event the next day, I'll pop on SK-II's Facial Treatment Mask. This mask is also on my holy grail list. So if your skin needs a pick me up or needs some luminosity,
pop this on for 20 minutes and your skin will be literally glowing after you take it off. You're just basically marinating your skin with pitera and the effects
are just incredible. My skin always feels so soft and radiant after I use it. Moving on to my next step, I go in with Kate Somerville's
Dermal Quench Liquid Lift, this is really fun to use because it comes in an aerosol can. So I'll just shake it, blast it on my hand and
then pat it into my skin. This just adds extra hydration to my face and just locks all the moisture in. For my night cream I'm using SK-II's Radical
New Age Power Cream. This has been the night cream that I've committed to
for the past year now. I just know that SK-II
products work really well with my skin and now that I'm very close to my late 20s it's really important to keep those wrinkles at bay. For eye cream I've been loving
Korres' Black Pine Eye Serum. I've read somewhere that you're supposed to put eye cream as your last step to your skin care routine, so that just kind of stuck with me, so that's what I do. For the final step I'll just go in with some Vaseline on my lips to keep them hydrated. I sleep with the AC on and
the air can be pretty drying so this keeps my lips from not cracking. So those were all the steps
of my skincare routine. If you're interested, SK-II is selling a Pitera Essence Set kit and it features three of
their best selling products, the clear lotion, the
essence and the mask. It values at $139 but
they're selling it for 99 so this is definitely the right time to try out some quality products. If you enjoyed this video

Completely beginner's luck, but I'm gonna try to do the same today and actually win it. - What's your tactic this year? - Just to try and remember how to play it and then that's about it. - Honestly I don't know
how to play either. My dad re-explains how to
play the game every year and that's how it works. - Yep. (upbeat music) - [Jennifer] So here is ddeok-kuk. This is my favorite soup. This is basically just a rice cake soup with dumplings, some meat, seaweed, egg My aunt did an amazing job with the spread.

It is Tuesday and I am freshly showered. I feel so amazing. This is probably one of my favorite things is clean hair, clean body
after a hard workout. The comfort and joy you seek is waiting and all you need to do
is pay attention to it. (chimes) Wow. - [Man] You just listened to the post titled A Little Guide
For More Comfort and Joy by Courtney Carver of bemarvelous.com, narrated by Jenn Im. (upbeat music) - [Friends] Yay. Happy new year, happy new year. Yay. - How was Redbird? - [Friend] It was so chill, guys. - What kind of music did they play? - [Friend] They were playing hip hop. - [Jennifer] Dressy ass shoes, I know. (laughing) That must feel so weird - [Amy] It is weird. - [Jennifer] Have your toes out. - [Amy] Yeah. - Oh my gosh. Good morning, it is Wednesday. Amy and I are heading into Pilates. It's gonna be really cold in the studio and it's locked. - [Amy] Go ahead. - [Jennifer] Thanks. - [Instructor] Punch punch punch punch, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10. Nine, eight, seven, six, five. - I would rather have this
be tighter and fitted. Cheeky has a visitor. They're so happy. As you saw, I had the Eggie team come over to my house for a fitting. This is for our fourth drop which is gonna happen around
music festival season, so I am so excited to
show you guys the pieces. A lot of the stuff needs some work, so I can't for everything to be perfect. I didn't get the vlog Angela and Leona but I work with them all the time, Angela especially, so... Leona is the lovely lady at Eggie who makes sure all the
measurements are correct and she sends it over to the manufacturers so that they can produce a
correct fitting prototype, and then we have Angela, of course, and she is my right hand woman. She helps me design everything for Eggie, and I freaking love her. She just gets me. As you guys know, I didn't
go to fashion school or I don't know how to sew or anything, so we work really closely together to create these designs for you guys. I'm heading out to Thailand tomorrow, so I'm gonna start packing. I don't have anything done, and then I'm gonna have
dinner with my friend Crystal and then we're gonna watch
our friend Kelly perform so quite a jam packed night. I'm gonna get some water. But first, I'm gonna pack. (upbeat music) Hello everybody, happy Monday. I am back in LA and it feels so amazing. I just got back from Thailand and I was gone for nine days, so it feels just, I don't know. I love traveling and I love being out but nothing feels as good as coming home. Right now I am on my way to the dentist. I'm gonna get my teeth cleaned. It has officially been six months since my last teeth cleaning so going back and hopefully there's nothing wrong. Last time I got x-rays and
I didn't have any cavities, so the Sonicare is really
working out for me. If you guys don't have an
electric toothbrush by now, I highly recommend it. I haven't had a cavity since that. Before, every time, I would
always go in to the dentist with at least something
that they had to fix, so yeah, after lunch. My mom is coming over with me. She volunteered to clean my house, and I'm gonna help her, obviously. I don't know if this is
just an Asian parent thing, but every time my parents come over, they are dying to vacuum, mop the floors, and all that stuff and it's
one of the perks, you know? Let me know in the comments down below if that's what your parents
do when they come visit you? But yeah, she has the day off. Today is Martin Luther King day, and I'm so happy it's being recognized. Martin Luther King did
so much for America, especially for freedom. He really paved the
way for all minorities, and if he didn't speak up or if he didn't have that dream and he didn't speak up, then we definitely would not
be here where we are now. (crowd chattering) Hi, Emma. Hi, Belle. I know, hi. Having lunch with
eomma (mom) and imo! (aunt) All right, so we just got back from lunch. My mom is over, helping
me clean the entire house. What did I do to deserve
such an amazing mom? Right now, Sam and Ben
are at a cafe working. Ben is currently working on
my Jenn goes to Phuket vlog and I'm so grateful because that day or that trip was a lot of footage, so there's a lot to get started on that, and I wanna have that
done as soon as possible. So yeah, while he's working on that, I'm gonna work on the house. I normally don't like
to call out the state of my office, but I
wanted to show you guys the before so... Here it is. It has not been this
messy in such a long time. But yeah, my luggage is still here. I gotta put everything away. I gotta open some packages, clean this desk up, and right now I'm waiting for my vacuum to finish recharging, but yeah, cleaning day! So the first rule that my
mom has when she's cleaning the house is that she likes
to open all the windows to get a good circulation in the house, so that is what I'm gonna do first. So I like to just take out all the stuff out of my luggage first and
then put my luggage away, so that way I have no
choice but to clean up everything on my floor or else it'll bother me like crazy. So now I like to put everything
in their little piles, so right now I've got products. We've got dirty clothes. I don't know why I put this
right in front of you guys. I got shoes. Clothes I wanna hang. Bathing suits and it just helps me keep organized when I put everything away, 'cause then I'll know
exactly where everything is. (speaking foreign language) (vacuum running) I love this salad. Hello. It is the next day. My office and the entire
house are completely clean. I wanted to show you guys the space. Look at all this floor. I love it. Oh yeah. I just feel so much more amazing when my place is clean because when my place is clean, my mind is clean. Who would have thought? But anyway, last night was so much fun. It was some good family bonding time. We had dinner at Fig At 7th, which is one of my
favorite shopping places in downtown LA. They've got an H&amp;M, a Zara. They got a Bath and Body
Works, Victoria Secret, Target, but anyway, needless to
say, I went shopping. I got my mom a couple sweaters, and I got myself a couple of things, because it's been a minute since I feel like I've shopped, but... They had this crazy sale everywhere, so first up at Nordstrom Rack, I got this black back pack. It is by Madden Girl, so I guess Steve Madden makes accessories. It looks like that other
brand that has this logo, but either way, I love it. It fits my Canon T3I, which is pretty much the only reason why I got this backpack. All my backpacks are breaking because my vlogging camera
is an unnecessary weight. It's around seven pounds. I don't know why I am so loyal to things, but anyway, I got a new backpack because my velvet one broke, so this is the new backpack for now. I like that it's in this ski pants, or snow material, because when it rains or something or if I'm in a different
climate or something, it's gonna protect all the goodies inside, and this was $30. All right, next up, we have Zara. They're having an insane
sale on everything, and the only thing I got were shoes. So the first pair of shoes I
got were these pointed mules. They've got a ruched center and I just feel like
they look very elegant, and then I got another pointed mule. I guess these aren't really mules. They're pointed slip ons, and the last pair of shoes
I got were these mules, another pair of mules, jeez. But these have a nice
teddy material in the front and these are very, very comfortable. All these pairs of shoes were 20 bucks, so I got everything for 60 bucks, which is insane. That's like the cost of one shoe at Zara, and then at H&amp;M I got these two beanies. This one was 13 bucks and then, this one, I don't
know how much this one was, but probably less than that, because this is just a
plain, black ribbed beanie, a little slouchy, and then, this one has a
cute little pom pom on it. Since I'm already showing
you guys all these things, I thought I would throw in
Stephanie's Christmas present. She made us coasters of all the girls, and they are so cute. She got my hair color so perfectly. It really looked like this at the time. The whole squad protecting
the surfaces of my home now, and the last thing I
wanted to show you guys was some jewelry by a subscriber. Her name is Eugenia. She is from Toronto and she just sent me the
most beautiful pieces, so I had to shout her out. First up we have these really
beautiful drop down earrings. They're very statement, and then she has these abstract
squiggle statement earrings. The third is a modern
day contemporary hoop, and the last pair of earrings, and the ones that I'm
the most excited about are these adorable egg earring. I love the fact that
she made the yolk gold and the rest is this beautiful chrome. I love these earrings. Thank you so much for
sending these to me, Eugenia. You're so talented. I'll leave her info in the description box so please check her out. But yeah, that is the end of the haul. I'm gonna get started with my day. I already went to Pilates earlier, but this class was just
weak for some reason. I feel like I didn't really get that full of a workout. I feel like Pilates is 50 50. Some classes I'm in excruciating pain and I'm so sore, but other classes, I'm just kind of like... Like I'm not even breaking a sweat. (relaxing music) Hello everybody. - Hello, everybody. - It's Ben Jenn here. - That's me, there we go. - We are going to the Goodwill outlet. We're gonna film a video. Ben is gonna help me shoot
it as he always does. - Give my best shot. - Honestly, it's been a long
time since I've been here. Instead of going to the
normal Goodwill store, I'm gonna go to the outlet, so I've actually never stepped in there because even that's really
overwhelming for me, 'cause everything is just
in a big giant bucket. Yeah, yeah. - Everything's like a dollar. - That's what they say. I hear that. You just pick whatever you wanna buy and then they weigh it and then, that's how you pay. I've never seen this Goodwill so full. The parking lot is rammed. - [Ben] Everyone's got
the same idea as us. - [Jennifer] I know. - [Ben] They're all
doing the thrift videos. - [Jennifer] I see you. You're not gonna get my goodies. - [Ben] There's no spaces. - [Jennifer] There's no spaces. Holy cow. - [Ben] It's a fucking Wednesday at 11 AM. - [Jennifer] Oh my gosh, I know. Oh my goodness. Let's just go all the way to the back. - Did it, guys.
- Nice. Oh, whoa, whoa. Oh, Ben loves to reverse back. - You know, it gets us, it means when we leave, we're fine. People in America don't
like to reverse park. - Yeah, 'cause you're
just a really good parker. (vocalizing) We made it. Here we are at the Goodwill outlet store. We've been to just the
normal Goodwill store a lot of times but it's
my first time entering this part of town. I guess this part of the store. (upbeat music) I need to burn my hands, excuse me. (upbeat music) Hello, so I'm back from the outlet store. I washed my hands with soap obviously, but yeah, I got some great things. The outlet was, I'm not gonna lie, it was really intense
and you're just sifting through a lot of stuff. Also, the people there
are very territorial because they are some people that go there to buy the clothes and
then try and upsell it on eBay or at the flea markets. When those buckets come out, a fresh bucket comes out, literally it's like piranhas eating this big dead carcass, but basically I'm home now, and I'm gonna cook some lunch. Ben and Sam are at a cafe working again, and I'm gonna make some
Dengjang Chigae So this is essentially
like a Korean miso soup. It's fermented bean paste. I know that sounds disgusting but it is so delicious. All right, so now that
everything is cooking, I am going to put in some
Doenjang This is the magic sauce. Like that amount. Maybe this is too much. I don't care. (upbeat music) All right guys, that
is a wrap on the vlog. I actually finished inputting
the rest of the clips into my laptop so this
is very, very recent. I'm gonna spend the rest of the day just editing this vlog and
it will be out on Sunday, which is when you're watching this, so yes, I hope you guys
enjoyed this little catch up vlog. I feel like, I don't know. I feel like this month
has gone so quickly, but yeah, I am going to continue to vlog the rest of January and then I don't know where I'm going with this. I just came here to say goodbye. Thank you so much for watching and see you guys in the next one. Bye. (upbeat music) 
(mellow, dynamic music) - What's up, guys, it's your girl, Jen and today I have an episode of favorites, I can't believe it's already
time to do one of these, but we are well into summer and I thought I would showcase some items, that have made this month even better. Also, if you love
favorites videos like this, make sure you subscribe to my channel, the button is down below,
so make sure you hit that, become a Jem today, so with
that said, let's get started. So I've gotta talk about some accessories, that I've been loving. Here I have these dangly
guys from the brand, Inc, I grabbed these at Macy's and
if you follow me on Instagram, these earrings are no stranger to you, I've been popping them on
like nobody's business, I actually love these so
much, that I got three pairs, it's not very often that I do this, I've been really liking to
mix and match them as well, they add like a nice
movement around the face and just the perfect pop
of color to any outfit. As you guys know, I moved
and with this process, I had to figure out what I
would do for my jewelry storage. My last place, it wasn't
really that good of a system, I had these clear boxes, but the jewelry was
getting all tangled up, it was rusting and it wasn't a good look, so finally I found my solution
for my jewelry storage, it is this jewelry armoire, it is amazing, I am so happy with it, it looks like a mirror from the outside, but when you open it, boom,
got storage for everything, my earrings, my bracelets,
my rings, my necklaces, it's just perfect and I am so happy, that I finally have a system again, because it's so easy to like
mix and match my earrings now, like all my chokers are in one place, it just feels good to
have like a nice system. I got this at Hayneedle and if I'm gonna be completely honest, it was, it was kind of like
a struggle to get this, so the first time it
arrived, it came broken, the hinges fell off and
it was just annoying, like calling the customer service, being like, hey, it came broken, but they took it away and
they shipped me a new one and while it was shipping, I
was reading everyone's reviews and a lot of people had the same issue, the first time, it comes broken, some people's mirrors were shattered, some people had the same issues that I did with the hinges coming off, there was one user there that
had ordered this three times, before it came like in one piece, but luckily for me, the
second time it arrived, it was in perfect condition, thank God, so if you're interested
in getting this armoire, just prepare to have it come
broken at least one time, because this isn't made
from like the best material, it's gonna have some wear
and tear from the move, so I'm just letting you guys
know that as like a heads up. Before we make a favorite, I have Stila's Liquid
Eyeshadow in Molten Midnight, these were everywhere on YouTube like a couple of months ago, everyone was just freaking out about them, obviously I am late to the bandwagon, I saw my girl, Sophia use
this in one of her tutorials and that was the day that
I was just convinced, I put it in my cart and I have no regrets, I've been rocking this eyeshadow look like a fair amount of times in June, but this is like the perfect
thing, if you love glitter and I love me some glitter. This is great, because
you can really pinpoint exactly where you want the sparkle and it doesn't have
fallout, which is a godsend, because usually when I'm
working with glitter, it just kind of gets all over the place, so when it's concentrated
and it's controlled, it's always a good look. This is a black eyeshadow
with gold and silver flecks and I'm rocking it on my eyes right now, I am definitely gonna film
a tutorial on this look, so stay tuned, because this is perfect for like summer nights out, date night or just anytime you just
wanna add a little glam. Moving on to more accessories, I have to feature these
sunglasses by Perverse, (sighs) these are called the Eva and I am just obsessed with them. I recently styled this
in my summer look book, if you haven't watched that video, I'll leave it in the cart right there, but these sunglasses give me life, like when I put them
on, I just feel happier, because the world just looks more vibrant and just better in general, this is definitely like a mood enhancer and I think you look pretty
cool, while wearing them. These are oversized, so I
think they would really suit anyone's face and just like
a really fun, summer staple. I'm thinking about filming a styling, tinted sunglasses video,
because at this point, I've collected around maybe four or five, so I think I'm gonna, I
think I'm gonna do it. Let me know if you're interested
in the Comments down below. If you open my closet, you'll notice that I only
have one type of hanger, it's these velvet, space-saving ones, these are incredible. If you just have like the
plastic or the wood ones, I highly suggest you convert
and invest into these, because you can hang so much more clothing with these hangers, but these hangers are
actually not my favorite, I wanna talk about these clips. These are by Huggable
Hangers, I got these at Target and these are clips that you
just attach to the velvet ones and boom, you can instantly hang all your like strapless tops, you can hang your skirts and your shorts and for the longest time,
I didn't really have like a good system for storing my skirts and skirts are like a big
part of summer, you know and before I was just folding them up and putting them in a dresser and just like literally
forgetting about them, phew, now I have these hangers, they're all hung up in my
closet, I can see everything and now styling is just so liberating, because I don't have to dig
into my, like my dressers to find like that one
skirt from months ago, so it's just nice to have
everything in one place, I absolutely love it. My next favorite is such a Mom favorite, but I gotta mention it anyway, it's my new Dyson vacuum cleaner, my parents got it for me and
Ben as a housewarming gift and at first I was like, oh, we already have a vacuum
cleaner, but Ben was like, "No babe, this is the
best vacuum cleaner," and I tried it out and
literally life-changing, I mean, I already love cleaning, but this has made the process even better, like it sucks up everything, it has all these different heads, so you can have like the normal,
traditional vacuum cleaner, you've got like the nozzles, you can get in the nooks and crannies, it's just such an effective tool, it just sucks up everything and also it doesn't have a cord, so you can take it anywhere,
you can vacuum your car, you can vacuum the
steps, it's just (sighs), I just, the love for this
vacuum cleaner is just awesome, like when I first got this vacuum cleaner, I literally spent the rest of
the night vacuuming the stairs and just, I went a little nuts, so I knew that I had to
plug it in my favorites. If I'm gonna be real,
this is pretty expensive, I looked it up and I was like, damn. Think of it as an
investment, because this, with this, you're gonna
have a really clean home and you're never gonna need
like a broom or a dustpan and it just makes cleaning a lot easier and when you have a clean environment, you've got a clear mind, so
just things to think about. My last favorite is a summer playlist, that I created with Spotify, I will leave the link down below, I just really created like a mishmash of all my favorite songs,
that I've been listening to, so check it out. There's just a lot of different
types of genres in there too and I'm just gonna be adding more songs, as the summer goes on,
so feel free to follow it and if you have any summer songs, that you have been just playing on repeat, leave it in the Comments down below, I love listening to you
guys' recommendations, it's like, it's one of
my favorite pastimes. Alright everyone, those
were my June Favorites. I literally can't believe
we're in July now, this year is just zooming by so quickly, I am just living for the summer though, this is my favorite
season, it's hot now in LA, it's like a nice, dry heat and it's just always
been my favorite season. If you guys enjoyed the video,

(calm music) - Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn and today is the final
episode of my series with Simple Skincare who
is collaborating with me and sponsoring this video. We live in a day and
age where we barely have any time for ourselves,
and I'm definitely guilty of not getting enough me time. So today I'm gonna bring
my friend Lauren in and we're gonna show you
three self care DIYs. So here we have Lauren. Yay.
- Yay. Thanks for having me.
- Yeah thanks for coming over. - Yeah.
- This is like the first time you've been to my place. - Mmhmm.
- Oh my God, we're finally doing it.
- I know. Finally.
- Yeah. So we have the DIY queen herself. We're doing self care DIYs today. So I just wanted to ask how
do you deal with stress? Do you get stressed easily? - Oh my gosh, I am the most
easily stressed out person in the entire world,
I'm like super type A, I'm a list maker. And I feel like massages
are like my number one go-to for de-stressing when I have time, and then also meditation. - Yeah, right. I think lists and
definitely the meditations are my way to go. I wish I could enjoy massages more, but I'm just so ticklish that the first 20
minutes I'm like in pain. (Lauren laughs) Yeah, but I'm getting there slowly. I need to chill a little more.
- Working on it. - Yeah, so the first DIY we'll
be doing today is the mask, these are ingredients that you
can easily find in your home. I notice that when I get stressed out my skin is the first sign to
show me that I'm stressed, so it'll, like, get really dry, it'll start breaking out.
- Yeah. - So, yeah, these are the ingredients for our masks we're making today. Avocado, Simple's Hydrating Booster, coconut oil, and honey. Okay, so should we just
start mixing everything in? - Yes, add it in.
- Yes, okay. - I feel like these are
all really easy ingredients I like, already have as well. - For the hydrating
booster you're gonna add like a teaspoon of that, so. - Hit me with a little
bit of booster. (laughs) - What kind of skin do you have? - I have, like, combination skin. I'm dry in some spots,
and then an oily T-zone, which I feel like is really common. - Yeah, right.
- Yeah. But I've got like, like
prepubescent skin I feel like. (both laugh) I'm like oh, I'm 24, I'm ready
to get out of puberty now. That smells good. - Oh my gosh, it does smell really good.
- It smells really good. - [Jen] Alright, so
this looks pretty, all-- - It looks face-maskable. (both laugh) Right? - Yeah it does.
- It looks face-maskable right now.
- Yes it is pretty much ready. - Yeah, it's good to go. - Yeah, so the booster is in here, can mix it into your
foundation, your moisturizer, or you can just use it all over your face. - A three in one.
- It is. - I feel like I look like a '90s child when I split my hair
like this behind my ears. - Really? (laughs) - I look like a Spice Girl now. - It's cute, I like it. - Okay, here we go. What's your method of attack here? - I'm gonna just plop it on, - Just go for it.
- I'm just going for it. - Okay, okay.
- Okay. Here we go. Oh, oh my gosh, it's very cooling. - I think I have too much,
think I have too much. - Really? (Lauren squeals) - Oh yeah, you're right, it is cooling. - Yeah.
- I'm like ready for someone to take a chip to my face. (Jen laughs) - Yeah this is a very light, thin mask. I think you just need a really thin layer 'cause you don't want
too much chunks on it. How often do you do face masks? - I probably do a mask, like, I really like sheet masks as well. I do these ones maybe like,
I don't know, once a week? How often do you mask? - I do around once a week too. - I'm having more issues than you are, you were like, you just finessed this, I'm not so-- - I just kinda winged it,
like, I think you're good. It looks the same, yeah. - Girl, it does not look
the same. (both laugh) - So you just leave this on
for 10 minutes, and that's it. - So we just washed our faces, and my face is feeling good. - Yeah, right?
- Right? - I feel like we got most of it off, but just to make 100% sure
that everything's gonna we're gonna go in with the
Simple Micellar Cleansing Water. I'll squirt some on. Yeah, this is my favorite Micellar water because it's so gentle,
great for sensitive skin, and it makes sure that
everything comes off. - Which I love. This is like when I find
out that I do a terrible job of washing my face, it's
like, this is the proof, that's like wow, I did not
put enough effort into that. Already!
- It's like judgment day. Yeah.
- I know, and there's already makeup on it. - Yeah mine's like, I've
got like debris on mine. - Debris. (both laugh) - Human debris. - I just like wanna wash
off this whole pimple, that'd be great. - I just wanna wash my
whole entire body with this, you know, just do like an entire cleanse. - You know, the collar bones. - Okay, now some stuff really came off. Since winter is coming as well, if you've got really dry skin I highly recommend the
Micellar facial gel wash. This is very hydrating
and good at removing all your makeup off. - Oh my gosh, that's like
such a must have for winter. I feel like when the air dries up, I'm like, my skins like
(makes slurping sound) I need moisture.
- Yeah. (laughs) So our second DIY is creating
your own meditation corner. So here we are in a nice
little corner on the sofa. - Literal corner.
- Literal corner. So I think the best corners for meditation are somewhere that's comfortable, somewhere that there's lots
of light and it's serene, basically anywhere you feel calm. - No distractions, that's
my number one thing is like if there's a
distraction anywhere nearby, like, it's over for me. - Right?
- It's over. - This is what you're gonna need for the meditation corner. A candle, sage, and some crystals. But yeah, so for our meditation corner we've got some crystals, these are, I mean, they're
apparently supposed to have, like, power, you know. - I feel like I'm so new to this world. Everyone's like, ooh, crystals, and I'm like tell me about the crystals. - I feel like they're supposed
to produce negative ions, so they're supposed to have
(mumbles), I don't really know, but basically for me it's kinda
just like holding something and putting intention in it. - Oh my God
- Yeah. - Wait, I kinda love that. - Right, yeah.
- Yeah. - So it's just something physical. And then obviously we
gotta get the smells right. We've got a big ol' candle and we've also got some sage. I've never actually lit sage-- - Neither have I.
- In this house before. - Woah, are we saging
your house right now? - Yeah, we could, you're supposed to when you first move. - All the bad spirits.
- Exactly. This is like get rid of all the bad juju, so yeah, we're going to
probably light this up in a little bit, and then
we also have this app called Headspace, this is
my favorite meditation app. I have logged in over 100 sessions, so I'm so excited to do this one with you. - I know, I'm a newbie to meditation, so today will be my guided, by Jen, meditation session. (both laugh) - Alright, I'm gonna light this baby up. Lauren's got the crystals.
- I'm on crystal duty. This is my first saging, I'm so interested to see how this goes. - Oh my gosh. - Oh, oh yeah she's smokin'.
- She's smokin'. - Be gone bad juju. Oh yeah, that smells like, it smells like when you go into any kind
of like mystic store. - Yeah, right, it's like
coated in this scent. Alright, so now we're gonna get straight into the meditation. - Your crystal.
- Oh thank you. Thank you. (both laugh) Alright, so I'm gonna
pick a 10 minute one. - [Man] So either sitting
down or lying down. And the muscles are softening,
giving way, switching off. I'll see you back here
tomorrow for day seven. - That was good. I feel calm and relaxed. - Yeah, me too. It just really helps
you catch your thoughts, because I feel like my
mind's always racing so whenever I meditate it just helps me like slow and dial things back. - Oh my God, for sure, I feel like there's never not a time where I'm like okay, what's next, what's next on my to-do list,
like, what am I doing now? - Well, what next-- (laughs)
- Well. - Next up we are doing our acai bowls. - Great transition. (both laugh) - Alright, so for our last DIY we have the yummy acai
bowl. (Lauren cheers) These are my favorite.
- Me too. - Yeah, they're very energizing and they've got a lot of antioxidants, so great for your skin. So here's what you're gonna need. Almond butter, that's optional, bananas, fresh berries, frozen berries, acai powder, chia seeds, cashew
milk, and coconut flakes. Okay, so we've got our blender here. Gonna put all the ingredients in. - Okay.
- Would you like to start? - Let's do it, let's do it. Okay, cashew milk. - I used to work at a
smoothie shop actually. - Really? Oh my gosh, I worked at a grocery store, I scooped ice cream. - Me too.
- Really? - Yeah, wait, which ice
cream store did you work at? - Oh it was a Canadian, like a little mom and pop Canadian place. - Did your forearm get bigger? Yeah, right, my right
forearm got bigger too, I was like--
- This muscle right here gets so big. - Yeah, I worked at Baskin Robbins and one of the test
questions was to memorize all 31 flavors, yeah.
- Oh my gosh. - It was nuts, but it was a good job. I gained like 10 pounds. (laughs) - Oh my gosh, okay, ready? - Okay. - Lid, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - Okay, is it secure? - No, I feel like it's not
on right, is that right? - Okay yeah, it's on, it's on, okay. (both cheer and laugh) So then now we just add our toppings. That's strawberries, blueberries, coconut, - I feel like there's always the pressure to make it look so pretty. - Yeah, right? - To just like demolish
it two minutes later. - Well presentation just
makes food taste better for some reason.
- I agree. - [Jen] It's like a form of art. Ooh, I like yours too.
- Eh. It's like the face mask, I'm like, you finessed it, I didn't. - I've been practicing. Wow.
- Yay. - Alright, let's have a bite. - Oh my gosh.
- Oooh. - Mmmh.
- Mmh! - It's like healthy ice cream. Okay, I think we nailed it. This is such a refreshing,
guilt-free snack, I love having it on, like, healthy days. - It's so re-energizing,
like a little pick me up. - Exactly. Alright guys, that is a wrap on the DIYs. I had so much fun with you. - Oh my gosh, thanks for having me. I feel good, I feel calm, I feel re-energized, full.
- Yeah, definitely full. If you guys want to check out

- Bye! (calm music) 
(soothing electronic music) - Hey everyone, it's your girl Jen, and this is the second episode of my mini-series with Simple Skincare, who is sponsoring this video. Last week, we had the
wonderful Jackie Aina, but today, we have a new guest, and we're just gonna be chatting about how you can avoid the
daily stress of your life from affecting your skin. And we're gonna be doing a really fun, stress-free makeup challenge, where we're just gonna be sharing tips on how you can
keep your skin hydrated, using Simple Skincare's
new Water Boost products. All right, guys, here she is, Ingrid! - Hi, everyone. - Oh my god, this is so trippy, - I know.
- Having you at my house. - I know, it is. - You're one of the first
people I saw on YouTube. - Really? - Miss Glamorazzi, yeah.
- Oh my god! That's so crazy, I didn't know that! - Yeah, no this is insane. - I know, I feel like
I have been following your fashion journey since
before I was even on YouTube, or maybe right when I first started. - Dang, that's nuts! No, 'cause I've always been
silently following you as well, but I always assume that there would be some sort of event or occasion. - I know, we never see each other. - We've never run across
each other, it's insane. So, today we're gonna be
just doing our makeup, and also, we've added
a little twist to it. We're gonna be adding some rules. You ready? - Love me some rules. - So, the rules are in this hat, so if you wanna pick them out and then I can explain each one. - Okay, what am I pulling out? What am I doing to myself?
- They're large strips. - I know, they are. Okay, after you finish
a section of makeup, you must frame your face with your hands. - Nice! - So, vogueing. - Exactly. So, after you finish your brows, you go ding, or like that. - I am going to get so into these rules that when I go home and
I'm just doing my makeup in everyday life, I'm ... - Is he applying it? All right, foundation's done. - Pat your head before
using a particular item. - So this one's, okay, let's say I'm doing the setting spray. I'll just grab this and, you know, just do a little pat. - Thumbmaster, 10 seconds for
another person to place thumb before getting penalized. - You just silently press
your thumb on the table, and if I don't notice,
or if you don't notice, within 10 seconds, then you get a strike. - Okay, great, I feel
like you found yourself the perfect competitor, 'cause I'm gonna fail it all! - (cackles) My plan all along! We're doing a fall-inspired
look, because summer is over. Isn't that crazy? - I know. - So, before we get started, I think we should cleanse our face first. Here you go.
- Thank you. - Yeah, I love this micellar water. - I know, it's really awesome.
It's incredible. - So, I'm just gonna
douse my cotton round, and I'm just gonna wipe
my entire face down. And I really like this because it's so hydrating and refreshing, and when you have a hydrated base, then your makeup just goes on more evenly. - I know, I like how my skin doesn't feel dry and tight after it. - Look, where did this come from? - I know.
- I washed my ... - I had no makeup on my face. Where did this come from? Just air
- It's all dirt. - And then, one of my
favorite things to use is the hydrating booster, and I've been using this every day, and I love it because
it's really hydrating, and it also is a really great primer. I normally mix it into my moisturizer, but then sometimes, I'll
add another layer on top, just because I really like it a lot. - And your face is nice,
it's hydrated, it's prepped. - Oh my god, it feels so
much better than before. Okay, so are we gonna start on this? Makeup?
- Our makeup? Oh my god, okay! Let's do it. - What do you normally start with? - Foundation, or concealer. - I start with my eyes. - Oh, is it for fallout
or something like that? - Yeah, kinda. I guess I'm just also ... I've just gotten into the
habit of doing my eyes first. Originally, it was for
fallout, but now, I don't know. - I feel like everyone has
their own little systems, and this is my ritual, foundation. - I know. - Did you pat your head, missy? - Oh! See I told you. - Can someone strike that? Okay, okay. Make sure you put a point on her, okay? I patted my head. You can rewind the tape to make sure. (bell dings) - Okay, so, I really
wanna ask you about Eggie, because I saw that that just
launched and that's so cool. - Thank you. I have been working on
it for such a long time, since the beginning of last year, And so to have it-- - Oh my gosh, wow.
- Yeah. It was supposed to launch
the beginning of summer, so then we started, as
the dates got pushed back, we started to, oh crap, we gotta think about more fall stuff, 'cause it's gonna launch in August now. So, it's just been a
really crazy experience, and I am so proud and happy
of the way it turned out. And this is just the beginning. - It's especially cool,
I think, to see people who have been doing it for a while, and just the different
paths that people take, and now you having Eggie, I just think it's so cool to see. Oh my god.
- Oh my god. - Recently, I was with some friends, and they made everybody
watch their first videos. - Oh my gosh, wait, what
was your first video? - So, my actual first
video is not up anymore. - Oh, you took it down? - Yeah, I took it down really early on, maybe within the first month
that I was making videos, 'cause I was like, I don't like it. I wasn't thinking, oh this is something I'm
gonna wanna look back on. - Yeah, memories. - So the the first one that's
up, is a red lip tutorial. - Oh, snap. - Yeah, and I was watching
it, like, oh my god. - Oh, how old were you? - I was 20. - 20, oh? - It was just so
interesting to think about, how much life has changed,
and how much you grow up, especially in your 20s, too. - Yeah, 20s is such a crazy,
fundamental part of your life, and every year is so different. - I know.
- Like, 20 to 21? And 21 to 22? - I know. - I look back at 23 and I'm like, whoa, what were you doing girl? It's crazy. - Like, things that you think
are totally fine, and cool, you look back on, and you're, like nope!
- Nope! - But I feel like that's
what your 20s are for. - Exactly. - You have to learn from your 20s. (Ingrid sighs) - What? (soft pat) Oh my god! (laughs) (Ingrid sighs) Oh my god.
- I'm so ashamed. - Oh, it's okay, stop. Don't let the game getcha down. - This is what my 20s are for. - Yeah, right? - Figuring things out. - I want to ask about your
skin care routine actually, - Oh really? - Because your skin looks so gorgeous. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah, so what are your
tips and tricks, eh? - I actually don't use too many products, and I try to stick with
things that are really gentle. So, I was telling you
earlier, that I've been using Simple since before they
even came to the States. - Yeah, I had no idea they were just in the U.K. for a long time. - Yeah, so whenever I would
travel, I would always get a pack of their wipes,
'cause I love them so much. So that's why I'm excited
that they came over here, 'cause I use the micellar water and the wipes and the
booster all the time. I've really been into K
beauty things recently. - Oh nice. - So I've been using this
watermelon sleeping mask, and that has just been
amazing for my skin, and typically, products like
that, that have AHAs in them, my skin is super-sensitive. - Wait, AHAs? - Alpha hydroxy acids. - What? Okay, wow. I've never heard of that term before. - They exfoliate your skin. It's almost like a chemical exfoliation. - Oh, interesting. - And, let me just put this on my face before I really mess something up. So, normally, that's really
irritating for my skin, but with this, there's so
many moisturizers in the mask, and you wear it over night, that my skin just eats it all up. I love it. - I think the main thing
about skin care for me is to always make sure
that everything is removed. So I always double cleanse,
and even triple sometimes. - Yeah, me too. - Sometimes at the end
I'll just do final layer of this micellar water, and it just takes out
everything that's on there. - I know, I always finish with that. And I use it in the
morning as a pre-cleanse to get rid of any night
treatments that are on my face. - Oh, cool. Okay, I am done with
brows (clicks tongue). Where are you at?
- That is what I-- - I am just putting on a little
bit of under eye concealer, and then I am going to set my face-- - Nice.
- with some spray. I always look like I'm afraid of my face spray when I put it on, 'cause it's always a
little startling for me. So I just need to set
this, and then I can vogue. (bottles crashing) - Oh god, oh no! - Oh my god. - My god. Rest in peace. Okay, well you caught the
thumb, 'cause that ... Oh, it blew my cover. Okay, all right.
(Ingrid giggles) - Rogue eye shadow. - I know. Okay, let me just go--
- oh my god. It broke. - It broke? (both giggling) - We're falling apart here. We're falling apart, guys. - Okay, moving on. (both giggling) - Oh. Messed up. - Oh my god. - I slipped. Every time I do my brows, I
always end up having to do this. - Same, brows are so tricky. - I know.
- Yeah. But this is great for makeup removal. - Yeah.
- It's my favorite. - I really like this,
'cause it doesn't have any harsh chemicals or dyes in it-- - It's so gentle. - So I feel okay with
putting it near my eyes. There are certain
mascaras that even, just, on my eyelashes, make
my eyes water and burn. - You're like, I don't
think this should be anywhere near my eye. - Yeah, I'm like, I don't think this is how it's supposed to feel. - So true. - Is there another city that
you would want to live in? Or do you think that LA is your ... - Funny you should ask that. So, I just went to Toronto in August. I feel like I've become
this ambassador for Toronto, I don't know why, but, literally it was my third time there, and my
friend Dani just showed me the best spots in Toronto, and she's just got an
amazing community there, and I didn't want to leave. I was like, wow, I could stay
here for another week or so. - So what made you love Toronto so much? - Because it's kinda like New York, but like a nicer New York? - Yeah. - Like, the people are more friendly. And it's just, it's got amazing food, and everyone that I met
there was just so creative and positive, and ... I mean, it could just be the
bubble that Dani showed me, but it was just super-inspiring
to be in a place like that. - Well, I feel like the
people that you're with make such a huge difference. That's the main reason
why I'm still in LA, 'cause my home base for
people, everybody's here. - Totally. But New York is super-inspiring
though, I love it. - I know. It really is. - I love the fashion there, as well, because people just really experiment. I feel like in LA, there's
so many little pockets (bottles crashing)
of different ... Oh! - I gave you a chance!
- Did I make it? Did I make it? (both laughing) I did it. But yeah, I feel like in LA, there's just so many little pockets, but I feel like the style
is relatively the same. It's so laid-back here, it's chill. There's the super-glam Hollywood style, but in New York, I feel like I see the most interesting
types of fashion there, where I'm like, I've
never seen that before. - I know. - Okay, I need to just fix this right now. This is no bueno. - What happened? Oh.
- This happened. (both laughing) You're like ...
- I'm like what, I don't see anything. - Once you see it, you can't unsee it. I'm so bad with the under lashes. - I know, I just have stopped
putting mascara there, 'cause I always get it on me. - I feel like it's a little ritual for me. Like, I have to put it on
my bottoms and my tops, no matter what, even
though they're so baby. That lip color is gorgeous by the way. - Thank you. - It really tied-in the
whole fall-inspired look. - I know, I like keeping
everything else really simple, but I've always enjoyed
a good statement lip, as my first video on Youtube displayed. - Oh yeah right, my red lip. - What was your first video? - My first video was
a summer fashion haul. - Oh my god, I love it.
- Oh my god. Or no, summer fashion trends? Yeah, that was so fun. I did it with my friend Sarah and that was just a very
pure time on Youtube. What is something you miss
about the old Youtube? - How there were a lot
less people, and so, even just in the comment section, it felt a lot more personal. I mean the comment sections
still feel personal, but it was just different back then. It was just a different world. There were less people making videos, there were less people watching. I'm still debating whether
I wanna put one more thing. Well, I'll put one more thing on. - 'Kay, I'm waiting for my, I think I just need to do
my lips, and then I'm done. (soft pat) - Cool, we're finishing
it at the same time. - I know, this is great. What is this? - It is a highlighter. - Whoa, liquid. - [Ingrid] Yeah. - Nice. - I really like ... I have also
had this in the powder form, but I really like the liquid 'cause it just blends so easily. And even though I've already
put on a setting powder, I can still put this on top,
and it works really nicely. It just allows me to use
it in different ways. Like, I can mix it with things ... - I feel like I've noticed that you like the creams for your face. - Yeah, and I used to hate
them, I used to hate them, but, it's all just in line with me trying to embrace my natural shine. - I like that. You do your thing. All right.
- Okay. I think we finished at the same time, - I know.
- which is very convenient. - I just need to spray set
this on my face, and I'm dunzo. (gentle spritzes) All right, so this is
our finished fall look. - Ta-dah.
- Ta-dah. I love your look by the way. - Thank you. - It's wonderful. - I really love yours too. I love how you do your eye makeup. - Thank you. All right, so this is the serious part. Let's see what the scores are. Let's see who won. - [Woman] Jen with six,
and Ingrid with 18. - What does that mean? - [Woman] So you win. - So I won? (both laughing) - I literally lost by so much. But I was so absorbed
in our conversations. - True, true. - But, at least now you
got to win this time. - Yeah, it does feel good, I must say. Wow. I'm gonna be glowing all day. - I know. - But anyway, thank you so
much for coming on to the show, and--
- Thanks for having me. - Yeah, this was awesome. - I know, it was really
cool being able to meet you, and hang out, and just chat. - Seriously. That was a good catch-up. - Yeah, it was. - And if you guys wanna see the previous episode with Jackie, the link will be down below. Also, a huge thanks to Simple Skincare for collaborating and
sponsoring this video. I absolutely love their
new Water Boost range, so please check it out. The link for the coupon will
be in the description box, so check it out. And, yeah, I guess that's it. - Yeah. I know. We're done. - I know, we're done. Thank you so much for watching. - Bye guys.
- Bye. (soothing electronic music) 
- You want me to powder you? - I do look a bit shiny. - Okay, I'm just gonna
bring the powder down. - All right, we getting the powder. Sort me out, make sure
we don't use this bit. (pop music) - Hi everyone!
- Hello. - And welcome back to my channel. Today, we have a very special guest, Ben. If you somehow do not know
who he is, this is my man. - Yeah, sorry about that, guys. You're probably sick of me
by now, but here I am again. - I thought it would be a really good time to bring him in because Valentine's Day is right around the corner. So, we're doing a very fun, relaxed Love and Relationship Q&amp;A. I went on Twitter and asked you guys if you guys had any questions, and we picked our favorite ones. - There was some good questions. - So, let's dive right in. - What are your respective love languages? - Yeah, we picked this question out because I literally had Ben take this test maybe two months ago.
- Yeah, about two months ago. - Yeah, so I thought the
results were really interesting. I've always known my love language test because I love quizzes. I love the Meyers-Briggs test. - I've never even heard of this test. So it was quite fun to do.
- Yeah. - Some of the questions were a bit odd. It was like, would you like a hug or get
a really expensive gift? It feels like a trick question. - Yeah, right? So, Ben's results were
quality time as number one. Then, touch. Words of affirmation. Then, it was acts of service. Very last was gifts. - Yeah, yours were? - Quality time, number one. So it's really important
to spend time with me. Then it was acts of service. So it really means a lot
when Ben does things for me. Like cooking, opening the
packages, watering the grass. - You keep reeling off the list. - Yeah, I know. Number three for me was
words of affirmation, so we're both equal on that. Fourth one is gifts,
and the last is touch. I had no idea that this
meant so much to him. Who would have thought? - This means a lot right now.
(laughing) - Second question comes
from Brittany Yann. At first, did your
parents have a hard time accepting your interracial relationships or were they happy you were happy? For the longest time, my parents wanted me to
be with an Asian guy. Love you two. Thanks, Brittany.
- Good question. - It's a very good question actually. Honestly, Ben didn't meet
my parents until like a year of us dating.
- It's been a year, yeah. - Yeah, for me and my parents, I was never the type to be
like this is who I'm dating. It was always very separate. With Ben, it felt like
something very serious. So, after a year of dating, Ben came over to my parents' house. Everybody was there. My mom, dad, and James. - You have to remember as well, for Jenn's parents to find
out their daughter is dating a guy who's in a band with tattoos. How far, five thousand
miles away does he live? Great, yeah, date him. So, there's a lot of things that weren't really going in my favor. - At first, they were like,
okay if he makes you happy, because they couldn't get too mad because we were already dating for a year. So clearly he wasn't
just about to run away. So, he knew that we were committed. And I think it's just Ben's efforts on always trying to impress my parents. You'd always chat to my
dad about soccer or golf, or pretty much anything. - Eats all that food. - Yeah, and eat all of my mom's food. - That's a problem. - That's the way to my mom's heart, is to eat her cooking. I think it's really important to just show your parents how much. How do I say it?
- How happy you are. - How happy you are. - Because I think the main thing, no matter what, every parents, every family want you to be happy, and if you can really show that. Then, I think that goes a long way. - Yeah.
- I guess we're lucky 'cause your parents were more accepting than maybe other parents might be. - They see the person, and beyond just the ethnicity. - Tiffany asks, would you and Ben have fallen in love with each other if you
guys met as teenagers? I like that question.
- I know, me too. This is how I envision it. We would be at a show, or
something, like a rock show, and you would be playing
the drums, or you're, the crowd or something.
- Yeah. - Like, we just ran into each other. - I think because we were into the same kind of music growing up, like that kind of angst-y punk rock, so probably like that. And I was in bands when
I was 14 or something. - It's just crazy 'cause
when we started dating, it was insane to see our paths so similar. - Yeah. - Even though we lived in
complete different countries. We had kind of like a similar adolescence. - Yeah, we did.
- Yeah. - But at the same time, I'm happy we met at this time in our lives.
- Now, yeah. - If we would have been teenagers,
we might not be here now. - Yeah, 'cause I feel like
when you're a teenager, you're still kind of
figuring yourself out. So I'm glad that we met now. - We waited, yeah.
- Yeah. So this next question is from Hafu. If it's not too personal, how
do you guys settle conflict? P.S. You two are goals. Thank you.
- Thank you. How do you settle conflict? We're pretty good with the fact that we always talk things through. - Yeah. - And make sure we never go to bed. Very rarely did we go to bed angry. - I think just one time
we went to bed angry. - Yeah. - It was not a good
morning the next morning 'cause it just transferred over. - Yeah. - So, it's good to always talk
it out before you go to bed. - Yeah, and it's something we're learning to kind of even make each
other feel validated, and it's something that can be very easy. If you're very opinionated or
you're annoyed with something, it's very hard to see the
other person's perspective. It's something where we're
definitely learning a lot. - When an argument gets quite heated, I'm not gonna lie, I'm
definitely a hot head. - You can be. - I know, I can be, but
I'm working on it so hard. So we have this system where it's kind of like
my happiness spectrum. So, right now I'm green,
so everything's good. Then, when it turns yellow, I don't feel too good.
- On the edge. - I'm on the edge. If it's orange, I'm already kind of
snapping back a little bit. I'm not angry, but I'm very close. When I become orange,
I'll tell Ben I'm orange 'cause I've noticed that
when I get to orange, I'm just looking for
a fight to get to red. I think recognizing the
different spectrums of my mood helps me catch myself. Before we get to the arguing part, it's good that Ben or
I just leave the room, and we let it just cool off
for even like 30 minutes. It really, really helps because it helps you get
back to how you normally are. - Well, you speak honestly as well because when you're
hot-headed like anyone, if you're angry, you have your walls up, you feel defensive, you
don't listen as much. Sometimes space is good, you need time.
- Space is good. - Sometimes, me listening is good. So me being there. It's about sort of judging it. Obviously every situation,
everyone's different. - I think at the end of the day, I think once we're both
normalized, especially for me, I can really hear Ben out. That's what we all need. We just need to be heard and validated, even if we don't
necessarily agree with it, as long as you hear the other person, and you come to a compromise. Then you're good. - So the next question. Did it intimidate you guys the
idea of going long distance in the beginning of your relationship? We get this question a lot. It's amazing how many
people in the same position. Especially this day and age, doing long distance, it's
happening a lot more, isn't it? - Yeah, definitely, I think
we're the age of technology. You can truly find a
suitable partner overseas. - Here I am. It's never easy. Long distance is something
that you live in limbo. You don't know when you're
gonna see each other next. You're so far away, so it's
very hard to feel connected. - It's such a high and a low. - Yeah. - Because when you see
each other you're like. - [Both] Ah! - The last two days, it's like. - Then you go home, and
you're literally so depressed. So, it's cool to see love
in such an intense spectrum 'cause you get the highest high. Like when I would see you at the airport after not seeing you for like a month. Just like packing up my things
and going to the airport. That was the best, most
exciting plane rides of my life was going to see you. - Absolutely. Long distance you have to
make that extra effort. You have to really want to make it work because it can vary. If you don't feel connected
for even a few days, it's very important to make
sure you go far and beyond for each other to make
yourself feel connected. Trying to Skype as often as you can. Especially England to L.A., it's like an eight-hour difference, so a matter of like four,
five a.m. calls would do. One of us would be drunk, one
would be going to the gym. (laughing) - Our clocks were a little bit off, but we always made time for each other, and I think your trust needs to be there. I feel like trust is built
by feeling connected. Send a little text of what
we were eating that day. - Even in the morning.
- Or a voicemail, yeah! - Waking up to a message
saying I'm thinking of you. Simple as that.
- Something like that. - It's the little things
like that that go a long way. - I think the thing with
long distance relationships is that there needs to be a time when you guys finally settle in together. Whether it's a three-year
mark, a five-year mark. - You won't always see that
end goal straight away. Even for me, I was in
England, I was in a band. I left the band and moved to L.A. It's so much change and
it's very easy to think, I can't do that, I'm doing this, I'm
doing that, I live here. You're always gonna have those walls and the things you can't do, but at the end of the day, if you're in love and you
wanna be with that person, that's the main thing. Your family and friends,
everyone will support you because it's about happiness
at the end of the day. So I think that's important. Very good question. - So, this one is from Valencia. Ben, please say something
to Jenn in Korean. (Ben speaks in foreign language) - If it's someone's birthday
as well, I'm all about that. (Ben speaks in foreign language) There's not much more than that. It's very hard.
- Pretty impressive. (Ben speaks in foreign language) - That's about it really. - Do you know how to say goodbye? (Ben speaks in foreign language) Which is the difference? (Ben speaks in foreign language) - Someone is leaving your house. (Ben speaks in foreign language) Means when you're leaving their house. By the time I've realized, as we're leaving someone's house, I'm like, oh, wait. See you later.
(laughing) - So this next question comes from Saska. If you guys swapped bodies for a day, Freaky Friday style, what would you do? - That is a very good question. - I already know what I'm gonna do. I would love to finally have
rhythm, and be able to drum. That would be so cool. To do that thing with the sticks. - Yeah, you've tried even my kit before. - Really hard, I know, it's really hard. - So you would drum.
- Yes, I would drum. - That's good. What would I? It would nice to kind of just be pretty for the day, you know? Got the hair going on, you know? Dress on. (laughing) So, Jean asks. What's the thing, joke
that only both of you gets? We got so many. - I know, we really have so many. I don't know where to get started. - And then, most of them are just so weird or don't make any sense, so you can't even explain it.
- I know. - [Both] Psst, psst, psst. - We've got a little name for our. - We have a theme song. - A theme song.
- Yeah. - We are the Ruse.
- You wanna sing it? Here, this is your mic. All right. ♪ We are the ruse ♪ ♪ Come on, everybody ♪ ♪ We are the ruse ♪ ♪ I said ♪ ♪ We are the ruse ♪ ♪ Key change ♪ ♪ We are the ruse ♪ ♪
(laughing) - Nickel asks, can you guys
read each other's minds? Love you long time Jenns and Bens. - Nice.
- Thank you. - We can a little bit, can't we? - Yeah, 100%. The instant Ben is feeling something, especially negatively, I know. I'm like, what's wrong? What can I do to help? Always.
- Yeah. It's definitely the same
the other way around. Even with board games when
we play with our friends. - The Werewolves game. - Yeah.
- Where someone is the killer, and you're supposed to have a poker face, - Yeah.
- And lie to everybody. - I'd be like, Jenn are you the killer? She'd be like, no. I'm like, she's the killer, and vice versa.
- Well, yeah! When you were the killer, I held your hand and I was like, babe, are you the killer? - Everyone was accusing me of
being the killer, and I was. - He was the killer. - So I squeezed her hand because. - Yeah, why would you
squeeze my hand so tight? - I didn't mean to the tension, I was angry that everyone was accusing me of being the killer.
- You can't lie to me. - They were right, so. - The last question comes from Victoria. What has been a challenge
that you two have overcome in your relationship and
how did you get through it? - Probably the long distance to moving in. - Yeah! That transition was kinda tricky 'cause we went from not seeing each other for most of the time to all of the time. I feel like the first
three weeks were awesome 'cause we were like, this is amazing. We get to hang out all the time. - When you move in with someone, regardless if it was long distance or not, it's about knowing your
roles and your boundaries. - Yeah, I think it's really
important to establish rules. So, for example, in the house, Ben will cook our meals and I will always wash up the dishes. Then, I will always do
laundry and fold it, and Ben will always do garden work. Yeah.
- Little things like that. - And we have a whole list. That way, we never fight about like, why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that? Because we know as long as you fulfill
your roles and your tasks, then you're good. - These little things that can build up. You don't say, and you think in your mind. It's okay, he's done it again, has he? Yeah, okay, oh, he's done it again. And then it builds up and you're screaming about something so small and insignificant when you could have just talked
about it in the first place. It's about being compatible. - And sane boundaries when we're both at a good green level. - You don't wanna scream like, do this! Okay I agree with you. That doesn't happen.
- No. - That has not happened. - It completely makes sense. I'm sorry for what I did! - You're the best person I've ever met! No one has ever had that argument. - All right guys, that is a wrap on our
Love and Relationship Q&amp;A. If you guys have any
other questions for us, please write it in the
comments down below. We would love to answer them. Perhaps, Ben will join us again. - This was fun. It was easy and it was nice to have some almost back and forth. - Yeah, this was so easy to film. We're just filming on a Friday night, with some drinks. It's been a great bonding activity. - It's nice to spend
Friday night with you all. - If you want more of Ben, please check out his YouTube channel. I will leave it in the description box. It is so good, and he's
worked so hard on it. I'm so proud of him.
- That's right. - Anyway, thank you guys
so much for watching, and we'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! - Bye guys, I wanna do it. Thumbnail photo. - This is too much. Complete my heart. - Like that, no, I'm not using this. - We need options. Good job! (pop music) 
(upbeat music) - [Jenn] Oh my gosh,
look what we have here. They have the Canon Rebel T7i. I am filming this with a Canon T3i, so you've come a long way Canon. Great job. (upbeat music) This is the Canon M6. This might be my new vlogging camera. - [Ben] Flip out screens are important. - And it's also so light. Wish I could do like a side
by side comparison, I know. So I'm back at home with the
new Canon EOS M6, I believe. This was recommended to
me by my friend Jesse. Thank you so much. So far, I don't really
know what to think about it other than that it's a lot lighter. I don't know how the sound is, or what the quality difference is so I guess this is just a test. This is using the new camera. I am currently on my way to the West side. Doing a couple of things out there. First, we are going to
the Hourglass event. They came out with a new highlighter. I'm really excited to try them out. They are cream. And then after, we are
gonna have dinner with Ashley and Vanan. We are going to talk
about our goals for 2018. So yeah, it's going to
be a very full night and then when I get back
home, we are celebrating Robin's belated birthday. It's been a really long time
since we've all been together. So it's going to be nice. (upbeat music) - Hi!
- Hey! - Wow! - Hello, everybody! It is 5:30 p.m. I'm about to have a shot of coffee. And then head off to dinner. Having a belated birthday
dinner with this one! We've got a little gem salad and hamachi! Yum! (gentle rock music) (upbeat music) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (laughing) This is one of my guilty pleasures. Oh, yeah. Oh and another one of my guilty pleasures. - California roll.
- California roll. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Thank you.
- Make a wish! ♪ Make a wish ♪ (speaking foreign language) - I love you, umma. (speaking foreign language) Hello everybody! I am back in the office. Today was a very, very productive day. Filmed the B roll for
the thrift haul video and the speaking portion. And that's why my office is a mess again. I'm so sad, I feel like I just cleaned it. Right now, I'm gonna start editing my vlog for you guys for the Sunday video. It is my goal to start
uploading two times on YouTube. Later on, I'm going to
my friend Kelly's house to help her clean her house. I think if I wasn't doing YouTube, I would definitely be doing something in like the service industry, or even like cleaning houses. I freaking love to organize, especially when it's not my stuff. I would love to be a part
of the Hoarders cast, just to excavate an entire property and just redecorate it and reorganize. That's what I'm doing today and then we're gonna have dinner with Anna, Jesse, and Claire, and Ben. So, it's gonna be good
to have a little reunion, see some familiar faces. (upbeat music) Oh my goodness. I'm about to just gain back
what we just worked out. We got a little breakfast burrito. Let's dig in. (upbeat music) At Sophie's! - Hi! - She's amazed with my
new vlogging camera! - It's amazing. - It's so light, feel it. - Wow! Taking over! I will show you the spread. We are having a house meeting at my house, so we have a cheese plate. We have chips and salsa. Annie's, so good! - [Jenn] These are amazing. - And Greek yogurt dip and some veggies. Healthy snack.
- Healthy snack. If there's a heaven on
earth, it is this place. Oh, yes. And look at their plates, they are rammed! Two full plates of salad! Meanwhile. - Us.
- Us. We're pacing ourselves, you know? - We're pacing ourselves. - [Jenn] Yes. You gotta eat this all. - I'm about to.
- You better. Ben, that looks pretty ambitious as well. - Yeah. - Andy's plate, very reasonable. It's a feast! They make the best
salads in the world here. - [Andy] It's very homey. - Well done, well done. Huh, this'll do. Hi, guys, I am in the car. I am currently on my way to go shoot with my friend, Rebekkah. If you guys have been watching
my channel for a long time, then you know who she is. She is one of my friends that
I met at community college. It's actually really so pure how we met. I remember it was during one
of our really long breaks and I just saw her sitting down on one of the planters and she had really cool style and I was like I'm just gonna go up to her and say that I like her outfit and become friends with her. That was my objective
because when I got out of high school, I was like, you know what a lot of my high school friends have left but I'm gonna try and
create a new community. She became my friend
and we just hit it off. We had a lot of the same interests. I am obsessed with this bookshelf. You've got little knick knacks. Oh my gosh, I'm getting
a lot of inspiration for my bookshelf, honestly. And there's the woman
of the hour, Rebekkah! - Can't forget Stella, though. - [Jenn] Hi Stella! Hey baby! How cute the living room is! It's like a spread in
Kinfolk or something. (upbeat music) We've made our selects
and now Rebekkah is gonna do her thing on Lightroom. Do you remember the first
time we met, Bekkah? - Yeah, I was sitting-- - On a planter, right? - I was sitting on a
planter and you were like, "Hi, you look lonely. "Do you wanna hang out with me?" And I was like "Oh, I
am lonely, yeah, sure." - Oh my god. See, I stone-cold went up to her. - You were like, "You look
like you want some friends." - Did I say that? - Something like that. That is a miracle in someone's life. Like, their first year in college, someone comes up to them and is like, "Do you want to be my friend?" And I was like, "Yeah,
sure, is this happening?" Do not second-guess whether
or not they're gonna think you're weird because you're actually gonna make their day. And you might be friends
with them for as long as we've been friends.
- I know. Here is my Green Goddess smoothie, and Alexa got the Peanut Butter. You guys, this is truly a miracle. I am going away to San
Francisco for a couple of days and I am only flying with a carry-on! I can't even think of the last
time I traveled like this. But yeah, Amy inspired me
to travel light and so I am! Normally, I always have like two bags, no matter how long a trip is. I will always have a carry-on and then I'll have a big one. I'm so excited to just breeze by. Oh, I also can bring my Global Entry card because I'm traveling alone, so let me go grab that. Yes, I am heading to San
Jose slash San Francisco to go visit Sarah. I haven't seen her since the holidays and so we thought we would do kinda like a trip together because I haven't seen
her in such a long time. Check this Global Entry out. I am flying into San Jose, which is where she lives. And then she is going to show me where she works, where she lives. And so I can finally see what her side of the world looks like. And then we are traveling
all the way to Oakland. I think it's like an hour drive. And then we are gonna stay at an Air BnB. But yeah, this weekend
should be super fun. I'm so excited. So, yeah, I gotta go get an Uber right now because I'm about to be late. ♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪ ♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪ - So I just landed in San Jose and I saw Sarah's lovely little home, and she packed her bag and now we are here in San Francisco. And we are at our lovely
Air BnB here in Rockridge. It is perfect for two people. Here is the bed we'll be sleeping on. A little desk area, which
will be nice in the daytime. A cute little kitchen space. We've got a kettle. We can make some tea, perhaps. And, we've got a full
fridge with a microwave. So, yeah, Sarah is just
gonna finish getting ready and then we're gonna do
a night out on the town. Oh, man, last night was so much fun. We had dinner, oh, that's cute, I like it. - [Sarah] It's super chill, I do too. - Last night was so much fun. We started off, where did we start off? Oh, we went to the Golden
Squirrel in Oakland. - Oh, that's what it's called. - Yeah!
(laughs) I only remember the
name because there were squirrels everywhere. I was like, wow, they're
really going for the theme. We danced so much. - That was so fun. - Yeah, it was really fun. - The first ten minutes
was just our high school. - Yes, literally, they were playing hip-hop songs from our
era, from like 2005. - I didn't even know that was a thing. - Yeah, right? But we literally knew every
single song that came out. We were like, "We know this song!" - Every song
- "Oh!" - "We know this song!" I loved 1015 because
there's so many rooms. There was like three different stages. - [Sarah] Yeah, that was cool. - And they were all distinct as well. And then our friend, Segundo,
was deejaying the mainstage. And then we saw the Ying Yang Twins. I woke up and I was like. - Took a nice walk to Trade Joe's. - She got me oranges. She's like, "What do you
want from Trader Joe's?" I was like, "Advil and oranges."
- I was gonna ask what kind of eye drops you wanted-- - Aww, that's so nice!
- But I didn't want to get you out of your half sleep. That place is promising
for the eye drops you need. They might be overpriced though. What are we doing today? We're gonna go get chicken sandwiches at Bake?
- Bakesale Betty. - And strawberry shortcake and then, we're gonna go, what cemetery is it? - Oakland Cemetery. - Oakland Cemetery, yeah. (upbeat music) - [Jenn] Here we have the
famous fried chicken sandwich at Bakesale Betty. I love this sandwich! Gotta have some hot sauce on the side. - [Sarah] I can't believe we're eating. We walked for like, years. - I know, we went the wrong way. I directed us the opposite way, so I added an extra mile to our trip. (upbeat music) Here we are! We walked all the way to the cemetery. How are you feeling? - Warm. - So, we have our apple
pie from Bakesale Betty and we're gonna have it on a bench here. (upbeat music) ♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪ ♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪ - Good? (upbeat music) - Hello, everybody! It is Monday afternoon. I am back from the Bay Area and it feels good to be back home. But honestly, I could have
used one extra day in the Bay. That would have been nice. I think I was just really
enjoying my time over there. Sarah is one of those friends where even if I don't speak
to her in like months, when we do see each other, it's like no time has passed. I'm really happy that I made an effort to go out and see her because we took a love language
test during Thanksgiving and her number one was quality time. And I believe mine was
quality time as well. I just knew if I want to
fulfill this love language, I have to go make an
effort to fly out more. Today is just a day of just getting my life back together. I've cleaned the house. I have put all of my luggage away. Just basically my normal routine that I do when I get back from a big trip. I'm gonna go see my therapist today and I'm really excited
because I try and see her at least two or three times a month. If you have quite a
cluttered mind like I do, it feels really good
to just release it out to a professional. I mean, I recommend therapy to everybody. If you have the time
and you have the funds to save up and go to therapy, I highly recommend it. I even asked my therapist
if she had a therapist. And she told me that she has one. So, I mean, that speaks volumes. Also, there are definitely
cheaper alternatives for a therapist. I remember my first one
I got with my healthcare and it was only $40 per session. I know it's still like $40, but you can't put a
price on mental health. Even though technically, you already did. - [Flight Attendent] Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure to
welcome you to Vancouver where the local time is
approximately 12:30 p.m. - Hello from Vancouver! I literally just landed like an hour ago and I just got to my hotel room. Staying at the Shangri-La. It is so swanky up in here. I am here in Vancouver
with Ashley and Stephanie. We're gonna see the
Takashi Murakami exhibition at this museum that's a
couple of roads that way. But I'm so stoked because we actually get to meet him, which is insane. I don't really know what kind
of look I want to do today because it's kinda rainy and dreary so maybe I'll do something more exciting to contrast the weather. I brought this violet
glitter eyeshadow from Stila. This is called Violet Vixen. I mean maybe I'll feel
motivated to use this because it's been a long
time since I've used color. Maybe I could use this
tomorrow for the exhibition. But we'll see. Either way, we're here until Saturday so I'm so excited to explore. I hear that the Asian
food here is so delicious so I'm ready to get some gains. (muffled television chattering) - Cheers! - To Vancouver. - Ashley literally went for the fry I was stabbing and you
took it off of my fork. - [Jenn] Sisters. - And then you went for the
fry that I was stabbing. - Back in the hotel room. They gave us this really beautiful dessert inspired by Murakami. It is kinda like a mushroom structure, a macaroon, some chocolates, and a chocolate brownie. We're gonna have dinner later. - You're going to the
spa in like half an hour. - I'm getting a massage! - Yeah, dude. - I'm so excited. So what can I expect in this massage? - Just a lot of slippery,
slippery stuff going on. You know, where are the arms? You don't know where the limbs are. You don't know where she's standing. Just a lot of smooth motion. - That was the best massage ever. (smooth music) All right guys, that is the end of the Jennuary vlog. I hope you guys enjoyed. Be prepared for our Vancouver trip. Or be prepared for more Vancouver clips in the February vlog. I want to thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (upbeat music) 
(jazz music) - Hey, everyone! It's your girl, Jen, and I have a very
special guest here today! - Hi, it's Aimee! - It's Aimee, of Song of Style. Today, Aimee is going to be
styling me in her clothes, and I am so excited because
you have so much range in your fashion. - Being a Californian girl, it's definitely like casual-cool, but overall it has like
this polished sense. - We're doing three outfits today. One is an Everyday Aimee, the second is Business Aimee, and the third one is Girls Night Out. - Turn up Aimee. - Exactly.
- Like turn up, turn up. (laughter) - No, she goes all night, which is crazy. But yeah, let's go head
into her closet now. - Holy cow! - You can have whatever you want! - Oh my God, anything? (jazz music) - Do I look okay, guys? - Yeah!
- Here we are, everyday Aimee. - So, obviously, as you can see, I'm a fan of high-waisted denim, and anything that has, like, some kind of distressed detailing, that's like my thing. I love pairing denim with
like pretty, flowy blouses, because I feel like it's a
very easy way to dress it up. I would either wear this entire ensemble with like flats, pointy flats. I love anything that's pointy. And what's special about this outfit is the see-through details, the ruffles, the asymmetrical, and all
these, like, little buttons. I love accessories. So, like, I'll always a pair of earrings, or at least one earring. - I don't think I would actually, like, naturally pick an outfit like this, but seeing it on my body,
I absolutely love it. - You love it?
- I feel so refined! - Especially with this purse, man. (laughter) I think this is for an occasion where I wanna look a
little bit more spruced up, but I can still see the casual elements, especially with the denim. I think that really grounds it. Alright, so let's get
into look number two. Alrighty. Here's outfit number two, Girls Night Out. I feel very, like, sexy in this. - [Aimee] For my Girls Night Out, I love to go dancing, and I'm all about,
like, being comfortable, but still sexy. I feel like this outfit makes
you look super slim and tall, and really sexy, too.
(laughter) I have, like, these sparking elements, so I'm all about that one
earring, as I said before, plus I don't know where the other one is. (laughter) And then I put you in this, like, metallic Louis Vuitton skirt, and I feel like it plays along
nicely with the sparkles. And then also I think
this outfit is really sexy because it shows a shoulder, which is sexy but still, like, polished at the same time. I like to tone it down with the heels. Since the sleeve is too big, this is like my little
styling trick that I do. I put in a hair tie that
like keeps the sleeves up. - Oh my gosh, that's brilliant! - Some sleeves are really big on you. - I love this look. It's also very like refined, I feel elegant, I feel like this is a good
after-party outfit, you know? When you wanna go dancing,
but still look really chic. Alright, so now I'm gonna
head onto the last outfit, so I'm gonna shimmy on there.
(laughter) Alright, the grand finale! This is Boss Aimee, going to meetings. - Oh my god, this is so crazy, 'cause it's like something
that I wear every day. To see it on you...
(laughter) - I know.
- It's so weird! - [Aimee] I love wearing blazers. I feel like as soon as
you put a blazer on, you're kinda more like in
that serious mood, you know? And also polishes the outfit. It cleans the outfit. - [Jen] Definitely. - [Aimee] Because that's going on, I like to keep the rest of the outfit a little bit more fitted. So like I like the ruffle
in here, I like the leather. And normally I wouldn't like
mix too many different trends, but I think it makes it fun
to carry on the ruffle theme with the boots. - Oh my gosh, yeah, these boots are fire. Like I've never worn just
like under-the-knee boots, I always go over. But this is actually a really
refreshing silhouette on me. - Then if I were to wear like
a button-up or something, it would be too stuffy. So I just like dressing
up my T-shirts, so. This T-shirt's from my line, Two Songs. - [Jen] It's so soft, by the way. - [Aimee] And then I finish the outfit off with my Chanel bag,
it's the Gabrielle bag. And then I'm all about
stacking rings during work. So like a lot of these are like from Dior. I just also love mixing metals. And then back to the one earring trend. - This beautiful earring over here. I love this. It's got a really great contrast to it, 'cause you've got the menswear, but you got the femininity
of the ruffle skirt. It's really cute, I
absolutely love this look. Alright guys, that is a wrap on the video. Please let me know which
outfit was your favorite, or which Jen-Aimee
version was your favorite. (laughter) And, yeah, if you guys are
not subscribed to Aimee yet, please head on over to her channel. She uploads very frequently. - I'm trying. - We also filmed a video on her channel, where I style her in my outfits. That one's gonna be really fun. So, yeah, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one. Bye! - Ciao!
- Mwah! (jazz music) 
(mellow hip hop music) - Hello everybody, good morning. Welcome to the second
half of the February vlog. So here's the deal. I have been vlogging pretty consistently, but I haven't done an
intro for any of the clips. So I'm just gonna try something new and just kinda fill you in
on what happened already. Let's start off with
the NBA All Stars game. I got invited to go by Discover LA. And so they gave me two tickets. And so of course, I had
to bring my brother. He loves basketball. Literally it was so awesome to get see him freak out about all the players. Just been doing my normal
routine of exercising. I did a private session
with Ellen and Fran. And that was really fun. Normally I work from home. But I tried to go to a cafe, and so I did some work there with Amy. I grabbed lunch with my friend Bambi. And it was really nice
getting to see her in the day. The only times I've seen
her were at nights out, so it was really refreshing
getting to see a friend during the daytime. And then after that, we went to LACMA, because it was just a couple blocks away. And it was just really refreshing
getting to go to LACMA. It's been, I wanna say, like
two years, two or three years, since I've been there. And so I haven't seen a
lot of the stuff there. I went to Santa Monica
with Ben on a random day. We decided to take
Cheeky out to the beach, and it was so refreshing
getting to see her just run her heart out in the sand. So I guess that leads me up to today. Right now I'm getting ready
to go to lunch with Sophia. We are going to Botanica. I've only been there once and I remember really enjoying it. They have a really good brunch/lunch menu. So I'm stoked to go. Also I have an announcement
for everyone living in LA, on March 10th, I will
be attending A Rare Day, I will be doing a talk on 10 top tips on making your
channel the greatest it can be, and I will be doing a
little meetup afterwards, and I'll also be selling stuff from Eggie, so you get to see the clothes, touch 'em, and you get to hang out with me. I will leave the info
in the description box, so please go check it out. I can't wait to see you guys there. It's gonna be a pretty intimate thing, so grab your tickets while you still can. Jackie Aina will be there,
Stephanie will be there, Kandee Johnson, Aja
Dang, Ellen, Fran, Pau, are gonna be selling their closets. It's gonna be just a really
great day empowering women. And hopefully I will get to
meet a lot of you guys there. So please come. (mellow music) This is some serious moody lighting. But I'm not mad at it. I am at Nickelodeon studios. I just read for a potential
cartoon that I might be in. But we'll see. My expectations are pretty low. But I'm just so glad I got to
go inside the whole studio. It's so freaking sick. I grew up watching Nickelodeon
and all the cartoons, Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Dog, Ren &amp; Stimpy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, okay I'm just literally listing off all the cartoons I watched. It's so cool. So, yeah. I tried out for a part,
we'll see if I get it. If I don't, not the end of the world. I like how I didn't have
to get all gussied up. I did very minimal eye
makeup and gloss balm all over the lips. - Cheers.
- Cheers. - Champagne's coming.
- I need coffee, right. - Right now we are at
Emeline's bridal shower, We're at Daily Dose Cafe,
about to have some food. (heavy beat music) Emeline! - Love you guys so much. Let's have a great day, today. - Cheers, yay!
- Cheers! (cheering) - So, I won. - [Camera Operator] What'd you win, Jenn? - I don't know. - [Camera Operator] Okay. (gasp) - Wow!
- Whoa! Oh my gosh! - Oh my God I love this. - [Camera Operator] So beautiful. - Oh! Could be like a earring. (laughing) - [Camera Operator] That'd be so intense. (gasping) (screaming) - Aw!
- Aw! So beautiful. - Thank you guys so much. - [Jenn] Aw. - Good morning everybody. Here I am on set. I am with the lovely Amy. She is assisting me today. She loves to steam. - I do. (laughing) And I love to squat. So we got both right now. - We're shooting Eggie drop number four. I have all my accessories laid out here. Yeah, it's gonna be a good day. (mellow r&amp;b music) (feet stepping) (clanging) (pouring) Morning. (sipping) Ahh. Mm. So Amy has been giving me
these homemade Raw bars. I believe this is Aimee Song's recipe. And I have been just eating all the ones that she makes me, so thank you. They're so delicious. I woke up at 6:50 a.m. in the morning. I have just been feeling more
inspired to wake up early since I'm reading this book
called The Power of Habit. I've learned that throughout the day, 40% of your brain is just
doing things out of habit. Like your brain just automatically knows. So if you create good habits,
then you can really lead a super productive life. And that is what I'm trying to do. So one thing I wanna
do is waking up early. Because when I wake up early,
it makes me want to work out. And when I work out, it
makes me wanna eat better. And when I eat better, I feel better. I've just been running around
for all this Eggie stuff, and maintaining the channel, and still trying to balance everything. But I was feeling pretty
low the past couple of days. And I felt like very just
sensitive to everything. And lo and behold, I got my period today. So that explains a lot. I mean I don't want to excuse
my mood swings for PMS, but Jesus Christ, it's like clockwork. A couple days before my period
I'm just like, I don't know, I'm just very on edge. I don't know if anyone is like that. But if you are, please,
please let me know. Tell me I'm not alone. - We've got a coffee machine from Tart? - [Jenn] Yeah, Tart. - They usually send lipsticks,
and things like that. But this time it's a coffee machine. - [Jenn] I know. - I hope the coffee's
as good as your brows. - [Jenn] Thank you so much, Tart. This is a first for us. We've never gotten a coffee machine. - Something that we really use. - [Jenn] Mm hmm. He loves coffee. - I do love coffee. So we're very happy about this. - [Jenn] It will fit perfectly there. - Everything's silver, though. - [Jenn] I know. Do you fancy an espresso? - I think I do fancy an espresso. Yeah, I just went to the post, the PO box, to get Jenn's packages. There's always plenty. As much as it's very that
we get sent a lot of stuff, some of it is, like getting packages with little TVs inside.
- TV screens, yeah. You get four eyelashes
and television inside. No one's gonna use it. Your not gonna sit up and watch the same advert over and
over for like a year. Like, you throw it away. This day and age we shouldn't
be doing things like that. - Yeah, at this point. - But other than, you know,
we got a coffee machine. - But I mean this is cool, though. I mean, getting something
that actually functions that we can use over and over is great. Oh my, they gave us so much! Wow! - You wanna use filtered water
so the coffee tastes better. Here we go. (machine humming loudly) - [Jenn] Wow. - I think this is the first time I've ever opened one of your
packages and got to use it. - [Jenn] Yeah. (laughing) - Now you do the first taste test, babe. Pop it in there. (ice clinking) - Ooh, that's nice. Ooh. - Mm, I like it. - I like it too. - Maybe it's like the
decaf one or something, we're like-- - Oh, can you imagine. - It's not doing anything. - Yeah, it's actually not
doing anything at all. - [Television] I was the
first audience for this film, and it really was about
getting to go home, at the end of the day. You know, some of this time
I was working on Campio. (traffic passing) - We are on a little
outing with Ben and Sam. Hi! - Hello. - AKA Joffrey. - Hey, Joffrey. We're heading to the
little farmer's market in our neighborhood. We're gonna get some
food, and lots of samples. (groovy hip hop music) Oh my gosh, so here are
the Silver Lake Footsteps. They're right over here. Wow. I think it goes up to
four stories of stairs. So this is awesome. - [Ben] That's my girls. Shipoo. - We're having a little
bit of a hummus feast. Wow, we've got some of
the best flavors here. This is my personal favorite. This is the Garlic Jalapeno. - [Ben] Garlic Spread/Basil. - [Jenn] This one's really good too. - [Ben] Basil. - [Jenn] Three Layer
Dip, which is phenomenal. This one tastes like a pizza. Sun dried tomato Garlic. And then we also got a vegan cheese which is called Herbie Vore. - [Ben] I think by the end
of this tasting session, we've all got decide
to from top to bottom. - Oh, ranking system? - [Ben] Yeah, so think
about that as you eat. This one's very hard to top. - Mm. (crunching) Wow. (mellow lounge music) (restaurant patrons mumbling) I'm at Boiling Point
with my big bro James. Perfect food for a rainy day. (mumbling) It's so good. All right, so here we are
at the Puente Hills Mall this is my childhood
or our childhood mall. We spent a lot of hours
here when we were teenagers. Especially me. I've had
all my first jobs here. Like I worked at the ice cream store, I worked at the sushi sports bar, I worked at two smoothie shops here, and I worked at the Forever 21. - Yeah, you made your rounds. - And at Johnny Rockets. I worked at every store
in this freaking mall. - You're like on the hall of fame. - I wish there was. (laughing) Okay, here we go. Wow. - [James] The smell. (sighing) - Oh my God, it smells so good. (sniffing) It smells like pretzels and... (sniffing) - It still smells the same, though, right? - Yeah, it does. That same mall smell. (mumbling) Oh my God! Sarcasm on. Sarcasm off. Aw, Hot topic has become a store just filled with these Pop figurines now. A complete different store
than when I was here. Now we're at another store and look. These Pop figurines, we can't escape them. But this store actually
has a lot of selection. And we also got these. (laughing) Of all the games, James
chooses to play this one. Every cup is a winner. - It's like the most soulless game. (laughing) Oh, damn it! Oh! That's so loud. (laughing) - [Jenn] That's so loud. (mellow r&amp;b music) (guns shooting) - What are we gonna do? What is that? (screaming) (laughing) (clicking) I am back home now. It is 11:20, I got back
maybe 30 minutes ago. And so I was just winding down, getting ready for bed, but
tonight was so much fun. I can't believe we just
walked around the mall. But we literally went through
every store and every corner, and it's crazy how much
that mall has changed. I wanna wake up bright and early because tomorrow I've
got Barry's boot camp. Yeah, I'm going with Amy, so
that should be a lot of fun. I don't know, these days
I get really excited to go to workout classes. Cheeky, say goodnight. (mellow lounge music) Signing in to say goodbye. I just entered all the
clips into my laptop and I'm gonna spend the
entire day editing this for Sunday. I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching. Cheeky, do you wanna say something? Okay, good chat, good chat. All right, if you guys
would like to tell me what you guys are up to in
the comments down below, please let me know how are
you spending your day today? I'll be in bed editing. It is raining super hard, so it's just a good time to
take advantage of this weather and be a homebody. So, yeah, let me know
what you guys are up to. I will be answering as many comments as I possibly can when
I upload this video. So thanks so much for watching, and I'll see you guys next one. Bye! Muah. (mellow jazz music) 
(jazzy music) - Hi, everyone! It's your girl Jenn, welcome back. Today, I am doing a very
much anticipated episode of What Would Jenn Wear. If you are just tuning
in, this is a segment on my channel where you tweet
me your fashion dilemma, and I try my best to answer it. We are currently on the 13th episode. This is crazy. But yeah, we've got a
slew of fashion dilemmas, and before I get started,
if you are not subscribed to my channel, the button
is down there, hit that, become a gem today, and let's get started. Isabel asks, what would
you wear for a picnic? Love you and your videos so much. Aw, thank you. So, if you've been watching
my channel for awhile, then you know how much I love picnics. I just love eating outdoors. I love eating indoors too,
but something about, like, having a fresh breeze while eating is just a really great sensation. So, here is my picnic outfit. I decided to rock some
cute little overalls, because they're loose and
comfortable and great on the go. Underneath, I wore this
off-the-shoulder top, then I threw on a white
cap, just in case the sun is a little intense, and then
I rocked these new Adidas for a nice sporty feel. I think this outfit is
perfect for picnics, because it's just comfortable,
and when you are outside and you just wanna have
fun, outfits like these are just perfect. Also, I haven't been on a
picnic since Valentine's day, so I'm definitely overdue. Next up, I've got a question from Cornhub. What would you wear if you
were in a punk music video? I love this question. I thought it was very original, thank you for sending that over. So, this is my punk-inspired look. For this outfit, I had to
bust out this latex skirt from Dolls Kill. I've had this skirt for,
like, a couple of months now, but I had trouble styling
it, so this question was just the perfect reason
to play around with it. I decided to wear this bright
orange top from Pleasures. For accessories, I piled
on the silver jewelry, and then added some fishnets
to really spice it up. For shoes, I just wore these
boots with stars on the back, but ideally, I would have
loved to worn some Doc Martens, I feel like that would have
been more true to, like, the punk nature, but if I'm
gonna be completely honest with you, I sold all my Doc
Martens because they were just so uncomfortable, I just
didn't have the patience to break them in. Like, I wore them a good, like,
five or six times, but just, my feet couldn't handle it. So yeah, just imagine I'm wearing
Doc Martens for this look. The next tweet comes from Sugaglow. What would Jenn wear if
you gained a little sum sum in your midsection but still
trying to look cute and sexy for the summer? LOL, help. So, I actually was in this
predicament last summer. I'd gained, like, a good 10
to 15 pounds and, y'know, I was still filming and
shooting and still feeling cute in my outfits, but on days
when I just felt, like, extra bloated and just extra
chunky, I would just always go to a flowy maxi dress. I know you would feel like this
wouldn't be the item to wear when you're feeling, y'know,
bigger, but it's just so slimming, and this dress is from Misa. I absolutely love the pattern
because it really hides every food baby and it's just
very forgiving to the body. I love the fact that the
sleeves are off the shoulders, so it adds a little coverage to the arms, and the elastic part on the stomach gives more shape to the body. I decided to wear some
comfortable heels with this look, because height always
counteracts any extra pounds, and then I rocked these
fun bobble earrings to bring more attention on the face. I think the way that you
dress yourself really affects the way you feel in an outfit. Even when I gained, y'know,
some weight last year, it was all about how an article
of clothing fit my body. In the end, it's all about the fit. Question number four is from Faith. What would Jenn wear to an art festival? Love you! So, I picked this question
out because I genuinely do want to attend an art
festival this summer, so, really praying that it happens. But this is my outfit for the occasion. I decided to style this
outfit around this floral off the shoulder top with
these fun billowy sleeves. I think that the use of
rainbow colors on the sleeves are a good representation of art. For my bottoms, I'm
rocking these denim shorts, and then I threw on this woven beret, because I feel like all art
connoisseurs should own a beret, it just goes hand in hand. When you're critiquing
art or admiring art, just a beret, really just,
y'know, ties everything together. The next dilemma comes from Gem. What would Jenn wear
for a styling workwear in a media company? I feel like media companies
or even, like, PR agencies, you're allowed to really wear
stuff that's more relaxed and just a little bit more modern. So, this is my take on business casual. I kind of met somewhere in the middle with this black and white ensemble. I'm rocking this lightweight
patterned blazer, and I feel like it's still professional, but has a young feel to it. Underneath, I'm wearing a button-down. It's a little sheer, so if
it's too sheer for where you work, definitely wear
something that's more opaque. For bottoms, I'm wearing
these black skinnies, I think they're very tailored
and just streamline the look. And then and I rock these
heels from The Kooples, they are just, like, my
most professional shoe, and yeah, this is what I would wear if I worked in an office. I have never actually worked in one, but I do visit a lot of
them for my meetings. So, the last question comes from Paula. She asks, I'm having a
hard time styling culottes. I love them, but I think
they make me look shorter. How can I style them? Thank you! So, I'm pretty short
too, I'm five foot one, and that doesn't stop
me from wearing culottes or whatever, like, fashion
trend I wanna try out. I think, in the end,
it's all about the way something fits on you. For this outfit, I'm wearing
these, like, wide-leg bottoms. They're a little bit long
to be considered culottes, but my advice for styling
both of these pieces are exactly the same. When you're dealing with a wider bottom, definitely wear something
more fitted on top. If you're feeling a little too short, always just throw on some
heels, that's, like, an easy, no-brainer solution, and since
this is, like, a summer look, I threw on this big straw hat
and wore some gold jewelry. Alright, guys, that concludes this episode of What Would Jenn Wear. If you would like to be
featured in the next episode, feel free to write your fashion dilemma in the comments down below,
or tweet me @imjennim and use the hashtag WWJW,
and you might be featured in the next one. I want to thank you guys
so much for watching, and have a beautiful rest of your day. I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (jazzy music) 
(smooth jazz music) - Hi everyone! It's your girl Jenn and
today I am finally filming the how I lost weight video. If I'm gonna be completely honest, I kinda put this video off
because I know diet and nutrition can be a very controversial topic online. First off, I'm not a dietician,
I'm not a nutritionist, I just literally used these tips that I'm about to share
with you and I lost weight. I can't guarantee that
it's gonna work for you because everyone's body is unique and some bodies just react differently. All I know is that these tips
have helped me lose weight and that's all I can claim. So now that's out of the way, let me just give you
some stats about my bod. Last year in 2016, I was
the heaviest I ever was, I was 120 pounds and for my
frame, that really showed. And now today in 2017, I
am a 100 to a 105 pounds. This took a full year to lose the weight so please do not expect
this to happen overnight. It is a gradual process. The only advice I can give
you is to start today. Start on your next meal
and don't look back. So I'm gonna rundown the 10 tips that have contributed to my weight loss. A lot of it is common sense but sometimes you just
need a little refresher. My first tip is to find healthy foods that you actually love eating. It's not realistic to have a salad for every single meal for
the rest of your life. It's just unattainable. Go out there and go on a food tour, find the healthy foods that you just freakin' love
eating and create a list. So throughout the years, I've learned that I love broccoli, green
beans, mushrooms, tofu, I can eat so much of that
and never get sick of it. Don't force yourself to
eat that dry kale salad if you don't like dry kale. And I don't go out of my way to eat healthy foods that I don't like. For example, I don't like
cucumbers, I don't like tomatoes, and I don't force myself to eat it just because it's healthy. I just avoid them and
eat other healthy foods and it's really worked out well for me so go out there, create
a list, and stick to it. The second tip is very important, it is to have no distractions
while you're eating. I know it's like second
nature at this point to get your hot pile of food,
turn on the TV or laptop and just tune out and eat. Your brain takes around 20
minutes to realize that it's full and when you're not paying
attention to your body, you don't know when that time comes. And I've noticed that
whenever I watch something and I'm eating, I tend to
eat even more and even faster and a lot of the times,
I'm finished with my food but the show's still going so I'll go back and get seconds just so I can
like, let the good times roll. But if you wanna lose
weight, it's easier to know what your body is saying to
you when everything is off. I always try and stop
eating right when I get to the sweet spot and
that is the spot where I'm not hungry anymore but
I'm not like, completely full. It's that really nice in between and I feel like the
Japanese have a word for it but I don't know, that's
where I try and stop eating and that's really helped
me maintain my figure and it's tricky, believe me. It's really hard to get that spot because it's so tempting to just eat until your stomach's like, "Oh god, No!" like, that's where I used to love being. It's been easier to maintain my weight because I'm not
overindulging and overeating. This next tip is something
that I've using since college and it's to have smaller plates and bowls. So if you look in our shelves you'll notice that we have two sizes, we've got a normal big one for Ben, and we've got a smaller one for me. We've nicknamed it the baby plate because it's just little. And yeah, when I have a bigger plate I tend to want to over-portion myself. I wanna cram and fill the plate so with the smaller
plate, I can still cram all the food in but it's actually the perfect portion for me. Tip number four is to get a water bottle. I feel like drinking water is one of the most common diet
tips but it's so true. When you are hydrated,
you're not really that hungry and for me, I love having my sippy cup because this makes me drink so much water throughout the day. And it's the CamelBak specifically, I love the like, the bite valve and I love how you have
to like suck the water in. I go through maybe three or
four bottles of this a day and so I make sure that I'm very hydrated. Whenever you have a craving, chances are you're just dehydrated or you're bored and so whenever when I have
like, a hankering for some chips or like any sort of snack or something, I will chug half a bottle of this and I'll wait 15 minutes
and if I'm still hungry then I'll go have a snack but most of the time, after I drink it, I'm completely fine and I
can wait 'til my next meal. I also should mention that
I don't drink any juices, I don't drink any soda or like milk. I only stick to water,
unsweetened tea, black coffee and like, soda water,
that's pretty much it. My favorite is La Croix,
it is so delicious, it has zero calories and it just gives you that carbonated kick
if you are missing it. My fifth tip is to never skip any meals especially breakfast. I feel like I have kind
of programmed my body to just wake up hungry so I
always, always have breakfast. There's a reason why it's called the most important meal of the day. It's because it kicks off your metabolism. And I've noticed that
when I skip my breakfast, by the next meal, I am so hungry I end up making really
stupid food decisions so I'll just end up overeating or I'll order something
like, really gnarly like nachos or something. It's easier to make mindful food choices when your body is not starving. Personally, I only eat three meals a day. I know some people like to have four to five smaller meals a day but for me, it's just too much effort to think of that many meals to eat so I like to keep it simple,
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. For my breakfast, that's
when I have most of my carbs, I'll have beans on toast
or like an egg wrap. For lunch, I can treat myself of a sandwich, a burger, whatever, But for dinner, that's when
I'm kind of the most strict. When I was at like, my most
motivated to lose weight, for dinner I would never have
any refined carbohydrates so I wouldn't have any pasta, I wouldn't have big fried rice dishes, I would probably stick to veggies, and a protein and that's it for dinner. And then for breakfast,
I'll have my carbs. This next tip is something
that I really struggled with when I first moved back to LA in 2015. I was eating out at
restaurants all the time and I was ordering Postmates all the time. When you go to restaurants,
even if you order the healthy dish, you don't actually know what the restaurants put into it. Sure, there's a list of ingredients but you don't know how
much butter they put, you don't know how much
oil they put or msg, the restaurant's objective
is to make the food taste as good as possible
and keep you coming back and it's a business so it makes sense so that's why it's just easier
to just cook your own meal. You know exactly what you put in it and I know it's like easy to say like, "oh, I'm not a
good cook, I can't cook" but you just need to cook three recipes. Learn how to make three healthy recipes and then you can build from there. It's impossible to just
completely avoid restaurants for the rest of your life,
it's not gonna happen so when I do eat out, I
like to have a balance. So I have this rule called The 2 Rule. So I either pick an appetizer, an entree or an entree and dessert. I'll never get all three, or if I do get all three,
it's like a special occasion but yeah, you don't need all three, you don't need an appetizer,
entree, and dessert that's just a full package. You just need two. Tip number seven is to
reduce your alcohol intake. When I was at my heaviest,
I was probably drinking may two or three times a week
and it definitely showed. There's a lot of empty calories in alcohol and the problem with me was I
would always have drunchies. When I would come home drunk, I would just open up my cupboard, make a snack, throw it in the microwave and I would just eat all of
it to soak up the alcohol and then go to sleep. But I mean I don't even know
if that's scientifically proven but basically, I would eat all that shit and I would wake up the
next morning, hungover and I would always order a burrito. Yeah, it was like a vicious cycle. Obviously, I still drink. I like to go out and have a good time but I only drink once a week now. If I'm gonna drink more than once a week, then I'll only have one drink, that's it. And every time I go out,
I only have a vodka soda with fresh lime, that is my
favorite drink of choice. But then I call it the Skinny Minnie because it only has the
calories of the vodka and I think a shot of vodka is what, like a hundred calories, and that's it! This next tip is about snacking. I don't keep any snacks
that tempt me in my house because I'm the type of person where if I have Hot Cheeto Fries or just any form of Hot
Cheetos, I have to eat the bag. It's kinda like, calling my
name as I'm just in the house. So I just like to cut the temptation and not have any of it in my house. If I really, really want them, then I'll have to get off
my ass and go by them. But if they're not in the house, then I'm not thinking about it. So I know I've been blabbing
a lot about food and diet so I'm gonna talk about the next obvious thing which is exercise. I like to exercise around
three to five times a week and when I was training super hard, I was going five times a week and that in combination with
all the tips that I said made me really shredded. For the first two months, a lot of that weight came
off because of those. I know the ratio is something
like 80% diet and 20% fitness but when you put the exercise in, that 20% goes a long way and when you are just
combining both those forces, a lot of it just melts off. So it's really important
to find a form of exercise that you hate the least. So whether it is kickboxing,
palates, swimming, running, whatever, for
me, it is to train alone. I love going to the gym
by myself, it's become my own little sanctuary. Each of my workouts are
around 50 minutes long. I am obsessed with this
app called Seconds. I have talked about it
in a previous video. It's basically like my
little personal trainer. So I like to start off
with 20 minutes of cardio. I'll use my high-intensity
interval training workout so I'll be on the
StairMaster for five minutes just walking normally, and then I'll run on the StairMaster for 30 seconds, and then I'll walk again
for a minute and 30 seconds, and then I'll run again for 30 seconds. And I'll do this six times
and then I'll cool off with five minutes of
walking on the StairMaster. And by the end of this, I am
literally drenched in sweat and now I'm ready for
my strength training. For my 30 minutes of strength training I won't get too into it but
I basically have created a bunch of playlists that work different parts of my body out. So I have three full body workouts, I have one for the waist, one for the abs and arms, it all depends. I feel like I'm just
gonna do a separate video on that workout because
if I incorporate that into this video, I feel
like it'd be way too long. So be prepared for my
workout video in the future. These days, I only workout
three times a week. It's because I'm not
trying to lose any weight, I'm only trying to maintain
the body I have right now. I'm really happy with my weight and I'm not trying to change anything. I've noticed that since I've been doing the strength training and the weights, it's been easier to just
keep my body the way it is. My last tip is to find motivation that really resonates with you. Back in the day, I feel like a lot of my weight loss inspiration
was quite superficial. It was just about like, "I
wanna be skinny for my birthday" or "I wanna be skinny for Coachella." Once I've found a deeper reason
of why I wanted to be fit, it just propelled me to stay in shape. The reason why I exercise
and I tried my best to stay in shape is for my mental health. I've noticed that back in the day, when I wasn't working out consistently, I had a lot more breakdowns,
I had a lot of meltdowns and I was just very sensitive to stress. Now that I workout three
to five times a week, I don't really have that
issue that much anymore. I'm not perfect but I am so much better than how I was last year. Some days, I just wake
up and I am just bummed but before, I would just kind of be bummed and just let it be like a sad day. Now, if I'm feeling sad
or if I'm feeling anxious or stressed, I hit the gym
because 95% of the time, I come back after a
workout and I feel better. Ben is the most important
person in my life and he lives with me and I
hated being the Debbie Downer. Ben is generally a super positive person and having a bad attitude
is just so contagious and I hated bringing him down and so I knew that this is something that I really needed to work on and exercise has helped me so much. So find a reason that
really sticks with you whether it's because
you wanna be stronger, you want to be able to lift something, whether you wanna run a marathon, or you wanna have inner with yourself, once you find a deeper goal,
it's easier to stick with it. Alright guys, those are my top
10 tips on how I lost weight. Honestly, the first month
is the hardest, I swear, but once you pass that hurdle, it's all downhill from there. And then once you start
seeing physical changes in your body, and once like
pants start to feel loose, then it becomes even easier. If you'd like to leave any diet
tips in comments down below or words of encouragement,
I'd love to hear them. I just want this to be
like a positive place for people to talk about
fitness and nutrition. If there's something that
you don't agree with me, it would be awesome if you just said it in a constructive way as opposed to a way of just attacking me. My point is not to shame
people into losing weight. It's just for the people
that need that extra kick to wanna live a healthier lifestyle. So I hope you guys enjoy
the rest of your day. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (smooth jazz music) 
(upbeat music) - Hey everybody! It's your girl Jenn and welcome back. Today I have a very large
thrift haul for you. Because in my previous
video, where I get ready, I asked you guys what types
of videos you like to see and a ton of y'all were like, "Bring back the thrifting videos!" So, I went to my Goodwill
Outlet Center and it was actually my first time at the outlet. And an outlet and a normal
Goodwill store is different because when you go to the outlet, there are no price tags on anything. Everything just comes in a
big blue bin and you just kinda have to fend for yourself
and at the end when you checkout they just weigh
everything and roughly every item comes out to like a dollar or two dollars. But if you get like a heavy
jacket maybe it'll be like five bucks but regardless you get a deal. But it's definitely intense. I wanna show you guys
all the goodies I got, so let me know you my loot. First up, I want to talk about this white sweater I purchased, this
is by Zara Man and I love that it's oversized and super comfy. It's kind of got like
an athletic feel to it because of the two thick
black stripes in the arms and it just sits really
comfortably on the body. I was debating whether I
wanted to crop it or not but I decided against it
because I like the length. It hits mid-thigh and it
looks so cute with some thigh high socks and a beanie. All in all this a really
casual comfortable piece to add to my wardrobe. Coming up next, I've got
this lovely red jacket. This is very boxy and cropped
and I love the silhouette. It's got kind of like a denim jacket but instead of denim its in
like a wool material. I absolutely love the color red and I love pairing it with outfits that I think are too plain or need a little extra oomph. See here we have a very
large striped polo. This is definitely
something my dad might wear. Maybe that's why I like it. It's got kind of like
a familiar feel to it and it's also something that
I feel like Unif might carry. This print is very like teenage skater boy from the 90s and I love it. I would rock it with the
buttons all the way up and untucked with some trousers. I feel like it would give off
some cool androgynous vibes. Moving on to something
more feminine and flowy, here I have this floral blouse that is definitely channeling OG Sarah vibes. I feel like she would have thrifted a shirt like this and I love this print. It's got pops of red, it's got polka dots, and it's a little gody but I love it. I noticed that a couple of
the buttons were missing and so I decided to knot it
and I feel like it really just elevates the whole look
and makes it more modern. So I've got another flowy item. This is a beautiful black
floral dress and I'm just gonna call this my dinner date dress
because it's sleek and sexy. And definitely something
I would rock on a night that I wanna be more dolled up. I love maxi dresses that have an asymmetrical hemline
because generally I just think its more flattering on petite girls. That way you're not
drowning in the fabric. I also love the subtle white floral embroidery on the bottom of the hem. I feel like if I wore it with
like a white baby doll tshirt, it would work really really well. My next item is this sick wind breaker. I love the pattern because it
reminds me of an oil slick. It's got all the colors in one, like the moss green, the
purple, the burnt sienna, and I just think it looks very retro. It's kind of in the silhouette
of a member's only jacket, but this is a lot more light weight. In fact, this a really great
like summer night jacket because you can just kind
of scrunch it up like this and just stuff it in your purse. And when it gets cold at
night you can unravel it and be warm, and look stylin'. So I'm pretty sure that
this next item is from the children's section. This a tiny graphic tee for
a soccer league and the shirt fits like a baby doll tee
and I think it's so cute. It's in that thick material cotton turns when it's been washed so many times. I love the tiny graphic on the side and the large statement image on the back. And I'm just a sucker for athletic wear even though I wasn't very sporty as a kid. I was in track for like a
year, but that's about it. So yeah, I'll spend the
rest of my adulthood collecting little athletic tees like this. So I've got a couple
of bottoms at the store and the first pair I wanna talk about are these black chino pants. These are also children's/tween clothes. Yeah it says the size 10 in husky. They remind me of Dickies,
but I like how they're cropped and I just generally think
that these are a better fit. These are great for me when I want to take a break from jeans. This next item, I'm
super stoked on because I found American Apparel denim pants. These fit pretty similar
to me as the disco pant, but these actually work better on me because they're more cropped. They fit right at the
ankle and I just love this. This is just really exciting
for me because I remember when American Apparel was poppin'. I used to wake up super early
for their warehouse sales and wait in line with all my friends. Just to get like defective
American Apparel clothing. I am very happy that I now found
the jeans for a dollar now, so we've come a long way. So this next item I scooped
up for Ben actually, in hopes that he'd like it. I love this type of tartan. It's very like true to
the lumberjack style. It's thick, I just think
it looks really worn in. It looks very vintage but it's actually from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. I think this is a really
great layering device. I feel like flannel will
never go out of style and so that's why I wanted
to add this to my collection. So the last item I have
is this floral robe. It's in a very clean, cream color. It's got this vibrant,
yellow floral embroidery on the lapels and the sleeves and overall looks very very regal. I know that this is going to
be an amazing beach cover up or just a shawl to put
over summer dresses. It used to have shoulder pads
but I just snipped them off to make it look more modern. Alright everyone that
concludes my one dollar haul. If you guys enjoyed this
please hit the like button, write a comment in the
comments down below. I'm also gonna be styling
all these items in like a $40 outfit challenge video because I can easily make outfits out of these. They're all gonna be under 40
bucks, so stay tuned for that. I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (upbeat music) 
(mellow music) - Hey guys. Welcome to the May monthly vlog. I'm just finishing up work. I'm exporting my Mother's
Day Gift Guide video, that should be out on Sunday. I'm just enjoying some YouTube videos and eating my favorite
chips, Hot Cheeto Fries. These are the bomb. These days, I'm really
learning how to portion control because, even last year,
if I got a bag of this, this would be gone in one session. But, with this bag, I've
been spacing this out between three days, so I'm
pretty proud of myself. Obviously, gotta use the
chopsticks to make sure that your knuckles and your
fingers do not get red. It's so embarrassing when
I go get my nails done and they're just stained
red because of the Cheetos. It is currently 6:39
p.m. and Ben's actually helping Stephanie film a couple things so once he wraps up, I
believe we're going to go to the outlet that we've
always wanted to go to, it's called Citadel and
there's like a big Nike store there so we wanna get some workout gear. Yay, we made it to the Citadel Outlets. Turning into the parking lot. There it is. The large Nike outlet. So many people inside already. This is exactly what Ben needs. - [Ben] No, these are too tight. this will show you--
- Are they? - [Ben] This will show
you every little detail. - (laughing) TMI. (ambient chatter) Oh, thank you. (singing) (applause) (dog growling) (toothbrushes vibrating) Just got to Steph's
house and Mochi is here. They're reunited! Aww! Cheeki's at the bar, she's, I'm underage. (laughing) - Cheers.
- Cheers. - [Jenn] Yeah wow. - [Steph] Here, I'll find
another one, let's see. - [Jenn] We've got Roxy
in the mix and Segundo. - In 2017. - [Jenn] Givin' the people what they want. - Ay, give the people what they want. - Here you go.
- Party foul. - Oh that's right.
(talking over each other) - I am currently just doing my hair. I'm gonna go for a nice
little dinner with Emily. I haven't seen her in a couple weeks, so it's gonna be nice
to catch up with her. We're going to Au Lac, which is one of our favorite vegan restaurants. Also, another kind of random update, but we are currently in the process of leaving this apartment, so our landlord just sold our apartment to someone, so we got a 30-day notice to leave. But, it might actually be good timing because we are in the process of getting a place right now. Hopefully, the timing works out perfectly so when we move out, the
new person can move in here, and then we can move to our new home. So, just crossing my fingers that everything goes swimmingly. I know moving is pretty
stressful, but hopefully this will be our last move in a long time. Before we move, we'll definitely make sure to do an apartment tour. That's kinda like just a tradition I do with every place that I lived at. So that's something fun to expect. Alright, just got outta Uber. Here it is, Au Lac. Ermila! Hi!
- Perfect timing. - [Jenn] This is the
salt and pepper shrimp, or I guess fake shrimp,
with my lovely date Ermila. What's up guys, it's me, Silas, and Ben. - [Guys] Hi. - Got The Three Musketeers. - Absolutely, we're English boys. - Yes, English boys. - Expect delays, we're in Hollywood-mode. - (laughing) Oh my god, anyway, we are on our way to What
Comes Around Goes Around. It's a vintage store in Beverly Hills. They've got designer vintage goods. We're gonna pick out a
couple of things to shoot. Very excited, I went
to the one in New York. Gorgeous store, and now I'm
gonna head to the one in LA. - And then we're gonna eat. - And we're gonna eat. - Dim Sum! (yelling) (mellow music) - Oh, that's cool.
- Look at how cool this is. - I like.
- David Bowie vibes. (people chatting) So we're having some Dim Sum here, that's shumai, green beans, turnip cake, noodles, barbecue pork buns,
and over there, har gow. - Har gow!
- Har gow! - [Ben] Hey, har gow. - So, I just finished shooting with Silas. I'm in Sophie's place, I
guess Sophie and Si's place, but right now we are importing the footage of the look, it took us, like, 15 minutes to shoot that, and we're already coming up with something great. - Yep. - Great teamwork. - Good job, team. (mellow hip hop music) - Hi guys, it is Saturday,
currently at the Asian Pacific American Heritage Month event. I'm with my big bro, James. - Very nice here, there's a lot of people. Bit nippy, but it's lovely.
- Yeah. It's pretty cold, actually. I'm wearing a very thin pinstripe jacket and a tank, yeah, so I've got two options for jackets, Ben's and James's. Look what we have here! - Hello.
- Hello! - WallyTV, in the building! - Hi, guys. - I love.
- Of course! Go, Jenn, Jenn's our baby. Wait, I can't say you're my baby, because you're older than me, but you feel like my baby.
- I'll be a baby. - I'm such a mom, I'm such a mom. - Jenn is going on stage
for her award tonight. - [Ben] Yes! - Digital pioneer, she deserves it, you did so much, all of my friends, like, love you and follow you. - Thank you!
- Yeah! - [Ben] But she's been at
the food buffet instead. - I know, I was seeing if
there were any Cheetos left. There's only Doritos (laughs). (mellow hip hop music) - Meet a wonderful young lady who is doing amazing things in her own way, Jenn Im! (crowd cheering) - [Ben] Go babe! (laughing) - You like that, you see that? Elevator shot. - All righty.
- Hey guys. - Hey guys, we are having a little snack, a supper, at Go Pocha, yeah. It's a Korean bar that my
brother recommended, sneakily. - There we go.
- Yeah! (laughs) - [Ben] Who is he, Jenn? Who's Richard?
- It says 2016. I've been meaning to tell you, that's why I brought you here tonight, (chuckles) to finally confess. You guys, so the budae-jjigae is here, this is kinda like an army soup. They used to make this while they were out on the field, or whatever, in the pot. Over here...
- Chicken popcorn! - Yes, popcorn chicken with some fries. Meh. Walking in the rain. We're shooting a lookbook! - We've got five outfits out of five, we're nearly done. - Almost done! - She's looking great. Let's finish this off. (mellow hip hop music) - Oh my God, so I just ordered some kimchi-jjigae, aka kimchi stew, from my favorite Korean restaurant. My personal favorite Korean restaurant, it's called Yangji. Ben went to a Dodgers game tonight with a couple of his friends,
and I'm just at home, about to enjoy this delicious feast alone. I'm watching Jackie Aina. I'm obsessed with her YouTube
channel, this is her video on trends we're ditching in 2017, it's like a roast of 2016 beauty products. I love her YouTube channel,
she's freaking hilarious, and her makeup skills are outta control. So I'm going to enjoy my
dinner and enjoy Jackie and, oh my gosh, my mouth
is salivating so much, I can't even, I can't even talk right now. Oh my gosh, and they even frickin' packed banchan, oh. Okay, I just spilled everywhere. I know it looks disgusting in this clip, but I swear, it's delicious. - [Jackie Aina] All right, gonna make it look a little bit more realistic. Some of ya'll talkin'
'bout juju on that beat, no, this looks more like
bed bugs on that beat. That's what the problem is. (mellow hip hop music) (laughter and chatting) - I won this big book! But I won it, this would be amazing! - [Ben] Literally been
not even two minutes. - I know, and now I have
to carry it! (laughs) - [Ben] Nice? - Thank you, it's nice. (laughing) Wow. - Does it look like we're
all going to the same place? - Yeah, looks like a biker
gang right over here. (mellow hip hop music) Whoa. Oh my God! Whoa. Oh my God. We are at Universal City
Walk in front of iFLY. - Yep, we're about to
do this indoor skydive. - That's Ben, checking in. All righty. (mellow hip hop music) So here we are at Bubba Gumps
after a lovely iFLY session. - My goggle mark's still there. - I got a salmon dish and
Ben got the fish and chips. So I just parked up, and
now we are at Empty Vase. The girls and I are about
to make bouquets of flowers. So we'll see what kind
of arrangements we make. (mellow hip hop music) - Yeah, so we're gonna do double layers. And don't worry about the
stems being different lengths, 'cause we're gonna go
ahead and pull them apart. - [Jenn] So this is Vanan's. We're workin' on Ashley's right now. It 's like an explosion of pink and blush. All right, all the bouquets are done. People always ask me,
"Oh, when's the wedding, "when's the wedding," but I gotta secure a venue before I can even announce a date, so I'll definitely keep you guys posted. Oh God. - Oh my gosh.
- This one. - Your pube curl.
- My pube curl! Well, here I am with the lovely Claire! God, it's so windy here.
- I know. It's kinda cold, look
at you in your sweater and me in my, like, tank top. - I know, right? - Hi, guys.
- Hi, guys. We just had lunch at Plan Check
how was the chicken burger? - It was so good, so
good, good recommendation. (mellow hip hop) - I'm really glad that
you're here, I love everyone! - Today is Saturday, and
right now I am folding a bunch of little slips
that I printed out. We're doing a Truth or Dare challenge with Weylie and Sophie,
it's gonna be really fun. For example, here is one of the dares. Dare you to wall twerk. I really hope I don't get this one, that would be very embarrassing. - I'm excited for you guys. - Yeah, it's like our first collaboration. - What's your first impressions
of each other's boyfriends? That's gonna get personal. - That's a good one, huh? That's a really good one. - If they say anything
nasty, just cut that bit out. - All right, we just finished our collab. - Finished! It was so much fun. It was the best collab
I've ever shot in my life. - [Jenn] It really was,
today was so much fun. - Wait, by the time you see
this vlog, it's up already. - Yeah? Wait.
- Is it? - [Jenn] Yeah! 'Cause this is for my May Monthly Vlog. - Oh yeah, so check it out. - [Jenn] So go check it out! - Click the annotation,
info box right here. - And subscribe over here. - Leave a comment down here.
- And like the video! - This is the surprise. - Happy Mother's Day. (laughing) Chippo! (laughing) (piano music) - Hi guys!
- Hi! - We are at Quarters
celebrating Hannah's birthday. (mellow music) ♫ Happy birthday to you (cheering) - Right now I'm at Weylie's. We're about to film our Get Ready With Us. Sophia's right over there. Hello!
- Hi! - You look comfy. - Oh yeah, this is how we shoot. - But right now we're
just kind of deciding what kind of makeup we wanna do. - What are you gonna go for? - I'm just doing like pinky rosy tones. - Oh, the norm? - The norm, yeah, the youzhe. - I'm going out there, look at this. - Whoa, Pop Rocks? Yes!
- Oh, do you like this? - I do like it. - Cool, I don't even know
what color it ends up being. - Look how cute you are
with your little bunny ears. - [Sophia] Can we all get some bunny ears? - Do my signature. - [Jenn] Appa's 21st birthday. - [Appa] Chadolbegi. - Chadolbegi, delicious. We've got some miyuk
gook, which is tradition to have on your birthday
and Mom made me some sundubu because she knows I love it and then we brought little Cheeki here. My parents are looking after Cheeki because we're heading
to New York on Friday, so we're dropping her off today, so sad. ♫ Happy birthday to you (cheering and applause) - Thank you. - [Jenn] Yay! Wednesday night. - Yes.
- The Handmaid's Tale. (cheering) - What's up, guys. It is Thursday. I am currently driving to Alhambra, grabbing lunch with Fran
and Steph and I believe we're going to this place called Savoy. Apparently they're
supposed to have amazing Hainanese chicken, that
is one of my favorite dishes of all time. When I was in Singapore,
we had chicken and rice and it quickly became like an obsession and apparently this place
does it really well, so I'm very excited to go. So we sat down for less than five minutes and our food's already here! Here it is in all its glory. The Hainanese chicken rice. And with the lovely Fran and
of course my gram (laughs). (upbeat music) Today is the first
official day in New York. I'm back, I feel like I was just here, but it feels good to be
back especially with Ben. But today I'm getting ready
because I'm going to Beautycon. This morning was a little
difficult to get up even though it's only a
three hour difference, it goes a long way in the morning. Like I put my alarm at
nine and I kept on snoozing until I got to 11 so, not ideal. But yeah today's the day with Beautycon, I'm doing two panels. One is about love and
relationships and the other is with Revlon, we're
talking about beauty trends in the space and how you
can achieve each look. (mellow music) Definitely does take work, a lot of work, but so fulfilling in the end. (mellow music) All righty, so Beautycon
is officially over. This was probably one of the
most smoothest Beautycons I've ever done before. Just did a couple panels and
got to meet a lot of you guys. Thank you so much to
everyone who came out. Oh wow, that's so nice! - They sent you treats and cookies and I think if we're here
for too long we'll be quite a lot bigger. - So yeah we are just
getting ready to go out. We're gonna meet with
Denny for some dinner and some cocktails and
then we're gonna meet up with Robin and Matt as well. - And maybe John. - And maybe John.
- His other friend. - Everyone's here, people
to see, places to go. - I am in Heaven. ♫ Bae, you're all that I want ♫ And you're lying here in my arms ♫ Finding it hard to believe ♫ We're in Heaven (yelling) - This is how you do it. Cut! We're done. This is how you do it! (laughing) That's how you do it,
that's how you do it! (mellow music) - What's up, guys. Today is a Tuesday. We're actually having a
little going away party, it's also an apartment
tour that we're filming and this is kinda like the grand finale. The whole gang's here, Chippo's excited, the pizza just came, very excited. Got some Hot Cheeto Puffs. Oh yes, wait, oh this is the one I want! This is the vegetarian one! Nice. - Pizza, pizza pizza.
- Pizza, pizza pizza. - What's up, guys. Currently about to do a
facial at Kate Somerville. It's been awhile. Skin needs some lovin'. So it is Saturday night. Currently having a Macbook
set up day, yeah party! And Segundo is the host. - Ay, I'm out here, setting up Macbooks. - [Jenn] You're literally giving
the people what they want. - Giving the people the Macbook! - Been a long day. - [Jenn] It's been a long day. - We're getting there. We're almost there, 30 minutes. - [Jenn] Slowly, but surely. I got a new Macbook right over here. Give myself a upgrade and this one is going to the lovely old Benny. This served me so well. - Excited about it. I don't necessarily want the pink marble. - [Jenn] No, it comes off. It comes off. - But I'm not very
excited, that one's dying. - [Jenn] But yeah we're
watching some Overwatch videos. This is the next game
we're gonna purchase. - Yeah it's good, it's like a movie. - I'm over here being a
stereotypical computer technician. - [Jenn] You really are! - And making people watch
videos of video gameplays. - All right, get a good
look at this apartment. This is the last time you'll
ever see it like this. Anyways, today Ben and
I are gonna be spending the entire day and all
of tomorrow, just putting all our stuff into boxes. Honestly, packing, it does stress me out. I'm a very visual person, very
affected by the environment. My parents are gonna come
later to help us pack which I'm so thankful for. Thank God and then by Tuesday,
hopefully everything is done and we'll be at the new place. (speaking in foreign language) Look at my forehead!
- I'm shiny, too. It's all the sweat from the packing. - It really is. But we are here at Som. My brother and the rest of my family. (speaking in foreign language) What's up, guys. It is currently Memorial Day Monday, I am on the road to Sarah's mom's house because Sarah just graduated. Woo! So she's having a little party today so it's gonna be a nice little reunion. It's gonna be a ton of great
food and familiar faces. As you can see, I'm in a different car because in the beginning of the month Ben and I got into a car accident. I obviously didn't vlog that
because I was pretty upset. Someone T-boned us and then
they freaking drove off so that wasn't a very pleasant experience. So we filed the police
report and then the insurance took care of everything, but they weren't able to
get our car out the shop until like a few days ago so now I'm driving a Hyundai Elantra and it brings back a lot of memories because I used to drive a Hyundai Sonata. I forget how smooth this car drives. Ben stayed back because
there's just so much more work that's left to be done. It's insane how two people can
accumulate that many items, or I guess, mostly me. I have a lot of stuff
that I'm trying to purge and giveaway. Tomorrow's the big day for moving. I can't wait to just get situated. (laughing) Yum, congrats Sarah! - Thank you. - [Jenn] You did it! - We did it! - [Jenn] We did it! - Just sit up a chair here man. - I know right, (laughs) I might as well. - This is real food. (baby squeals) - So we know that we're here to celebrate Sarah's graduation. (cheering and applause) - All right guys, so today is moving day. The movers have been
here and our apartment is officially gutted out. I'm standing in our empty bedroom. Here was the living room, over here was the guest bathroom, and then over here was,
of course, my office. Had a ton of amazing memories here. (slow melancholy music) 
(upbeat music) - What is up you guys. I'm currently on my way to go on a sh, I was gonna say a shoot and a set. A shet. But I'm gonna go shoot with Wengie, today. She is coming out with an app, so she is doing a bunch of
exclusive content for that and she has me as one of the guests. So yeah, it feels good
to be back on the road, in my car. I feel like my car's
been in the shop forever because it has. It took like a month
to get everything done because I guess they were missing a part and et cetera, et cetera,
so things got delayed. But it feels so good to
be back in my own space. The other rental car I had, didn't even have a, didn't have Bluetooth and
since I have an iPhone 7, it doesn't have an auxillary cord. So, I was just listening
to a lot of radio. So now I'm caught up with
all the top hits and stuff, which is good. But it feels so good to be back in my car. Look who I'm on set with. - Yes. - Yeah. - We're shooting for my show. She was on it. She was so cute. It's like a style show and I got to style her. - It was really fun. We had the magic ball and
so it had two occasions. So we got velvet. This is the outfit that we
ended up loving the most. - Yes, spoiler. - Alright, so I am on my way home and this shoot went so awesome. I had a blast there. Wengie's amazing and so talented. I can't believe she filmed 18 episodes in a matter of eight days. That's insane. Her work ethic is just very inspiring. But yeah, I am currently
on my way back home. I'm gonna film a summer lookbook. Or I guess finish up the summer look book. Yesterday, I was only
able to film two outfits, so today, I'm shooting
the rest of the three. Alright, little update. It is almost 2 pm. I'm currently in the car because Ben and I are
just finishing up errands. Now Ben is picking up a print
from this guy named Frank. He does amazing prints. He does a lot of our friends'
photography prints as well. So we're grabbing a little
something from there and then, we're gonna
frame it back at home. But meanwhile, since we're already out, I'm gonna film this outfit
for the summer look. And then going grocery shopping and then getting frames, so really just hopping around. - We're making a chicken Tiki masala. - Dinner! It's the best recipe ever. Ben has perfected it. (chill music) This is the glam squad! David did an amazing job on my makeup and Jenelle Sorry.
- Hi. - I just won't let you do the steps wrap. But Jenelle did my hair. It's incredible. Alright, this is the first look. Hair and makeup is done. I am just obsessed with everything. I wish I could just show you
guys the highlighter right now. It is popping. I've got the red lip and these kind of like, like sunset eyes.
- Warm. - Right.
- Yeah. (jazzy hip hop music) - This is look number two. Look like a little princess. (jazzy hip hop music) Okay I can't believe we
shot this thing over there. Wow, thank you Ben. Hello, and so I'm back from my shoot. I know we went from super
glam to absolutely nothing. But yeah, the shoot went super well. I shot an editorial
with the Advant Society. My girl Vannga just set
up this sick photo shoot. The theme was modern Renaissance and I feel like we really
ticked all the things that we wanted for the theme. Five killer looks. The team is incredible. But yes, I'm at home now. I am in my office and I am
just chucking away with work. Also before I forget,
I need to show you guys my shelves for my office. Okay let me focus. Alright here we go. My office is slowly
starting to come together. This is gonna be my nice
little filming room. I still need to organize the shelves in a way that they look more,
I don't know, aesthetic. And then I just ordered a big print to place over here on Society 6. And yeah, I think once
I get the shelfy down, we'll be all good. So this is gonna be perfect for doing intros, favorites or whatever speaking portions
that I feel like doing. Also, closet update. Did I show you guys this? But I pretty much hung
all my shorts up here. I just a million of these clothing pins to hang the rest of my bottoms. So that's going to be another
project for another day. Good morning everybody. Today is the first day of Vidcon. I just checked into the hotel. I'm staying at the Hyatt and they gave me two big queen sized beds. But I'm staying in my room alone, so I guess I could just
kinda hop in between the two. Right now, it is 11 o' clock. So I should probably go
to the convention center, pick up my badges and
head to my first panel. (chill jazz music) it is the second day of Vidcon. Also the last day for me. Vidcon is gonna be so fun, just quite hectic. It's a lot of rushing around. Today, I have a meet and greet at 9:30 am. I think this the earliest
meet and greet I've ever done. But, we'll see who comes. After that, I have a panel and then doing a couple of
interviews with some publications So today is gonna be a pretty full day. I don't know if I'm gonna head out to any of the YouTube parties. Cause I kinda wanna be home
by at least 10 pm tonight. I don't know if I told you guys this but the reason why Ben
couldn't come to Vidcon was because we couldn't
find anyone to watch Cheeky, so Ben just stayed back
and he's manning the house and taking care of our baby girl. Alright, Ingri is done. We're having breakfast. - Yeah
- Yaay. - I'm so hungry. - I know. What do you have for breakfast? Did you have a little muffin? - Air. - Air, yeah, absolutely nothing. Running on nothing. I'm running on a big cheese tart that Ashley has provided. Alright, getting to the buffet. Let's see what's on the menu. Alright, got some fruit. Gonna pass on this. K. Wow, that looks so good. This looks delicious. (chill music) - Hi guys. So I thought I'd vlog for a minute because today is a very,
very important day. Mark it down, 25th of June. It's Cheeki's birthday. Yes it is. So I'm taking her to the shops to get her a birthday cake, some treats, dog toys, a new dog bed, the lot. Cause she deserves it and it
is a lovely, painfully hot day but we're gonna treat Chippo today. Ooh look at all that. You're gonna have a good time in here. Have you chosen a dog bed? What do you think? Do you like the look of it? Ooh you like it, don't you? Now do you want that as
your birthday present? You're only getting one bed. Are you sure? Ready. Alright, you know you like it, cause you won't get out of it now. Oh it has to be that one. - [Woman] Look at the pug. - [Ben] Cheeki. What's this? - [Jenn] Aww. Oh my God. Happy birthday. - [Ben] Look at her
waiting like a good girl. - [Jenn] Oh my God. ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ Happy birthday dear Chippo ♫ Happy birthday to you - [Ben] Okay. - [Jenn] He's like where do I get started. Ooh. - [Ben] Ooh she likes that. Did you just have some? - Yeah, it tastes like a normal cookie. - [Ben] Have a bite. - Really? - [Ben] Yes, have a bite. Fuming. - Tastes like a cookie. (chill music) - [Ben] This is amazing. Cheeki loves hanging out with the dog. - [Man] Yeah. - So Jenn, you're gonna sit here. - [Ben] Get comfy. - So I'm here with the
doctor with a hint of style. So what was the verdict with my teeth. - No cavities and your gums are great. - Thank you. I do have a problem with
clenching though, apparently and the first question he asked me was if I eat almonds, which is not very often but you guys need to
watch out for raw almonds. Not good for your teeth. - That's right. Raw pure almonds, it can break your teeth. You can have either soaked
almonds or sliced almonds. No problem. - Ah okay, my teeth are feeling so clean. I can feel every gap in between each tooth and it just feels glorious. If you have not seen a dentist
within the past six months or haven't gotten your teeth
cleaned, professionally. I highly recommend that
you do twice a year. It's just a part of self maintenance. You gotta do what you gotta do. Ben and I had to rush home because the shades
people are finally here. We got our blinds installed
today, in the house. I need to show you guys when I get home. It looks so good. And then now, I am heading
on over to Anna's house, because it's time to do my base. These roots are growing out. At Anna and Jesse's house
getting my base done. Look very attractive. But this is beauty. There's Jesse. The host with the most. Oh my gosh, so Anna just
busted out her bag of wigs. - Look. - [Jenn] Woah. That one's cool. - These are from actually
one of the fashion shows. - [Jenn] What color is that? It's almost like a green. Wow. - This is the one I custom colored. - [Jenn] Woah. Oh my gosh, can we put
these on me one day? - Yeah. - Wow. - Of course, it needs to still be styled. - Yeah uh huh. Do you guys love it? I look like a fricking anime character. I look like a SIM right now, with my shirt and my random pink hair. So I'll just shuffle to you. Ta da! - They have so much fun. - [Jenn] I know, they
really played it out. - You know what's crazy? I still feel like they
have energy to play more. - [Jenn] No seriously. - But they literally played like crazy. - [Ben] You're best friends
now, aren't you Chippo? - Are you ready? - [Jenn] Are you ready to go home? - She doesn't wanna go. - [Jenn] Bye Navigation. You have the cutest name. Navigation! - That's the new name. - [Jenn] Hmm, is that beans I smell? Oh my God. This is my favorite breakfast. - [Ben] Baked beans and a
little bit of baked ham. - [Jenn] This looks divine. Look at my mans in his robe. - Hey, in case you forgot my name. (laughs) - Yes, beans! Starting my morning off right. Some beans on toast. So we're gonna try the gym close by and then get the film
the rest of my B roll for June's favorites. I have a shoot with Miss Bish and then getting my nails done and then having dinner with Stephanie. So I was gonna call her Grim but that works too. - [Ben] Both works (chill music) - Alrighty, we just finished shooting. This is Christina! - Hi. - We are at Echo Park Lake. What do you think? - It's beautiful. I love it. - The fountains, the sun, the wind. We are at Wolfdown right
now in Silver Lake. Let's see how the food is. This is the black rice. So you can see underneath. I think these are like mushrooms and stuff but the rice underneath is black. There's some cauliflower there. - [Woman] I am so hungry. - [Jenn] Hey y'all. - [Woman] This is delicious. - [Jenn] Having dinner with my girls. Got Soph and Erms - With my bib? - [Jenn] Look at this romantic setting.
- I know. - [Jenn] And next we have
the beet salad with avocado and grapefruit. Here we have the chicken dumpling
underneath a bed of greens and there's shrimp in there too. Here we have some spicy Korean chicken along with a nice coleslaw with peanuts. The next dish is a miso black
cod served with sushi rice. Yum. Morning everyone. Currently on my way to pick up Sophia because we are going to
the Americana in Glendale. I have always wanted to shop there. It's been a very, very long time. Actually, I don't think
I've ever been there but I saw their directory and they had amazing stores. I have to go grab a couple of things. I have to get a dress for a wedding. I'm going to one Sunday. And then a birthday gift for Dawn. She turned 24 so, I wanna
get her something nice. She just moved into a new apartment so I'm gonna get a nice housewarming gift. You know, just stuff to
have around the home. This morning, I just uploaded
my June monthly blog part one. Hit the cards to watch it. Get to see my home and my trip to Tokyo, whole lot of stuff. (chill music) (speaking in foreign language) Oh my god, we're finally
here at Din Tai Fung. I've tried to come here so many times but the wait was so long. - I always come at a good time. So I always get a seat. - Sophia says these are the
best greens beans in the world. We'll see. - It's the best greens beans in the world. Cheers. You taste that garlic? - The garlic is potent. - Yes. So this is called XiaoLongBao - XiaoLongBao. - Soup dumplings - Yes. So there's soup in here. So you gotta be careful so

(chill music) So Ernie just made us pancit and his - [Ben] It looks so good. - [Pancet] His favorite or his specialty. Chicken adobo

Oh my god. - [Ben] So good isn't it? - [Woman] The chicken's (mumbles) ♫ Happy Birthday to you. (cheers) - [Jenn] Make a wish Leah. - I wish for more dog treats. - [Ben] Such (cheers) - [Jenn] Cheeky, stay. Oooh. - [Jenn] Good girl. It looks good. I want a bit of that. - Frosting you know
- It looks really tasty. - [Ben] This is so Oh he loves it. He loves it. - Stay. Money. - [Guy] Money's so cute. - Good girl - [Ben] This is so funny. - He did not like his
cake a few years ago. Cheeky, is that too big for Cheeky? - [Jenn] No it's good. - We all, I could give you a big life
- It's so funny. (chill music) - [Jenn] Having breakfast
with my girl Brianne. She always takes me to the best spots in this area. First Ostrich Farm and now Botanica. - I know, I'm the road map. - [Jenn] Yeah. (laughs) - Gentrification. (laughs) - Hi guys. - Hello. I'm driving. - Jen's driving. She's treating me to a little relax. - Yeah, Ben went to Home Depot earlier to set up my shelves. - Yeah. - So, I'm driving. I'm taking the wheel, y'all. - She's doing that. We are going to Samy's camera store, which is a great little
camera spot in Hollywood. We are gonna get a lens, a Canon 24/70, which
is a upgrade to our 24. So we're very excited about that and maybe a couple other bits to see
- Yeah. - We wanna get the MD filter. - Yeah, that's good for like
shooting in direct sunlight, which we can't avoid here in L.A. It's just constantly really bright. - [Jenn] ♫ We're heading in - [Ben] ♫ To Samy's, Samy's. - [Jenn] Each time I go to Samy's, I always stop at this photo. I don't know why I love it so much. It's Guns N' Roses eating
spaghetti before a show. That's amazing. So we found the MD filter. - [Ben] And it is very cool. This one is basically magic. This has three filters within it. So you see here, it gets lighter.
- Wow I'm excited. - [Ben] Keep twisting. - [Jenn] It's even lighter. - [Ben] Now it goes back to dark. - [Jenn] Wow. - [Ben] Magic. It's three for the price of nearly three. (laughs) - [Jenn] Go sister with Dawn. This is her belated birthday dinner. We've got spring rolls as our first dish. 
(mellow music) - Hi everybody, it's your girl Jenn, and today I have a huge
thrift haul for you. Yesterday I decided to pop
in to my local Goodwill because I just wanted to find something fresh and unique to style
for my upcoming lookbooks, and I ended up getting a lot. If you enjoy thrifting videos like this make sure you're subscribed to my channel. The button will be somewhere down below. It would make my day if you did. So, please do that. So, with that said, let's get into it. So, I'm gonna start off with
this cream blouse first. I really loved it because it had this knot detail in the center. It kinda gives it like a
school girl vibe which I enjoy. In the spring I really like tops that are easy and breezy because they give a nice flow to any outfit. Also, this brand, Pins and Needles, is actually an Urban Outfitters brands. So, I basically got this for three bucks. Next up I have this floral blazer here. It's not much of a looker on the hanger, but it just translates so beautifully. I feel like floral and
spring just go hand in hand, and this blazer just takes the cake. It originally had huge
shoulder pads underneath, but I just decided to cut them out, and I actually safety pinned
the side of the sleeves just to tailor it a little bit. This is my version of tailoring. But I feel like it really slims down everything and gives it a modern feel. It just looks like one of those couches you would see in the 90s, and I like that. That's the vibe I'm going for. Moving on, I have this
dark floral camisole. I feel like camisoles and slip dresses are still heavily trending right now, and I thought this would be perfect to add to my wardrobe. I plan on wearing this layered, either with like a baby doll t-shirt, something lacy, or even a turtle neck. I've been really digging
the way that that looks. It looks layered, it looks dimensioned, and just makes any outfit a
little bit more interesting. The crazy thing is I
actually picked this up in an abandoned basket at Goodwill. It was just left on the floor. I'm pretty sure there was
nobody like attending to it. So, I picked it up, and you know, it's kind of a lesson to look at the racks and also the baskets on the floor. This is another item that
was in that abandoned cart. This is a neon ribbed tank, and I thought that this would be a really brave choice to
add in my spring wardrobe. Neon seems kind of like
an intimidating color, but it surprisingly goes with a lot. I feel like fluorescents really go well with white, black, just anything neutral. I feel like it's like a really interesting pop of color, especially for the spring. I think I might actually crop this and wear it with some
high waisted anything. Next up we've got this
sleeveless houndstooth blouse, and it's in this really fun
metallic fabric which I love. It adds like a nice glimmer to your look. I've always been a huge fan of houndstooth because of it's mod backgrounds. I feel like this is something
that Twiggy might wear. I mean, if this came as a shift
dress that would be perfect. But yeah, I just love the print, it's really elevated, and
effortless, and totally chic. So, my next item is gonna be this cobalt blue button down. Originally, I thought the
graphics were equations, and that excited me,
but with a closer look I discovered that this
is actually just random squiggles and doodles,
and I like it anyway. It's actually embroidered,
so that really wowed me because a lot of time when
into making this button down, and it makes me appreciate it even more. I would probably wear
this as an outerwear piece as apposed to just like
a shirt on it's own because it's kind of oversized. I feel like it would layer really well, especially with like a
graphic T or something, or just tied around the waist. Cobalt blue is always
like a great accent color. So, I've always had a
thing for sparkly stuff, and I cannot say no to this sequin top. It's in this really nice blush color, and it's got these translucent sequins beaded throughout in
the front and the back. I hate it when something beaded is only in the front because, I mean, you gotta give the back some love too. I would probably wear this to any sort of daytime event like
a nice brunch or a lunch. It kinda has those vibes to me. For some reason I really
love the look of linen, and when I saw this top,
Ben actually told me to put it back, but I
decided to take it anyway. And this fabric is also really breathable, and soft, and it has this really cool graphic on the back. It's like the story of a surfer, and he kinda looks like the
iconic surfer, Duke Kahanamoku. He has a bunch of restaurants in Hawaii. There's like a street named after him. But he kinda looked like him, so I was look cool, that's
like some Duke paraphernalia . But yean, I really enjoy this top. This is my dad on vacation top, but instead of my dad wearing it, it's me. So, my last item is my wild card. Okay, so don't judge it by the hanger. It's not a pretty sight, but here are my red fleece printed pants. They've got stars, and all the stars have different prints on it. It's got zebra, leopard, dots, it's kinda all over the place. But it's one of those situations where something is so ugly that it's kinda cool. I thought I would be able to make it work by just pairing it with something very, very, minimal like a black tank. I thought, I don't know, it kinda reminded me of those juicy terry cloth fleece sweat pants that
are coming back in style. But I thought, with this print, it would be completely unique. Also, I did wash these pants
with scalding hot water. And so, they smell of detergent now. But honestly, putting it in
my cart was pretty gross. I was like, I don't know who's worn these, but now they're on my body. All right, so that
wraps up my thrift haul. I actually had one more item, but I ruined it in the wash. Look how cute it would've been. Maybe I can, I don't even
know what to do with this. This is like for a toddler. But this would've been so cute with like jeans this color as well. But yeah, I learned my lesson. Don't wash wool in hot water. But yeah, that concludes my haul. If you guys enjoy this video

(upbeat music) - Here we are, on the road. It is July 2nd. We are on our way to Orange County!
- Woohoo! - Today, we are going to a wedding, which is why we are in our gowns. Emily's brother, Charles,
is getting married to the lovely Michelle. I haven't really been
to that many weddings so this is gonna be a first for me where I actually know the
people who are getting married, so I'm really excited. (upbeat music) (audience cheering) - Oh my god, look at
Sophia, she a crying mess. So Sophia and I, we changed dresses. Sophia got full, so now she's wearing
my flowy little number. - 'Cause you guys know
my indigestion problem. And then Jenn's is like, whoo!
- I'm fine. - Let that belly out.
- I let the belly out. I love this dress! - I know, it's so pretty, right? (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Happy Monday everyone! I'm here with the lovely Vincent. The Photo by Vincent. He does amazing photography
for my girlfriend Jill, he recently shot Heart and Arnold. They drove all the way to Malibu. - All the way to Malibu! - Yeah, now we're shooting
together for the first time! Yay! We're on outfit number two, it's like a white-on-white number, and we found this lovely
corner in the Arts District. (mellow electronic music) Alright, several hours later, I am at Ashley's house warming party. I've got my little drink here, and people are slowly
starting to filter in. Her place is so beautiful! This is her living room. Mochi's outside. She's got here Rare sign here. This was a birthday gift
from me and Stephanie. Here's the karaoke machine, which I know that we will be abusing. Grem is here. - Hello
- She has arrived. - My sister's residence. Segundo's back there. - Talking to my bro! (mellow electronic music) (laughing) Happy Fourth of July, everybody! We are at our friend's apartment complex hanging out by the pool. I am trying my best to get my tan on. I am trying to get two shades darker, especially for my body. I don't know if you can see my makeup, but I'm trying to do a festive
red, white and blue look. The red is kind of like
more of a reddish brown, and then the blue is all over
the bottom half of the eye, and I'm very pleased with the
way it came out, I'm happy. Sophie's here, she made it!
- Hi! - [Jenn] Of course, got
the hot Cheetos fries. Oh, these are the best flavor. (mellow electronic music) (gasps) Oh my gosh. Oh, Cheeki's really not
liking these fireworks. Oh no. It's okay angel. This is Cheeki's first Fourth of July and our neighbors ain't
playing with the fireworks. But yeah, our neighbors
are really going to town with the fireworks. Oh my god, oh my god! Don't know if you can see,
but that is the exterminators! If you live in a house,
then I'm pretty sure that everyone kind of deals
with it during the summer, but this heat has been
attracting the ants, the spiders, the insects,
all into our home, and I don't really have a
terrible fear of insects, but when I found ants in the bed, I knew that it was just
time to call a professional, because that Raid wasn't really working. So luckily my friend Jesse
recommended this exterminator. So hopefully this kind
of cleans up the house and makes sure that
there's no creepy crawlies. And today Ben and I are
heading out to Terranea because it is our three-year
anniversary tomorrow! So I'm really happy. It's the longest relationship
I've ever been in. - [Ben] We're back. - [Jenn] We're back! - [Ben] Terranea! - [Both] Terranea! (upbeat jazz music) All right, we made it

leave, and I was like, ugh, - Yeah, you were

like, c'mon! (chuckles) - I was like, just a
couple more bites, please. - It's nice to eat this
and relax this time - Oh my God, that's so good. I feel like I only update you
guys when we have food, but - [Ben] (laughing) The
best part of the day. - [Jenn] It is, the best parts of the day! Over here we have the chicken wrap, and over here we've got a pokebowl (upbeat jazz music) - So, we just finished a couples' massage, (moans) (giggling) You look like you got way too much sun! - I do, don't I? Well I definitely did. (laughing) That along with the massage. - We were literally laying out for a good three or four hours. - Yup. Too much for my English skin. - Yeah. - Half Irish, as well.
- Well look-- (laughing) The white robe is making
it look even worse. - It's not as bad, it looks worse on here. - (laughing) I feel like that's
really what it looks like. You're just in denial. (laughing) (upbeat jazz music) - Jenn was a bit cold, so they brought up - [Jenn] This huge torpedo. (upbeat jazz music) Happy 21st Birthday Jesse! Got salmon. What is this called? - Cacio e pepe. - [Jenn] Cacio e pepe. Obviously we've got the
healthy section over here. (laughing) - Not so much over here. - [Jenn] No, back to pasta over here! - Going for the bib tonight, 'cause that on the white, it's not worth it. - [Jenn] Doesn't mix. ♫ Happy Birthday to you! (upbeat jazz music) Happy Sunday everyone! Currently in my workout gear because I'm heading to the gym with Ben, I had just like a couple of weeks of just eating whatever I want and not
going to the gym whatsoever, so yeah, gonna go to the gym and then gonna go grocery shopping after. Also, I just wanna show

Coachella blanket is back and we have this side as well. Here's our tour. (Jenn laughing) Have another seat over here. (Jenn laughing) - [Jenn] We've got some food. Wow, this looks delicious! (Wah laughing) Wa on the grill. What's on the fire? - So over here, we have
some marinated chicken, and over here we've got
marinated pork belly. Got some corn. Yeah, that's it for now! - [Jenn] The vegetables are
here, So-so is chopping. Sophie and Silas did such a good job washing these mushrooms,
look how clean they are! They're so bright and clean
- You're so supportive! (laughing) ♫ Happy Birthday to you, ♫ Happy Birthday to you, ♫ Happy Birthday to you (cheering) (upbeat '60s music) - What's up, everyone, and happy Monday. Little late start to the vlog today, just went to a meeting all
the way in Century City, so that ate up like a good
three and a half hours of my day, but after,
came back and I filmed four outfits for 'What Would Jenn Wear?" I did a total of six
outfits, and Ben and I thought it would be good
to just take some shots around the neighborhood
while changing in the car, but, my God, it was so hot,
like it was such a struggle putting on and off the clothes, like everything just wanted to
stick, and it was pretty funny because prior to this day, I
was just talking to Ben like, man, this heatwave is
awesome, I love the heat, blah-blah blah blah blah,
but I guess it turns out I just love the heatwave because I was in AC most of the time. But today put me in my place,
the heatwave is very real. But yeah, I've been really happy that we finished the outfits,
that's a huge load off my back because we are heading to the
Hamptons on Thursday night, I'm going with Revolve, I'm
so excited for that trip. I can't believe it's already been a year, since the last one, but yeah! Should be a lot of fun, but
I just wanna make sure that I wanna have all my work done before. Also, I've been kind of playing around with this makeup right over here, I saw Pearypie rock this
look on her Insta-Story and I had to recreate it, and
so this was my best attempt, it's like violet eyeshadow and then blended it out with some orange, I think I might do a
tutorial on this pretty soon, so I've just been practicing
the way this looks. (upbeat '60s music) Oh my gosh, look at this
beautiful sunset behind me. (giggling) I love lens
flares, they're so beautiful. It is later in the evening, and I'm on my way to pick up Weylie. We're going to have vegan sushi, I'm very excited to see what that entails, I'm assuming there's gonna
be lots of vegetables inside. So here is our appetizer,
this is the gyoza! - [Weylie] Gyoza, yes! It's uh... I already forgot what's in it. (Jenn laughing) There was something but I don't remember. [Jenn] Yeah, I forget.
- Is this soy free? Dairy free sauce.
- Yeah! - Okay. - [Jenn] It's all vegan! (upbeat '60s music) What's up everyone, it is Wednesday, I am currently on the road,
driving to the Roosevelt Hotel, Hourglass is having an event there. I'm not sure what they're promoting, but I'm excited because I really love their highlighters and their blushes. I am driving because I'm actually just trying to take a
little break from Uber, I mean, I do like Uber and Lyft, but, there's just something
really nice about just being in your own car,
being in your own space, and it also kinda saves money, because those Ubers definitely add up. Any updates? Oh God. Yo, this sun is just gnarly. (upbeat '60s music) So last night was a little
bit of a fail at vlogging, I went into the hotel and I just got completely overstimulated,
and I forgot to-- or, it's not that I forget to film, there's just a lot of stuff happening, like we're seeing people, there's like stuff being passed around, like food and it's just hard to really
capture everything solo, but yeah, I just wanted to show you guys what they were actually
promoting, it is... And they are promoting their
new refillable lipstick. They provided all the
colors and I am so excited. So the cool thing is that
all these little sticks go inside this gold tube
here, and you're able to just kind of pop it in
your bag or whatever. I still have yet to try it, but I'll let you guys know what I think. Also, here's some photos from last night, there's me and Ashley, gettin' busted. And here are the fingerprints
of all the different colors, or I guess just ten of them. But yeah, I just wanted to come in, and just sign off for this part of the vlog. Today I am just running around, I feel great because I've got fresh hair, this is like the best feeling ever, but Ben and I are going
to New York tonight, our flight is at 11:50pm,
so we've got all day to pack and just get the whole house situated. I believe my brother and
my friend Danny are gonna take turns house-sitting our place, so I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one! Bye! 
- So 2017 ends tomorrow and every year I like to
do a recap of the year on what happened and how I felt but I didn't want this
review to just be a montage of my highlight reel because
I've done that in the past and I just wanted to push
myself and create something new and most importantly,
something that was honest. So here we go. This time last year was crazy. I was scratching milestones off, I was getting closer with my circle and I just got engaged to my soulmate. Sparks were off the roof, energy was high and I truly felt like I
was on the top of the world but as always, I felt this anxiety, this feeling that told me that things were too good to be true and that I would eventually lose it all. So I did what I do best
when I feel anxious. I kept myself as busy as I possibly could. I put a lot of energy into my channel and of course I focused a lot
of energy on my relationships. I'll start with my family first. As I get older, I realize how important my connection with my family is. I made it a resolution to see
my parents as often as I could even if I just dropped down for dinner. I cherish my oma and opa with all my heart and I think I appreciate
them a lot more now because we've never had
a relationship like this. When I was younger, I didn't
really see my parents that much because they were always working and today I feel such a
strong connection with them and I owe them everything. Even with my big brother, I didn't talk to him much growing up but this year, we are also
the closest we've ever been in our entire lives. It almost feels like I'm
discovering a long lost sibling and it's so cool getting to respark what I thought were dead nerves. A highlight of 2017 was when
my family met Ben's family for the first time and this was one of the
most nerve-racking moments. I asked myself, would they get along, what do we even talk about but we powered through
and we had the dinner and like most things
in life, it worked out. It wasn't at all like the negative story I painted in my head. We laughed, we ate and it's a
dinner that I'll never forget. Throughout middle school and high school, I always longed for that
perfect group of friends, a magical ride or die group where you just did everything together but I always just kind of floated around from group to group. I'm in my late 20s now and it trips me out that I have finally found my circle. I have an individual relationship with each one of these people and I would do anything for them. This year, I learned what
I want in a friendship and how I can be a great friend back by listening, reaching
out, asking questions and by always making time for them. I feel like time is the biggest
gift you can give someone. Every time I hang out with my friends, I feel full, I feel
acknowledged, I feel safe. I feel so lucky that we get to live this crazy life together. Like Christopher McCandless said, "happiness is only real when shared." (calm music) Then we have Ben. Wow. Where do I even begin? He is the love of my life, my
soulmate, my future husband and getting to travel and
work together as a duo has been such a gift. His videography and
photography has evolved and it's a point where Ben now knows more about camera equipment than I do. It's very impressive. This year, we moved out of our apartment and bought a beautiful home in LA. I guess all that saving
definitely paid off and I'm so happy to be
living here with my man and our darling Cheeki. Ben and I made it to our three
year anniversary this year and it was a huge deal for me because it officially marked
my longest relationship ever. My past relationships
would always kinda crumble around the two year or the
two and a half year mark and I almost felt like it was some sort of weird curse that I had. So it was a big deal when
Ben and I passed that and I know we're gonna last because I'll do anything in
my power to make this work. After I got engaged, I
became very introspective. I started to reflect and I
wanted to finally address things I've been desperate to fix about myself. We all have our inner demons
and issues we need to work on and before Ben and I tie the knot, I wanted to focus on how I
could be my best self for us. So this year, I focused on
my relationship with myself. I started to do things that
I've always wanted to do so I got my first tattoo in New York. I feel like the design really mirrored what I wanted to focus on this year. In August, I launched
my clothing line, Eggie which is freaking crazy. This is something that
I've been working on on the down low the entire year so when it finally launched,
it felt so cathartic and the day of my launch was so beautiful. I was truly touched by all
my loved ones that showed up and it meant the absolute
world to have their support. Since then, I've had three drops and each one of them had me
step out of my comfort zone. I love the fact that I get to
collaborate with my friends with each collection and I'm so blessed to have my whole Eggie team
working on this with me but as I was piling more
and more onto my plate, the stress began to consume me. I actually had a few meltdowns this year where I felt shattered and burnout to a point where
I felt so much self-loathing. This was the moment I had to take my mental health more seriously. One new habit I picked up was meditating. It helps me slow down my racing thoughts, forces me to focus on my
breath and to be present. I continue to exercise regularly because whenever I'm in a mental funk, I like to just sweat it out at the gym and I feel like $100 after I leave then I went to therapy
for the very first time and I stuck to it this entire year. I've always struggled with my self-worth, confidence, anger and depression. Honestly, YouTube saved me. When I first started, it was my outlet where I felt like I could be myself and share what I love to the world but being on YouTube
has its pros and cons. I think after seven years of uploading and living under somewhat of a microscope, it makes you a target
for praise and criticism and honestly, on a rough day, reading negative comments broke me because when you are
your own biggest critic, your entire soul aches when
other people pick you apart. It reinforces this horrible thought that the negative stuff that
they're saying is the truth and I knew I had to get help. I have a much better understanding
of why I am the way I am and I'm developing a thicker skin. There's still so much left to improve but honestly, I am miles and miles better where I first started and I feel so proud. I never wanna stop creating videos though because this is what brings me joy. I love being able to express
myself through visuals and sharing stories through the screen and my favorite is getting your feedback. Whenever I upload a video and
I read your guys' comments, I get so happy and I can't
even begin to explain how surreal it feels when I
meet you guys in real life. It honestly is very overwhelming because I look at myself and I think, why would anyone even show up for me and so it's been really nice to have other people that believe in me when I don't believe in myself sometimes. You guys make it all worth it for me and I wanna thank you guys
from the bottom of my heart. I learned a huge lesson this year and that's to never be afraid of peaking because it doesn't exist. Every year is completely
different than the last and I feel like you always
have different milestones and different struggles and I feel like that's how life levels up and so I don't think it's fair to compare your past self to the present and I always want to be happy and comfortable with who I am right now because I know that I'm trying my best and every year I want to just
get progressively better, I wanna become more self-aware, I want to be, I want to feel
more safe and comfortable and free to be myself wherever I go. I feel like that's all
what we want in life, the permission to feel your authentic self without the fear of judgment
and I know I will get there. I know you will get there if
you're struggling with that and yeah, I just wanted to
share these things with you. We are in this together. I wanna wish you guys
a beautiful new year. It's 2018, baby. Fresh new start and I'll see
you guys in the next one. Love you. Bye. (calm music) 
- Hey, everyone. It's your girl Jenn and
today I have a fresh batch of favorites for you. We are coming very very close
to the last month of 2017 and I'm so excited because
I love the holiday season. It's about to get very very festive. But, first I just want to
talk about all the best things of November so let's get started. My first favorite is a beauty product. This is Atomy's Rose Rain Mist. And this has been great to use as a toner. I actually got this from
a subscriber in New York, her name is Michelle and
on the note she wrote that this is one of her holy
grails and it's quickly becoming one of mine as well. And I just love the way
the mist is distributed. It's like a really fine
cooling mist and it just does a really great job
toning and hydrating. Sometimes I'll use this just
as a setting spray as well. When I just want my
face to look more dewy. You can also spray this
on your body as well. Naturally my skin is a little
bit on the drier side so this just comes in handy
when I want a refresher. Next up I've got another beauty product. I want to talk about falsies. I have been a falsies
girl since I was 15 or 16 so there's been a lot of like
fake lashes on these eyelids. And right now I'm kind of
in more of a natural subtle makeup look right now. So that's why I've been
loving these falsies by Kiss. The two styles that I
love are Lily and Jasmine and I have stocked up
on both these styles. These are really great if
you want more of a fresh and innocent look. The band is super thin so
you don't need eyeliner to cover the band or anything. It kind of reminds me of
the Ardell demi wispies but these are more perky. Sometimes with the demi wispies my eyes can look a little sleepy. Not with these guys. I'm wearing them on my eyes
right now and I just feel just like very fresh. These have been great
to use when I want more of like a natural look like this. But it's still glam. For my book favorite I have The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. This was one of the presents
that my brother got me for my birthday. He said that this book
really helped him when he was going through a creative
rut and I'm actually trying to start this new creative
project and that's why I smashed this book out. This is a very easy read. I finished this in a couple nights but I do feel re inspired. This book is really awesome
when you're going through a creative block because
it just highlights the fact that the only thing that is
stopping you from doing a creative project is you. And he calls that resistance. And resistance is that
voice that tells you to start tomorrow. It tells you that you're not good enough, or your idea's stupid. It just basically explains
that the most difficult thing about starting a project is beginning it. And it is so true. I want to say that this book
wasn't like mind blowingly good but there are definitely
parts of this book that have me feeling inspired and
ready to start my next project. If you're looking for a quick
read that's gonna give you a kick in the butt, go check this out. My next favorite is a fitness one. I recently purchased these
ankle weights on Amazon and they've been incredible
for just helping me step up my fitness game. Sometimes I just don't want
to go to the gym because it's just kind of a hassle and
I just want to work from home but I realized that I needed
to get just better equipment. Right now I just have these
little dumbbells but they're just not good enough. I wanted to get something
where I can challenge my legs and my butt so I got these
eight pound ankle weights. I just Velcro them on to my
ankles and they have been amazing for toning the legs
and I was using these elastic bands before but these
are way more challenging. I love that you can also put
them on your wrists as well if you want to do some arm workouts. You can do arm circles. You can like punch the air like this. I'm like already working
up a sweat right now but these are incredible if you want to start working out from home. You can also just like leave
these on your ankles and just walk around the house
if you want just kind of like a no brainer workout. I am always looking for things
that challenge my body more and to stay fit. My last favorite is this green tea matcha. I recently got this as a
gift from my friend Regina. Thank you so much. This has been life changing. It's been such a great way to
get caffeine in your system. Before with coffee, I didn't realize how wired I get and how bad the crash is from caffeine. Like personally I do like the
feeling of feeling hyper awake and a little bit wired. I don't know I just kind
of like being on edge. But basically what
killed me was the crash. Because after like an hour
of feeling like, I'm awake, I would crash and I would
feel really really tired. Um, not with this matcha. It's definitely more of a gradual energy. Kind of like slow release. So it just comes up and
it gently comes down. It's just very nice. I feel like this is just
better for your body. It's also very relaxing to make. You get your little sifter,
you sift out all the little clumps and then you add hot water. Personally, I like to add
ice because I just like iced drinks so I make like
a really delicious matcha iced drink and it is just
so tasty and gives me the energy that I need. I know matcha is having a huge
moment in New York and LA so I'm so happy that it's in the
comfort of my own home now. Alright guys, that is
a wrap on my favorites. If you'd like to share anything
that you were inspired by or loved please write it
in the comments down below. I'm trying to think if I
have any updates for you. The wedding planning is going. I'm not gonna lie it's
been pretty stressful. It's just a lot of like
small like details but we are having our cake test tasting this week which I'm really excited about. There's still no like wedding
dress that I really like yet. It's kind of weird because
last time I went wedding dress shopping it just felt like
very bizarre like a lot of the dresses it felt like someone
just copied and pasted my face on these dresses and I just
feel like that's a sign that I haven't found the dress that I love yet. But yes, the search continues. Then my brother and I are also going to New Orleans next week. I am so excited. If you guys have any
recommendations on what to do there please write it in the
comments down below. From food to drink to just entertainment. I would love to know
like a local's thoughts. But yeah, I want to thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye, muah. 
(jazz music) - Hey everyone. It's your girl Jenn and today I am talking about 10 of my favorite movies of all time. Obviously, you don't need to
watch these before you die. I just thought it would tie in really well with my favorite books video. After I uploaded that, a lot of you guys were requesting a movie version,
so here I am, filling that. It was freaking hard to narrow
it down to 10, but I did. These are all movies
that have changed my life or I just thoroughly enjoyed. So let's get started with he countdown. At the top of the list I have Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind. This has been my favorite
movie, since I was 15 and it's always such a pain to say it, because the title's so long, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but it is still my favorite film today. I've seen it a million times
and I never get sick of it, because this love story
is so freakin' real. It's about a couple
named Joel and Clementine and one day Joel wakes up and he realizes that Clementine has completely erased him and the relationship from her mind and obviously, he's
really confused and hurt and so he decides to get
that same procedure done and erase her from his memories. And so you see the whole process of them removing the memories. At the beginning of the film you don't really know
their relationship at all, but as they're removing each memory, one by one, you see how they fell in love and how they fell apart. During heartbreak,
sometimes you're tempted to think, you know, I wish I could just erase this freakin' person from my mind, but you see, in the film, that sometimes it doesn't really work that way. And maybe sometimes it's better that you have those memories, because you could learn from them. But yeah, it is my favorite film, very thought provoking, super surreal. I love the visuals of the film and it's at the top of my list. Coming in at number two
I have the film Rushmore. I have always been a huge
fan of Wes Anderson films, but this is my favorite one by far. Part of the reason why I love it is because it's set in a
private school setting. I've always enjoyed that setting, because maybe when I was younger I always wanted to go to private school. It's about a gifted
student named Max Fischer and he is very, very
involved in the school. He's the president of all the clubs, like in a million
extracurricular activities, but unfortunately his
grades don't reflect that, because he's too busy
exhausting his energy on everything else. But basically he needs
to get his act together. But he ends up falling in
love with a teacher at school and wooing here becomes
his main objective. And I love Max Fischer,
because he is a character that really gets whatever he wants, or almost whatever he wants,
because he's so confident and he's just like a bullshit talker. He's just this je ne sais quo to him and I love the dynamic
between all the characters. It's just like a bizarre love triangle. You'll see. Next up, I have a very
enlightening movie for you. It is called Fantastic Planet. I first saw this in college and it's one of those movies
where after you watch it you're like, whoa life
man, because it really shakes up your perspective of the world. It's about a planet where big,
giant aliens are the rulers and they take humans captive and humans are just like little pets. They're domesticated. They're just for the
amusement of the aliens and one day one of the
little humans runs away and he discovers a world where there's like other
humans living a civilization. It's just a really trippy film and I just love the animation. It's very old school sci-fi cartoons. It was made in the 70s and oh, it's also completely in French, so I highly recommend you
watch the French version with English subtitles,
because the dubbed English just sounds bizarre. It's just a preference thing. I believe you can watch it on YouTube. You can rent it. I'll leave a link down
below, if I can find it. So go check it out. Moving on, I have The Holy Mountain. This is probably one
of the most fucked up, but visually entrancing films I've ever seen in my entire life. Some parts were kind of hard to see, because they're very graphic, gory, a lot of nudity, but I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It's insane. It was kind of like watching
this really crazy dream unfold and I love that if you pause
at any moment of the film it's something beautiful or very intense. It makes you feel some type of way and I feel like that's what art is about. It's supposed to evoke
a feeling out of you, whether it's joy or whether
it makes you uncomfortable. This is one of my favorite films to discuss with other
people, because I love hearing their interpretations of it. It's coded with symbolism. For me, I thought that this film was about realizing that the world is
just a projection of images and you are the director
behind the screen. This film is a psychedelic masterpiece and I highly recommend you watch it. Not for the faint of heart though. If you are looking for like
a happy, easygoing film probably wouldn't watch it. Coming in at number five, I have The Shining by Stanley Kubrick. I normally am not a huge
fan of horror films, but this movie is just a
complete exception for me. It is about a tortured writer who decides to caretake this big hotel that is very, very isolated
and he takes his wife and his son there and his son starts to see weird things at the hotel. He starts to see previous
guests that stayed there and just really freaky stuff
that happened in the past. Jack Nicholson's
performance is outstanding. He plays a crazy guy so well. It's insane. There are iconic scenes in that film that will never be taken out of my brain. For example, I love the
Grady twins in the hallway and the woman in the tub. That was freaking freaky. I think it's a really awesome
time to watch it as well, because it's like Halloween. It's a little spooky, so go check it out. My next film favorite is Donnie Darko. This will always have such
a soft spot in my heart, because it pretty much encapsulates how I felt during my teenage angsty years. It's about a troubled
boy named Donnie Darko. He's played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He was so moody and so fine, but he survives this freak accident and since then he starts
seeing weird visions, particularly this man in
a bunny suit named Frank. And Frank is the one
that kinda persuades him to do all this gnarly stuff. It's very thought provoking, open ended and I feel like it could be a hit or miss with a lot of people, because some people might watch it and be like,
"What was the point of that", and other people would be like, "Didn't you see, the
point is right there". I think this is one of
the first films I saw that just got me hooked
into the sci-fi genre. Next up I have The Matrix. I would say this is probably the only film you should watch before you die, because if you haven't you
are severely missing out. I first saw this film
when I was in fifth grade. I had no idea what I
was getting myself into. My brother put it on the TV
and I was just like watching and slowly my mind started to enlighten and absorb what was actually
happening on the screen. The matrix is about a man who's just living his ordinary life and one day he is
presented with a question whether he wants to live
and continue his normal life or find out the truth and obviously he picks the truth and it just unravels the fact that the world is just
a simulation of images. I believe it's a depiction of Plato's The Allegory of the Cave and it does such a cool
job explaining that. It's honestly the movie
that got me into sci-fi. I thought it was Donnie Darko, but The Matrix was actually the movie that just like broadened my horizons and made me think of
things in a different way. Next up I have a
lighthearted film for you. It' is called Wayne's World. I grew up listening to rock music and Wayne's World was a film that really incorporated
the rock and roll lifestyle with comedy. And it's about two dudes
that love rock music and they have a TV show where
it's on public access network, but basically that show
starts to get some traction and you get to just follow their story. And it's one of those really lighthearted, goofy, silly movies that doesn't
take itself too seriously. This movie is the reason why I know the entire lyrics for Bohemian Rhapsody. That scene is just iconic and it's probably the first of it's kind for carpool karaoke. So go check it out, if
you want a good laugh. Now I'm gonna bring the mood back down. My next film is Mysterious Skin. This is a very disturbing
yet touching film. It follows the story of two boys that have undergone something very, very traumatic in their childhood. And you just see how they
both cope with the abuse. One of them is just obsessed
with space and aliens and abductions and the other
becomes a male prostitute. So it's a very sad story,
but it's very engaging. It is like a very interesting
coming of age story. I don't know. I feel like some people might find it really difficult to
watch, so maybe check out the subject matter before you watch it. My last film is Ex Machina. I wanted to pick something
that was a little more current, because a lot of my picks are throwbacks. But this was released in 2015 and I actually saw this in
theaters, which was insane. My jaw was dropped the entire time. I couldn't believe my eyes, honestly. It was a really haunting cool storyline, very visually pleasing. It's about a programmer
who is interacting with artificial intelligence
and it's in the form of this gorgeous robot lady. Her face is just like a woman,
but her body is a robot. And the programmer needs to decide whether this AI is conscious or not. And it just raised a lot
of questions in my head. After I saw it, I was like I just kept on thinking about it for days. It's one of those films
that just like kind of eat away at you, but I would recommend it. I have always found AI so fascinating, so this checks all my boxes. All right guys, those are my top ten favorite films of all time. As you can tell, I am a huge sucker for psychological sci-fic thrillers. I just really enjoy watching things that make me question my life and just like blow my mind. I do like watching
lighthearted stuff as well, but it just didn't make
my top ten, you know. It would mean a lot to me if you wrote down your favorite film in the comments down below. I'd love to hear your guys' suggestions. Also I wanted to apologize for the light, because I decided to
film this at like 5:30 and now the sun's setting and my mic died and that just set me back. Yeah, it's been a
struggle filming this one, but I'm glad I did. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. (kiss) 
(ethereal music) - Here we are, we are at our hotel. We finally made it. Right now we're in the
middle of a thunderstorm. I'm not used to this weather, but it's so cool and trippy to be here. We're at the Raffles Hotel in Jakarta, and this garden is unbelievable. (telephone rings)
Oh, someone's calling. - We're getting a phone call. Let's see who it is. - Oh, my gosh. - No one's there.
- Oh, that's so scary! So, aside from the freaky phone call, we are here for Beautyfest Asia, which is the largest beauty convention in southeast Asia. It's tomorrow, so tonight
we're just gonna relax, and get prepped for tomorrow. (downbeat music) Just caught Stephanie cutting some apples. Casually, Chef Steph in the kitchen. That's pretty much our little living room. Work area. Got the bed. Wow. Bathroom.
(crunches apple) And that's the tour. All right, the food is here! We have ordered a lot. It's just basically some
chicken and some rice, - [Stephanie] Chicken rice. - And over here we've got a salad, and some dim sum, of course. My favorite. Whoa, what's in here? - [Stephanie] Yeah, what is that? That's not, I didn't think that
that's what we ordered, but. - It's good, whatever it is. A gift has arrived. I actually already opened it, because I got a little too excited, but here's a nice little
bouquet of flowers, and some macarons, yum. And they also gave some clothing. I'm actually wearing one
of the dresses right now. I just got really excited. But it's like a little vacation dress. It's got ropes as the straps. And over here I've got
a little cute skirt. I will probably wear it
on this trip, definitely. This is perfect for the weather here. So Stephanie is taking a shower, and I am going to be next. (blow dryer whirs) Good morning, guys. It is our first official day in Jakarta. But, yeah, today is gonna be jam packed. Got so many activities planned. The first one is our meet and greet, which will be really amazing. I can't wait to meet you guys. And then after, Stephanie
and I are doing a panel, and then I am doing my makeup
live in front of all you guys. I'm gonna do an everyday makeup look, so the makeup in itself
should be pretty simple, so. It's hard to goof that up. But, yeah, I've got 45
minutes to get ready, and then it'll all begin. (speaking indistinctly) (crowd cheers) (smooth music) So we just finished the meet and greet, and now we are heading
on over to the stage to do a little interview. Hey, everyone! (crowd cheers)
Whoo! - And I really like it. That's something we
really do in this company. Fresh face? - Fresh face. - [Stephanie] Ready to go? - Yeah, let's do this. - [Stephanie] Nice. Touchin' up the brows, wipin' off the bake. - So it's several hours later. It was so amazing getting
to meet some of you guys at the meet and greet. Thank you so much who came out. Thank you so much for your presents and your actual presence. But, yeah, we are all dressed up, because we're going to... - [Both] A gala! Indonesians. - Y'all are the best. - I know, and your food is delicious! - Holy crap! So freakin' good. - We had the nasi goreng for lunch. - Mmm, yeah. - So bomb. - Dude, everything has
been so delicious, though. - But yeah, we're going to the gala. We're presenting an award. Jet lag is kinda creepin' in, but we're gonna keep chuggin' along. - Yeah, power through. - All right, we're sitting
front row at the gala. - Hiya. - There's Ashley. Got my girls here. Hi, you guys. - [Ladies] Hi! - Look how beautiful they
look in their gala dresses. (upbeat music) - That vlogger, it goes beyond just filling in and showing tips. It's about being passionate in what you do and being consistent. The winner is Rachel Goddard! (audience cheers and applauds) (upbeat rock music) (laughing) - We got one for the ladies! (cheering) (slow, romantic music) - Hi, everyone. It is Sunday. It is a beautiful day in Jakarta. I'm currently editing a
video that I need to upload. I feel like my travel schedule
has been really hectic this particular month. I usually like to upload twice a week, but with the traveling, it's
been a little bit tricky to have that much content. Whoo, okay. So I thought I would take a
little break from editing, and I'm sitting down, because I'm about to
open some of the presents that some of you guys brought
to the meet and greet. You guys did not have to bring me gifts. It is not necessary whatsoever. I haven't touched anything yet. I wanted to keep everything organized, and then, I guess, show it in the vlog. Okay, this is from Bon Barrel. Wait a minute. This is actually so freakin' cute! Holy crap! You really know my style! Thank you! Oh, snap. Ah! Okay. We've got some cheetos up in the mix. I've never had this flavor before. This is the jagung bakar. Here we have a little notebook. Oh, my gosh, this is so sweet! This is from Xena. Oh, she comments on my
videos all the time. So, thank you. Aww. This is a little wild lavender portrait. This is the stick pedas. I think this is a
different type of Cheeto. But these look like the hot fries. Oh, my gosh, what a cute little card. This is from Yuliana. This is a black studded choker. I really like the width of it. These earrings are so cute! I freaking love anything with stars on it, so this is amazing. I have a bag of Popa Puffs. Whoa, this is so soft. So this present is from Grace, and she made it herself. I can't believe you sewed this! This is amazing. Oh, it's got a little Ziploc. Okay, so we've got some
jasmine tea, some coffee, ginger and coconut caramels. Oh, my gosh. Got some more tea. I got a little bumblebee apron. Wow! I've got a watercolor painting of moi. Oh, my gosh. These are baked cheese tarts. Okay, me and Stephanie have to
eat this when she gets back. So there's no card in here. All right, so we've got some lipstick. And then we've got some phone cases. This present doesn't have a name, but thank you so much for
the candle and the lipstick and for the phone cases. All right, so this is from Olivia. And she even wrote a list
of things to do in Bali. Oh, whoa! Wow, this is so nice! So I've got like a little scarf here. So those were all the items. I apologize for the awkward lighting. And I want to thank each
and every one of you that came out yesterday. It's so surreal being thousands
of miles away from home, but coming to, like, a
community like you guys. I don't know what I did to deserve you, but I just can't express how thankful I am and how grateful I am to have this life, and it's all because of you, and, thank you, thank you a million times. You guys are amazing,
and I love you so much. So these are from Xena. Thank you! - Thank you, Xena. - So we just opened up two
snacks on Stephanie's channel. So feel free to pop on over to her vlog to see what these taste like. And then over here we've got some Cheetos, and stick pedas. - Yeah. - Oh, thanks. Wow, they're yellow. In America, Cheetos are orange. - They smell vinegary. - Cheers. - What? - I don't believe, like, we
had the exact same reaction. - Wait. What? They're a completely different
texture, they're Cheetos. - Oh, my God, I like it! - Mmm. They're kinda sweet, but they're savory. - Mmm.
- Mmm. And they're airier and fluffier
than the normal Cheeto. These are bomb! - Oh, my god! - Whoa. - They're soy-saucy. - Are they? - Soy sauce powder. - Ah. - That's what it is. It's like that sweet, savory
thing going, oh, my God. - This is so good. That's gonna be pretty hard to top. All right, stick pedas. - [Both] Cheers. - Ooh, they're spicy! (gasps)
- Whoa! It's building. - This is taking me on a journey. - Oh, my God. Is it gonna keep building, though, cause like I'm almost reaching my limit. - No. (Stephanie sputters) I think this is just about to, and then, it's gonna dip down. These are good. - Like, if they were a little drier, like if this spice were on the freakin'... - [Both] Cheetos. - Next level.
- Oh. - These are my favorite. - I know, me too. (downbeat music) And we're heading to Bali! Whoo-hoo! (downbeat music) We have arrived. - We made it! Finally! - [Jenn] Here is our private villa. We are welcomed with two big teddy bears from Beautyfest Asia. Over here is Ashey's little bed. We've got two beds for ourselves. I'm, like, living for this bathroom. It is time for a little snack. We've got some little Balinese treats. - [Stephanie] Balinese treats. - [Jenn] Balinese treats. And then over here we've got pad thai and some fruit. - Yeah!
- Mmm. - Good morning!
- Morning! - From beautiful Bali. - Oh, my God, this is insane. It's paradise. - It is paradise. - [Steward] I've brought your breakfast. - Oh, thank you.
- Thank you. - Thank you so much. So, for brekkies, we've
got an egg white omelette. And Steph? - I got the Amurican. I just wanted to do some poached eggs. Check out this muesli. It's so beautiful. I think there is pistachios, strawberries. (bird calls) (downbeat music) - No, use the weight. Don't try to dash your hand. - Okay. (downbeat music) Oh, my God. So we are in the middle
of the jungle, y'all. But we're having some hot
coffee with this hot weather. - Quite nice. - I didn't even need sugar or anything. I usually douse it with Splenda. - Mm-hmm. Coconut coffee. - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my God, that's really good! - Really?
- Oh! (downbeat music) - [Jenn] I got the nasi goreng. This is one of my favorite
Indonesian dishes ever. You guys, now it is raining super hard. Wow. Just look at this view. - That would be so scary, actually, to sit on the edge of that. - [Jenn] Yeah, it's actually quite a... - [Ashley] A steep drop. - [Jenn] A steep fall, yeah. - [Stephanie] No, if
you fell off that ledge, it would not be good. (laughing) (downbeat music) - Good morning. Oh, my gosh, we actually had
a pretty frightful morning. We woke up to an earthquake. So the entire hut was just shaking. It was like a gentle shake. It wasn't, like, frantic. But it was enough to notice
it and be a little alarmed, because right now we
are right by the ocean, like right next to the ocean. And earthquakes and oceans, there is a chance of a tsunami, so, we got a little worried, but luckily, everything is fine. But, regardless, I'm still
feeling a little shaken up. - Okay, ready? - No. Oh, my God, it's hot. All right, first meal of the day. I've got the meyu jakarta, which is some sort of egg noodle soup. It looks delicious. It's exactly what I want for breakfast. Ashley got the egg white omelette again. (relaxing harp music) - [Stephanie] So what are you doing on Ashley's face today? - I'm just adding like lashes
for her, just a little bit, because I just want to enhance her beauty. - [Stephanie] Yeah, right,
Ashley doesn't need much. She's already so beautiful. - Oh, my god. (downbeat music) - We are back in the hotel room, and we had lunch with all the girls here. Amazing! There's so many other
people that are here, but I feel like I haven't
been able to capture. I love, love, love the girls
that came here with us. Pearypie, Tina Young, Inui. They're all super amazing, and I'm glad that we got to
have lunch before they left. We are going to see some temples today, which I am so excited about. Yesterday on the drive, we passed by so many small ones, and each one, I was like, can we go in? For my outfit, I'm actually wearing the
Four Seasons' bathrobe, because I just thought it
went so well with my outfit. And the crazy thing about these shorts is I had no idea that this tartan print was such a massive print in Indonesia. I've been seeing it all over the temples, so I thought that these
shorts were very, very fitting for a little adventure. He's like, is it worth it? He's like, no, I'm good. - Seriously. - Look how many people that are here. Clearly a popular destination. (downbeat music) Today is our last day in Bali, or the last couple of hours here, really. We're just packing and
getting ready to go home. - [Stephanie] Sad! - So sad. I wish I was able to stay here. I wish we were able to stay here for a couple more days. There's still so much we haven't seen! But I guess that just means
we'll have to come back. (downbeat music) 
(gentle instrumental music) - Hi, everyone. It's your girl, Jenn, and I have a brand new series in collaboration with Simple Skincare, who is sponsoring this video. Life can be really stressful, and not only does stress suck, it can affect your skin, too. And that's why we've whipped up this really fun, stress free series where I've just invited a
bunch of my friends over. We're gonna be hanging out
and just chatting away, doing fun makeup challenges, and also sharing tips
on how we keep our skin healthy and hydrated using
Simple's new Water Boost line. Today's special guest is
my friend Jackie Aina. She is one of my favorites on YouTube, and I absolutely love
learning so much about her. I'm so excited to catch up with her and get some one on one time. Well, Jackie. - Hey, girl. - She's here. Thank you so much for joining me! - Of course! Thank you for having me. - Yeah. It's your first time at my place. - First time at the crib, kicking it. - So today, we're doing
a just Get Ready With Us, but with a twist, of course. We're gonna be playing this
game called three simple rules. - What does that mean? - Well, all the rules are
in this lovely basket here. - Oh lord. - Each time you break a
rule, you get a strike, and whoever gets the
most strikes, they lose. So, do you wanna pick out
what rules we're gonna do? - Are there cash incentives involved? - Mm, we could, we could. - I only pick one? - Mm-hmm, one at a time. - Move your arms like
a train when laughing. Oh, great. - So this is the choo-choo train. So every time you laugh,
you have to go like this. - I'm a professional laugher. That's gonna be hard. I literally laugh at everything. So this situation? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, I think I could do that. - Yeah, right? - Okay. - And the next one is,
you can't say yes or no. - Dang, that's messed up.
- Yeah, mm-hmm. - Position your arms like a
T. rex when picking product. What? Like this? - Yeah, exactly. You gotta pick it up like this. And then once you've captured it, you get to just do your thing with it. - But not laugh in the
process, because then you-- - Oh! - If you T. rex it up but
you laugh in the process, you gotta choo-choo it out. Is that what you're saying? - Yeah, yeah, exactly. - All right, this is gonna be tough. - Precisely.
- This is gonna be tough. That's why I asked about cash incentives. (Jenn laughs) - So today, I thought we would just do kind of an everyday, bumped up look. So you can put a little
glamor if you'd like. - We can do that. - So before we get started, I wanted to make sure that our
skin is hydrated and primed, so we're gonna use
Simple's hydrating booster. This is great if you are stressed out, because stress can dehydrate the skin and then make it more sensitive. So this just reverses all of that. Ooh. - [Jackie] It smells good. - Yeah. It's so milky. - So we can use this as
a spot treatment, right? - Mm-hm. 'Cause you have oily skin, right? - I have combination. Yeah, I have more combination, so this area here is more normal for me, so I'm just gonna pop that in that area-- - [Jenn] Nice. - Where it tends to get
a little bit more dry. And what about you? - I'm just a normal girl. Sometimes I get dry during the wintertime. So I'm just gonna use
it all over as a primer. - You're so lucky. - It's genetics. Thank you. Thank you, Mom and Dad. I'm just using it all over as a primer, but you can also mix this in
with your moisturizer, too. - It feels like a primer. It's a little tacky in a good way. - So the makeup can really stick. - Yeah, it kinda grabs onto anything. Oh, that's why they call it a booster. - Yeah, right? A little boost. - Simple, I see you. - All right, so now that
our skin is prepped, let's get started. - Let's get beats, shall we? - You ready? (Jackie laughs) - That was so cute. (laughs) - Okay, there you go, there you go. - Okay. Serious face. - So, what are you using for foundation? - Ooh, that's one of my favorites. - I know. That's why I busted it out. I got it 'cause of you. - Really? - You convinced me. - I feel like a proud auntie. - Absolutely. (Jackie laughs) That's the one. Foundation that works for all skin types. - Mm-hmm. - That was a little erotic move. - Yeah, right? (laughs) No! What have we signed up for? So how long does it take you
to get ready on a good day? - Well, if it's on a luxurious day where I have time to kill-- - Like hang out, listen to music. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Two hours, like an hour and a half. - Is that you showering? - From the time I prime
to wig on, styled, curled, so it's hair and makeup. - Whoa. - Yeah, it kinda takes me a long time. - Wait. - But, but, on a normal
day, it's like an hour. How long does it take you? - Okay, if I have to be out the door, let's say I'm just doing a easy shoot, it would take me like
20 minutes, 30 minutes. - What? - Yeah. - If I need to be out the house,
I can do it in 30 minutes, but that's like, your wing
may not be even, girl, but you gotta pick your poison. - Exactly. - You've got a deadline to meet, so you're gonna sacrifice something. - Okay. So Jackie just had her
30th birthday party, which was so crazy. She had rented out the whole penthouse of Mr. C in Beverly Hills.
- It was so nice. - It was so nice. We saw panoramic views of the city. There was sushi. There was pizza. - You're really selling this. - I know, because I had never been to a party like that before, and I was like-- - Really? - I couldn't believe it. And so me and Stephanie
ended up staying there for way longer. We saw your grand entrance. How did you think of that?
- That was so much fun. Well, because our inspo
was Coming to America, so we wanted to be super extra. If you've ever seen the
movie Coming to America, then you know it's super extra. - I haven't seen it. - It's very extra. (both laugh) - So heavy. - The anticipation, I was
like, "What's happening?" - What's happening here? - (gasps) I left my contour at home. - No! I have this. Will this help? - Oh honey. (both mumbling) - Oh, the shade is not dark enough. No. - No? - It's okay.
- No. - It'll be a light bronze day?
- Do you have bronzer? - Yes, we always have bronzer. It's okay. I love how that was so tragic for us. - Yeah, that's so sad. I was like, "Please." Okay, so where are you now? Okay. - Still doing concealer. And you've already like baked and-- - Yeah, I need to slow down. I need to slow my role. - I'm just a slow girl. I don't know. - [Jenn] You take your time. - I do like taking my time, I do. - [Jenn] That's good. - I enjoy the process of getting ready. - Me, too. - I really do.
- I love having the option to just do whatever I
want to my face that day. Like, do I want a green
eye, a yellow, an orange? Do you like my small, tiny-- - Oh, I travel with that one. - It's the best. - I always get that one for travel. What's that brow pencil? - Dior brow styler. - They have brow pencils? - Yeah. Dior is really stepping it up with all their makeup products, mm-hmm. But this brow styler is the bomb. Oh, but your collaboration with Too Faced. Oh my god!
- I'm so excited about that. - I know, I know.
- I'm so excited about that. - I'm so excited, too.
- I'm so excited. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Waiting to announce that was hard. - Wait, so when does it launch? - So, basically, it's in effect now. - (gasps) Really? - Yeah, it's gonna take
however long it takes to get in the lab and start formulating. I do want to name one foundation
after one of my viewers, 'cause I've got people that
have reached out to me, and they've been like, "I'm one of those weird in between shades, "and I know that a lot of other people "are similar to me, as well. "Could you make something for me?" I wanna make one of those really complicated in
between shades for someone, like dedicated to one of
my followers or something. And the other names, I want them to be inspired
by countries or something. - Oh my gosh, this brow
is looking so wonky. - Which one? - This one. It's like ... - Oh, yeah, yeah. It's a little shorter. - I've gotta go for this. (Jackie laughs) Okay. All right. - The way you like, "I gotta-- - I gotta, I don't wanna drop anything. - You got it. - So now I just gotta fix this brow. I'm using Simple's Water Boost
Micellar Cleansing Water, and I'm just going to apply
this onto a cotton round. Boop, boop, boop. - That stuff is good for
spot cleaning and stuff. - Yeah, and just prepping the face, cleansing your makeup off. It's really gentle, and it
just instantly hydrates. - [Jackie] Oh, wow. - Yeah. Are you already on your eye shadow? - I am. - No! - Okay, I decided to do a little beat, just a little, just
something for the summertime. We'll turn up, me and bae. - "It takes me two hours to get ready. (Jackie laughs)
"Oh, I'm already done." - Have you ever been with a guy that did not like you wearing makeup? - When I wear too much, they'll say-- - What's too much? - When it's bold eyes, bold lips. I feel like a lot of
guys, they say they like, "Oh, I like all natural girls," but they don't realize
even the natural girls have a lot of stuff going on still. - Do you know how long it
takes natural to get ready? So my natural BB cream
is gonna take 45 minutes, my natural contour, another 10, and then my natural lash application. - Right. - That sparkly color is
pretty, that first one, that's super pretty.
- Thank you. Oh, wait, it's, hold on. - It was Color Pop, right? - Yes. I love it.
- Yeah! - Yes. - [Both] Yeah! (Jackie laughs) - Do you even put on mascara? You did. Okay, now they're even
longer and more full. - Ooh, are you using primer? - Yeah, I have to. - Ooh. - This is Lancome's seals booster. - Seals booster. - Yeah, I really need them. Hello!
- How are you doing? - Bumped up! - This is my favorite lash. I love this lash. Look at the difference. - Whoa, oh my gosh.
- Party time. - Yeah, you need to show them. - Good morning, party time. Good morning, good night. - Oh, no. - What happened? - I forgot my blush. - No.
- No! - Girl, what do you need? I got coral. - You got coral? - I got liquid. - That's my shade. - I've got, hey, we've got it all. - What's this? Whoa. - My latest, newest obsession. - What is it? - I forgot the T. rex arms. - It's okay. It's just a strike. Just add it on our strike list. - I'm trying to win the game. - I know, I know. - I take like my finger, and then I dot it right on the apple, and then on the other side I dot it. Then, before it dries-- - Oh, it's so cute like that already. - Hello. I kinda do a combination of zigzag motions or patting motions, and I just blend it out. - Wow. - It shears down. It shears down really nice. - Wow, it's gorgeous. - So pretty, huh? - [Jenn] Oh my god, give me that. - Get it, girl.
- Give me some. - You want a little more? You want another squirt? - Okay, I'll have a squirt. - Don't be shy, girl. But start off with a little,
and then build it up. - Can I use my beauty blender? - Yeah, you should, yeah, you should be able
to use your beauty blender. - I love this guy. He saves everything. - The beauty blender is just the freaking greatest of all time. - Oh no, oh no. - [Jackie] Oh no. - Oh no. - Oh, no, it's okay. Keep blending, keep blending. - We can save this. - I like how you're-- - Yeah, I know. If you just pound it
enough, it'll work out. - You can use a brush, too. Actually, it doesn't look that bad now. You're blending it out good.
- Yeah, right. I'm gonna keep doing this. - You definitely blended it out better. - Maybe put a little foundation on here. - It does take a little bit of
time, a little bit of giving. - Okay, here we go. Okay, I think I found my groove. - Oh, yeah. - I just bump it with the beauty blender-- - Oh, it sheared out really nice. It sheared out really nice. Don't you love that we're
both using the same product? - Yeah, I feel so connected. - Same product, different complexion. What's your favorite mascara? - I'm using Shiseido's
full lash waterproof. - Oh. - It's got this type of brush, so really-- - [Jackie] Oh, that's a good brush shape. - Yeah. It really gets into my thin, baby ones. Your bottom lashes are so long that they have their own shadow. - I know, I know. - [Jenn] They're so long. - That's not bags under my eyes, guys. That's a shadow. - The shadow of my lashes. - Just so you all know. Okay, Maybelline Master
Chrome, show me what you got. - Wow. Wow. Ah, I can't see. - Bling, just a little bling. - Yeah. - What is that? - Oh, this is just a lip color. This is a Cream brand. This is (mumbles).
- Cute! - It's cute, eh? - I love the packaging. That's so cute. You know, I'm the worst at lip liner. - Really? - Yeah, I really am.
- Gotta hold your breath? - I don't know what it is. I don't know if my lips
aren't even or something, but I always feel like one
is higher than the other. So I'm gonna take my T. rex hands. - Yep. Can you reach it? (Jackie screeches) (Jackie laughs) Okay, here you go. - Friends helping friends. Look at that teamwork.
- I know, got you. Yeah, I think I'm pretty much
all caught up with you now. - Yay. That lip color is so pretty. - Thank you. - That is such a beautiful color. That was so easy to fix. - Oh, nice. And you're back. - And now I'm back. Ooh, I just realized this smells so good. I need all my lipsticks to have scents. - Yeah. That's the only product I don't mind that, like if it had a scent, I don't hate it. - Oh, you prefer no scent? - Yeah. That's why I really like Simple's stuff, because it doesn't smell like anything, 'cause there's nothing really in it to-- - That is true. No, skin care is different, though. - Yeah, yeah. - Makeup, you can throw a
little cupcake scent in there. - That's true. This one smells like chocolate. - Oh! The Too Faced line, oh. - Oh my gosh. Sometimes I'll just huff it
and then just get to work. - I know. When I'm organizing my makeup, I'm like, "Give me this
lip gloss. (sniffs) "Okay, back to work." Okay, girl, I'm gonna get
you out of the impact zone and use my spray. I don't wanna get it on you. - Wait, I wanna try some of that. - Oh, please do. Oh, you're gonna love
this for your normal skin. Here you go. But does it smell good?
- Mm-hmm. - Can you smell it?
- Mm-hmm. So dewy. - I know. - I love it. - I'm done. We actually managed to get
ready at the same time. - Yeah. - Yes!
- We did it! - Come through. - So, we are all done with our everyday, bumped up makeup look. I think we did a really good job. - I'm ready to go out. - Yeah. Where are we going? - We need to get some drinks. We need to get some reservations popping. - It's happy hour now. - Oh, even better. - Nice! - Call Uber. (Jenn laughs) - Okay, we gotta see who won, though. - Ooh, yeah, I forgot about that. Oh my god, who win? Oh, me? Oh, didn't I say there
were some cash incentives? - Okay. - So does that mean you pay? - All right. - I mean, you could cover the
tip or whatever, the bill-- - I'll do this round. You are the guest, after all. Congratulations. - Thanks, boo. (both laugh) It's okay, she's--
- Oh yeah, wait, okay. - Oh, we're still playing, oh. - We're still playing. Is this like the lightning round? Okay. Make sure you check out the next episode, which will be next month. We're gonna have a new surprise guest. If there's a makeup look
that you want us to try out, please leave it in the comments down below and we'll use it for the next round. Also, I wanna thank Simple for sponsoring and collaborating
with me in this video. You've gotta check out their
Water Boost collection. I'll leave a link in the description box. Also, a coupon, so please check it out. - Turn up. - Turn up. (laughs) - Coupons (mumbles) coupons. We can shimmy to a coupon. I'm just saying. - I know, I know, everyone loves a coupon. - I know. - Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you guys next time. Bye! - Bye! 
(mysterious music) (evil laughing) - 'Tis the season for Halloween. I've partnered with Simple
Skincare to show you these two killer looks to rock this year. First, I'm gonna show you how I did this dead bride look and
then into a disco alien. I'll be using Simple's products from their water boost line, in between the looks so that way I can keep my skin hydrated during this spooky time. All right, so let's get
started with the first look. So here I am with fresh clean skin and I'm gonna use Simple's hydrating
booster to prep my skin. Since I'm gonna be putting
a lot of stuff on my face, I wanna make sure that it's hydrated. I love this booster because
it also acts as a primer, so it's gonna make sure that
everything stays on tact. Now that my skin is ready and good to go, it's time for concealer. I'm using Colourpop's No Filter Concealer in the shade light and I'm
gonna start applying it all over my face as the first base. Then with a damp makeup sponge I'm just gonna blend that baby out. I wanted my face to be a little lighter so I'm gonna go in with foundation now, just doing the usual, dot it on my face and then blending it out. The next step is powder. I'm using my trusty Laura
Mercier translucent one and I'm just gonna set that
in so that nothing budges. For my brows, I'm using
Benefit's Goof Proof Brow Pencil and I'm just gonna do
my usual brow routine. At first I was tempted
to use a black eyeliner, but I thought I'd go for
something more wearable. Okay, brows done. All right, so let's move onto eye shadow. I'm using NYX's Jumbo Eye Pencil and I'm gonna use this as a
base for our ultra smoky dead bride look. Feel free to be lax with application because after you do this, you're gonna get a dense brush and start
to smoke the edges out. Then I'm gonna go in
with the same eye pencil again and start covering the lower lid. Go in with that same brush and start to smoke it out the best you can. Don't trip if it doesn't look too perfect, because in the end, you're a dead bride, so it's all right if it
looks a little messy. Now I'm using Kat Von
D's Monarch Pallette. I'm grabbing the matte black eye shadow and I'm just gonna start
packing it all over my lid. I'm doing like a little patting motion instead of a sweeping one because I wanna minimize the fall out. Then I'm gonna use a dense, fluffy brush and start smoking this all out. Next up, I'm taking
this burnt sienna shade and using this as a transition shade. I did kind of like a
slight winged out shape just so it looks a little glam. Then I'm gonna go back
into the same sienna color and I'm gonna drag that out
for the bottom of my eyes. Grab a black eyeliner
now and start tightlining the bottom half of the
eye, this is just gonna smoke the look out even more
and intensify everything. Then I'm gonna grab a
cheek brush and I'm just gonna dip it inside that
sienna color and start using that as a contour shade. I kinda went a little harsh with this, so I'm using a makeup sponge to blend the imperfections that I made. There, much better. I'm gonna quickly pop on some falsies now for some instant vavoom. Now using a black pencil liner I'm gonna start drawing the skeleton nose onto mine. I went for, like a rounder shape, because I wanted my nose
to look more button-like. Then go in with a
concealer and start whiting out your lips, you want a super pale base because we're about to
draw some skeleton teeth. First using a black liner I'm gonna start drawing the inside of
my lips to make me look more dead, then I'm gonna
lightly drag the pencil out to the corners of my lips to give them the illusion that they open wider. I'm gonna draw the outside skull teeth first and then
I'm gonna grab my liquid eyeliner and I'm gonna redraw and sharpen the lines in the corners of my mouth and also along the lips. Using the liquid liner is easier than the pencil because you can
be more precise with it. I shaded the inside of
my lip a little darker and now I'm done. Throw on a black wig, grab a veil, and prepare for the ultimate
wedding of the underworld. I love that this look is a little creepy, but still sultry as hell. Now, it's time to take of the wig and all this makeup off so that we can transition into the next look. First, I'm gonna use
Simple's Cleansing Facial Wipes and start removing the first layer of makeup off. You guys know that these wipes are my jam and I love how soft and effective they are for removing the first
portion of my makeup. See, look at all that gunk. Now I'm going in with Simple's Water Boost Micellar Cleansing Water. I'm soaking up a cotton round and then gently removing the
remainder of my makeup. This formula is awesome
because it's refreshing and rehydrates the skin. And there are no harsh chemicals, which is always a plus. Okay so now that makeup is finally off, let's start the second look. First, I'm just gonna prime the skin again with Simple's Hydrating Booster. My skin has been through a lot today so it's important that I add this step so it's hydrated and primed
for the second round. So I'm basically doing
the exact same steps as the previous look. I put the concealer on my face, added powder, and then drew on my brows. Now that we're up to speed, I'm gonna go in with
another NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in this lovely green shade that I honestly thought I'd never use. I'm gonna start coloring
it all over my lid. Then going in with Colourpop's Cusp, I'm gonna pack this shimmery emerald shade all over the base. I'm honestly just
obsessed with this color. Now I'm gonna go in
with my Lo-key palette, I'm gonna grab this orange shade and start using that as my transitions shade to blend this crazy green out. Surprisingly the orange looks really good. I never thought that
this would be the color to blend out really unusual shades. I'm picking another adventurous color, this is wild thoughts and I'm just gonna start going in all under
the lower part of the eye. I just basically picked
out a bunch of intimidating colors that I never use for this look. Then I'm grabbing my
liquid liner and drawing my usual cat eye. I just realized that I
wanted a little extra oomp so I grabbed this champagne color and added it to the inner
corners and brow bone. Now I'm skipping mascara and I'm popping on these big fluffy lashes. These add the drama that
I want for this look. I wanted to add a
celestial element to this so I'm using Urban Decay's Heavy Metal amp and I'm adding this green sparkly glitter to the top part of my lid. I love glitter, so this
is very much needed. Then using Stila's liquid eyeshadow, I'm gonna take this violet glitter and start covering the lower
half of the eye as well. This is Halloween, folks,
so go big or go home. Now using my favorite
highlighter, I'm just gonna dust this onto
the apples of my cheeks, nose bridge and Cupid's bow. For the lips, I'm going for a darker color so I'm lining my lips
with a black pencil liner. Most of the time I don't
really line my lips, but for dark colors,
it is an absolute must. I'm finally busting out squid ink from my collection and
I'm gonna apply it all over the lips, this is such a cool color because it's like a
dark, dark indigo shade. This is definitely one of the most challenging colors that
I've ever applied on my lips, but, I tried my
best, please don't kill me. Now that I'm finished, I'm gonna throw on my rainbow wig and my
little alien antennas. I love how whimsical this look is because of all the variety of colors. This is the perfect look for parties, whether it's Halloween or not. All right guys, that is
a wrap for this video. I hope you guys enjoyed it. I would love to know what you are gonna be for Halloween this year. If you happen to try one of these looks, please tag me. You know where to find me. Also, huge shoutout to Simple Skincare for partnering with me for this video. I absolutely love their products and I highly recommend them. If you haven't tried it out for yourself, I will leave a link for a coupon in the description box
so please check it out. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye (kisses). (whimsical music) 
(upbeat guitar music) - Hey everyone! It's your girl, Jenn, and here I am in my kitchen slash living room. I thought I would just
switch up the background to keep you guys on your toes. Let me know if you like
it, don't like it, neutral, let me know! I have gathered all my
favorite things of August. I can't believe it's over. Summer is gone, y'all. It doesn't feel like it's gone. We're going through this
crazy heat wave in LA, but regardless I've gathered
all my favorite things and I'm going to present them to you like we do every, single month. If you enjoy videos like this make sure you're subscribed. Buttons down below, and let's start. So let's talk about shoes first. Here I have my white
sneakers from Superga. I actually got this last month when I was in the Hamptons with Revolve, and they have just been
my favorite sneaker, other than my Vans, I love my Vans. But these are a close second. These are the shoes that I also styled in my Eggie look-book, while I was in Toronto. They just went with every, single outfit and I feel like a pair
of crisp, white sneakers just adds a nice casual elements to any ensemble. Since I am five foot one, the one inch platform is very nice because when you're this short, every inch counts. And yeah, I really enjoy these shoes and I thought I would give
them a little shout out. So let's move on to some beauty products. Here is a concealer that I've been loving. This is by Hourglass and
I am the shade natural. I know there's this trend on YouTube where people are just skipping foundation and just concealing where they need to and I just jumped on the wagon because my skin behaves most of the time, it's a combination of genetics and my skincare, and just the
amount of water that I drink. I drink a lot of water. I mean my sippy-cup is
always being refilled. But regardless, this have been
my favorite concealer to use because it's very precise and I like the consistency. Like most people, I have dark under eyes and this guy just conceals everything and so I just do it underneath my eyes, around my nose, a little bit on my forehead and chin, and I just blend that baby out. For example, I'm not
wearing any foundation now, just this concealer, and I think it's doing
a pretty bangin' job. Another beauty product
that I want to talk about is this spray from Too Faced. It is their Hangover three in one replenishing primer and setting spray. I first heard about this
from my girl Jackie. She actually showed it
to me right over there. We did a collab video, so if you haven't seen
that also hit the cards. But, yeah, ever since
she's told me about it I have been hooked on it. I have only used this as a setting spray and it just keeps my face
looking fresh and glowy. It's just been really interesting to see all these different
types of make up trends, because a couple of years ago it was all about that
matte, glamorous look, and now it's all about dewey,
highlighted, fresh skin and I feel like this spray really helps me achieve that look. Alright folks, let's move
on to the book favorites. I actually have two this time which is really exciting. I was traveling a lot this month so I had a lot of time
to kill on the plane. So the first one is
called The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer. And this was recommended
by one of you guys, so thank you so much because this book has
been just life changing. I feel like just the past few months, my journey with spirituality and self-awareness has just skyrocketed. I still have a long way to go but I just feel so much
more connected with myself. And this book in particular, it made me just reevaluate my
relationship with my thoughts. I don't know about you but my thoughts are constantly racing and when I'm feeling sad, anxious, or mad, my thoughts can distort
and sometimes I'll think some really crazy things. And this book has made me reevaluate that, made me step back and see
my thoughts as an observer. It's made me just more calm and more at peace with myself and I feel like with the
combination of meditating, reading books like this, going to the gym, I just feel a huge improvement
with my mental health. And I just highly recommend this book if you want to just see your
thoughts in a different way and be more at peace with yourself. My next book favorite is
called Rich Dad Poor Dad and this was actually recommended to me by my friend, Amy, aka
VagabondYouth here on YouTube. If you don't know her channel please subscribe to her. She's got a really fun spirit and a great perspective on life. So check her out, if you haven't already. Anyway, so this book is
about financial education. At school we really
learned nothing about this. Like, we have econ class, but
that's about the government. And a lot of us learned
to manage our money through our parents or our friends, and still I feel like that's not enough. And I feel like this book
has just really changed my whole perspective on my finances. Now whenever I purchase something I ask myself, is this an
asset or is this a liability? And obviously there are
things I want to purchase because I want to treat myself, so it's all about a balance. But in the grand scheme of things you want to have more
assets than liabilities. Once you're more conscious
of saving your money, absolutely start investing. So whether that's in a
stock or a municipal bond, you gotta start a 401K, etc. It's all in this book,
so please check it out. I feel like if you want to start learning how to make your money work for you rather than the other way around, start reading this. A lot of you guys know this by now, but I launched my clothing
line, Eggie in August and it's just been such
an incredible experience. Thank you so much for the
overwhelming amount of support. I had to put it in my favorites because this is such a
huge milestone for me. And I also wanted to talk about my favorite piece in the line. It was very tough to narrow down but I gotta talk about
the Truck Along Jacket. I feel like I've always been attracted to really shiny things and so that's why this patent has just been catching my eye. Fall is just the time to be
super bold with your layering. This is also a really insulating fabric because this material is so dense and unfortunately I haven't
been able to wear it in LA because it's just been so incredibly hot but once the temperature starts to drop I am definitely going to be rocking this. I also can't wait to show you guys the new styles that are
going to be dropping at the end of September
and also in November and then beyond. This is only the beginning, so be prepared for a lot
more Eggie in the future. So my last favorite is going to be an app that I've been using the entire year. I have kind of become a
gym rat the past year, I lost 15 pounds since 2016 and I'm gonna do a whole new video on how I lost that weight. But one of the reasons why is because I've been using
this app called Seconds. This is basically like, not
like a personal trainer, but I've made it my personal trainer because I have created all
these personal timers for me. So I go on the StairMaster for 20 minutes and I don't just go on it without having this timer, because this really breaks
it down into sections for me. So I'll used the advanced hit timer, so for five minutes I'll just be walking on the StairMaster
at like a good 11, and then for 30 seconds
I'll just be running on the StairMaster, and then for a minute and 30 seconds, I'll just be walking and
then running for 30 seconds. So I do this six times and by the end of it I'm literally drenched in sweat and after that, that's when the real workout begins. I'll do my strength training. So I'll go on one of my workout playlists, and this one has like
13 different exercises, and I'll do this three times. And so that's why it's
become my personal trainer because I'll just put my headphones on and I'll just let the timer run and then I'll just listen to it. I'm gonna do a separate video where I go more in depth
with my workout routine and also what I eat and just how I lost the weight. Because my past video
on how I lost 10 pounds, things have changed, and I have definitely worked my butt off to lose the weight and I can't wait to share
those tips with you. Alright guys, that is
a wrap on my favorites. As usual, please write down your favorites in the comments down below, also I'm looking for like a film favorite. I'm looking for like a good,
psychological thriller, or like a Sci-fi fantasy adventure film. Write it in the comments down below, I would love to check it out. Lastly I just want to thank you guys for the love and the support. I feel like, I've been
feeling it extra this month. So I just want to be able to
send that right back to you. Thank you so much. I hope you guys had a beautiful weekend and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (playful pop music) 
(gentle music) - Hey everyone, welcome
back, I've got an episode of Favorites for you today. Honestly, I'm a little
stressed out on how quickly this year is going by, we're
literally plowing through 2017 and it's true, the saying
that the older you get, the faster the year seems to go. That's definitely my life, but anyway, on a lighter note, I've got
some of my favorite things from April and if you are
a lover of Favorite videos, make sure you subscribe to my channel, the button is down below
so hit that and subscribe, I provide a monthly
favorite every single month so you'll always have
something to look forward to. So with that said, let's get started. In April, I fell in love
with this strappy nude wedge. They're probably familiar
to you because I've been plastering them all over my
Instagram, my YouTube channel, these have just been on my feet nonstop because they just go with
everything and they're super comfortable because it is a wedge. It's very rare for me to
wear shoes that don't have a platform or a wedge because
those are just painful. I think it's about time
that I retire my Zushu nude platforms that I used to
wear all the time for years. I think we've got a new nude shoe in town. A common question that I get pretty often is what kind of bra I wear
with items that are strapless or backless and before
my answer was always, "Oh, I wear a sticky bra,"
but I just never really recommended it that much because
my sticky bra kinda sucked. It was always just okay,
if it was really hot or if I got sweaty, the sticky
bra would just kinda fall off and it just felt horrendous
wearing that when it was hot. But in April, I discovered
these nipple covers. These are silicon nipple covers and look, they're pretty large,
which is nice actually because you would think in
theory that smaller nipple covers would be better, but larger
ones are in fact better because they provide shape to your breast and it just covers the
entire thing, which is nice, so these are great for items
that are backless, strapless, and if you have something
with a plunging neckline, these are a godsend, I just
make sure that every time I use them, I put them in
this case because I don't wanna lose these guys
and I make sure to keep this little plastic wrap, just
to keep it nice and secure. It keeps the adhesive quite tacky and you can just wear them over and over. Now that I've discovered
these, I've just been wearing a lot more backless items
and I just love these guys, these are a necessity in
every girl's wardrobe. Moving on to some beauty
products that I've been loving, here I have Kopari's coconut body glow and I actually discovered
this in my hotel room while I was at Coachella and
I went ham with this product every single day when I was out there. Basically I would put
just several pumps of this on my hand until my whole
body was slathered with this, my legs, my arms, just any
piece of flesh that was showing except for my face,
yeah, I would put this on and it would give my body just
a beautiful golden shimmer and it's got little tiny gold flecks in it and it just, I don't know,
it just makes your skin look so glowy and bronzed, I
feel like it definitely has some sort of toning effect
and I could see myself rocking this for any summer future event like, I don't know, like a
Fourth of July pool party or just another music festival. Another beauty product
that I've been loving has been this highlighting
palette by Stila, this is their Star Light
Star Bright palette and I feel like I've mentioned
this in multiple videos by now but I had to put it in my favorites because I was literally
wearing this highlighter right in the middle, Kitten,
throughout the entire month of April, all these
highlighters are gorgeous but the one in the middle,
Kitten, is just out of control. I really love the formula
of this because it's not a powder but it's not a cream either, it just kind of dances
in between the middle and I think it gives a
perfect, dewy, natural finish. This palette is also a part
of my Jet Set Jen box and this is probably one of my favorite
pieces in the entire set. Next up, I've got this lip
butter by Sol de Janeiro. This is their Brazilian
Kiss Cupacu Lip Butter and if I'm gonna be completely
real, the reason why I love this, like 60% of
the reason why I love this is because of the scent, it
smells so darn scrumptious. It smells like vanilla
bean and I don't know, if you don't like vanilla scents,
you're not gonna like this but if you do, you're gonna
be obsessed with this. I enjoy putting this on my
lips, it's like an experience that I want to have because
it smells so delicious. Maybe that's part of
their marketing strategy, they just make it smell really good so people just use it up faster. My last favorite is a podcast
that I've been listening to nonstop, it's called How I
Built This and it's by NPR and this is a podcast
where they just get a bunch of entrepreneurs, innovators, idealists, and they come on the show
to talk about how they were able to build their
empire or their movements and it's just so inspiring to listen to because as a young
entrepreneur, it's always good to have some sort of mentor,
I personally don't have one but that's why I always seek
out information like this and one of my favorite
stories was by the guy who created Five Hour Energy,
I know it's super random, it's that little tiny
bottle that you see in all corner stores in America, he
now has like a billion dollar industry and his story was so interesting. At the end, the host asked
him, "What are three tips "that every entrepreneur should follow "in order to have a successful business?" And the first one was common
sense, use your common sense, make things as simple as
possible, don't waste your time using jargon and making
things sound complex to make yourself sound
smarter, that is gonna do the opposite so go with your
gut, use your common sense. Tip number two was to be determined. Everyone can be passionate
but after you've been kicked in the face a couple of
times, passion fades, but determination means
that no matter what, you are getting up and
you're starting again because you've got that mentality. The last piece of advice was
having a sense of urgency. So that means do it now,
not later, not tomorrow, do it now because when you put things off, you tend to forget about it, so always have a sense
of urgency, do it now. I've just been really
enjoying listening to this while I'm walking to
the gym, it's like a 15, 20 minute walk so these
podcasts are just perfect pieces of information while I'm walking. Alright guys, so that wraps
up my April favorites. I am so sorry that
there's no film favorite or a book favorite, I
just didn't read anything and I didn't watch anything. But if you wanna write down
any of your recommendations from film to books to podcasts especially, put it down in the comments down below, I would love to read about
it, I genuinely love reading what you guys have to say,
I do have a very long list of current recommendations
but I am always open to adding more to that, but anyway, if you guys enjoyed the
video, make sure you hit the like button, subscribe
to my channel if you haven't already and I'll see you
guys in the next one. Bye! (mellow music) 
(knocks) - One second! Oh my god, hi! I haven't seen you in so long. You're actually really
early, but it's okay. I still gotta get ready,
sort out the apartment, but come on in. Make yourself at home,
take off your shoes. I know, I have too many. This is Ben. - Hi, nice to finally meet you. How are you? Can I get you a drink? Coffee, a snack? - Or how about these? There's only one way to eat these. Chopsticks! You want some more? Come on, just another one. Come on, it's good, they're good for you. Eat it. Here, let me show you
the rest of the place. This is the bedroom. I still have to make it though. Do you wanna grab that side
and then I'll do this one? Wait. Do you have Cheeto fingers? Okay, you just hang out there. I'll finish the rest. (laughs) You are not helping at all. (squeals) This is way
better than making the bed. There, perfect. I can't believe Ben and I are
moving in a week and a half. I'm gonna miss waking up
to this view every morning. I love living in downtown LA. So this is where I get
ready every morning. Got the natural light. Put my makeup in this nice vanity and this is my attempt for makeup storage. Wanna help me pick out an eyeshadow? Oh, good choice, Elixir. I think I'm just gonna
go for something casual. It's not like a crazy
party, so something subtle. So I'm gonna show you my office and also where I keep the
majority of my clothes. I still have no idea what to wear tonight. But I guess I could show you the options. Have a seat. I just feel like I have nothing to wear! Yeah, this is the room
where I do some filming. This is like the infamous
corner of the room where I do most of my intros. And then this is the
other side of the closet that is not perfect, but it works. (laughs) Alright, what do you think? Is it too much? Should I wear the hat? How about like this? No, hat's weird, okay. I got this camera. Maybe we'll just take a bunch of photos of all the outfits and then choose? Nice. (calm music) This one's a little bit
more quirky, playful. Like this is my house, I
can wear whatever I want! This is the one, I love it. Please tell me you like it. Okay. (sighs) Thank god. Okay, we'll do like a thinking one. Okay, let's do a jumping one. Ready? One, two, three. They say a picture is worth 1,000 words. Today we wrote a novel. Oh crap, I forgot I have
to film something actually. Do you mind grabbing my
camera in the hallway, please? Oh, I always forget to do this. Oh, it's the camera on the left! Did you find it? Oh, nice! Yep, that's the one. Thank you. Yeah, do you mind just
waiting in the lounge while I do this? It'll only take like five minutes or so. Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn. Welcome back to my channel. Today's video is gonna be
about wardrobe essentials. These are my favorite
things to have in my closet. I kind of rummaged through my wardrobe and picked out ones that
were just calling out. So the first item I have
is a white (mumbles). Any occasion really. You can wear it layered, open, tucked in, pretty much whatever. Alright guys, thanks so much for watching. If you'd like to support this video... Oh my god, I haven't played
that game in so long. Like a board and all
these little knick knacks. Do you wanna play first
while I set this up? Person? Cookie? An alien? You gotta give me something more here. An alien, a root? A disease? A... Smallpox? Chicken pox? Chicken pox? I got it? Oh, nice! With time to spare. How about we play another game? Pre-game. Alrighty, here's your beer. (cheering) Hi! - Hey, what's up? I'm Stephanie. - Hey, what's up? Segundo, nice to meet you. (laughs) - There you go. - No, yeah, that was amazing, exactly what we were talking about. - And there you go. Guys, can I have your attention please? I'd like to do a toast to
thank you all for coming. Old friends, new friends. Let's have a bloody great night. (cheers) (upbeat music) You drink beer, right? So you must have played beer pong. Come on, come on. Keep it mighty. You got this! (laughs) - It's okay. You'll do better in flip cup. - Yeah, you're going down, bro. I don't even know you. You're going down. - [Jenn] Chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug! Oh my god! Come on, come on, come on. - [Ben] Come on, come on,
here we go, here we go. (cheers) - Yes! - Hey, are you okay? Here, have some water. You should definitely hydrate. Yes, all of it. (cheering) Yeah, that's good. I'll grab some more. Whoa, you're still here? Oh my god, you okay? Last night got pretty crazy. (laughs) But yeah, you look really tired. Let's get you home. Bye! Thanks for coming over. Get home safe. (calm music) 
- Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn and here I am with a new
episode of favorites. As you guys know, September
is over and I'm so gutted because my birthday
month is officially gone, now I gotta wait another year, but regardless I'm gonna just run down the best of the best of September and if you're new here, make sure you're subscribed to my channel. The button is down below and now that we're done with the intro, let's get right into it. I'm gonna kick things off
with a fashion favorite first. If you have seen my 24
hours in New York vlog, then you know that I did this
really rushed shopping trip at Reformation. It is one of my favorite stores and I got this entirely new outfit. One of the pieces included
this leather beret and I have just been obsessed. It really adds that perfect
amount of edge to any look, and I honestly think that this is the new it head accessory
for fall and winter. I'm just saying. I'm calling it out. I'm seeing a lot of designers
put their own spin to it, like I know Dior has a
beautiful leather beret, but I'm just really happy
with my Reformation one. For my beauty favorite, I
have this lip color by Dior. It is called Rolling. And honestly, this name is
so fitting for this product because it literally
just rolls onto the lips. It's such a smooth, moisturizing formula and it's in this gorgeous
nude, salmon shade. I used this in my sultry fall makeup look so if you haven't seen that
video, check out the cards. I also love that this formula
is super low maintenance. You don't have to worry about reapplying it over and over again. And as the day goes on, it
doesn't leave that like, line on your lips. I believe it's called butthole lips, because like when you pucker up, it'll just have like that weird, you know, butthole effect. This product doesn't do that which is nice. I have been a victim of butthole
lips just too many times so I'm tryna stick with
products that don't do that. Alright, so let's jump
into some book favorites. Here I have Death Note. This is a gift that my
big brother James got me, and I am so happy he did this, because this is like the first manga I've ever read in my life. Growing up, James had this
huge collection of just mangas and it was just kind of his thing. I tried to read them, but a
lot of them were in Korean too. He had like this crazy
Dragon Ball Z collection, and I could read Korean,
but there are a lot of words that I can sound out phonetically, but I don't know what they mean. So, anyway, this is obviously in English and I'm so happy that he's
kind of like introducing me into the manga world because this was like the perfect book to start out with. So this book is about a
high schooler named Light and he stumbles across
this like really mysterious and magical notebook
where you can kill people by writing their first, last name and visualizing their face. And he is shadowed by
a death god named Ryuk and Ryuk is just so cute. At first I was kinda like, oh, he's kinda creepy, but just like, seeing his mannerisms and his fascination with humans, it just makes him really endearing. So Light's mission is
just to purify the world of criminals, so he starts
just like killing off criminals in the death note. But unfortunately, the
cops see this as like, an issue because murder is murder whether you're murdering a bad guy,
you're murdering a good guy. You're still killing someone, so they're tryna find
this mysterious killer, and it's just really interesting. I've never read a plot line like this. Can't wait to finish the
second book in volume one, and then after I guess I'm just gonna have to start buying the
rest of the collection. I highly recommend it if
you have never read a manga, definitely a really cool
storyline to get sucked into. My next book favorite is
called Wild by Cheryl Strayed. This was recommended to me by my mom, and she never recommends
me to read anything so of course, when she told me to read it, I was like okay, so I
downloaded it on my Kindle, and I am so happy that I read it. It is such an inspiring story. It is a memoir of Cheryl, and just a lot of unfortunate
things happen to her, which caused her to lead
kind of a reckless life. But when she turns 26, she decides to just get a hold of her life and she decides to go on this crazy hike, the Pacific Crest Trail. And, this is not like, you know, just a three mile hiking trail. This is a really intense hike, 1,000+ miles on crazy terrain, and the crazy thing of all
is she does it by herself. She learns a lot about herself and it kind of inspired me to want to go backpacking as well. I've never done anything like that before and I love nature and it was really inspiring
for me to read her story and see how this whole journey
just kind of healed her. You want to know what she's doing next and it's just really
cool to see like a woman, a strong woman do this
on her own, and yeah. I highly recommend it. Next up, I have my film favorite. So, Ben, James, and I went to the theaters and we saw the movie It. Normally, I don't watch horror films. I steer clear from them because I just have like a very
active imagination, so like once I see a scary
image, it's with me for life. And I end up like, they
end up popping in my head at like the worst times, like when I'm washing my
face and closing my eyes. It's just bad. I remember when I was a kid, when it first came out, like I literally thought that It was the most terrifying
thing in the world. But something about the remake
made me wanna re-watch it. I think maybe it's like
the nostalgia factor, also I heard I heard it wasn't that scary. And so, I went into the theater and
we all ended up loving it. I think it's because they put in pieces of like really hilarious moments just to break apart the horror. 'Cause if it's just like
a scary movie all around, like it's just too much for me. Like you gotta give me like
some sort of nugget of happiness in a film. And if you can handle
like, Stranger Things, you can definitely, definitely watch It. Unless you have like a
giant fear of clowns. So the film is about a story
of seven children living in this town and every 27 years, this clown named Pennywise comes out and tries to kill as many kids as he can. And the crazy thing is, even
though he's like really scary, he also has the ability to transform into your deepest, darkest fear. So yeah, it's still out
in theaters right now. I highly recommend you go watch it if you just want like a
really fun Blockbuster hit. My last favorite is a podcast. It is called Optimal Living Daily. And this was recommended by my friend Amy, a.k.a Vagabond Youth. I honestly get so many
recommendations from her, because she is like a
little pod of knowledge. I believe in like, my last
favorites video I talked about a book that she recommended. So yeah, if you're not subscribed
to her channel, please do. I'll link her in the
description box, check her out. I have been obsessed with this podcast, I have been listening to it
every morning as I get ready. It's just really nice to listen to because every day he uploads. The narrator Justin Malik, he picks out articles and blog posts about self development and
personal growth, which is nice. A lot of the articles
are around 8-12 minutes so they're just like bite
sized pieces of information. And if they're too long,
he'll put it into two parts. But a lot of subjects he
picks are about minimalism, there's one about time management. The information that he gives out is just really useful things that you can incorporate
into your daily life. So, yeah. If you are looking for a
new podcast to check out, definitely listen to Optimal Living Daily. Alright guys, that wraps up
this episode of favorites. Before I left, I wanted to
do a couple of announcements. Number one, a lot of
things are back in stock at the Eggie shop. First we've got the fuzzy baby tee. They are in all the sizes. The oversized hoodie, and also
the oversized long sleeves. So, now's your chance to cop. Number two, I wanted to talk about the international shipping. I am so sorry that it is more
expensive than I would prefer, or you guys would prefer. Trust me, I am working my hardest to try and decrease that cost. If there was a way where
we could have just like a flat rate international shipping rate, you guys know I would do it. But for now, this is
the best that we can do. Number three, you guys know
how much I love captions. Every video, or the majority of my videos, I get English subtitles,
because it's just nice. Like any show I watch, I like,
I just throw the subtitles on because I wanna know
exactly what they're saying. But I recently just discovered
that you can turn on like the community captions so like, now you guys can help translate my videos. It would be my dream to have my videos in
all different languages, from Korean, German, Spanish. It would just make me so happy. So, if you guys speak another language and you wanna help your girl out, please help transcribe my videos, it would mean the world to me. I've already put a list of
like the top five videos that I need help
transcribing and captioning in the description box,
so please check it out. As usual, write down your favorites in the comments down below. I love hearing from you guys and it's just nice to
get like a big source of information and inspiration down there. Thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one. Bye! Muah! (burping) 
(upbeat music) - Hi everyone, it's your girl,
Jen and welcome back today! I have a fresh episode
of favorites for you and honestly I think I
am one of the few people who still do monthly favorites
and I gotta tell you, I need to thank you guys
so much for watching them. I think that's the only reason
why I continue to film them. But regardless, I've got all
my favorites in a row for you so let's get started. So I'm gonna start with
a fashion favorite first. Here is this gorgeous
tote from Oak + Fort. I had the pleasure of visiting
their store in Vancouver and I picked this bag up there. This is such a chic vegan leather purse and I love that I can just
dump all my belonging in there. I am constantly on the go and I just have a lot of stuff with me, like my vlogging camera, my makeup bag, accessories if I'm going to a shoot. So I just wanted one large
container to store everything. There is a little magnetic enclosure so it secures your belongings and it just matches with everything. And I just love how universal it is. Next up I have a book favorite. As you guys know I love
sharing with you guys what books I've read or
audiobooks I've listened to and that's why I'm so proud to announce that this video is in
partnership with Audible. For those who don't know what Audible is, it is a service that has
an unmatched selection of audiobooks, podcasts,
shows, new, broadcasters, just anything in their arena. They have such a wide
selection of everything. So one audiobook that I
finished was The Book Of Joy by the Dali Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and Douglas Abrams. I am continuing my journey
on just bettering myself and I love to consume enriching content that is nourishing for my soul. And since it's still the beginning of 2018 it's not too late to hop on
the new year, new you train and this book just came
at such a great time. This was highly recommended
to me by Amy and Oprah, two very important women in my life and so I knew I had to listen to it. So this book is a conversation between two huge spiritual
leaders in the world, the Dali Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. They are really great friends and for the Dali Lama's 80th birthday they decided to get together because this is probably the
last time they'll ever meet and they wanted to have a
conversation about finding joy in a world full of suffering. And Douglas Abrams was there
to help guide the conversation and write the book. And it was so enlightening and one of my favorite
quotes from the book was. These days the idea of giving
back to my sphere of reach is so important and this
book just reminded me to stay kind, stay empathetic, and to care about the
wellbeing of other people. Anyway there are a ton
of more amazing lessons that I've learned from this book and I highly recommend
that you listen to it. Fee free to use my URL, which is audible.com/clothes. You get a free audiobook and
a 30 day trial membership, so definitely take advantage of it. If you're more of a texter, you can text clothes to
500-500 or just use my URL it's audible.com slash C-L-O-T-H-E-S. If this book doesn't interest you at all, there are so many other books that you can listen to on there. They have a huge selection
from sci-fi, business, like romance, history,
classics, everything. Their library is your oyster
so please go check it out. Moving on to an accessory
that I've been loving, here are these heart locket
earrings from Peter Do. I thought that they were fitting
for Valentine's Day season because they're hearts
and they're so functional. You can open them and you
can actually print out a photo of people or things that you love. I'm thinking about putting
a picture of Cheeky on here because she's always on my mind. Or I can have Ben on the other side too. You can wear them like both open. You can wear one open, one closed. Just depending on how you feel, you can kind of adjust
the earrings accordingly. And they are very high quality which means that they're a
little bit more of an investment but I'm at a point in my life where I would just
rather invest in jewelry that I know won't just
deteriorate in a year. Next up I want to announce my
very first artist favorite. I wanted to put the
spotlight on Takashi Murakami because I had the honor of
meeting him in real life in Vancouver in February and it was such a once
in a lifetime experience getting to meet him and look
at his art in the flesh. It was just incredible. His exhibition is called
The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg and he named it this because he admitted that he's very critical of his own work and this is like just a
comprehensive collection of all his work that he's done
in the past, in the present, and so when he saw all of it he said it just looked like
an octopus eating its own leg. And being at that show was
just really inspiring for me because there was a point in
my life when I loved to paint. This was in middle school and high school, because I've always had such
difficulty expressing myself through words, especially
writing and speaking. And so that's why a big release
for me was through imagery and I have always loved cartoons and flat imagery that
still has lots of depth and I feel like Murakami's
work really embodies that. And so after I got back from Vancouver it inspired me to go to
a paint and sip class with my brother and I
ended up painting again and it felt really, really good. I'm definitely gonna go do more of them. But anyway if you're in Vancouver I highly recommend you guys
go check out the exhibition. It is playing like now till
like March I want to say, so you still got some time. A pair of pants that
I've been wearing nonstop have been the Late Shift Trouser by Eggie, which is my clothing line. And no, I'm not just plugging this in because it's my clothing line. I have been really,
genuinely wearing these pants pretty often and it's because these days I just really don't feel like
squeezing into skinny jeans. I love that these pants are just kind of like a shape shifter. They can be formal if you want them to but casual if you're more
in the mood for that. With the chain it looks super bad-ass, but without you just
look like you're wearing a nice formal trouser. And these are super-soft,
very comfortable, and they're a little bit stretchy so if you eat a lot it
will expand to your stomach which is always a plus for me. So my last favorite is a
lecture by Charlie Kaufman and he is the writer of my
favorite film of all time which is Eternal Sunshine
Of The Spotless Mind. He also wrote Being John Malkovich, which is also an incredible movie. But yeah, he did a talk on
how to write a screenplay, but there's so much more depth
that comes out of that talk. It's around 41 minutes
so it's pretty lengthy but it is truly one of
the most honest talks that I've ever listened to and after listening to it
there's like so many times where I just kept nodding my
head and agreeing with him. And he touches a lot on his insecurities and his need to be liked and feeling disgusting
because he wants to be liked. And I like that he admits
things that most people won't admit to, but feel. And I love that he explains when you are creating meaningful
art, you have to be naked. You have to be vulnerable and it's inspiring me to
push myself to create content that is more meaningful, more vulnerable, and more relatable for you guys because I can do a
video on like a lookbook and all that stuff, and
I do still enjoy that, but these day I feel like I'm
trying to create more content that comes from deeper within my soul. And it is a process
that I am learning to do and I just feel like this talk was just really nourishing
for my mind and soul. And I really would love for
you guys to listen to it. I will leave a link in
the description box, so please go check it out. All right guys, that is a
wrap on my February favorites. As always please comment down what has inspired you
in the month of February in the comments down below. Or just tell me how you're doing. I truly love listen to
what you guys have to say and how you guys are and I just want to thank you
guys so much for watching. And I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! Muah! (mellow music) 
- Hi everyone. I'm Jenn Im and today I'll
be meeting some athletes who are going to be
representing the United States in the Winter Olympic and Paralympic games in South Korea, Pyeongchang in 2018. Korean culture is known for their beauty and cosmetic lines so we're gonna put each Olympic hopeful to participate
in one of three games. And this episode is Place the Face. We're gonna throw each athlete
into the K-Beauty gauntlet, and see who comes out on top. So lets go ahead and meet our athletes. Hey guys, so here we have Evan. Thank you so much for joining us today. - Good to be here. Thank you for having me. (laughs) - So today we're gonna

challenges actually. So we're gonna do a game called
The Facts and the Furious. So three simple questions you will answer. - Musubi. - Musubi? Like spam musubi? - Maybe katsu musubi. - Well I love spam. - Mexican food. - Mexican food? You like spicy food then? - Yeah spicy where it still has flavor. - Oh so it's not to the point
where it's like hurting you. - Yean, exactly. (both laugh) - For sure. What's one song or artist
that's been on repeat lately? - Definitely that
Kendrick Lamar, "Humble." - I love Kendrick. - That thing gets me jumpin'. - "Stay" by Zedd. - He's amazing live. - It's a real ear worm though. Just gets in there. - My definite go to song is
DMX, "X Gon Give it to Ya." - Oh hell yeah! - It's a great pump up.
- Oh my god. - You start dancing, you bark a little, weird people out, but
it's pretty much my go to. - No seriously, every
time that song comes on in a bar or a club everyone's just "Alright, we're doing this!" - Exactly. - That's a great song choice. We're gonna play the game! It's called Place the Face. - Ready? - Oh! (grunts) Not ready for that. On the table, I've got three go to Korean products that I love. First we've got the BB Cushion. And if you don't know what that is, this is what girls put on
their face as the base. - I think they joke and
call it Bondo, right? The guys call it Bondo like on the car. You know, when you got a little bowl and you kinda patch it up. - Oh my god! (both laugh) Yes, this is our Bondo for our face. Second, we've got some eye shadow sticks, and the last one is a lipstick. Add some color to your lips. Pucker up. And the best part is you're
not going to do it on my face, but you're gonna do it on
this lovely woman here. Obviously doing this blindfolded as well, so you've got something
to, I know, ya know? Okay let's put you into
position, over here. Okay, and go! Oh. Okay. - This is gonna be. - Hey, you're off to a pretty good start. - I don't know what a cat eye is. - Just flick it at the end. Flick it. Now for the lips. Alright. And you're off. Yeah, okay, okay. Fantastic. - I'm not very good at this. (both laugh) - Wow, it's really low, isn't it? - Yeah, those are some big lips. Okay. Not bad. Oh, god. - Oh, no. That's way off. - Oh my gosh. That's pretty darn close, actually. - Can I have a little more? - Yeah. - Am I on the eye? - You're close enough to be honest, yeah. Or you're more down south. Oh, yeah that's one way to do it. - You said go for it. - Yeah. - I'm assuming her lips are right there. - High cheek bones, I gotcha.
- Yeah. And come right back across the face right? On that high cheek bone again. Gotta get that Bondo in, and you have to sand it down 'cause if you don't get it sanded down you'll see it when you
paint the car, you know? I'm gonna say it's
about right there, yeah? Look at that eye, right? - Make sure you flick it at
the end for the little cat eye. - You gotta give her that cat. - Yeah, there you go, there you go. (laughs) - My masterpiece is complete. - I think we have the new
Picasso here, alright. Ready to see it? (both laugh) - Wow! - This one was really good.
- I actually go them. - This one was really good. - Oh wow, not bad right?

- Yeah, right? - You pretty much. - Got it in her eye. Some people like the nude
look on their lips so. - Exactly. - Oh my gosh. - Like, come on. - Not even close to the lip. - It's okay, I mean we
all have our strengths. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Makeup is not mine. (laughs) - Well that concludes
K-Beauty with NBC Olympics. I feel like the athletes are ready to dominate their sports and maintain a great complexion. Thank you so much for watch America, and I'll be seeing you in Pyeongchang.

(jazzy music) - Hi, everybody. - Hi, guys. - Here I am with my fiance, my man, my baby, my hunk, my boo. Okay, I'll stop. But today we are filming the My Man Styles My Outfits Challenge. I've seen this tag circulating
around the internet, and I thought it was time
to do our own spin on it. - Just the idea of it is stressing me out. I mean, for you girls,
you've got so many options. High-waisted jeans, skirts, shorts, pants. - Vests, turtlenecks. - Just everything, but guys,
it's t-shirts and jeans, maybe shorts, you're good. And we thought we'd mix it up and do, like, a thrifted style. So, we're gonna go to a Goodwill, and I have to pick out
some outfits for Jenn. This is gonna be hard. - Yeah, it's gonna be good. - We are here at the
Goodwill in Glassell Park, and I'm gonna get Jenn three outfits. First one's gonna be date night, the second one is gonna be
an everyday Jenn kinda vibe, and the third one's gonna be girls' night. The last one is gonna be a wildcard where Jenn will have to go and
wear this out in public, which I'm very excited for, but obviously, you know, the more
interesting and wacky I go, the harder she's gonna
go when it's my turn. So follow me in and we'll see. Let's do this. (jazzy music) I'm not good at shopping for myself, let alone for you in this gigantic store. You guys have got, I think
you've got too many options. You know, even all this is girls as well. I like the shape of that. It's like Crocs. You know that's gonna look good on you. I think I'm done. That might have been
the most difficult hour. Have we been here an hour? - [Jenn] Yeah, we've been
here for a really long time. - We're finished. Oooh. - [Jenn] No, no way, ew! - You know I look good. - [Jenn] Yay! - Success. - Success! All right, guys, we are back at home. All the outfits are prepared now. That was tough. - That was very tough, but I feel confident. I think we should crack on. Go get on the everyday Jenn look. - Okay, be back in a flash. Ding! - You look good. - I love it! - The point of it was to go
for something comfortable. The polka dot shirt feels soft, light. I like the shape of it. And I think the skirt's
just nice and easy. Again, looks comfortable. And we found out it's actually. - Skort! - What's it called? - It's called a skort. Short skirt.
- A skort. And then we went for
the white tennis shoes, which again, comfortable. And it just says you're
feeling relaxed and casual. And the headband was
actually what Jenn wore on our first date at
London Eye, wasn't it? - Yeah, it was. - So that had some nostalgic, you know. - Sentimental value. - Sentimental reason for that. So what would you give that out of 10? - I would give this outfit
a good eight out of 10. - Eight? - Yeah, I think it's cute. I don't think it's for every day. I think this is kind of
a very feminine version of my everyday style. But I would totally rock this. Like, this is a cute lunch outfit, or on days when I wanna
look more pure, I suppose. Yeah, I feel very
wholesome in this outfit. I like it, though.
- You like it. Okay, well let's see
how the next one goes. Why don't you try the date night? - Date night, okay. - Good luck. Ooh, I like that. - Date night, ooh! I like it.
- I like it. (laughing) So, with this outfit, for the bottoms, I wanted to go for some pants, as opposed to a skort. I thought that you'd like the shape of those tops at the moment. - [Jenn] Yeah, I do. Like, I like a big ruffle. Like, obviously I am on the smaller side, and that just makes it
look more put together. - [Ben] I think because it's
got a bit of a pattern to it, I thought we'd keep it simple on top. Some nice silver earrings, and then some nice mules. - These guys.
- Beige. So what would you give this out of 10? - I would give this a good nine out of 10. I like how it's not like
your typical date night look, with a little bodycon dress. It's got a nice twist to it. I think I would've worn
it with a lighter bottom. Like, I would've worn some-- - Fine. - Oh, wow, someone's taking it personally. - I'm happy with it, and
I got a nine out of 10. - Yeah, I think it's awesome. - Next up we have the
girls' night out outfit. So go get that on. - I will. - Ooh, I love this! - This one's cool. I like the little green. - It's definitely a
slightly braver jacket. I mean, I definitely
couldn't pull that off. - [Jenn] I think you could. - [Ben] I'll give it a
go after this, maybe. - [Jenn] For sure. - [Ben] And then I thought
I'd do a black skirt, mix it up a little bit. - This one's actually
a really great skirt. I'm really happy with this find. This is, I really needed
a corduroy a-line skirt, so this is perfect. - You're welcome, you're welcome. A nice lace top, a beret. Of course, you know Jenn. She likes berets. - [Jenn] I do. - And them some black, are they mules? - No, these are like suede platform shoes. - So that's the outfit, and I like it. What do you think? What would you rate it? - I would give this a good nine out of 10. Once again, I'm happy that you went with just kind of like a unique choice. This could've been like
a sequined, shiny number, but you went for something
more brave and bold, and I like that. - But that's also why we took
another two hours in there, because, so, all right, now
I need a skirt for that one and a top for that one. - There's a lot of coordination when you're styling outfits. But I think it's great. - Good. Well, last but not least is the wildcard. This was a lot of fun to find. I'm very happy with it. I think it's very fitting, and Jenn's got to try
and make it look good, and then also she has to go
out in public and wear it, which I'm very happy about. - We'll see what I can do. I'm gonna try my best to salvage it. - Good, go get it on. - I'll be right back. - There she is. Famous! - Oh my God. - The reason why I picked is just, it's just not you. I mean. - I'm famous. Hey, guys. I'm famous on the internet. - It's basically one of
those tops that just screams, "Give me attention!" Apologies to anyone
that does own this top. It's very nice for someone else. - Yeah, you do your own thing. I respect your style. - Just, I know Jenn's style. I know what she likes and
doesn't like on herself, and I think she won't like this when she's going out in public. - I just don't know how I would save this. Maybe if I tucked it in. No, it just. - It just still says famous. - It still says famous. - Well, I think you should get outside and get you showing off. - Okay, let's do it, let's do it. Hopefully there's no one out today. (jazzy music) No more, no more photos. All right, guys, that wraps
up the video for today. I think Ben did a very,
very fine job on styling me. - Thank you. - Write in the comments down below. Did you love it? Did you hate it? - Be nice. - What do you guys think? - Please be nice. - If you would like to
see an episode where I thrift outfits for Ben, also let me know. Give the videos a thumbs up
that would indicate to us that you like these videos. - Guys, let us know what you think, and see you in the next one. - Yeah, bye!
- See you guys. 
(ambient music) - Hey everyone. It's your girl Jen and today's video is gonna be about self-confidence. I know a lot of you guys
are under the impression that I'm a confident
person and I would say at this point in my life,
yes, I am confident in myself, I'm happy, I'm secure. Obviously I still have my
insecurities, I'm human, but they don't consume me like
they did when I was younger. And I would say that this
whole confidence thing, really came maybe the
past four to five years so all these life lessons are pretty fresh so I thought I would share them with you so let's get started. So my first rule is to
stop judging other people. This is number one because I
think it's the most important and if you don't apply
this to your life already, apply it today. I feel like this day and age it's so easy to put someone down and say nasty comments like eh, why would she wear that? That's like my number one pet peeve is when people talk shit about what other people are wearing. I feel like fashion especially,
everyone has the right to wear whatever that they want so let's say like we're at a club and someone says something snarky about what other girl is wearing, that really grinds my gears,
like I don't like that. I feel like whether someone wants to wear like a fishnet body suit
or sweats every day, that's their prerogative and it does not effect your life whatsoever. And if you are about to
talk smack about someone, pause for a second and think about whether it effects your life in any way. If it doesn't, let it go. It really doesn't matter. When you are hard on other people, you are harder on yourself. Talking smack about
someone else isn't gonna bring them down to your level, it's not and have you ever noticed that the people that talk the most shit are
the most painfully insecure? Let's just leave it at that. So the next time you're
about to bad mouth someone or judge someone, just realize that it's a cheap form of
conversation or thought. So my next tip is for those
people that get a little nervous when they're walking in public, or they're afraid of being stared at. So when I walk in public, I literally just look straight ahead. I don't make any eye contact with people. I just literally walk my direction, because when I was younger
I was always really paranoid about the looks that people would give me. I'd be like, ugh like
why did they look at me? Do they think that I look stupid? Do they think I look dumb? And all these things, all these thoughts would rush into my head and
make me feel even more insecure. So my solution was to literally
stop looking at other people and continue just walking my way. And I've come to realize that
if people are looking at you, number one chances are
it's not really negative. Or number two, they're
probably looking at you because you looked at them. I don't know I just like to
avoid that situation altogether so I don't make any eye
contact when I'm walking on the street and I just
look straight ahead. Tip number three is to
listen to a badass playlist. Like most people, music has
a huge impact on my life. And don't underestimate
the power of music, it can really change you. So when I was in college,
when I would wear like a crazy outfit,
something really bold, I would just put on my
playlist, walk straight ahead, and it would literally be
like I was in my own world. Definitely, take the time out to curate your own badass playlist. Put all the bangers in there, stuff that makes your heart pound. Stuff that makes you feel
powerful and confident. It's so important. I am gonna leave a link to my playlist that makes me feel
confident in the down bar. Just be warned it's gonna
be a random slew of songs, but each song is really
near and dear to my heart. You can see like, I don't know, I have like random taste in music. And also if you guys have
a confidence like song that makes you feel amazing
put it in the comments down below cause I would
love to listen to it. Tip number four is to expand
yourself, to stretch yourself. I think it's so important
because if you want to grow you're gonna have to stretch, and when you stretch it's
gonna hurt a little bit, but that's the only way you're gonna grow. For example, when I was younger
I was terrified of driving. Like literally so anxious on the road. Like my heart would beat really fast and there were sometimes where I just like wouldn't even go to certain places because I didn't want to drive. But fortunately I had to conquer my fears and when I lived in Davis
and I wanted to go home I had to drive six hours down so that constant driving over
and over and over again just made me more
comfortable with the road. I wasn't scared about
switching lanes any more and honestly if I can tell
my 19-year-old self now that I would be completely
fine on the road with no anxiety I would've
been floored, literally. Stop avoiding stuff that
you don't want to do because it's so important for you. The more you do something
the easier it becomes. My last life lesson is you will grow into who you are as long as you absorb. So my senior quote in high
school was be yourself, everyone else is taken by Oscar Wilde. And this was a mantra
that I really fixated on and I just kind of obsessed over because at the time, I
didn't know who I was and I desperately just wanted to be me, but I didn't know who I was yet. And now that I look back,
it is perfectly fine to not know who you are. It is a gradual process and
everyone has different times on when they start becoming
comfortable with themselves. But all you gotta do
to get to that process is just absorb as much as you can. I feel like the world is
just like a big chaotic place with tons of different
information just flinging at you and your brain is just like a sift that's just like catching
as much as it can and what comes out of
the sift it all just like goes in a big pot and it marinates goes in a big pot and it marinates and what is in that pot
like that's your soul, that's who you are. And the only way you know
who you are is by absorbing as much and experiencing
as much stuff as you can. So don't hold back. Watch those movies you've
always wanted to watch, talk to those people, wear
what you want to wear, go to those concerts,
watch those documentaries, listen to podcasts. I'm literally just saying everything that's coming in my mind. Now is the time to develop your interests. And it's so important to do that because that is gonna
really shape who you are and I think it's a beautiful thing because in the end we're all just like little bits and pieces of everything that we've ever experienced and I think that is
such a beautiful thing. This is just a process that
I would just want everyone to start on because it's so important and such a gift to really be
comfortable with yourself, and it's something that
everyone can achieve. Wooh, okay guys so those
were my five life lessons that I've learned to be more
comfortable with myself. I know I probably missed
a lot of other tips that I could've incorporated so you guys should definitely write in
the comments down below, what has made you a happier person, what has made you more confident. I would love to just
make the comment section a big, just like open forum. I want to let you guys know
that I appreciate you so much and this channel would
be nothing without you and I want to film more of
these like advice videos, but I never want to come off too preachy. Cause I don't have the
answers for everything, I really don't. I really don't have
answers to anything at all, but I just wanted to share with you guys just some information
that I have learned myself and anything I learn I
want to share with you guys cause you guys are really important to me. So I hope you guys have a beautiful day and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. (kisses) (ambient music) 
Hi, everyone! Happy Sunday. Today, I
am filming a What Would Jenn Wear. Earlier this week, I asked you guys on Twitter what
kind of video you guys wanted to see today, and What Would Jenn Wear won by a landslide, so here it is. For those who are just tuning in, this is a segment where you tweet me your fashion
dilemmas, and I answer them. And since it is officially winter time, I thought that I would specifically choose like
winter-related questions, so let's get started. The first tweet comes from Hannah, and she asks, "What
outfit can you wear to stand out during the holiday party?" This question is perfect because New
Year's Eve is right around the corner and everyone is going to be dressing to the nines,
and this would be a great opportunity for you to get gussied up to. This is what I'd
rock if I wanted to turn some heads. One quick and easy way to stand out
is to have a faux fur moment. Something about this fun texture just
screams glamour and luxury. This one is from Storets and I absolutely love
the pleather lapels on the coat. Underneath, I'm wearing a fitted stripe turtleneck top, and then I tuck that into this
black leather skirt with ruffles. For shoes, I'm wearing these sexy thigh-high soft
boots that are perfectly fitted, and there you have it. A fun, flirty look for the season. So, let's move on to the second
dilemma. This one says, "How to look cute for a date while trying to layer up
for the cold at the same time? "I just started dating this guy, but it's winter in Chicago,
so I feel like I can never dress up." It appears we have a little visitor. Are you gonna stay here? By now, I know Chicago is absolutely freezing, and I
know when temperatures are that brutal it's hard to feel cute, but I feel like it is still possible. This is my cute winter date outfit for you. I think the color blush is very flattering on any complexion, so I'm rocking this really fun, dusty blush jacket
in this thick shearling material. I think it really complements my sweater
underneath. This one is a salmon shade and it's got these fun stripes all around it. Also, if you want to stay warm,
wear a thermal underneath. For my bottoms, I'm rocking these light colored denim in this kind of like, badger silhouette, so you can
wear some tights underneath to keep warm. For shoes, I'm wearing these white heels
from Aldo to streamline my legs, and lastly, I threw on some blush earmuffs because
honestly, my ears get super cold, and I feel like having this protection 
would really keep you warm. Regardless of what you're wearing,
if the guy's diggin' you, he's not gonna care what you're wearing
on the outside; it's about your character. Good luck with your day and I hope
you guys have a great time! The third tweet comes from Reese. "What would Jenn wear for a casual Christmas look?" By the time you're watching this,
Christmas will be tomorrow, and chances are I'm definitely gonna keep it casual. So, this is one of my options that I might wear. Starting
from the top, I'm wearing this polo from Guess. There's green and red in it, so I feel
like it kind of gives off Christmas vibe but in a very subtle way. I tucked the top into
these black trousers from Eggie. I took off the chain in the pants just to make them look
less street style and more like a lounge pant. And for shoes, I'm wearing these cute lace-up boots
from Vagabond, and yeah, I called it a day. I think this is a really cool effortless outfit that
anyone can rock on a Christmas Day. Moving on to dilemma four, "What would you wear with an
oversized fur teddy coat? I picked this question up because I
have so many fur teddy coats, and it was really hard to narrow down my favorite one, but this is the one I chose to showcase. This is
my tan teddy coat from Storets. This one is pretty oversized and I love it
because I can layer anything with it, and it keeps me super warm. Since I live in LA, I
rocked it with a thin, white long sleeve But if you live somewhere colder, a white or beige
knit turtleneck would look amazing. I love the way brown and white looks and it's just a foolproof color combo. For my jeans, I'm wearing some
high-waisted black skinnies just because I needed something fitted to
offset the bulkiness of the coat. I'm wearing my chunky black
platforms to add some height, and lastly, accessorize with a pair
of asymmetrical earrings. I think this is a really effortless outfit. You can wear for
grabbing coffee with a friend or just having lunch. So the last question comes from Feiby. "How would you style crushed velvet jogger-style pants
so it looks fashionable and less like loungewear?" Jogger pants can be a little tricky because
they are a type of loungewear and honestly there's nothing
wrong with looking comfortable, but there are slight modifications you can do with your
outfit to make it look more elevated. So this is how I styled my crushed velvet joggers. These are in a festive red color, and I love that they have
black stripes running down both the sides. I wore them with a black bodysuit from Are You Am I, but I think any black top would look
killer with a pair of joggers like these. For outerwear, I wore a long black tuxedo blazer to
elongate and to give the outfit more structure. I really loved how flowy the fabric is and I think
it adds a fashion-forward element to the look. For shoes, I'm wearing some pointed black boots,
and I feel like these finish off the outfit nicely. All right guys, that is a wrap on this
episode of What Would Jenn Wear. If you guys would like to be
featured in the next episode, feel free to write your fashion
dilemma down in the comments, or you can tweet me @imjennim and just send
me your fashion dilemma there. I would love to know how you guys
are celebrating this holiday season. Tomorrow, by the time I'm watching
this, tomorrow will be Christmas and so, Ben and I are having my family over. Ben is gonna be cooking a delicious Christmas roast, and so I'm super excited to be hosting my family. Normally, we always have it at my parents' house, but this year, we thought we'd switch
it up and we thought we would host it. So yeah, I would love to know how you guys are celebrating Thank you guys so much for the support and the
love, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Byeee! Mwah. 
(calm music) - Hi, everyone! It's your girl Jenn and today
is such an exciting day for me because my clothing line
Eggie officially drops today. Like, even saying that
out loud is so surreal. I have been working on
this for such a long time, since the end of last year. So I've been keeping my
lips sealed since then and now I get to just,
you know, break the news! Eggie is baby in Korean and growing up, I was always
the Eggie in the family and now this clothing
line is Eggie of my own. This is a full blown 27 piece collection. There's a lot to go through. And I thought for this first video, I would just, you know,
break down each piece, explain where I got the inspiration, and showcase the items to you guys in a good old-fashioned haul. There's a lot of items in this collection, so let's get crackin'! So I'm gonna start off
with the tops first. Here I have this white ribbed T-shirt. This is called the Fuzzy Baby T. And I think it's a really
great, easy everyday top and it has Eggie in Korean on the corner, and I thought it'd be really
interesting to make it 3D and fuzzy so it just has
like a quirky texture to it. I went for a mock neck
just to make it stand out from the rest of the
graphic Ts on the market. Moving onto the next top, here I have my Try Again Cropped T. This comes in three colors: this blush, yellow, and then black. But then I forgot to film black. When I was showing this in
New York at my press preview, a lot of people were asking
me like what this meant. It's just "try again" but all jumbled up so it implies the viewer to
try again to decipher it. White tops have always been
such a staple in my wardrobe so that's why it was
really important for me to sprinkle a couple in my line. This is my Ruff Haus Blouse
and I absolutely love it. It's this really flowy looking number. It's got kind of like
an Edwardian theme to it with color and the ruffles
and the sleeves as well. It's got this lovely white
polka dot pattern all around it and it just gives it a nice,
beautiful, dainty feel. I also recommend wearing
this with a nude bandeau or a nude camisole, just
to keep you more covered. I've always loved items with
little catchphrases on it, so that's why I made the Now What Blouse. This is the perfect
fitting white button down that's a little sexy but put together. It also has the words
now and what embroidered onto the lapel and I
feel like this is saying that, you know, it's applicable
for a lot of situations and you could even like say "What now?" So they're interchangeable. Over here, we've got the Eggie Hoodie. This is an incredibly
oversized, slouchy, comfy hoodie and I just wanted to make
sure that the sleeves were extra long because I
thought it would be really cool for the proportion. On the sleeve, there's
also Eggie written on it with like an Old English font. There's also Eggie on the hood in Korean, so that way you can just kinda flash it to tell everyone who needs to be babied. I've got another top that
is perfect for the fall. This is the Eggie Long Sleeve. I'm holding the orange one
but it also comes in white. I love both color ways and it's made in the softest material. It's just like a really cozy fabric and I could totally
see myself wearing this as like my pajama shirt during the fall when it gets a little colder. This is also one of those
shirts that you can sleep in and then, like, wake up
and go out the next day in. Very comfortable and easy on the go. This next item is the item to
layer with during the fall. This is my Mesh Bodysuit. I love pairing this with
just little baby doll Ts that are fitted, because it creates a really cool 90s effortless look. I could also imagine
myself layering this over like a fitted turtleneck or
even off the shoulder tops. This is just a really fun
piece to experiment with. Sweater weather is quickly approaching, so I wanted to have just
the nice, snuggly jumper into my collection. This is in a beautiful lilac shade and it's, like, so perfectly 90s. This is in, like, a beyond soft material. I swear, like once you put it on, you don't want to take it off. And this is actually like a happy mistake because this was supposed to
have like a fish cake print all over it but it didn't
embroider correctly so we decided to just X out the embroidery but keep the actual sweater. So now we are done with the tops and I want to talk about this skirt. I think red is such a
power color for the fall and I wanted to make sure
that I really utilized this fun color into this nice skirt. I really love this light, breezy material and I think that the grommets on the side and the lace detailing
really make it unique. Now let's move on to the
jumpsuits and the matching sets. I want to talk about the one
that I'm rocking right now. This is called the Dolores Jumpsuit and it comes in two prints. The first print I want to talk about is the Korean national flower print! Wanted to incorporate some
of my Korean background into my collection. When I was going to Korean school, we sang this song called like
(speaking in foreign language) and it's basically just like praising our beautiful nation flower (laughs). And I thought it would
just be the perfect print to put on this jumpsuit. This jumpsuit like
literally fits like a glove and it's got pockets and it
hugs in all the right places and I absolutely love the back as well. This also comes in
gingham, as you can see. And I guess this is incorporating more of like my American background. When I think of gingham,
I think of picnics, and I named it Dolores
because of Dolores Park in San Francisco. I had a lot of picnics back there and it just reminds me of good times. And I feel like this jumpsuit
would be perfect to wear eating outdoors and
enjoying food and friends. Next up, I've got the Eggie Tracksuit. This is in a nice beige color but it's got a little kick to it because of the checkered
striping on the sides and the armpit. I thought that the checkers went perfectly with the gingham print. Like, look, it's literally the same thing. But I don't know, I just
thought it would go really well together and tie in a nice theme. This is a perfect little
outfit that you can wear at the airport or school or whenever you just want
to blast through errands but stay comfy. So I love wearing matching sets and this one is extra special to me because it has my favorite
fruit printed on them. This is the Korean melon and it's called the (speaking
in foreign language) and I ate these so much
while growing up as a kid. My mom would cut these up after dinner and we'd eat them for dessert. And these are just absolutely delicious. If you've never tried a Korean melon, I highly recommend that you do. This is a really fashion forward piece and I love the pockets on the skirt. Those are a game changer for sure. And if you don't like the melon print, it also comes in a striped version! This is identical to the melon set but it's in a slightly different fabric. Like, it's a little thicker so it'll keep you kind of warmer, so if you live in a colder place, this will keep you maybe 5% warmer. Let's chat about the Knotty
Top and Wide Trousers set. I feel like this is perfect
for the in between summer to fall transition phase because the top is still very
appropriate for the summer. And for the bottoms, these are
just a great fitting culotte. They're such an amazing fit
and you can rock these pants in a business setting. This also comes in black
so it's even easier to mix and match with items
that are already in your closet. Alright, everybody, let's move on over to the outerwear pieces. This is my Tuxedo Blazer
and I am just obsessed with the stripe print. It's so bold and it
coordinates really well with the Stripe Set that I showed earlier. I just love statement jackets and you'll really be making
a splash in this one. This also comes in a black color. And I find that these types
of jackets are always my go to when I want to find a
coat for the evening. So this next jacket is my favorite one, it's the Truck Along patent jacket. This is in a really flashy material. It's so sick and just so unique and it's fun to wear. I wanted to make sure that
it came in red and black, depending on everyone's comfort level. I would say to try the black one if you're just kind of dipping
your toes into this material. This jacket adds so much
personality to any look and all eyes will be on you
when you're rockin' this. Next up in line, I have the Eggie Bomber. I love huge oversized bombers. This is basically supposed
to be like a bomber that, like, your boyfriend's
letting you borrow. Or you stole. It's got like a nice slouchy fit and it's perfect and warm for
those fall and winter days to come. I love cardigans that double as a blanket, so here I have my Cozy Cardigan. It's so long, it's like floor length, and you literally wrap around
in it like a little burrito and you're just so comfortable and cozy. You throw it over anything and
it instantly elongates you. My last coat is a blazer. It's called Gingham Thing. Obviously I wanted to keep the gingham and the checkered theme in my collection, so I thought we'd just bust
out a blazer in this fun print. Throw it on over any casual
look for a polished feel. And also this blazer is so well made. It's lined, it's got pockets, and it's just everything
you would want in a blazer. I can't wait to style
this in a future video. So we are at the last category now. We're gonna be tackling the dresses. This is the Cheeki Slip and I have obviously named
this dress after my dog. This is essentially a bodycon
dress but with a twist and it's perfect to wear on nights out where you just wanna dance
and just have some fun. The next dress is called The Dalva and I actually named this after a bar that Ben and I used to go to. It's in the Mission and it's just like a really romantic spot where you sip on cocktails and get to know someone really well. And this dress is just
a really cool in between of just like casual and formal. It's casual because of the material but formal because of the silhouette. My last dress is called the Shine Slip. This is just my version of the
classic little black dress. The straps are adjustable and we tried to make
them as thin as possible so we could make it even more delicate. And it also has these
sexy cutouts on the side and the material has a
nice soft sheen to it. Alright, guys, that is the end
of this massive Eggie launch. I can't believe that each
and every one of these pieces are in my own line and I
feel so proud and excited to share this all with you. Feel free to shop all the
pieces online at eggie.us and please follow out
Instagram, @eggieshop. We will be posting
exclusive content on there and it'll give you just more ideas on how to style everything. Before I left, I just
wanted to thank you guys for giving me this opportunity
to even have a clothing line, because without you this would
have never, ever happened. I have been on YouTube for seven years and I have been putting my
everything into this channel and building this
relationship with you guys. If I told my 18 year old self that I would have my own clothing line, I wouldn't have believed it and I also would have been terrified because when I first started
YouTube, I was so lost. I was really struggling when
I first started this channel. I got rejected to all my dream schools, I was going to community college, I was working in a smoothie shop, and I just felt like I was
letting everyone down in my life. And YouTube was my little escape to showcase what I knew and
what I felt good expressing, fashion and style. I honestly don't know what
I did to deserve you guys. You guys are the best,
those most loyal subscribers that I could ever wish for and I just appreciate you guys so much. You guys have given me this beautiful life and you guys inspired
me to just work harder, bust my ass, and just try and
produce like the best content and produce the best items that
I possibly can for you guys. I will never stop thanking you because I'll never forget you. Thank you for everything
and I love you guys, you guys are all my Eggies. I also have to thank my Eggie team. Without them, this would
have not been possible. This is not a job for just one person, so I am so thankful that I
have a group of solid people behind my back. Thank you so much. (sighs) I feel like I'm
accepting an award or something but this is literally one
of the biggest milestones I've ever had in my entire life and I just wanna thank you guys so much for being a part of this journey. Thank you a million times. I'll see you guys in the next line. Bye. (calm music) 
(upbeat music) (knocking) - Welcome to the Hamptons! So this is the room that
Ben and I are staying in. Over here we've got the bed. There are like a million pillows. Then over here, we've got
the entertainment center. The TV that we can't
figure out how to turn on. - [Ben] There's a pool down there. - Tennis court's here. - [Ben] Show everyone
how good the English are at basketball. - [Jenn] (laughs) Do you
guys even have a team? - [Ben] No. - No? And then there's this box of goodies. It says "Hello Hamptons, Jenn." I will do an unboxing later so you can see what kind
of goodies are inside. The bathroom! Oh my gosh, look at this tub. It's perfect. - [Ben] Want the water on? - No! (laughs) Everyone's still about to arrive, so we're just going to hang out and then we'll show you
the rest of the mansion. What did we do to deserve this? - So as you can tell, we
are very happy to be here. - I can't believe it's our second year. - I know. Last year was amazing. I mean, it's Revolve. They don't do things half-assed
as we say in England. (laughs) So yeah, we're very happy. And we're just excited
to see everyone as well, all the crew and a bunch
of influencers we know. - Yeah. - So on that short walk,
we're just arriving at house number deux. - Fancy seeing you here! First dinner is gonna be at our house. And it's all set up, it's so beautiful! The cheese has come. - Where's the lipstick? Oh, there's. (laughs) - Hey! - Alright, this is my team. I'm (mumbles)! (shouting) Pizza! Mask. (shouting) Morning. Hello. We are on our way to yoga. A little worse for wear
today, but you know, nothing like some stretching will fix. (laughs) (calm music) So we finished morning yoga. It was a great start to the day. Had acai bowls. Now it is time for lunch. - [Ben] You happy right now? - Yes, so stoked. We're breaking the ice. You know, someone's gotta do it. - [Ben] Course it's us. - Jenn, you're my next victim. - Why? Oh my god. I just realized that
these are real lipsticks. Oh my god! - [Ben] Wow, that's actually a lipstick. - I think Jenn needs one of those. - Yeah. - [Ben] It's the size of your head. (laughs) - Only Jenn Im could get away with this. We gotta redo this, sorry. (laughs) - Alright, it's time to chill. We've filmed four outfits today. Really smashed those out. But now it is time for the pool. Good morning, everybody! It is the next day. Last night was crazy! It was so much fun, I
can't believe that club was literally downstairs the house. I am feeling 100, okay,
maybe like 98 today. I feel good. We're at a beach club in Montauk. It is called Hero Beach Club. And it's so cute! (waves crashing) (laughs) I don't want to be touched by the water. - [Ben] You don't want to
be anywhere near the water. - I just like when the
water chases me, I'm like... Alright, it is the evening now. We just got back from the
beach and it is dinner time! Sean and James are the best chefs ever and tonight's dinner is pasta, my fave. And I believe he used a truffle cheese, so very, very excited. Good morning, everybody. Today is the final day in the Hamptons. We're actually leaving in a couple hours. Last night was so much fun though! They set up this huge
movie night thing outside. We saw Mr. and Mrs. Smith and it was awesome getting
to eat all these snacks and watch movies outdoors. It was so lovely. But after that I was so tired
and so I went to the room and just fell asleep. Before I left, I realized
I never did this unboxing. This is the Hamptons box. I was just packing up and I realized that I probably don't
want to pack this huge bag because I don't think that
there's going to be enough space, so I thought I would
show you what's inside so you all can take a gander. Here is the Revolve box. It's very substantial. Oh, okay! Alright, first up we've got these cute strawberry
fringe tassel earrings. These are from Frasier Sterling. And then there are these
cute palm tree earrings. Oh, these ones say J.I., very cute. And then over here, we've
got some classic seashells. For beauty products, we've
got a coconut face cream by Kopari. Oh, okay. It's very lightweight. It's kind of milky. Mm, and it definitely smells like coconut. Got Oribe Supershine Moisturizing Cream. Oh, I love this! This is the Surfcomber
Tousled Texture Mousse. I haven't used this in forever
but this is really great if you want like that
nice, wavy beach look. We've got Ouai's Wave Spray. This one's a classic. And then we've got this
box from Sugarfina. Yum. So there's a bunch of
gummies, there's rose, some lips, flamingos, and bears. Thank you, Revolve! 
(peaceful music) - Not every morning feels
like a good morning. There are days when I
wake up and I just know it's gonna be one of those days. Before, I would just wallow in my sorrow, but as I got older, I
realized that it's only up to me to flip a bad day around. I'm so happy to partner
with Olay to show you my eight steps on how
I deal with a bad day. Step one, make the bed, the first step is something so simple, but important. You spend a huge chunk
of your life in this bed, so you should treat it like a haven. Making your bed takes less than a minute, and it's actually correlated
with better productivity, and it gives you a sense of well-being. It also gives you a reason
not to jump back in bed, and forces you to get on with your day. Now it's time to freshen
up, hygiene is a huge part of self-care, and your
face should not be neglected. I've been loving to use Olay Daily Facials because of how easy they are to use. The cloths are nice and
dry, so they're great for traveling, and they never dry out. All you do is add a bit of water, and it lathers up so beautifully. I'm all about efficiency,
so that's why I love that this is a five-in-one product. It removes any makeup
from the night before, it washes away dirt and oil, tones skin, hydrates with essential conditioners, and exfoliates to smooth skin. After you cleanse your
face, you reuse the same cloth for a final rinse, and you're done. These are so practical, and
they won't break the bank. I always feel a little bit better when my face is cleansed because it invigorates me to get out the door. This next step is
something that's difficult, but I promise the hardest
part is going out the door. Stepping outside for a run
or a walk always shifts my mindset because it physically
gets me out of the house. As much as it's tempting
to stay inside all day, it'll do your body and
mind some good to breathe in the fresh air and get
those muscles moving. It also helps you release
any pent-up energy from what's bothering
me, and I always feel at least 30% better than
how I was feeling before, because the endorphins
always kick in after my run. If you have a tub, treat
yourself to a bubble bath. This is honestly something I rarely do, so it's truly quite the treat when I do. I like the fact that when
you're here you can zone out. You're literally in a hot tub of water with nothing else to do. The smell of a bubble bath is also just a form of aroma therapy
which can really help me relax. It's a bit symbolic
too, you can physically imagine yourself washing
away your troubles. I've always struggled with
relaying my conflicts, or talking too heavily
about myself to friends or loved ones, so it's super important for me to find another type of release. Writing is both a healthy and
cathartic form of release. I love talking about my feelings, and this is honestly a space where I know I won't be judged for my thoughts. It doesn't have to take
long, write it on a journal, a protected Tumblr, Google Docs, whatever it is, just write it out. For me, a physical space is sometimes a representation of my mental space. A cluttered place is a cluttered mind, and it's really hard to function when a physical environment
literally can get in the way. As I get older and older,
I realize I love to clean. It makes me feel productive,
and even if I'm stressed out on the inside, I
know that at least I have a space that enables me to get things done and work sufficiently productively. It's also just one less worry if I have a full plate of other responsibilities. Last summer I discovered a
meditation app called Headspace. There was a point in my life
where I would do this daily, but now I just try to
get it in whenever I can. Meditation is a habitual
process of training your mind to focus and redirect your thoughts. Studies have shown that the
practice can help develop self-awareness and reduce stress greatly. We live in such a fast-paced
instantaneous world, where we just sometimes need to stop
and breathe in stillness. Practicing gratitude is the oldest trick in the book, but it works. It's so easy to forget what
we have, and focus on the bad. But really, we all have
something to be grateful for. Where you are abundant, remember that someone, somewhere lacks. Redirecting your thoughts
and counting your blessings also helps put into perspective how blessed and privileged I am in this life. It might take a bit of
work, but in the end, reframing my mind is worth the challenge, so try listing out what
you're grateful for. For me, it's the people
in my life, my home, food, Chicky, and the list goes on. Alright guys, those are my eight tips on how to deal with a bad day. I have definitely had my fair share of them, so I know what it feels like. Next time you're in a mental funk, hopefully these tips can help
you flip around your day, and I wanna thank Olay
for sponsoring this video. Make sure to check out their facial wipes in the description box, so I
will leave the link down there. I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the
next one. Bye! (smooching) (peaceful music) 
(upbeat music) - Hi everybody. It's your girl Jenn and welcome back. Today I have an episode of favorites because August is slowly creeping on up and so I thought I would just
gather all my favorite things of July and share them to you like I do every single month. Like honestly, favorites
are just like a tradition and routine at this point and if you don't want to miss a single episode of favorites, make sure you subscribe to my channel. The button is down below. Hit that, become a Jem
today and let's get started. So I'm gonna start with a
couple of fashion bits first. If you've been watching my
videos this year or this summer, then you know that I've been rocking mules like nobody's damn business and here is one of my favorite pairs. This is one from Jeffrey Campbell and I actually love
how little the heel is. It's maybe like 1.5 inches and it's all I need, just
that little extra pep. On days when I want to
be a little bit fancier, I've got this option right over here. These are my dusty blue
suede mules from Raye and these just give me like
Marie Antoinette vibes. It's definitely the color
and the texture as well. It's just so chic and cute and I just love mules
because they're kind of like the chic version of a flip flop. You can slip in and out of
them and look good doing so. So this year I promised myself that 2017 was gonna be a year of
self-growth and so that's why I've just been immersing
myself with self-help books and that's why I have been so happy that I partnered with Audible
because I've been exposed to so many different types of audiobooks. If you don't know what Audible is, it is a service where you just have like a massive library
filled with audiobooks, podcasts, radio stuff,
everything under the sun and one audiobook that I finished is The Subtle Art of Not
Giving A F*ck by Mark Manson and I know that the title
is like kind of jarring, a little douchey, but I swear this book is
not like that whatsoever. I love that it's not like
your average self-help book where it's kind of like be positive, like stop being negative or
just be confident in yourself. Like it's not just half-ass advice. I really like his approach
because it's very raw and realistic and that's
just what I prefer. One huge takeaway that I
took away from this book was the idea that there is
always going to be problems in your life no matter what and I know that this is just a
very obvious piece of advice, but it is a lesson that
really sunk in with me after I listened to this and there was like one really
good quote in this book that just really stuck with me and I'm gonna read it out to you because I don't want to mess up. "Don't hope for a life without problems. "There's no such thing. "Instead hope for a life
full of good problems. "You are defined by what you're
willing to struggle for." And I just love this mentality
because it's so real. I don't know, like the past
few years of my adult life I feel like I was always just kind of like running through the motions of fixing problems, solving problems, like dealing with a problem
and then solving the problem and it really felt just
never ending because it is and I guess I always saw problems
as like a negative thing, like of course another thing went wrong. But that's just what life is. Sh happens and it's just all about the way you deal and handle situations and sometimes a problem
is actually a blessing and I feel like this concept
really just stuck with me and has helped me immensely and there's so many other
great things about this book. This has been an amazing audiobook to just get ready to,
clean the house with. I know a lot of people struggle with finding the time to read a book, but with an audiobook you can
really pop one on whenever and it's good to multitask. Your brain is a powerful thing. You can do a lot of things. If you want to check this out, make sure you head on over
to Audible.com/clothes. They're doing a 30-day free trial. So please check it out. They have so many
different types of genres and if you don't like a book,
you can always switch it out. So it's kind of like a
library, but with audiobooks. My next favorite is an accessory that has not left my body
since I've gotten it. It's this nameplate from Amarilo. I just love dainty and
delicate pieces like this. Like this chain is everything. It's so glimmery, it's
so soft and very feminine and I just actually really love the way that the name is in all caps. Normally nameplate necklaces
they're like in cursive, but I feel like this is
like a nice little twist and because it's summer, obviously my warmer tones are coming out. So I feel like the gold
really brings that out. I just feel like it adds like a perfect little extra oomph to every outfit. A lot of you guys were
wondering where it was from, so I thought I would shout it out. Next up I want to chat
about a skincare product. As you know, I've just been kind of like hopping around with eye creams. The last one that I liked was Korres's Black Pine Eye Serum, but I wanted to find something that was just like a little
bit thicker and richer and that's where Sisley's
Eye Contour Mask comes in. I finally got my hands on this after I used it from my friend Ashley. She like swears by this stuff. It depuffs her eyes and she used it like all throughout college until now and so I finally sipped
the Kool-Aid and I get it. So I use this in the morning and the night and I used to never wear
eye creams in the day, but just I don't know,
maybe it's just the way like my concealer was starting to set, but just something didn't
feel hydrated enough and this just completely solved that. I'll just apply like a little tiny dot underneath both eyes and
my eyes just feel brighter and also my concealer jut sets better now that I have this on my base and yeah, I have been using
this for like over a month now and I've been evening sharing with Ben and I've only used like this amount. So even though it is like
a bit of an investment, I feel like this is gonna last
me a very, very long time. For my movie favorite,
I have the film Get Out. I know, I am so late on recommending this, but you know what, it's
better late than never. I finally got to watch it with Ben. We saw it on like Apple TV and literally after the
film I was just like oh my god, this is one
of my favorite movies. I would say it's definitely
on my top five films for sure and I feel like the last
time I saw a movie this good was probably like Ex Machina and just both these things
are so freaking good. So I guess like technically
it's like a horror film, but like if you are
scared of horror films, like this is not gonna scare you because there's just so
many other elements to it, like it's super funny, it's thrilling and it's kind of like
a psychological bender. Highly recommend this. Like a quick summary is there's a couple and they're finally getting
into the relationship where they're gonna meet
each other's families and they're in an
interracial relationship, so there's a couple differences and I will just leave it at that because it's one of those movies where the less you know the better. So definitely go check it out. It's obviously on Apple TV. Pretty sure it's on Amazon too. So my last favorite is also something that helps with self-growth. I've been using this app called Headspace for the past 27 days and I have just been obsessed with it because I feel like it's
been changing my life for the better. So Headspace is an app where
they do guided meditation and it just improves your mindfulness. So when I first downloaded Headspace, I just had like the free version. So like each of the
meditations were only like three to five minutes long
and they were very peaceful, but like after the third day, like they asked would you like
to buy the premium package and I was like yes I do
and once I bought that one, just a slew of like huge
packages just came in. So by packages I mean they're
like guided meditations that focus on different
things you want to work on. So for example, I've
downloaded self-esteem, basics, creativity, happiness, patience, and the list goes on and you can do a guided
meditation every single day. Right now I am doing the self-esteem one and I know a lot of you guys
think I'm like super confident, but you know, your girl
gets in her head a lot and this is something that
I've just been dying to work on and I feel like Headspace has
really, really been helping. So each of these guided
meditations are 20 minutes long and I know like it seems like a long time and honestly it kind of is, but that's 20 minutes
that are just for you and I think a way to just make sure that you do a meditation every day is just by kind of slipping
it into your normal routine. So I like to meditate
after I have breakfast. I'll go back into my bed and I'll like make my
bed and I'll sit on it and then I'll just do
my guided meditation. One day I would love
to be able to meditate without having like someone guide me, but I feel like this is
making me closer to my goal and this is something
that I want to incorporate for my routine as long as I possibly can. Alright guys, that wraps
up my July favorites. If you're looking for some
music recommendations, please head on over to
my Spotify playlist, which is located in the description box. Please hit that. I have been adding new
songs like every so often just to keep it spiced up. It's mostly like just summer jams, easy songs that you can listen to while you're getting ready or driving. Go check it out. Also I feel like the lighting is just progressively getting worse because it's like I don't know, it's
just a very cloudy day today. So I'm sorry if it just
got super dark at the end. I know a lot of you guys don't care, but it's driving me a little crazy. If you have any recommendations that you want to share
with me or anybody else, write it in the comments down below. I love when everyone is just sharing and dumping stuff that inspires them. I just love that. So if you can drop some love, share what you've been
loving, feel free to do that. I want to wish you guys a beautiful day and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (smacks lips) (upbeat music) 
(slow jazzy music) - Hi everyone, it's your girl Jenn, and today I have the Face of the Month. I have partnered with
Clinique, and I'll be using their Beyond Perfecting
Foundation and Concealer to show you guys how I got this look. It is glittery, it is glamorous, and just perfect for any
summer day or night out. I actually learned this makeup technique from my girl Sophia, so thank you babe. I learn so much about makeup
from her and she's amazing, go check her out if you haven't already. I've also picked out
some questions to answer on Instagram and Twitter,
so just come hang out, grab a snack, get ready with me. Also, if you are not subscribed already, button is down there, hit that, join the family, and let's get started. Alright guys, my face is cleansed, it's moisturized, and there's SPF on it, so now we're gonna jump right into primer. I'm using this one by Pony Effect, it is her Ultimate Prep Primer, and while I apply this onto my face I'll be answering a question from Dafina. She asks, when is the wedding? As you guys know, I am in
contact with the wedding planner. Her name is Jeanie and I know
I'm in good hands with her. So she said our first step
is to create a guest list, so a couple days ago Ben
and I sat down together and we went through, over the
people we're gonna invite, and we want like a relatively
small/intimate wedding, so we want like 100 people max. So now that we have our list we're just gonna go back to Jeanie and we're gonna let her know, and so she's gonna help
us pick the perfect venue for that amount of people. As for timing, we're thinking
about sometime in 2018. You gotta book these venues
like months in advance, so ideally we would love
to do it in the summer, but we're open to the fall
as well, it all depends. We're doing our wedding in California, so the weather should be good either way. Now I'm gonna move onto foundation, and I'm using my go-to one as of lately, which has been Clinique's
Beyond Perfecting Foundation and Concealer,
this is only 28 bucks, and I'm actually gonna use two shades, because I wanna use one to highlight and just one to, like,
be my natural skin tone. So I'm gonna go in with Linen, and I'm gonna use the Doe-Foot applicator and I'm gonna pop that
right underneath my eyes where I wanna highlight. I love how precise you can
be with this applicator. This kinda reminds me of, like, Shape Tape, as I've said before. So I'm gonna work on blending this in, this is a medium to
full coverage foundation so you can use as much
or as little as you want. I'm going to a wedding right after this so I want my makeup to look bomb. So now that we've applied this layer I'm gonna go in with
this shade, Buttermilk. I'm just doing a light layer, because I still want my
skin to peek through. I really love the natural
matte finish this has, and it lasts up to 12 hours, so it's gonna stick on my face all day. So now that foundation
and concealer are done, I'm going to set this
all down with a powder. I'm using this one by Pony Effect, and I'm just going to grab this, like, flat brush from Marc Jacobs, and I'm just gonna pat this on my face. I don't really bake anymore
because I just realized it kinda makes my skin
look a little patchy, so I've been doing this,
like, pat down method. There you go. Have you thought of any
places for the honeymoon? What is your dream destination for it? So Ben and I would love to go to somewhere where we both haven't been, so maybe like Tulum, Mexico or even like an island in Greece, just somewhere warm, and
somewhere we can just relax and enjoy each other's company. Oh, we would even love
to go to New Zealand. There are just so many places
that we haven't been together, so the options are endless. If you guys have any ideas for where we should go on our honeymoon, feel free to write it in
the comments down below. So as you can see I'm
just kind of brushing away any of the excess off,
and now my face is done. Now I'm gonna move on to the brows. I'm using this brow styler by Dior. How did you know that Ben was the one? Well, that is a really,
really good question. With my previous relationships the thought of marriage
or the idea of marriage was just very unsettling, like I just honestly thought
I was a skeptic to marriage because it didn't seem
like something I could do, like, spend forever with this person. That sounded really scary to me. But Ben was different. It sounds so cliche, but I just generally didn't believe in the idea of
a soul mate until I found him, and it wasn't like an overnight thing, it wasn't like right when I got together I was like, he's the one. It definitely came with time, and I think as we kept on spending time together and as we kept on getting
to know each other I just realized, like, woah, I have never been this
compatible with a person before. Like, I'm the type of person where I like to have relationships
outside of my partner. I value time with my friends, I value time with my family, and I value time for my career, and with Ben, I know that we both make each other better people. Like, we have been living
together for like a year, or over a year, and things
have never been better. 'Cause I feel like once
you move in with someone, that's when all the stuff kinda comes out, and it really tests your relationship, but Ben and I are very compatible and I'm so, so grateful for that. The idea of starting a future with him, having kids, it sounds exciting, and I know, I just, I just
know that he's the one for me. Okay, I think that looks fine. Now that the brows are on I'm gonna get started with the eye shadow. This is my favorite part. I am using Nyx's Jumbo
Eye Pencil in Dark Brown, and I am just gonna go to town on my lid. I'm gonna apply it all over, because this is gonna be
a base for the eye shadow, or the liquid eye shadow
that we're gonna be using. And I'm just gonna kind of
smooth out the edges a little bit so they're not so harsh. I know it looks really uneven right now, but we're gonna fix that in just a second. But it is time for the
exciting part, the glitter. This is Stila's Liquid Eye
Shadow in Molten Midnight, and I'm gonna grab this little wand and I'm going to precisely apply that right over the dark brown bit. Damn, look at that, look at that shimmer. I'm gonna go in with my finger, and I'm just gonna kind
of pat that all out. Do you ever want kids? If so, how many? I would love children in the future. In a perfect world I would have two kids. I would love to have,
like, one of our own, like I would get pregnant once, and then I would love
to adopt another one, and that would just be great, because they would always have each other and I know Ben would
be such an amazing dad and I would try my best to be
the best mother I could be. I would say that we are
pretty nurturing people so I would love to raise
two kids in the world. That would be, that would be perfect. Now that the glitter is on, I'm gonna really focus
on blending this guy out, it looks like a hot mess. I'm going in with Kat Von D's
Monarch Eyeshadow Palette. I'm gonna go in with this dark
brown shade right over here. I'm gonna grab a little bit of that, tap off the excess, and I'm gonna focus on
blurring out the outer thirds. I don't know about this,
this looks a little crazy. See if this helps out. How do you maintain such
a cool cheerful attitude while being so busy? How do you manage social and work life with your cray schedule? I've definitely mentioned this before, but I am a crazy, avid planner. I love to just schedule
everything on my phone and on my happiness planner. If I don't do that, I don't know how I would keep up with everything. It just keeps me sane, so that's how I'm able to juggle
my social and my work life. As for my attitude, it
absolutely fluctuates. I'm not always happy and cheerful. I know a lot of you guys
are under the impression that I'm like constantly happy, but, I have my, like, I have deep mood swings, and I don't think I've
ever mentioned that, but my highs are like soaring high, like I feel so happy when I'm happy, but when I'm feeling down, sometimes I can get into a
very, very dark, dark place. And the last thing I need
when I'm in that dark state is to record that and have more judgments and opinions about me, because I'm a very sensitive person, and when I'm at my
darkest points of my life I just, I don't really
feel like documenting that and I think that's fair. I know some people see it as an outlet and they like to connect
with their audience that way, but for me when I'm feeling down I just need to be alone,
and be around people that understand the full
context of my situation. And I think that's fair, I
don't think that's being fake, I don't think that's being inauthentic. I think it's just being more particular in what you choose to
share to the online world. And then I'm gonna go in with that same taupe color right over here, and I'm gonna just put that
all over my under eyes. Okay, I'm gonna go in one
more time with this glitter as like, the last hurrah of shimmer, because I think some of it got lost as I was blending out. Now for my inner corners I'm gonna go in with Colourpop Summer Loving. I'm gonna just pop that into the inner corners of my eye, and this is just gonna
brighten everything up and add even more glitter. Alright, very happy
with the way that looks. So now I'm gonna give myself a classic cat eye using
Kat Von D's Tattoo Liner, and I'm not gonna speak while doing this because there's no way in hell I can talk and do a straight cat eye, so I'm gonna go quiet for a second. Pretty severe wing,
but I think we're fine. I think what I'll do is
I'll just smoke it out underneath a little bit more, so it just kinda goes with
the tail a little better. Now I'm gonna get started on the lashes. I'm gonna go in with the
Shiseido Full Lash Mascara. What weird food combinations
do you really enjoy? So I have the habit of
putting kimchi on everything, Ben always thinks I'm
really strange when I do it, but I just can't help the
fact that it tastes so good. Like for example I love
kimchi and Shepherd's pie, that's bomb. Kimchi and spaghetti, that's delicious. So now that mascara is done I'm gonna go in with some falsies. These are by Velour. So now that my lashes are
intact, I'm gonna contour. I'm using this palette from Lorac. I'm gonna go in with the light contour, and then I'm just gonna start
givin' myself some cheekbones. Oh, wow, that is very dark that is, that is too dark. Okay, how do I fix this? Oh my gosh, oh God. The beauty blender saves everything. Okay, okay. (exhales loudly) So, FYI, light contour isn't so light with the Lorac palette, okay. So while I do the other side I'm gonna answer this question. This is from Monica, she asks, what should you do if you're
feeling lost with your life? Cough, asking for a friend, cough. The last time I felt
the most lost in my life was when I was in community college. I got rejected to all my dream schools, I was stuck living at
home with my parents, and that was actually when I started my YouTube channel with Sarah. I used all my feeling of
angst and discouragement and just feeling lost,
into a creative outlet, and I found myself because of that. So I think if you're feeling lost you just gotta do things that
make you more self aware, you gotta learn about
yourself a little bit more. So whether it's journaling or filming or creating art, something
in that field that's gonna make you just get to know
yourself a little better, you will find the meaning. If you seek, you will find. For blush I'm using this one by Hourglass, this is my first time using it. It looks very, very beautiful,
looks like the world. This blush is very pigmented
as you guys can tell. I'm gonna go in with the beauty blender and hopefully this fixes this as well. So the moral of the story is, your beauty blender can
literally fix anything. All your makeup mistakes. So blush is done, and now
we're gonna highlight. I'm using this one by Dior, this is their Dior Skin
Nude Air Luminizer. Everyone is going bonkers
over this highlighter, so I'm excited to try it out. (laughs) Wow, I like. I like a lot. Oh yeah. Do you like being called
Korean or American? I consider myself a Korean-American because even though I'm
100% Korean by blood, I was born and raised in Los Angeles. The strange thing is that I'm considered a foreigner by both sides. In America I'm considered a
foreigner because I'm Korean and when I go back to Korea, they see me as a foreigner
because I was born in America. So it's a very interesting position, Korean-Americans, or
any like minority, has, when they are born in America, and luckily I am happy with who I am and I have like, a community of people who are in the same boat as me, so I never feel alone,
it's just interesting. So the last step is lipstick. I'm using Colourpop's Screenshot. This is kind of just like a good nude, I love Colourpop. Alright everyone, this
is the finished look. I think this is perfect for
any summer days or nights out, any time you just wanna
feel a little extra glam. I'm actually heading to
a wedding after this, so I think this makeup is gonna
be (clicks tongue) for that. If you enjoyed this video,

(upbeat electronic music) - Hi, everyone, it's ya girl, Jenn, and I'm so happy that the holiday
season is officially here. This is my favorite time of year because there is so much going on, like parties, lots of
food, and just more reasons to get dolled up or stay cozy. Today, I'm gonna be talking about the newest additions to Eggie,
which is my clothing line. If you guys are interested
in any of the other collections that I've created,
head on over to the cards. I'll leave them up there. But let me focus on this drop. I wanted to create pieces that would just reflect any type of situation you might find yourself this time of year and I'm so excited to just go through every item, piece by piece,
so let's get started. So I'm gonna start with dresses first. Here is the Lady's in Chain slip. I wanted to put in something
super glam for all the ladies who just want to shine on New Year's Eve or any holiday event. If you want to channel your inner Samantha from Sex in the City, this is your dress. It's in this really
slinky, satin material and just the chains, it is so industrial and I love how it contrasts with such a, like, a feminine fabric. I highly recommend this black dress if you don't have a little black dress already in your closet, this
could be the one for you. During this time of year,
there are a lot of options for shindigs and parties,
and so I wanted to create another going out look. This is a set. This is Trunchbull top
and the Trunchbull skirt and I named it after Miss
Trunchbull from Matilda. She is the boss, takes no crap from anyone and this outfit just kind
of embodied that for me. This set definitely
exudes, like, professional, demanding vibes because
of the pinstripe pattern. But in order to not make is so stuffy, I thought that these nice
exposure details in the middle would really lighten it
up and make it shine. I love this set and I
like that even though I'm technically covered
up, it still feels sensual because it's so bodycon. Next up I have the Miss Honey dress, which is named after the
sweet and nurturing teacher from Matlida. Basically, the complete
opposite of the Trunchbull, but yeah, this is just a
really sweet and modest yet chic dress that you can rock to maybe, like, a family dinner, meeting the parents, or church. I just wanted to create
something that was longer because I know I have a lot
of miniskirts and minidresses, so this is a nice, fresh
silhouette that you guys can rock. It's midi- but in case you
want to show some extra skin, you can pop open a couple
buttons and flash that leg. I must mention that it also has pockets. I wanted to make sure that my ladies had somewhere to put their
hands during awkward situations or maybe you just need
somewhere to store your phone. Basically, pockets are
always a great option and this dress has it. Next up is the Delilah dress. This dress has got a really nice, thick, substantial material to it and I just love anything off the shoulder, so this is perfect for those of you who want to show a little decolletage. I'm also a huge fan of polka dots because they're just a timeless print. I love billowy sleeves and I feel like this dress really plays
with your proportions in all the best ways. The last dress I have is
the Queen of Diamonds slip. This is just like your
traditional slip silhouette but with a very contemporary
checkered print. It has this black lace
trimming on the front and the bottom and it just adds a nice feminine detail to it. For a night out, I would
wear this just on its own with a red lip and earrings, but if I wanted to just
make it more casual, you could just throw a sweater over it. All right, so let's move
on over to outerwear. Here is the Holiday Cozy cardigan. This is a remake of the
Cozy Cardigan from drop one, but we made a couple
of different additions. For example, the fabric is a lot softer. It's in this really nice, buttery knit. We've also made it a vibrant red, which is perfect for the holidays. And, lastly, we've added pockets. The Cozy Cardigan was
one of our best sellers, so I thought that we would create just one with some modifications and something that is really festive. Also, I feel like even after Christmas, this cardigan can be worn in the spring because red is still having
a huge moment right now. So this next jacket is
hands down my favorite. This is the I'll Be Back anorak and I love the fact that I
could see anybody rocking this. It's definitely the most unisex piece. It's in this sick camo print
with checkered detailing all over the sleeves. It's also very oversized. What I'm wearing right now is a small, so you can really layer any piece with it. It's kind of like your modern-day cape if you were, like, a
superhero or something. That's where I actually got the name. It is a nod to the Terminator
when he says, "I'll be back." I feel like he'd be wearing this anorak. The last jacket I have is the Luna hoodie. This is so luxurious and soft. This honestly feels
like I'm petting Cheeki. It's so soft but it's faux fur. This is a cropped zip-up hoodie
with gold chain detailing. It also has a cute little E
for Eggie charm at the end. This also this satin lining
and it feels really good to slip into and I'm wearing a size large because I just wanted something
that was more oversized, something that I could just, you know, chuck on over anything, but if you want something more fitted, definitely
go for the smaller sizes. So the last category is tops
and so I'm gonna talk about the sweater that I'm rocking right now. This is the Salmon Stripe sweater. This is just your every day cozy sweater. You can wear it to class. You can wear it home. You can wear it to the grocery store. I thought I would just play around with the stripe sizing by having some fat stripes on the chest and some thin stripes on the sleeves. It's just a really
quirky, every day sweater that you might love. Next up I have the Hot and Cold turtleneck and I named it this because even though it's in a
traditional turtleneck silhouette that's supposed to keep you
warm, it will not do that because it's in this mesh material. Basically, I would say that
this has no functionality to it but it's purely for the aesthetic and I live for pieces like this. This is definitely a look. I would rock this layered with dresses or overalls or something, or,
if you're just gonna wear it on its own, I would recommend wearing a black bodysuit
or a black bralette. The last top I have is the Check Mate tank and this silhouette is pretty similar to the Lady's in Chains
dress because it has that same draping effect on the front. I feel like this is really flattering and it's also in that really
luxurious satin material. I love this fabric
because it just makes you feel like a million bucks. So that is a wrap on the haul. I hope you guys enjoyed the pieces. I honestly had so much fun
designing this capsule collection and I can't wait to see how all these pieces look like on you. If you would like to follow
our Instagram @eggieshop, feel free to do so, there's a
lot more inspiration on there. If you're interested in the pieces, head on over to eggie.us
and I'll also leave a link in the downbar, so please check that out. I want to thank you guys
so much for watching. I'm gonna head out because
this lighting is horrendous. I need to make a note
to myself not to film past 2:30 because the light
just gets progressively worse. Anyway, I hope you guys
are having a beautiful day and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (relaxed music) 
(mellow music) - What's up, YouTube? It's your girl, Jenn, and today's video is gonna be about Korean beauty and skincare. I'm gonna do a haul and a demo
on all these products here. It's been awhile since I've
done a video like this, so I thought it was
about time that I do one. Also, if you are a lover of K Beauty, make sure you're subscribed to my channel. It takes a second, or less than a second, to become a gem. So with that said, let's get started. So I'm gonna run through
some skincare items first. Here I have the Egg Mouse
Soap by Too Cool for School, and I've actually used another
product from this line. It was called the Egg Mouse Pack, which is like a mask for your face, and this product is pretty
similar, especially the texture. So what you do is you
shake the bottle very well and you squirt maybe like a
golf ball size onto your palm. And it's really thick
and bouncy and moussy. It's almost like a meringue. What I'll do is I'll just apply it all around my face, kind of massage it, and then rinse it off with warm water. I would highly recommend that you use an oil based makeup remover or like a makeup wipe
first before using this because this on its own doesn't do a good job removing makeup. So as long as you double
cleanse, this product is great. Next up, I've got this
exfoliator by Neogen, and I've also used this
product in the past, but their red wine version. They came out with a lemon
one, so I had to try it. It's super refreshing and I
love using it in the morning. Sorry, I just love the way this smells, but I'll use this after I wash my face, and then I'll grab one of these pads, and then using the rough, coarse side I'll use that to just gently massage and exfoliate everything away, and I'll do that for
maybe 20 to 30 seconds. Then I'll flip it to the back, and this is like a nice, quilted side, and then I'll use that
to pick up all the debris and just kind of, I don't know, it's just a nice sensation to do. It's also part of the directions. After, I will rinse once more, and then my face is
exfoliated and just baby soft. I'll use this maybe two
or three times a week, nothing more than that, because you don't wanna over exfoliate. But, it is important to do so, because when you don't exfoliate, like when you layer different products, like serums and creams, it's not fully sinking into your skin, so when you exfoliate it's kind of like raking the leaves away, and that way the product
just really sinks in. Next up, I've got this mask by Dr. Jart. This is their Clear Skin Lover, and I love their masks because they're so easy to pop on and I feel like they're very effective. This one I like to use
during that time of the month when all flows in town. That's the only time where
I start breaking out, but I feel like with this mask it really keeps all the
pimples under control. There's a little packet
with the product inside. So, I'll just slather it all over my face, and once that's on there
I'll open up the actual mask. This is like a very delicate mask, so if you've got long nails you're probably gonna puncture it, but don't worry, if you
get holes in it it's fine. Then you just let everything
marinate for 15 to 20 minutes, and then I'll peel it off. And I know some people they just like to leave all
the product on their face. I like to rinse it off, because it's just a lot of product. So I'll rinse it off
and then I'll essence, and my serums, and my night creams, but I'll save that for
my skincare routine. So now I'm gonna move
onto some makeup products. The first brand I'll be
speaking about is Pony Effect, and I love Pony so much. I had the pleasure of meeting her in LA, and if you don't know who Pony is she's like my favorite
Korean makeup artist. She's amazing. She's just as beautiful
and sweet in real life, and I just wanted to try out
some more of her products. You guys know I love her contour pallette, so I grabbed a couple
more items to try out. The first is my newest obsession, which is the Blurring Powder. So what I'll do is after I apply my foundation and concealer, I'll grab my beauty blender and I'll pop it into this mesh bit, and then I'll just put
it on my under eyes, my smile lines, my nose, and my forehead. I don't bake because
I'm not an oily person, so I'll just leave it on
for maybe five seconds. Then I'll grab a big fluffy brush and just brush all the excess off. It does a really great
job keeping me matte. I find that this powder kind
of like blurs over pores because it's such a fine powder. Yeah, definitely expect to see it in a future makeup tutorial. The next Pony Effect item that I have is the Intense Eye Tint. This is in the shade Lucky Charm, and it's in this gorgeous
bronzy metallic shade. This is a liquid eye shadow, so the first time I used it
was a little challenging, because it was my first time
ever using a product like this, but I think I've got the hang of it. So what you'll do is grab
the doe foot applicator, and you only have one coat to do this. What I found is that you can't
really layer with this item. Even if you let the first layer dry, when you go in with the second coat, it just gets wet again, and it can become a little patchy. So you just get it right the first coat. It leaves a really
pigmented, metallic color, and then I'll go in with the brush to make it seamless at the ends. Now I'm gonna talk about a highlighter. This is her Strobing Luminizer, and I'm obsessed with the packaging. I love the rose gold. It comes in a beautiful pump like this, and all you need is half. A full one is a little too much. But, I'll warm it up
in the back of my hand, and then with a damp beauty blender I'll pop it onto the
cheekbones, nose bridge, Cupid's bow, chin, all the normal areas, and it does a beautiful job
just luminizing the face. This is definitely more
of a natural finish. It's not gonna make you look like you're frigging glowing to the gods, but this is something
that's more everyday, casual, and it does a great job. My next item is this brow product by Clio, and this has two functions. The first end is the tattoo pen, and I find this part
really difficult to use, especially for me, because I'm so used to using a brow pencil that I don't really know
what to do with this marker. I've tried drawing it on my brows, but I feel like I don't have much brows, so when I draw it in it just looks odd. So I'll just use my normal brow pencil, and then I'll use the brow mascara, which is on the other end. Now, this is what I love. This is a very pigmented brow gel, and it just leaves my brows
looking nice and soft and brown, and I feel like it really
complements my hair color, because, as you know,
my eyebrows are black, so this gives it more of like
a nice, brown, natural look. So now I want to talk about
some items from Etude House. First is the Play 101 Stick. The first bit is the contour side, and I just like to use
this to contour my nose. I've tried doing it on the cheekbones, but I don't know, I just
prefer the way powder looks. I still haven't mastered this, but for the nose it's amazing. I'll use this to make my nose look a little bit more defined and just use my fingers
to blend everything in. And the other side is the highlighter, and if I'm gonna be honest I don't use this side too much because I'll just use any
of my other highlighters, but in the clip I'll kind of
show you what it looks like, and it does a really great job. My last item is a mascara. This is Etude House's Curl Fix Mascara, and this is one of the most
water resistant mascaras that I've ever come across. Literally, tears, everything,
it just doesn't come off. And, if you have really
short tiny lashes like me, this is also great, because
the formula is very, very dry. So, once you curl your lashes
and then you apply this on, they're just up and perky,
which is very, very nice. The downside is it's a bitch to remove. It takes like a good douse to pad with heavy eye makeup remover, and you just have to leave it on your eyes for like a good minute, but other than that,
this product is great. Alright everyone, those
were all the products in this Korean beauty slash skincare haul. I hope you guys enjoyed it. If there is a product that
you'd like me to test out or one that you recommend, please leave it in the

(chill music) - Good morning! Today's breakfast is a decadent one because it's Friday, woo! We've got some baked beans, toast, a little tiny slice of turkey bacon, and a pile of potatoes. Getting ready currently

portion of the episode. But yeah, I'm super excited to be here. It's like a whole production, guys. There's trailers, there's hair and makeup, there was a fitting yesterday. So I've been running around this week, but now I'm gonna definitely
grab some coffee, much needed. Of course, you'll always
find me by the food. Dang, they're making omelets here. - [Man] Salsa? - [Jenn] I would love spicy salsa. - [Man] Maybe some chopped serranos? - Mm. Wow, look at this makeup setup. This is goals right over here. - Contour.
- Contour. - Snatched.
- Snatched. (laughter) (chill music) - And action. - So I'm behind the trailers. We just wrapped. It is four o'clock and
the set went so well. I freaking love any set. I wanted to film more but it
actually just got a little too hectic to bring this camera out because we were doing so many takes. This is kinda giving me a taste of what doing commercial work is like and it's so interesting to do
it because there's like a team of 40 people in front of you. I'm gonna see everyone again on Friday and I'm just super happy with
the way everything turned out. Everyone's so nice and I just feel happy 'cause we got all the
work that we needed done. (chill music) So, today we're filming in
this huge mansion in Malibu. Oh my god, I'm obsessed
with these ceilings. So this is the living room which we've pretty much
made into a crazy set. All the flooring is carpet. Hey babe. - Besitos. - Oh my gosh, how's it going? - Good.
- Having fun at the shoot? - We're having so much fun.
- I know. - And can we move here. Like this house is just bomb.
- I know. Honestly, I feel like if
we did move into the rooms, no one would even notice. - No, did you show them the pool already? - No, I didn't.
- You need to go. - (grunts) Over here we
have this crazy backyard. It's got a fire pit. Man, if I lived here Cheeki
would have the time of her life. This deck is insane. We are assembling the
gift baskets over here, waiting for Iris. - Hey hoe.
- Hey baby girl. Today our moms are on set. My mom's getting her hair and makeup done. (chill music) Oh my gosh, hello everyone. It is Friday, six o'clock. Yesterday, I came back from Bali. Oh my gosh, that trip was amazing. It was un-Bali-vable. Someone wrote that as a
comment on one of my pictures and I was like (tongue
click) that pun is so good. I am surprisingly not jet lagged. It's six o'clock and I'm doing just fine. Right now, I just repacked my bags because today is Sophie's
surprise birthday party. We rented out a huge house for her that we're just gonna
be with all our friends and she has no idea. Last night when I landed,
I wasn't able to go to her like surprise dinner karaoke thing which I was so upset about, but I had arrived at around 11
o'clock and I was just shot. But I knew that I would spend the rest of the weekend with
her so I didn't feel too bad. We have all our stuff packed up in the big suitcase over there and now we're gonna get going. (chill music) You guys, look how cute this setup is. I'm about to cry! We just got to the house. We are up in the Hollywood Hills, folks. Look at his view. This is insane! You could see Downtown over there, deet. We've got a little fireplace here. Have a few heart to hearts
on these lawn chairs. So Sophie's about to come
in through those doors any second now. The suspense. ♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫ Happy birthday to you! (cheering) - Oh my god. (chill music) Okay, it is the morning after. How do you feel about your surprise? - It was surreal, it was
amazing, and I cried. - She did.
- It was so sweet. My friends are so nice. I have the best friends
in the entire world. - We care about you so much. - I know. - It was so hard to
keep it a secret though because I felt so bad that
I missed the karaoke night. I was like, god damn I was supposed to surprise you there too but - Everyone, but yeah it was so good. It was so fun and the
party will go on today. - I know, I'm so excited. We got one more day in this funky house. I still have to do a house tour. This place is - It's so retro.
- Yeah. Right now, Sophie's
using like a combination of Weylie's makeup and then luckily I got some brushes from Bali so - Yes, clean brushes. Weylie packed my stuff because
it was a surprise yesterday so Weylie, my boyfriend had
to pack up all my clothes and makeup so she just gave
me a bunch of her makeup so (chill music) - What is up, guys? Today is Wednesday, hump day. I am actually on set
for a shoot with Macy's. Very, very busy month for
March but we are in a house somewhere in Silver Lake. Check out this gorgeous living
room, it's filled with light. We've got a little clothing rack. I believe these are Sierra's clothes. But I'm just like digging the decor here. Everything's fun and bright. I'm shooting a video with Macy's for their spring trends lookbook. I can't believe spring's already here. This is my first outfit. Sierra and I are gonna be
doing a little photo shoot, like a little gif thing. (chill music) Hi Chee. Shaboo. Ugh, okay. Wow, I literally got done packing. I just finished up my Macy's shoot. It went amazing. I can't wait to see how
the video comes out, but I'm actually heading
out to New York tomorrow so I've got all my bags packed up. I am now leaving to go bowling
for Weylie's 24th birthday. This is a surprise. She has no idea that
I'm coming or Emily or She has no idea that we're
going bowling for her. So this month has just
been full of surprises. But yeah, I'm getting an Uber now. I'm picking up Emily
because she's along the way. I believe we're going to
X Lanes so I'm excited. I am a horrible bowler
but I just love like the bowling atmosphere with
all the lights and whatnot. So I'm with Emily. We see Weylie and Wah, the backs of them. We're gonna go an surprise them. - Oh my god, okay, let's do it. Here we go. - [Jenn] Happy birthday!
- [Weylie] I knew it! - [Jenn] Aw, you knew it?
- [Weylie] I knew it! - [Jenn] No! - [Sophia] She knew everything. - [Jenn] Hi Wah. - [Wah] Hey Jenn. Thanks for coming. - [Jenn] Yeah, of course. ♫ Happy birthday to you! - Thank you. (cheering) (chill music) - What's up, guys? I'm officially in New York. I just checked into my hotel room. I'm staying at The Dream. This is my hotel room. I could easily do a hotel tour just by spinning you guys around. I spent most of the plane ride editing my March Favorites video so I'm gonna export that and
while that's doing its thing, I'm gonna go downstairs
and get a bite to eat. I walked to the Apple store. It was less than a mile
away, nice brisk walk. The weather's nice. I can't open this. But yeah, now I have four
of these MacBook chargers. When I went to Austin, I forgot
to pack a charger as well so I'm just kind of annoyed at myself. I can't believe I forgot to pack it again. I'm gonna attempt to get this
open and upload the vlog, or I gotta export the video
and then upload the vlog. I also got dinner at this
little Chinese restaurant. It just sounded good to
get wonton soup so I did. And then I also got some shumai to eat tomorrow for breakfast. (chill music) You guys, look where Dani takes me. She comes to my hotel, she
takes me through the subway. What is this? This is the toilet paper exhibition? - Yes. (chill music) - I just wanted to pop
in and end the vlog here. Thank you so much for watching. If you enjoyed, please

(gentle music) - Hey everyone, welcome
back to my channel. Mother's Day is quickly approaching, so I've partnered up with Target to create the ultimate Mother's Day Gift Guide. I have all the items in
this lovely container here, and the theme is happy together. Last month, my mom, along with Irishcel and her mom, we all
filmed this video together for Target in Malibu. It was such a great experience because it was the first time both of our moms have seen us in our element like that. I will leave a link to that
in the description box, as well as the card section on the side. Make sure you watch that video. It was such a fun day. But this video is about this basket right over here. My mom and I love spending time together by pampering ourselves, so I put a couple of her favorites in this basket. If you love gift guides like this, make sure you're subscribed to my channel. The button is down below. So without further ado, let's get crackin' with the basket. First up, I've got two face
masks that I popped in. These are both from the Yes To brand. The first one is just a
calming cucumber mask. The second is a detoxifying
charcoal mud mask. I just threw these in because my mom goes through these like Tic Tacs. She loves face masks so much. She likes to pop them on
when she's watching TV or just winding down, so I just added some to the basket just to make sure her mask stock is full. I decided to put two because maybe next time I see her, we could both put these on together. Next up, I have two complexion sponges by the brand Real Techniques. I love this brand because it's by one of our YouTube OGs, Pixiwoo. They went on to create
this successful brand. I just put these in the basket because my mom has expressed to me that sometimes she finds it difficult
to blend her foundation all the way, so I though
that these sponges would be perfect. There is a flat edge so you can really get in the nooks and crannies of the face, and it's gonna give you
that nice airbrushed finish. Moving onto the next item, I have Pixi's Makeup Fixing Mist. I've heard so many amazing things about this product,
especially from Irishcel. She converted me while we
were filming at Target. She grabbed this and was like, "We need "to put this in the gift basket "because it's amazing." You spray this after
you put your make up on, or even after a couple hours you've put your makeup on. Basically, use this to set it, and it prolongs your makeup wear. My mom works long hours, and so I thought that this would be a really great product that she can just spray on when she feels like she needs a little
extra oomph to her face. It will always keep her skin looking dewy and fresh. My mom has always been
the type to just rock a natural, fresh makeup look. She doesn't really go for the bold colors, so I decided to put in this lip color. This is by Burt's Bees. This is their Gloss Lip Crayon in the shade Pink Lagoon. I thought that this pinky shade would be something that she would feel comfortable wearing. This is a hydrating
and nourishing formula, so it's not gonna leave her lips looking dry or crackling. This is gonna just keep her
lips feeling comfortable. I also got my mom a little robe that she can lounge around in while
she's pampering herself. This is made from a really soft jersey cotton material. It's very breathable,
so it's gonna be perfect for those hot summer days or nights, so she won't be sweating in her robe. This is something that she'll
be very comfortable in. It also adds a nice texture to the basket. It really ties in the
theme really well together. Lastly in the gift basket, I had to throw a candle in. Who doesn't love candles? I hate buying candles for myself, but I love getting candles as a gift, so that's what I did for my mom. This is in the scent Sweet Sangria. I got this scent for her because I know that she loves really sweet, fruity, citrusy scents. This smell is right up her alley, so I thought I would get it for her. This is in a nice gold
case, so this is something that you could put on your
table, and it instantly becomes an accent piece. All right, guys, so
those were all the items in my gift basket. These are all available
at Target to purchase. I will leave a link in
the description box, so please check that out. I hope this reminded you to give your mom some extra love this year. This gift is just a small
token of appreciation of how much my mom has
scarified for our family. She's done so much for my brother and I. I just can't thank her enough. She's just everything to me. I just love her so much. She's dealt with so much, as well, from putting me through piano school, SAT school, and I failed
at everything so hard, but she didn't give up on me. Yeah, that's what family's about. If you wanna leave me a comment saying what your favorite memory with your mom is, I
would love to hear that. I would say, huh, I think recently, my most favorite memory was just going to the Huntington Library with her and the rest of my family. She just had an exceptional time there. She's always loved nature because she's from the countryside. So when she went to
the Huntington Library, there were just so many botanical gardens. She was just really, really,
enjoying her time there. Seeing her that happy made me happy. Yeah, if you'd like to
leave a little memory with you and your mom in
the comments down below, I would love to read about it. If you enjoyed this video, make sure you hit the like button. Subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already. I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. Mwah. (gentle music) 
(upbeat music) - Hi, everyone, it's your girl Jenn and today I am finally filming my favorite books of all time video. This is actually one of
my most requested videos and I thought I would just buckle down, film it today and it was just, the problem was that it was really hard to narrow it down to only 10 books but I tried to make it as
well-rounded as possible, just kinda genres for everybody. Also, if you are not subscribed by now, what are you waiting for? The button's down below. Come join the family. Stay up to date and with that said, let's get cracking with the books. The first book I'm gonna
recommend is East of Eden by John Steinbeck. This book is a classic. It's just like a piece of literature that I feel like everyone
needs to read before they die. I mean, there's a reason why this is assigned reading in school but I know it's not fun when
you're forced to read it and you're getting graded on it but I swear, with fresh eyes
and reading recreationally, this book is gonna take you on a journey. It's about two families,
the Trasks and the Hamiltons and there's just a whole lot of drama. The tea has been spilt and
it goes on generations. I feel like this book has
everything you need in a story. It's got guilt, it's got rivalry, it's got the struggle to be
loved and finding acceptance and also, I feel like this book has the best villain of all time, Cathy. She is psycho, she's
crazy and just raunchy and she does like the craziest stuff and she just kept me
thoroughly entertained. Every time she was in
a chapter, I was like, ah, my girl is back. It's very clear, easy to understand and it's just a masterpiece. Moving on to book number two. I have Kafka on the
Shore by Haruki Murakami. I have read a number of Murakami books like Wind-Up Bird
Chronicle, Norwegian Wood but Kafka on the Shore will
always remain my favorite. It's about a boy, a teenager. He runs away from home and
he tries to find his lost mom and his lost sister and he ends up spending some
time in this little town and he works at a library and that's where things start
to get a little twisted, a little dark and very, very surreal. One of the main reasons
why I love Murakami is that he really takes you
on psychological mind-benders. You really don't know
where he's gonna take you and he creates such vivid scenes that I would have never imagined and I love the fact that he
just takes you from point A to B to C to Z, just everywhere. I remember when I was reading this, I was really trying to
learn how to lucid dream. I was drinking all these
teas and all this stuff and reading a Murakami just made me feel like I was dreaming. That was the closest I've
ever come to lucid dreaming. I've never met an author or
I've never read an author like Murakami and so I think it's so cool that he has his own distinct way of writing and storytelling. If you're the type of person that needs all the buttons buttoned and all the ends tied in a pretty bow, I'm not sure if you'll like this because this is more about
the journey and the experience than a clear explanation. My next book is The Five
People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom. This is one of those books that you can just smash out
in a day or read on vacation. It's one of those nice, happy books. It's about an old man named Eddie and he just kinda lived
a dull, meaningless life and on his 83rd birthday, he dies and that's not a spoiler alert. It happens within the first chapter and also clearly he dies
because heaven is in the title but each one of these people he meets, they explain his connection with him and how they changed
his life or vice versa knowingly or unknowingly. Some people might think
it's corny or cheesy but I love this book. It left me feeling all
happy and warm inside and so if you're looking
just for a quick, happy read, this is the one for you. Alright, gonna keep cracking on. My next book is Ready
Player One by Ernest Cline and this was actually recommended
by a bunch of you guys so thank you. You know me so well. This is one of my favorites now. This is a sci-fi dystopian novel which is right up my alley. I love books like this and it is in a world where
just everything is in shambles. Pretty much everyone's living in poverty because global warming
has just taken a toll and a lot of people just escape this world by going into this virtual
reality called the OASIS. It's kinda like The Matrix and internet. The main character is a teen named Wade and he spends all his time in the OASIS and he is dying to play
this scavenger hunt game because the winner of that game, it's kinda like winning the lottery so a lot of people see that
as their way out of poverty and Wade just has to go through
all these crazy adventures and there's so many 80s
references and I love it. It really takes you on
thrilling adventure. Definitely recommend it
if you're looking for just a fun adventurous read. Moving on to more dystopias. Had to feature 1984 by George Orwell. This is another literary classic. Highly recommend. It's about a world where the government controls absolutely everything
even the way people think and there's no sense of individuality. There's no speaking up. It's like a tyranny
where just the government is constantly watching. Big brother's watching. And it follows a man named
Winston and his job is an editor so he rewrites documents
and just Photoshops photos so these historical documents
follow the government story. From an outside perspective,
Winston's a good man following and showing
face but in actuality, he is just freaking miserable and he's trying to find a
way to rebel and resist. This is a very bleak read but I just, I find these stories so fascinating because this could have easily
happened to where we live now and there are places in the world where this is a reality
and not just a story. Also, Marzia is the one who
got me this copy for Christmas a few years ago so thanks babe. So this is my last book
on dystopias I promise. I could honestly film
an entire separate video of my favorite sci-fi
slash dystopian novels but maybe I'll save that for another time. Had to mention Handmaid's
Tale by Margaret Atwood and I'll like you five times more if you have read this book. In this world, women have
absolutely no rights. They can't have a job,
they can't have money, they can't read, they can't write. They're all assigned to these roles and some women are wives. Those are the better off women and then some of them are aunts which are kinda like
the maids, facilitators and then there are handmaids and the handmaids are the ones that literally just have to give birth and I mean, it's not a good role. These women get raped every month and this is also a TV show on Hulu so if you are not gonna read this book, I highly recommend the TV show. It's the best, every Wednesday. So yeah, check out the
book or check out the show. So my next book is The Secret
History by Donna Tartt. Unfortunately, I don't
have a physical copy because I bought it on my Kindle but this is me holding my imaginary copy. It is a story of a group of students in this really prestigious
elite university and it's a murder mystery. The main character is named Richard and he doesn't come from money so he's just kind of plopped
into this world where just, where everyone's just wealthy
and everyone's super posh and he's in a class, a very small class that studies ancient history
and one of the students dies but you don't know who did it or why so that's where the story
just kinda takes off. This kinda reminds me of
And Then There Were None but the teenage version. I mentioned this book not
too long ago in my favorites but it's The Picture of
Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I love this book. Quick summary, it's
about a man named Dorian. He's very attractive, young and
he gets his portrait painted and he meets this man
named Lord Henry Wotton and he lived just a super
hedonistic lifestyle. He gives zero for anyone but himself. So Dorian gets very inspired by that and he ends up selling his soul
so he can look young forever and he just lives this
very materialistic life and he's just living for himself, just selfish and he's just a big dick. I read this book when I was 18 or 19 and it taught me just to
balance, not go overboard. It taught me the importance
of not being so decadent and knowing my limit. My next book recommendation has such sentimental value to me. It is the Perks of Being a Wallflower. I read this book when I was 15 and it just left such a
huge impact on my life because this was one of the first books that I read outside of
my assigned reading. So when I read a book like
this and I followed the story, it was a storyline that I was
just genuinely interested in and there were a lot of characteristics of the main character, Charlie that just, that I felt like he just got me. He was sensitive and introverted and those were the personality
traits that defined me especially when I was younger and when I reread it as an adult, there was just this huge
overwhelming wave of nostalgia. It's crazy that when you revisit something from your past that you love you so much, to be transported and feel that same way is just, it's insane. It's like a time machine. So this book will always have
a special place in my heart and it's very interesting and an unconventional coming of age story but I feel like I understand why this has affected so many teens. My last book is my first
non-fiction on the list. It is the 7 Habits of
Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey. I have also mentioned this
in my monthly favorites but I had to mention it
again because this is, this has changed my life
in such a positive way. I feel like I'm always trying to find ways to increase my productivity, my efficiency and my self-growth and this book just hit
all those targets for me. Obviously, this book is about seven habits that make you more effective but I feel like it's beyond just that. This book has taught me
to be more self-aware and to be a better person and I could easily just tell
you what the seven habits are but they're not gonna make
sense until you read the book, read each of the stories
attached with the lessons and then you'll really absorb it. I'm actually on my second
time reading this book because it's not one of those books that you just read once
and you're like ah. I just wanna remember these
lessons for the rest of my life and apply 'em that way. Alrighty, guys, those were my top 10 favorite books of all time and honestly, I had so much
fun filming this video, explaining all the books
and I would love to, I mean, I don't know if you
guys would be interested in me doing another book countdown. I have so many other recommendations. I could just do another
10 more favorite books or I can do books on just
self-help or just sci-fi or just fiction. I don't know, there's
so many possibilities. Also, I would absolutely love it if you would tell me your
favorite book recommendations along with a little summary
and why you like it. I would love to read what you guys read. It's crazy how much I love
reading recreationally because it really just
broadens my horizons and it brings light to so many stories that I otherwise would have never known and I think it's an art form that everyone or not an art form but a skill
that everyone should utilize because the brain is such a powerful tool and it needs to be worked
out and I feel like reading just really keeps your brain
stimulated in a good way. I'm not a scientist but I
just feel like it does that but anyway, I hope you
guys enjoy this video, hope you have a beautiful day and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. Muah. (upbeat music) 
(lively music) - Hi everyone. Happy New Year! It's your girl Jenn. And today I am just finishing up some loose ends from 2017. I'm going to be talking
about my December favorites. I'm really happy to do this because once I film this and edit this, that means I have done every monthly favorite of 2017 and that
makes me feel really good. I like to complete things. So, yeah even though this
video is a little late, I thought I'd do it anyway. This month we've got a
lot of film favorites. We've got a book, we've
got a fashion and a beauty. So let's just dive right in. I want to start with a
fashion favorite first, here I have these mismatched
earrings from Pomelo. I believe I first showed
them to you guys in my first and only episode of jungle bells. I rocked them in New
Orleans and I got a ton of comments asking where they were from, so I had to put them in this video. One of the earrings has this cool silver bar and the other has a pearl. And I love pairing
these with really simple and basic outfits because
it instantly gives that outfit a quirk. I'm a huge fan of dangly
earrings, as you can tell and these guys are no exception. Moving on straight into a book favorite. I have The Four Agreements
by Don Miguel Ruiz. And this book came to me at such a perfect time in my life. It was actually recommended to me by two of my friends,
Amy Lee and Anna Lee, no they're not related. But this book just really changed the way I look at life and I feel like these days I've been really reading a lot of self-improvement books, but I feel like they've really helped me
develop who I am today. So this book teaches you
four agreements, or rules, that you should always apply in your life in order for you to
have just like a fuller and more peaceful life. So the first rule is to be
impeccable with your word. It basically says that what you say actually means a lot. So be mindful of it. The second agreement is to
never take anything personally. And this rule really
resonated with me because I am a very sensitive person and I take a lot of things to heart. And so when you retrain
your mind to realize that nothing anyone
does is because of you. It's because of themselves. Even if someone insults
you or is rude to you, know that it's not because of you, it's because of themselves and the rules that they've
made in their own head. And I know it kinda doesn't
make sense right now, but I swear when you read that chapter, it will be crystal clear. The third rule is to
never make assumptions. Because when you assume,
it creates complicated situations and it says to never be afraid to ask questions. If you're confused, don't assume. Just ask directly. And I feel like that's something that I struggled with because sometimes I don't wanna bother
anyone with my questions, but when you ask someone
directly what they mean, or to clarify something, it removes the possibility of a disagreement. And so yeah, it says
to always ask questions and to never assume. And the last agreement is
to always try your best. And I love this agreement so much because I don't really like to half-ass anything, I like to put everything
into whatever I'm doing. Whether I'm washing the dishes, whether I am working on a video. I feel like this is something
that everyone can apply. And I know that even if I
mess up or I don't follow the rest of the agreement as perfectly, as long as I know I'm trying my best and I'm improving a little
bit by bit everyday, that shows for something
at the end of the road. So yeah that was a little
skeleton of the book. I highly recommend you
actually go read it though, because I find that the agreements sink in much more that way. And also the way he writes isn't like flowery and confusing, he writes in a very crystal clear direct way. So it can really hit home for anybody. So I saw multiple movies this month and to my surprise I have loved every one single one that I saw. So the first one I want to talk about is The Disaster Artist
and it has James Franco, Dave Franco and Seth
Rogan and like a bunch of other people, but it's essentially a movie based on a movie. And it shows you how
they created The Room, which is notoriously
known for the greatest worst film of all time. The movie was incredible and it actually propelled me to watch The Room. And I think they're an
amazing pairing together. You've got to watch both of them. And if you actually enjoy The Room, you and I will have
some sort of connection because it's one of those movies where you freaking love it or you're just confused and you just want to stop it. But The Disaster Artist, it really helps you see how bizarre and passionate Tommy Wiseau is. He is a character for sure. And I feel like James Franco really did an amazing,
like representation of him. It's incredible. And it just shows you that you know, even if you're a little crazy, as long as you like believe in something and you put your all in something, you may get recognized for it and it's really inspiring
at the end of the day. I love both movies and
I feel like you should watch The Disaster Artist first and then The Room because it will just make The Room even funnier,
so go check it out. My next film favorite is called Ladybird and I also saw this in theaters and I freaking loved it. So this is about a teenage
girl named Christine and she's a senior in high school, it's her last year so you just kind of see what she gets into. This movie is really
about her relationships with everyone in her life, like her mom, her best friend, the guys that she dates, like the way she feels about college applications. And I cried twice during this movie, like one because of sadness and one 'cause of happiness. And I love movies that really take you on a roller coaster. Like it's not like an action film, it's like more of a hyper realistic film where you can truly see
yourself as Christine. And I feel like it really hit home for me because, like she and I kind of had like a very similar high school experience and so it really resurfaced all these like old memories and feelings and after I left, I felt very reflective and I also felt like a sense of pride because I've come such a long ways since my awkward days. I highly recommend it. If you kind of grew up
around the early 2000s, because it is so nostalgic. And it's one of those films where you forget you're watching a film because you're so
invested in the characters and you really see
yourself in all of them. So yeah, go check it out. In December, I colored my hair darker and I freaking love it. I feel like a new woman. But with darker hair comes like the visibility of dandruff, so I knew I had to you know take matters into my own hands. So I got this shampoo by Briogeo. It is their scalp revival one. It comes in a tub, which
kind of tripped me out, but yeah you just basically scoop up the shampoo, you rub it in your head and the little exfoliants
inside the shampoo, it like exfoliates your
scalp and because of that, you have no dandruff. And it has been amazing to use. I love the way it smells. It smells like Lush's mask of magnaminty. So yeah it smells good,
it cleanses my hair and I am dandruff free. Lastly, I wanted to show
Ben's Christmas present to me. He got me this gorgeous plant from Sanso and I'm obsessed with it. I feel like it really breeds in life to the living room, it
really grounds the space. I love the colors, I love
the way it branches out, I love the pot, it's stunning. And right now, I don't
know what to name her, so if you guys can tell
me what kind of names you think I could give
her, please write it in the comments down below,
I would love to hear. All right guys, that is a
wrap on my December favorites, it would mean the world to me if you wrote down what you were inspired by or what you loved or something good that happened to you in
the comments down below, I truly love reading what you guys have to say and I try my best to answer as many as I can. So yeah, feel free to drop some love down. By the time you're watching this, I will be in Thailand with Ben and I am so excited. I've never traveled there with him so it will be an adventure for us. We will definitely be vlogging. I'm gonna try my best
to vlog all of January because December I just kind of fell off, like I was supposed to
have two jungle bells episodes, but by the
second half of December I just kind of wanted to take a little break from vlogging, I was still uploading, but I just didn't feel
it necessary to vlog, you know everything like that. But, I don't know why I'm
like trying to justify this. Regardless, prepare for
more vlogs this January. I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye (kisses). (lively music) 
(groovy music) - Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn, and welcome to my car. Today I'm planning the
perfect date for Ben thanks to Google Assistant
who I've teamed up for this paid partnership. Ben and I just love going on picnics so I thought I would just, you
know, make some Korean food and we'd head out
together, and I'm gonna use Google Assistant to help me
plan our little adventure. What are nearby Korean grocery stores? - [Google Assistant] I found a few places within two point seven miles. - I think I want to go to Zion Market. Alright. Let's head on over. I think I'm gonna try and make kimbap because my mom always
makes it for our picnics. But I've actually never made it myself. Maybe I helped her once when I was a kid but I really don't remember. So I think it would be really
fun to make it for Ben. And then probably some chips because I love chips and ooh, Korean pears, oh, those
are so tasty and juicy. I think they're in season too. So, we'll find out. Alright, I've parked, I am
here, and I should probably figure out how to make kimbap actually. Kimbap recipe. Wow, there's so many options. I think I'm just gonna go for
this recipe right over here. Perfect. Alright, we're at the grocery store, I haven't been here in a hot minute and oh, I should add Korean
pear to my shopping list. Add Korean pear to my shopping list. - [Google Assistant] Okay,
I've added Korean pear to your shopping list. (pleasant music) Okay. I've gathered everything and
I guess I am on my way home to make this all. Okay. I've got all the ingredients. And I'm gonna put on the rice first cause that's gonna take the longest. I'm just gonna set a timer. Set timer for 30 minutes. - [Google Assistant] Okay, 30 minutes. And that's starting now. - Yeah, Ben and I try and
go on these little dates at least once a week. Whether it's you know,
going on these picnics, or we go out for dinner. It just helps you know keep
the relationship on its toes. - [Ben] Hey babe. - Hey. - [Ben] Oh, what you got there? - I'm making something. - What are you making? This looks amazing. (pleasant music) - [Jenn] Ta-da! And we're all set. (car engine revving) Alright, now we're at the park. - Made it. Look at this. - [Jenn] Look at our spread. - [Ben] Delightful little spread. - [Jenn] We've got kimbap, Korean melon and a side of kimchi and radish. - What a lovely day. - [Jenn] I know. - We come here a lot. - [Jenn] We do, we really
really utilize this spot but this is just a gorgeous place that's in the middle of L.A. (groovy music) - [Ben] It's coming for you. - Korean melon. So tasty. - [Ben] So fresh aren't they? Did you get a photo of this? - Yes. - [Ben] Oh, I've got the phone hang on. Okay google, take a selfie. There we go. (camera shutter clicks) (groovy music) - So I'm back home from the picnic and I'm so happy we did this because I just feel rejuvenated. Something about eating outdoors. And I also feel like
little moments like this really keep a relationship on its toes and keeps the spark alive. I want to thank the Google
Assistant for partnering with me and making this video possible. I also want to thank you for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. Mwa. (funky music) 
(mellow music) - [Jenn] Good morning, this
is our breakfast for today. Wow, we definitely got a feast. I got the egg white omelet
with spinach and mushroom. The weather's now clearing up. I looked up the weather forecast. Raining all week. ♪ A tiny little Tabasco. ♪ My favorite is actually Tapatio, but they never have it at hotels. But it's okay, Tabasco's really good too. - [Stephanie] Tapatio,
they don't do mini's. I've never seen a mini. - Yeah, me neither. There's a hole in the market. (mellow music) - [Jenn] This is my favorite album by Kanye West, "Graduation" and this is the famous Kanye Bear. (mellow music) - [Woman] I want one of these flower bags. Buy me. (woman laughs) - [Jenn] Okay, what do you guys think? Does it go with my outfit? (mellow music) - Your Murakami inspired luncheon. (mellow music) - [Jenn] There's Ashley
with all her friends. Here we are at The Botanist. So, I'm here with Ashley
and Stephanie of course. - Just Botanist (laughs). - Just Botanist. - Botanist, no "The," no "The." This was actually
recommended by Mike Africa of Oak and Fort, so thank you so much for the recommendation. This is, the aesthetic is
already like, too much. I want my whole house to look like this. (mellow music) - So we just finished our delicious lunch and know we are at Canada Place. [Stephanie] I love when there's a Chevron. [Jenn] It's so cute. [Stephanie] That's the
one thing I comment on and the beautiful view. (mellow music) - [Ashley] So, we're shooting
a look book right now for Jenn's channel. Robert's the videographer, @roberthill. It's supposed to be a rainy day look book, but it's not raining. (mellow music) - Today we are leaving Vancouver. We are pretty much all packed up. I took a nice bath this morning and I feel so fresh and so clean. I love it. There Stephanie is, she is
just packing her belongings. I feel like my whole body is so dry here. I don't know why. I think it's just because
it's a lot colder here, but, yeah, today, or I guess
last night was a lot of fun. I didn't take my camera out. We went to the Murakami
after party birthday bash and it was a lot of fun. There was great music, but now we are just
getting ready to go home. But before, we are grabbing dim sum. - [Stephanie] Yes. - [Jenn] Before we left, I wanted to do a little room tour. These were are beds that we slept in. This was Stephanie's
side, this was my side. Over here, we've got the bathroom. Very comfortable, spacious, well-lit. Over here, I've got a bottle
of wine from last night. - [Stephanie] Half drunk. - [Jenn] Half drunk. This is our little living area. Got some work done here and then we've got a view of
this hardworking building. - [Stephanie] Not there
today, though, it's Saturday. - [Jenn] Yeah, not there today, but it was interesting to see corporate life right across us. Got a very large TV screen. And, honestly, that's about it. Yeah, that was our room. - [Stephanie] Go show
them the, show them the... - [Jenn] The bar area? Oh, yeah, okay. Alright, this is the last,
this is the grand finale. We've got the bar area. We used this every single
day, the espresso machine. Oh, and she didn't tell
me about these chips. A couple nights ago, I was
like I'm really craving chips and she was like, oh,
well, there's nothing. But there was. - [Stephanie] For your
health, Jenn, for your health. - [Jenn] I love sour cream and onion. That's our hotel room tour. We look like witches (laughs). (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) - We used the one that has more move rather than these. (mellow music) - [Ashley] Are we changing the hair now? - Yes. - [Ashley] Okay, 'cause I need to do a tighter curl for that look. - For the Gigi look? Hi, everybody, it is Thursday and today is actually
a really exciting day because we're shooting for
the Coachella drop for Eggie. I am so stoked. We are at my friend
Honor and Brandon's house and their home is literally
like a 70s wonderland. And so, yeah, I can't show
you too much of the clothes, 'cause I want it to have
some sort of suspense, so I'm sorry if don't get too many clips. I just finished hair and makeup. My hair is by Ashley and the
glam is by Daniel Chinchilla. It's such an incredible job and I am so blessed to
have a team like this. - Do you want anybody?
- We earned this one guys. - Oh, definitely. They only gave me two California rolls. Excuse me? - [Woman] Two pieces?
- What? - [Woman] How much are
you supposed to have? - At least four, at least four. ♪ Summer snow, summer snow ♪ ♪ Summer snow, summer snow ♪ - [Jenn] Congratulations Laylee. - Thank you. - [Jenn] I'm so proud of you, my baby. Currently at the Eggie headquarters planning for the summer drop. - It's not really velvety, but kind of, but it's like sparkly. - Ooh. ♪ Summer snow, summer snow ♪ - Look how pretty this wrapping paper is. Hey, baby girl. These presents are for Amy. Today is Amy's 24th birthday, I believe. And I'm gonna see her in a couple hours. I'm gonna take her out to dinner and then we're all gonna go out bowling which should be fun. I know I already went bowling, like, a couple nights ago, but I think that was meant for practice. And although I'm not the best bowler, I just really like the
atmosphere bowling alleys have. There's like food, there's
drinks, there's music, there's competition and
it's just really fun. But yeah, I'm so excited to
be spending Amy's birthday because Amy has been
such a gift in my life. It's so crazy how close we've gotten within the past six or seven months. She also has a YouTube channel, so please go check her out. I'll leave her link in
the description box, but she's incredible for advice and for recommendations for books and she's just an all
around amazing person. So, please go check her
out if you have some time. So, I just finished writing
my birthday card for Amy. Whenever it's someone's birthday, I really like to write out a card. And not just like a, "Happy
Birthday, Love, Jenn." I like to really go in and talk about what I love about that person, how far we've come, or
something I'm proud of them for. I think I'm just a very vocal person and if I have a lot on my mind, I want to tell them because
I feel like life is so short. I mean, God forbid something happens. Like I, if this is the last
time we are able to speak, I would want them to know
everything that I feel about them and I know there's that saying like, "Oh, some things are just known" or "Some things are unspoken," I forget what that phrase is. But, basically, I don't believe in that. I think you should say how you feel especially if you love someone so much. And so, whenever I write
like a Valentine's Day card or a birthday card or a
Christmas card, I try and go in and when people do that
to me, it means so much. And I think it's because
words of appreciation is pretty high on my love languages test. I feel like this world
needs so much more love. So much more, so if you love
someone, tell them, right now. Text them, call them, email them. - [Jenn] Happy Birthday, Amy. You're an adult now. - Yay, thanks Jenn. - [Jenn] We just had (speaks
in foreign language). I asked Amy what she wanted
and she said she wanted this. - This is always a favorite. - [Jenn] Yes. (Mariachi music) - [Jenn] Bowling right now
and this is honestly the best I've ever done, you guys. - [Amy] Wow. (tick tocking music) - [Woman In Green] Okay,
sorry, that was me then. - [Jenn] You guys, check
out this stunning floral arrangement by The Empty Vase. They are my favorite florist
in Los Angeles, hands down. And this is just breathtaking. It is a very large floral structure and it almost doesn't really,
I mean it looks so crazy. It's almost like it's been copied and pasted onto my kitchen. I just got back from Sophia's house. We filmed something for her channel and I'm really excited
to see how it comes out because there was choreography involved and it's just gonna be a really
cool, colorful, quirky video and I'm excited to see it come together. But now I'm at home and I'm dealing with a lot of adult stuff. Like, I opened my mailbox and literally, anything that I get in the
mailbox is either stuff that I need to pay for or spam. Like, I don't even know how I got onto this random list for Grandin Road. I think January or January,
February's a weird time of year where all mail just gives me
anxiety because it's either the IRS or the Franchise Tax Board. That's my dealio right now,
so I'm just dealing with this so I don't have to think about it anymore. I'm not a person that puts things off. If something makes me uncomfortable, like, I have to deal with it and confront it because
my worst nightmare is putting it off and then
forgetting about it and then getting in trouble. It is Monday today and I actually have like a really chill day
and it feels so good. This past week has been
so nuts and I feel like, I feel like I was on
the edge of burning out, but for some reason, I wasn't. I think it's because
I feel pretty balanced and I must say this meditation,
therapy, working out bundle is working out for me pretty well. I just cross my fingers
and hope to stay stable. But yes, yesterday, I uploaded
my Q&amp;A video with Ben. It's going down really well. I think a lot of you guys are enjoying it which makes me super happy. Later on tonight, I'm going
to Emily's house for a Galentine's Day and that's
gonna be really fun. I love my girlfriends so
much and I really prioritize the friendships in my life. - [Jenn] Oh, my God,
Happy Galentine's Day. - Happy Galentine's Day. - [Jenn] Oh, my God, Revela
is cookin' up a feast. A vegan feast. Sherry's pourin' the wine. Wow, we're gonna drink this all tonight. - [Woman] All of it. - [Jenn] This looks freaking delicious. Damn, Sophie, are you gonna eat all that? - [Sophie] I'll let you know. - [Jenn] And there's salad. - [Woman] I'm gonna sit right
next to the everything bagel. (group speaks in foreign language) - [Jenn] (speaks in
foreign language) everyone, it is Tuesday. I am currently in the car
driving to a couple of meetings. First is with Fresh and
I'm really stoked because I love their black tea line, so I'm excited to see the rest of the range of the products that they have. And then I'm doing an interview which would be really thrilling. I was gonna say exciting, but I'm trying to do a different
adjective besides that. I think I'm kind of finally
getting in the swing of things with interviews because most interviews, they kind of ask you the same thing, they're like how'd you get started, what kind of videos do you do, so I can easily talk
about that all day now. But, it's so crazy,
even like two years ago, I wouldn't even know how to answer that question without stuttering. Last night was so much fun. We had a Galentine's Day at Emily's and it was just so sweet that
she cooked for all of us. I definitely want to return the favor. I feel like most of the times
when my girlfriends come over, we just like PostMates
something or we eat out, but there's nothing like
a home cooked dinner and she's like inspiring
me to try new recipes because I only know how
to make like four things and I would like to expand that to at least six things, you know? I think I'm just really spoiled
because Ben does pretty much all the cooking in the house, so my cooking skills have
definitely deteriorated. But I think I'm gonna cook dinner tonight. I think I'm gonna make kimchi jjigae because my (speaks in
foreign language), my aunt, she made this delicious kimchi I think it's ready to
be turned into a soup. Kimchi jjigae is best when
the kimchi is a little older and more fermented, I guess? I don't know what the word is, but it's better when it's more dank. (mellow music) (mellow music) - Alright, it is time for dinner and tonight I am making
kimchi jjigae with tuna. I bought this can, I wanna
say, a couple months ago and I know I should use it. Normally, you're supposed
to make kimchi jjigae with pork, but since I am
not eating pork anymore, I am gonna go with good
old fashioned tuna. And yeah, this tuna is
specifically made for kimchi jjigae so I'm super excited to try it out. So, I just grabbed this recipe online and the first instruction is
to sauté this can of tuna. Wow, woo, that's red. And here I have this homemade
kimchi that my aunt made. Oh my God, this is so
beautiful, look at this. I haven't even touched this yet. I've only had maybe like a portion or two so I'm gonna put this in the stew. It's gonna be delicious. Oh my goodness, there is the
finished kimchi jjigae, yum! And Ben is making fries. - Chips. Crispy chips tonight. So English and so Korean. - [Jenn] I can't wait to
have a little bit of that. He's gonna have a little bit of this. - [Ben] Yeah. - Today is Valentine's Day and I woke up with this on my bedside. Ben was off to a early gig today, so he left me this note. So, we'll see what's inside. Aw, this is so cute. It says "Good morning." (laughs) Oh my God, this is
off to a great start already. Oh my God, what is this (laughs)? (mellow music) With (mumbles) again. We've got a glass of champagne. - [Ben] Sort of like a prosecco
vodka and blueberry mix. We tried to copy what Steph
did with our sipping sister. We didn't have some of the
ingredients, but we did this. - [Jenn] Yeah, I think it's pretty close. - It's nice. Happy Valentine's Day, babe.
- Happy Valentine's Day. - I love you.
- I love you. - Oh, wow, that's great, that's fantastic. I really get some awesome
notes of the vodka. - I really taste the alcohol. (Jenn laughs) - [Jenn] Alright, so, another dish came. This is the Kale Caesar Salad. We've got the deviled eggs and a lasagna. But Ben's in the restroom
right now, somewhere, so I gotta refrain myself
from eating all this. - [Man] So, if we want
somewhere in Orange County, that is kinda like the new hotspot. - [Cell Phone] Welcome
to day nine of change. - Hello, I'm shooting with Silas today. We're doing a little Team Cozy shoot. - [Silas] You look just
miserable (laughs). - (laughs) Stop! (mellow music) (mellow music) I think this one is for me. Look what we have here. - It's a really sharp box. - It is (laughs). - Cute.
- Cute. - Oh, my god, these are sick. - They're so platformed. - I know, I love a little bit of height. - I love that too, actually. - This is sick, thank you. Wow, check these out. This is Stephanie's seat. And over here we've got moi. It's a very recent photo. I love it. (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) - [Jenn] At the park I brought Cheeky. I'm hanging out with Julia. She brought some snacks for us to eat. This is her loot. We've got the roasted
garlic, some hummus, ooh. - [Julia] Kale pesto. - [Jenn] I love pesto. - [Julia] I love Kale, so (laughs). - [Jenn] Oh, my God, so it works out. - [Julia] This is great. I had it the other day. - [Jenn] We're about to paint. We're at a paint and sip event. James is ready to get his paint on. We've got some colors here. (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) - Hello, everybody, I am
checking in to say goodbye. I want to thank you guys
for watching this vlog. I am gonna continue to record today. I am going to lunch with The OG Crew, John, Sarah, and Becka, and this is what I'm wearing today. I'm wearing a Finders Keepers
blouse from a long time ago and Eggie trousers. It's like 75 degrees
today, beautiful day in LA. But yeah, leave me down something
in the comments section. I'm gonna reply to as
many as I possibly can and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye, muah! (mellow music) 
(upbeat music) - [Announcer] We're gonna
make sure you have a safe and comfortable flight. - Hi, everybody! I've made it to New York in one piece. It is currently 9:00 p.m.
and your girl is starving. I am actually here because
I partnered with Innisfree. I am doing a meetup at
their grand opening store in New York. I only brought one suitcase
which is a big feat for me because normally like
no matter where I go, no matter how long I'm staying,
I always take two bags. I'm just such an overpacker. But this trip it just didn't feel right to have like two big suitcases. So yeah, I minimized. I'm actually going to
head on out to dinner so I'm gonna put some
makeup on, get freshened up. I also forgot to pack fake eyelashes so I'm gonna go to the
corner store and grab them. I'm here with Vanan. If you guys don't know who she is. I don't think I've actually
ever like introduced you guys to her, but Vanan is the junior manager at the management company
that I am with, Rare Global. So yeah, I speak to her every single day and so this is like our
first trip out together so it's been really nice to
like hang out and catch up. I gotta get ready because I've got... Wow, it's already 9:19. Wow, time is flying by right now, guys. - [Podcaster] Only
bringing what I could carry in my backpack. Once again, I felt the lightness
of having so few things... (calm music) - Hello! I am back from dinner. Vanan and I had food at the NOMO. It's just like right across
the street from here. And it was just really nice and I really, really enjoyed
having the little one on one with her. I don't know, I feel like
whenever you have settings with a lot of people,
it's just easy for things to just be very surface level, so I'm just really happy that I got to have some
one on one time with her. I also got a couple of
things that I needed from the drugstore. First up, I got this top
coat from Sally Hansen. I think I'm gonna repaint my nails. I actually got them done at the airport. They had this really quick
20 minute gel system. But I'm just not digging
like this translucent look. And luckily I packed in one
of my Oribe nail polishes that I wanted to try. So I'm just gonna paint that and then put this layer over it. I grabbed a pack of Simple wipes. Fake eyelashes. First, I've got these ones by Ardell, these are just the Demi Wispies. I also saw this brand, it's called Eylure and I saw Nikki Phillippi
so I was like holy crap, I gotta support. So I got these ones which
are the wispier ones, more spaced out, so I
thought these would just be a really nice, like natural fluttery lash for, you know, the future. And then I had to get these. I cannot escape the chips. I'm probably gonna eat these
in like 15 minutes or so. I'm gonna just take my makeup off, watch some hotel TV, and munch on these. Alright, so now I'm just
gonna take off all my makeup because I hate having my makeup on, especially when I'm just lounging. So I'm gonna remove all that. Now that I have bangs, I have
to have this little headband because it just, you know,
tucks everything away. Think I might go shopping tomorrow. There's like a Reformation
right over there, the Top Shop, opening ceremony. So (gasps) I've got like
the shopping itch right now. So I just cleansed my face and I'm just gonna try
out this Innisfree mask. They sent me a ton of
masks so I'm really excited to try this out. This is the It's Real Squeeze Mask. Whenever I travel, I love
to put on sheet masks because my skin can get
a little temperamental after the plane, so I
want to really make sure that it's in tip top shape for tomorrow. Oh, this one's nice, it
just sticks right on. There's a lot of face masks that I use where it's like so thick that
it just refuses to stay on. So you leave this on for 10 to 20 minutes. Nice. (groans) My knee. Good night. (calm music) Just ordered the avocado toast and also I got a cappuccino but clearly I don't get
cappuccinos very often because I had no idea there
would be so much milk. I think I mistook this for Americano. Whoopsie daisy. Good morning! You guys, lighting is so nice. I'm blessed because this
room has these huge windows and it makes it just perfect for filming. So I just cleansed my face,
there's nothing on it, and now I'm gonna apply
this serum from Innisfree. It's their intensive hydrating
serum with green tea seed. So this is the first
product I'm gonna apply after cleansing. Kind of like wash off, tea on. This formula really helps
reduce your skin's tightness after you wash and it just
really adds a great balance of moisture back into your skin. And I believe it's a blend of green tea and green tea seed oil. So now that my serum is on, I'm
going to put some sunscreen. Even though it's cloudy,
there's still UV rays out there. This sunscreen also feels very serum-like. Smells kind of citrusy as well. I genuinely forgot how good milk tasted because I only drink my coffee black. But today I decided to be adventurous and order a cappuccino, thinking
that it was an Americano. And then I took a sip
and I was like holy crap, this is just frothy milk
with a splash of coffee. I'm just gonna go straight
into concealer now. I'm using this one from Colourpop. It is their no filter concealer. I think it's so funny how I came here right as Fashion Week ended. I've actually been really
enjoying watching Fashion Week just on social media. I had zero FOMO and I
think I'm finally at an age where I don't really get
affected by FOMO anymore. I'm just genuinely happy for
the people that got to go and I like watching the shows on my phone in the comfort of my own bed. It's just nice. The last Fashion Week I went
to was last year in February and, guys, winter in New
York is so miserable. Especially for an LA girl. It's really hard for me
to dress for the weather because it's just so painfully cold. I remember last time, me and
Ben, we were trying to go to this restaurant that
was only like a block away from our hotel and it was a
struggle getting out there. The wind just felt like shards on our face and I wanted to just have like a ski mask and just a bunch of puffers on me. And the last thing I was
thinking about was, like, is my outfit cute? Because it was just way too cold. Now that this is done, I'm gonna set everything with a powder. I'm using Laura Mercier
translucent powder. Turns out my friend Danny is
also gonna be in New York, or is also in New York
right now, she just landed. If I had known she was
gonna be in New York, then I would have extended
my trip a little bit. My flight is at 10:34. It's like a 24 hour trip pretty much. But if I had known she was gonna be here, I would have like at
least stayed the night. So if you guys don't know who Danny is, she's the one who lives in Toronto and she's the one who creative directed my Eggie editorial lookbook. She's a Scorpio, so we
just get along so well. I don't fully really care
about horoscopes that much but I don't know, why
is it that I get along with every Scorpio that I meet? Maybe because my moon sign is a Scorpio. Now I'm gonna go in with brows. I've been using this stay
all day waterproof brow color from Stila. So what I do is I'll only use
it for the meat of my brows. This is just a really great product that does a nice gradient. Now that's done, I'll go in with Benefit's Goof Proof brow pencil and then I'll just start
drawing the rest of my brows. Okay. I don't really fuss over
them too much these days because now that I have
bangs, it just covers them. But I still like to draw them in because you never know if
like the wind's gonna blow or something. I wanna make sure that
something's still there. It's time for eye shadow. I'm using this palette from Colourpop, it is their I Think I Love You. So I think I'm gonna go in
with this rose gold color. Yeah, I'm not sure what
Danny and I are gonna do. I think we're just gonna catch up. I just kinda want to go
shopping for an outfit because of course
everything that I packed, I suddenly don't want to wear anymore. I'm reading this book called Wild. It's about this girl who goes
on this backpacking adventure on the Pacific Crest Trail and she only packed the things
that she genuinely needs, like fleece socks, a
whistle, water purifier. I would love to do
something like that one day because, you know, I really
enjoy being around nature and I like hiking and stuff but I've never actually
done anything intense like that before. Okay, so now I'm getting
Level Up, let's do this. Okay. Here we go. Okay, so I'm gonna go
back into Rule Breaker. And then getting a dense
brush, I'm gonna pop that kind of like here in the
inner corner of the eye. So now using this flat brush, I'm gonna go in with that brown shade and I'm just gonna smoke it out. So I'm pretty happy with the eye shadow. I think it's really gonna come together when I apply these falsies. But right now, I'm gonna
do a little cat eye using Kat Von D's tattoo liner. Can't believe it's already my
birthday month, it's insane. Virgo season! I actually rented a cabin in Big Bear. I'm not the type of person
who waits for someone to surprise me or plan
something out for me. I am, I'm like very much a Virgo. I just like to get shit done and if I want something to happen, I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that it does. I got this huge cabin in Big
Bear and it's gonna be so nice to have all my friends there and it's gonna be just
like a big sleepover! There's gonna be games,
there's gonna be food, and there's like a hot
tub in the living room, so I think that's gonna be really fun. Okay, so I just applied
Lancome's cils booster and while that's drying, gonna contour. This is Tarte's Pro Glow palette. I'm gonna go in with Sculpt. I'm just gonna chisel away. Since I'm born on the 22nd,
I'm a Virgo-Libra cusp and I really identify with both signs. I know a lot of people just
like to like brush zodiacs off but I feel like they're fun to read because you're just more aware of all the different
personality traits out there. So Virgos are really meticulous
and they love structure, they love scheduling, and I feel like that's where I get my organization side. And Libras, they're very social creatures. They love making sure that
everyone's taken care of and I definitely identify with that. Ben is also a Libra and
he's just like Libra to a T. For blush, I'm using this one by Tarte. I've already hit pan. Just gonna pop that apples in my cheeks. And then for highlighter,
I'm using Strobe. Around the nose. For lashes, I'm using
Urban Decay's Trouble Maker and I'm gonna use this for the bottoms and a little bit on the tops. I'm not like a die hard zodiac fan and it's not like
everything's set into stone. And I truly do feel like
whatever sign you are, there's something that you can relate to. So whether I was a Leo or
a Taurus or a Sagittarius, there's all something
that we can relate to and that's the beauty of it. Alright, lashes are on. I guess we're done. I'm gonna do my lipstick... Oh, I guess I should do my lipstick now. I've just applied the lip color and it's just kind of like
my lips but better shade. It's like kind of like a glamorous look. I enjoy it. Just gotta work on my bangs and then we'll be off to go see Danny! And also Kristen. Everyone's telling me to do
like Korean see through bangs but I feel like I have
too much bang to do that. Or I guess, I feel like this is like the Korean see through bangs. It's like a couple of strands and then... I feel like I look so weird, okay? I would rather just have
a full bang, you know? Before I forgot, I had
to do a little room tour of the hotel. I'm staying at the 11 Howard. So over here is the hallway,
you enter right over there. Check out this beautiful room. Little workstation. The most comfortable
bed in the entire world. View of New York from here. Over here, you've got the bathroom. So beautiful. Oh my god. You guys, it is so hot. (calm music) Three Musketeers! A little reunion. We had like a little
frantic shopping session at Reformation. - But isn't it always frantic? I feel like whatever, you're
like I got this, that, that. But yo, you look-- - I know. Got all Reformationed out. (calm music) You guys, the entire wall
is made out of real plants. They put in an irrigation
system to water it as well. The future. Alright, guys, here I am
at the Innisfree store in Union Square and the
meetup is about to begin! (calm music) 
(light music) - What's up, gems? The shortest month of the
year is officially over. February, February, it's like
the weirdest word to say. But anyway, it is over, so let's talk about some of
my favorites from last month. Also, if you are a lover
of monthly favorites, make you sure you subscribe to my channel. The button's right down below. If you subscribe, it would make my day. So without further ado,
let's get on with the items. So, I'm starting things off
with a fashion favorite. Here I have this pair of earrings. These are by Adornmonde, and literally every time I've rocked them, I get multiple questions about them, so I thought it would be just
natural to feature them here. I've always gravitated
towards dangly earrings. I think it's just because they add a nice shimmer and glimmer on the face. And these are actually a
really interesting shape. It's two like rhombuses,
is this the shape? What is this? It's like a slanted square. I think they're just really interesting, and add the perfect amount
of funk to any outfit. Alright, now I'm gonna jump
into some beauty products that I've been loving last month. Here I have Etude Houses'
tint my brows gel. And if you saw my February monthly blog, then you've already seen me feature this. I actually saw this for the first time at my girlfriend Sophia's house. I walked into her
apartment and she just had these crazy looking brows
and I was like, what is that? And then she explained to
me that it was this tint. Basically, eyebrow tinting has
been a huge trend in Korea. You grab the wand, and then you draw in the
eyebrow shape that you want. And you let it dry for around two hours. And then you peel it off from the tail. And then the end result is just this really natural, full looking brow, and it just cut down on my
eyebrow process in half. Because when I don't have this tint, there's a lot to fill in there, cause I barely have any brows. But this tint creates like a nice base, and it just makes the
whole process a lot faster. It's kinda like henna but for
your brows and not orange. Next up I have a highlighter. This is called over the moon by Colourpop. And it's this stunning, iridescent hot pink and violet highlighter. Initially, I was a little
intimidated because like, when do I ever go for purple highlighter? But I actually went to a
concert, an Oliver Helden show, and I thought that it was just the time to finally bust this out. And I was so happy with the way it looked. To apply it, it's really easy. You just grab a damp beauty blender, and you grab the flat side, and you just kinda twist it like that. And then you apply it to the
highest points of your cheeks. It adds so much glow, and
I think the purple shade really complements my skin tone. Normally, I go for champagne highlighters, but this one's just like a wild card, and I really like the way it looks. I am so excited to use this for upcoming music
festivals, like Coachella, I think it's gonna be really
perfect for that type of look. Last month, I tried out a
new hairstyle for myself. I was rocking these little space buns for a lot of the month, especially on nights where I
was going to a special event. It looks like actually spent
a lot of time getting ready when you do this hairstyle, but it's actually super easy to do. All you have to do is
make two little pony tails on the side of your head. I like to leave a couple of bangs out, like some strands of hair,
just to frame the face. And then you grab the pony
tail and then you twist it, and then you just kinda wrap
it around into a little bun. And then you just grab as
many bobby pins as you can and you just like pin
the living crap out of it until it looks fine. And then you try and attempt
it to do on the other side. I think I'm gonna do like a
full tutorial on that soon, because I think I'm gonna rock that look when I'm at South by Southwest. Very, very excited to
go to that by the way. But yeah, I think it's just
like a really fun hairstyle to just try out cause I think it's gonna
be flattering on everybody. I think just more people should have fun and be more experimental
with their hairstyles. You only live once, YOLO. Pretend I never said that please. For my book favorite, I
have Shelter by Jung Yun. And this was actually recommended by one of you guys in
the comments section. In my last favorites video, so thank you so much
for this recommendation. Honestly, this book is heavy as fuck. But very, very gripping. This was also written by
a fellow Korean, so KP. It follows a couple, Kyung and Gillian. Kyung is Korean and Gillian is Irish. And it kinda was coincidental
because I'm Korean and Ben is half Irish. Anyway, life isn't looking
too great for them. They're financially unstable. And Kyung isn't exactly the
best place with his parents. But something very traumatic happens, like absolutely horrific happens, and it forces Kyung to
reconnect with his parents. And just like the darkness unfolds then. And it really shows you how, how a person can be affected
by their upbringing. And this is a very honest,
and sad and graphic book. But it's something that I was just like immediately drawn to. There's a lot of stuff
that I can relate ... Or not a lot, but there were some aspects that I could relate with with Kyung because we both grew up in a
Korean household in America. For example, like both our
dads were Presbyterian, or are Presbyterian. Obviously, my parents
and I have a way more emotionally stable relationship than Kyung had with his parents. But anyway, I highly recommend this book. It's very, very well written. Or in my opinion, it was well written. I really love the pacing of this book. It's straight forward but feel of details. And yeah, if you're looking
for a morbid, honest read, definitely check this out. For my last favorite, I've
got something quite random. Here I have this shower spa
mist in this Eucalyptus scent. And this smells so amazing, it's changed the showering
game for me and for Ben. So basically when one of us showers, we always spray at least three or four, as the steam starts to gather. And it just makes the
entire bathroom smell like this luxurious spa, you're transformed into
somewhere calm and serene. Just the smell of eucalyptus, it's so healing. I feel
like I'm in a spa right now. I'm just a big advocate for aromatherapy. I feel like the power of smells really can make your mind feel at ease. And I wish I could just
show you this scent or like make you smell
this though the camera because it's just good for the soul. After I take a shower, my
mind just feels at ease. I feel like I can conquer the day. And I'm just all about
adding little details in my life that make me happier. For my music favorite, I actually made a playlist
in my confidence video. If you haven't seen my confidence video, I'll also leave a link in
the cards in the corner, so definitely check it out. But basically one of the tips
that I gave in that video was to listen to a banging
playlist that makes you just feel just unstoppable. And I made it on SoundCloud, so I'll leave a link
in the description box. This is also like a really
workout playlist, I realized, because it just makes my
heart go like, you know. As always, please write
down your favorites in the comments section as well. I love reading them, I love
responding to as many as I can. And just know that, your
recommendations go a long way. And I love hearing what
you guys have to say. If you enjoyed the video,
please hit the like button and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (kiss) (light music) 
(relaxed jazz music) - Today is a laundry and cleaning day. (jazz music) Alright guys I am finished
cleaning, for now. I vacuumed the entire house,
I wiped down the surfaces, I cleaned the house because today I'm having some friends over. I feel like whenever we have guests it's just a good excuse
to clean the house. But, yeah a bunch of my high
school friends are coming: Jon, Breann and of course
Sarah! She is in town. For those who are new
here, Sarah is my friend that I started the channel with for you OG subscribers, you
already know who she is. But, yeah she lives in
San Jose so every time she comes down, we try our
best to see each other. And it's gonna be so
nice to just be reunited. She's coming in like 20 minutes so I'm actually removing some nail polish. So basically I got a gel
manicure two weeks back and I picked out this red color, thinking that it was
more of like a true red but it's actually more
of a orangey-coraley red. And I just wasn't diggin' it so I went in my nail polish collection and I re-painted it this dark navy color. But now that it's chipping it's
starting to look kinda weird It looks like hot cheeto residue. So I'm just removing that first layer off and just making all my fingers red! It's like a magic trick. So yeah, I'm gonna do
the same with this hand And then I'll be ready fer,
I'll be ready for my guests. I have the entire house to myself because Ben is in San Diego. He's at a music festival
with a bunch of his friends and I believe Foo Fighters are playing and that is one of his favorite bands; definitely his favorite drummer. And so, yeah he's out there
and he's having a good time. I'm here with Chippo and I'm gonna have some company really soon. Yay, Cheers! (jazz music) Balloons, check. Hey everybody, so as you can tell I have just been rushing around town. I am gathering all the things I need for Ben's birthday weekend. His birthday's on Friday but the celebrations start tomorrow. And he has no idea. He thinks I am shopping for
Halloween costumes right now. So, (laughs) So I got the cake, and I got the balloons and now I am dropping all
of this off at Bern's house because tomorrow I am surprising him with a stay at the Beverly Hills hotel. I got us a room there and
I have never stayed there. It's like one of the most iconic
and most beautiful hotels. And it's pet friendly so
we get to bring Cheeki. So tomorrow morning I'm just
going to tell him to like pack his bags and just drive him there so that's going to be exciting. We've got dinner plans at
nine pm at the Polo Lounge and while we're at dinner
I have told all our friends to go into the hotel room; Berns is gonna bring all of this stuff and they're just going to set it all up and I just can't wait to see his reaction it's gonna be so satisfying. I just, I love planning
other people's birthdays. It's like way more satisfying
than planning my own. I'm just so excited to see his reaction because he is one of the most
important people in my life or probably the most
important person in my life. He has done so much for me
and he's transformed my life and he's given me a love
that I've never had before and I've had a lot of
great loves in the past but nothing can top his. It's not a competition
but he's just the one and something about his energy and his presence that makes me want to become a better
person and, I don't know if you're watching this,
babe I fucking love you. You are, you're the one! (laughs) (smooth jazz music) - [Jenn] Having date night with my lady - We got a Michelada, yeah - [Jenn] We got a gin and soda.

(guitar music with light vocals) I believe the last clip
you saw was us at the Broad at the Yayoi Kusama exhibition That was honestly one of the
best shows I've ever seen in a really, really long time. I love The Broad museum
because they don't half-ass any of their exhibitions,
it's freakin' nuts and I feel so blessed that
Flaunt Magazine and The Broad invited us for their private preview it meant so much, I highly
recommend you go see it I can comfortably say that Kusama is probably
one of my favorite artists. Her work is so immersive, meticulous and I just really like
everything she stands for. I didn't know how prolific
she was with her work. She started in the 60's and
she's always been standing up for things that she believes in whether it's: free love,
women's rights, gay rights She's always been very vocal. I highly recommend you go see it. It is on til January 2018 so definitely go check it out if you can. Oo, I uploaded my "How
I Lost 15 Pounds" video That video's doing really well and I wanna thank everyone
who has watched it and left such positive comments on it. I am so happy to help anyone who wants to have just
a healthier lifestyle. (jazz music) (laughs) Hello it is four days before
Halloween it's Friday. James is preparing for his show where he'll turn into a skull! (drums, guitar and flute plays) - [Jenn] Alright, are you
ready for the big reveal? - Yes - [Jenn] Okay - I'm scared - [Jenn] Open your eyes - Whoa! This shit looks good! - [Jenn] You like it? - Yeah looks cool (jazz music) - What's up guys it is Monday. I am currently on my
way to the Eggie shoot We are shooting the product
shots for drop number two very, very excited to see
everything on somebody else I found this model named Jawni She was modeling for my
friend's clothing company and I was like oh my god, I'm obsessed. And so she gave me her contact and now I'm going to meet her! It's gonna be really
awesome getting to see an entire new collection like this. This always makes it
feel more real for me. It's gonna be awesome seeing my Eggie team And just, you know, get to work. (jazz music) Hello, so from the last clip you saw that Ben and I went to The Empty Vase to look at some flowers for our wedding. Wedding planning is in full force and I honestly thing that's
why it's been extra hard to vlog this month, I've just
been like wearing extra hats like I feel like just my responsibilities for my channel is quite hefty and now I've added obviously
Eggie and now the wedding so it's like three different components that I'm like splitting my brain into. So back to the flowers,
we went to the Empty Vase and they are my favorite florist I am so happy to be working with them because they make beautiful arrangements and the color scheme
we're going for is like white, coppers and greens so just kind of like ethereal,
earthy and beautiful. Next week I am gonna be
trying on some dresses. That should be really fun. I've created like a Pinterest board of different dresses that I'm into and I'm noticing a pattern, a
lot of off the shoulder stuff. Honestly I didn't use Pinterest
at all until like this year. Because obviously I had to
do some boards with Eggie and now especially for
the wedding, it's insane. I also see the appeal of Pinterest as well because it's so nice to see all the images that you have on your mind
like on an actual visual board. So I get it, I get Pinterest now. So today is Halloween and I am just going to
be staying in editing. I've got a bunch of
deadlines due tomorrow. This weekend we went out so I feel like Halloween is already over because I celebrated Halloween
on Friday and on Saturday. So I'm just like done. This is the costume that
Ben and I had for Halloween. We are Wayne's World and Cassandra who is the original OTP. If you guys haven't seen that
movie, please go watch it. Also, if you guys didn't know, Ben started his own Youtube channel. I am so proud of him. He already uploaded his second video. If you guys haven't
checked out his channel please hit on the cards
or the description box. I will leave everything down there. Other than that, I'm just
going to continue on editing. November will be a better
month because I think I'm starting to get a better
grasp on everything hopefully. Okay, well I guess this is my cue to go I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching and I will see you guys
in the next one, bye! (jazz music) 
- Hey everyone, it's your
girl Jenn, and welcome back. Today I'll be recreating
art pieces into outfits, I've always been a huge
lover and appreciator of the arts, so I thought it would
be really fun to bring these historic images into real life. All of the artworks or art
pieces that I'm recreating are Twitter submissions
from you guys, so thank you to everyone that sent me
these images, I feel like a lot of new artists were,
are showing on my radar, so thank you so much. Before I get started, I must
ask if you're subscribed, because if you're not,
the button's down below, hit that become a Jennim
today, and let's get started with the video. So my first art piece is Woman in Gold, by Gustav Klimt, like this
is just like one immaculate portrait, like if I could
go back in time and get my portrait done by an artist,
it would definitely be him because his work is like
nothing I've ever seen before, like I just appreciate how
ornate and detailed all his portraits are and I
love like the use of like pieces of gold, and
like the collage-iness, I'm pretty sure the portrait
would be freaking expensive, but definitely worth it to
have a portrait done by him. This is how I recreated
that look, I just wore this gold sequined gown, I found
this on Amazon and I tried my best to find a dress that
had like different metallic patterns, I failed, and I
thought that this gold dress would do, I added this crystal
choker to match the one that she has on, in reality
I would probably wear this to like a dinner or a premiere
or something, it's definitely like a lot fancier than I'm
used to, there's also a film based off the woman in this
portrait, apparently the Nazis like stole this in a
raid, so there's like a whole film on that, I believe it's
called like Woman in Gold, I haven't seen it, but I
just you know random fact that I found online. The next piece I have is
called Dancers in Pink, by Edgar Degas, this was
painted in the 1800's and is considered part
of the Impressionist era, so that's why there's
just like a lot of thin, light brush strokes that's
just classic to that style, and Degas is actually known
to have painted a lot of paintings of ballerinas
and dancers while they're performing or they're resting,
so it's just kind of like a little like, peek
inside a ballerina's life. And this painting in particular
just like caught my eye, I think it's just like the
splash of color, and it just looks very candid. Okay, now this is how I
recreated this look, I couldn't find a pink tutu or body
suit, so I thought that red would be my best option,
honestly I think like red and pink are pretty
interchangeable, I did a fake rose into my hair to match the
one that the girl has on and then wore this black
choker from REMI to match the painting. I feel like this outfit
can really only be worn like if you're a dancer or
ballerina or maybe like a Halloween costume, it's definitely not something that I would wear everyday. Maybe if I just threw on
like blue jeans instead of the red tutu it'd
just be more everyday. Our next art piece is by Jean-Claude-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and it's of a woman named
Mademoiselle Caroline Riviere. I'm sorry, like I'm horrible
with French and obviously I'm like butchering the
pronunciation, so forgive me in advance, I'm so sorry. This was painted in 1806
and it's the third of three portraits of the Rivier
family, this is actually hanging at the Louvre in
Paris, so I though that was pretty damn cool. I really love the way her
eyes were painted here, they're kinda lowered and
they have like that slight smirk, very similar to Mona Lisa's. Voila, here is Mademoiselle
Caroline in the flesh, I'm wearing a white empire
waist dress with lace sleeves, it's long and flowy and
I definitely felt like a Disney princess in this. For accessories, I wore
these yellow gloves and this faux fur stole that I borrowed. For my hair I did a center
part and pulled it back to copy what she did, and let me tell you, when I was filming this
it was so freaking hot, I was dying and I definitely
got a lot of interesting stares for this, we filmed
this at Terranea and we thought it would be
like the perfect backdrop because it had like the
beach and the cliff, and it was so funny because
I think people legitimately thought that this was my
wedding dress because like Ben and I were like walking
around like taking photos of it, so yeah, I mean
it's like it's a good thing that my wedding dress doesn't
actually look like that or I don't have a wedding
dress, but it wouldn't look like that. Regardless, we got the shot
and that's all that matters. This next one is pretty
hilarious, this is by the brother's Jan and Hubert Van Eyck, and this particular panel
is actually one segment of this entire altarpiece,
this was painted in 1432 and it's considered one
of the world's treasures. I know that these men just
look like they're like constipated and confused but
they're actually singing, they're singing angels
and they're all in a choir and I decided to dress
up as one of the angels. I'm wearing a red silk robe
and I thought that this would just give the same
vibe as the ones that they were wearing, and then I
threw on this tapestry scarf I bought at this ministry
website, and it was actually like pretty expensive, I
paid $60 for this, but I had to get it or else it just
wouldn't complete the look. I topped it off with a
bejeweled crown from a party website and I called it a day. This art piece is actually
one of the most stolen art pieces of all time, the
Nazi's were like desperate to steal it and actually
one of the panels is still missing, so I thought that
was super interesting, I really enjoyed like
researching all these art pieces, it was kind of like being in
art history class but without being graded, so it was pretty awesome. Regardless, this is one
of the world's most, just like influential
paintings ever because, I think it was like the
world's first oil painting, like the first oil painting
masterpiece, and it also has like very heavy Catholic roots. This last art piece is one
of my favorites, it's by Frida Kahlo, and she is just
one of my favorite artists of all time, her story's
always been so fascinating to me because she's just
endured so much in her life. Like for example, when she
was a child she contracted polio and then growing up a
car hit her and she became disabled and during her
recovery was when she really began to paint. This was painted in 1940
and she just looks really tense because she's lived
a life of physical and emotional pain, unfortunately
the man that she married, Diego Rivera, wasn't very,
like wasn't a very good match for her, he was always cheating
on her and didn't treat her right, like he even
cheated on her with her sister, so the story's just very wild
and she's just seen a lot of stuff, so honestly I
could talk about her all day, but here is how I recreated
this look, I put my hair up and added this flower crown
in classic Frida style, I even had a, put a little
uni brow to honor her. I threw on this brown tie
dye shawl, that mirrored her top, and then underneath I
wore this nude skirt from American Apparel. For accessories I wore this
silver choker that kind of looks like the thorn one
she's wearing, and then I wore this palm tree earring
because I couldn't find a hand and I thought that it would do. Frida's my favorite artist
of all time because she's very introspective with
her work, and I could just, I don't know I feel like
I can relate to her a lot, and I just feel like a lot
of her portraits like show how someone can feel so
trapped in their mind and their body and I just
have so much respect for her. Alright everybody, those were
all the outfits that I have for you, I am so sorry that
it took me like forever to film this, it's because I
had to source all the clothing find all the backgrounds,
and like just research about all these art pieces, so yeah
that's why it took a little bit longer than usual. I want to thank you guys so
much for watching, if you enjoyed the segment please
hit the like button, write it in the comments
down below, if you want me to do like a part two let me know. I would appreciate your feed back. If you would like to
submit one of your favorite art pieces that you'd like
me to recreate into an outfit, feel free to write
it in the comments down below or tweet me @IMJENNIM,
whatever you prefer. Honestly I had so much fun
filming this and it's kind of inspired me to start painting
again, because growing up I loved to paint, because
I was never a good writer, so I always found like
different mediums to express myself, so whether that
was painting or videos, I'm just very visual. I wanna thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one, bye. Mwah. 
(r&amp;b music) ♫ Better think it over baby ♫ Better think it over baby ♫ Better think it over baby ♫ Better think it over baby - Hi everybody, it is Wednesday. I'm currently driving back from the gym, because if I'm gonna be completely honest, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I woke up in a foul mood, and that's when I just realized, like, okay, Jenn, I know this is the last thing you want to do, but you gotta go to the gym. Because now, it's literally night and day. I feel 100 times better, I feel
like I can conquer the day, thank God, because today's
actually like a really important day for me. By the end of August, I'm
gonna be launching something very, very important to me,
and today is the first day I see it for myself, so I
just pray to God everything goes to plan because I already
booked my trip to Toronto. I went to FYF over the weekend,
and my God, that festival just had me rejuvenated. It's just, I just love live music so much, and the lineup for FYF was so sick. I loved Anderson Paak, he
was just like so talented. The fact that he sings
and raps and then he goes to the drums, like that was crazy. Me and Ben and everybody
were just like in awe. Missy Elliot was a freaking legend. She hasn't aged a day. We saw a Tribe Called Quest,
Erykah Badu was amazing, and then of course, Frank Ocean. I had such a blast, and
it was just kind of like the mental vacation
that I needed, but yeah, now it's back to work
and back on my grind. (r&amp;b music) Hello guys, just got out
of the Lyft, and now I'm heading to dinner. Going to Au Lac, I feel
like I've talked about this in a blog before, but
yeah, we're gonna have vegan food with the girls. (r&amp;b music) ♫ Oh baby ♫ Better think it over baby ♫ Better think it over baby - In the back seat. - With the top down.
- With the top down. - Feel that downtown L.A. wind. - The fresh air.
- The fresh air. - The fresh air and the particles. (laughing) - Particles. (r&amp;b music) - Oh, who's a good girl? Down. Leave it. Okay. Hi everybody, it is Thursday. Ben and I are on our way
to the Goodwill outlet. We are finally doing the my
man styles my outfits tag, but we thought we would
do a little twist and do a thrifted version. So we're gonna try and do
both our outfits today, but depending on how much
time we have, we're just gonna squeeze as much as we can. - Yeah, we'll be all right,
we'll be doing like three outfits each, maybe four. We might want to do one
that we have to wear out in public, so it's
gonna be a wildcard to say the least. But I'm excited to find Jenn's. I mean you've already styled
a trash bag and looked great. - Thank you, aww. - I don't know, I've got to really try and find something good. (r&amp;b music) (tapping) I'm using my dad's hand as a tripod, look. (speaking in foreign language) Bye! Hey guys, so a little update. It is currently 11:11. Oh, make a wish. So I'm back from dinner
and now I am packing, because tomorrow Ben and I are heading to San Francisco. I haven't been to the
Bay in like over a year. And I think a couple years for Ben. So we're super excited to be going. We're going to Generation Beauty. But right now I'm packing. I'm only gonna be there for two days, but every time I go on
a trip, I just pack like quadruple outfits, because I feel like I don't know there's
gonna be opportunities to shoot and stuff. So yeah I'm just gonna start packing. Oh, I have to show you
this killer vintage find I got at Popkiller the other day. It's just a jacket with
all these sponsors, there's UPS, Coca-Cola,
Nascar, it is awesome. And then I also got this
sick vintage Pink Floyd tee. It is massive. Ben and I are definitely
gonna share this piece, so I'm gonna pack both of these 'cause I'm very, very excited about them. But other than that, I got nothing. So let's start. (r&amp;b music) Here we are at Samovar. - We haven't been here
in three years maybe. - [Jenn] Yeah. - We sat outside there
and had a cup of tea. One of our first dates. So it's nice to be back. It's very nice to be back. It's beautiful here. Look at it. All this green, the flowers, buildings. - [Jenn] This is one
of my favorite parts of San Francisco, this area. It's above Yerba Buena Gardens. - [Ben] Got myself a reuben,
nice quiche for the lady. - Oh my God, we are starving! (r&amp;b music) Happy Saturday morning. We are about to head out to
the Embarcadero and have, I don't know, some clam chowder, perhaps? - [Ben] Yeah, go to the pier,
just walk along the water, and this lovely hotel we're at. - Yeah, this is the Palace Hotel. (r&amp;b music) We're at the farmer's
market in the Embarcadero. There are so many options for food. - [Ben] Too many options. - I know, we'll figure it out. - [Ben] We will. - We'll narrow it down. - [Ben] Found the Korean spot. - Yeah, looks like a Korean fusion spot. There's a kimbap burger. Interesting. So this is the kimbap burger. Mmm. - [Ben] We'll take that
as a yes, it's good? - Mmm hmm. It's like kimbap with a burger patty. - [Ben] Mmm. (r&amp;b music) - [Crowd] Hi Ben! - [Ben] Hello. - Yay, we are at Gen Beauty
now, about to head to my meetup, so excited
to meet all of you guys. - It's gonna be good. (crowd screaming) (r&amp;b music) - [Jenn] Having a drink at Delirium. (laughing) - [Jenn] Proper dive bar. - Three-and-a-half years
ago, I met this one here. - Found love in a hopeless place. - Literally a hopeless place. (laughing) - [Jenn] Dinner is served. We've got a little dim sum platter. - [Ben] Dim sum. I think it's my favorite food. - Yeah, no, it is. It's one of my favorite foods as well. - [Fan] Can I take a photo of you two? - Oh, we're actually taking a video. - Thank you, though.
- But thank you, though. (laughing) - [Jenn] Here we have
the mapo tofu, which is one of my favorite dishes ever. - [Ben] You like this. - [Jenn] I do love it. (r&amp;b music) Good morning. This is breakfast, chicken
enchilada, Ben got a burrito. - It's so heavy, it's
just gonna be in there in a minute. - [Jenn] Substantial. - Absolutely. - We're eating at Tropisueno,
which is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants ever. And that means a lot
because I grew up in L.A. and I had a lot of good Mexican food. But this place is so amazing. It's in SOMA, right next
to the Jewish museum. - [Ben] And we went on
a date here, didn't we? - We did. Golden Gate Bridge right over there. So we are at our second
destination now, we are at Lands End/Sutro Baths
and it's so awesome here. It's just like hiking. - It's very peaceful, it's lovely. We're in a little tree. - Little tree nook. - Tree nook, looking at the old bridge. What's going on? You're not telling everyone are you? (laughing) - Why? - You can't tell anyone. - Ben's getting a little powder. - A slight powdering. - This is just showbiz, guys. - This is showbiz. When we were recording,
I realized my face was looking a tiny bit
shiny, we've been setting everything up and running
around, and I felt a little bit of sweat coming along. - Yeah, see? Mattefied. - We got a powder and what do you think? - Yeah, some Laura Mercier
translucent powder to block out the shine. - See? For men, too. So there we are. - Yeah, so today we're
actually filming the fiance styles, or thrifts
my outfits challenge. Everything's like just really squeezed in right now. 'Cause tomorrow I'm
heading out to Toronto, so I'm like.... - You're doin' it. You're gettin' through it. We managed to go to the gym. Managed to get some errands done. - Yeah. - Get this mashed out. Go get your hair done,
get yourself packed, watch Game of Thrones,
then bugger off to Toronto. - Yep. Hi everybody. I am on my way to Ana's house right now. It is already time to do my
base, can you believe it? It's been like four weeks, insane. I always am shocked how
fast the time goes by. But yeah, it's time to
get my base done and then I will have fresh hair for Toronto. I'm heading tomorrow at like
5:30, because my flight's at 8:00. In August, it's just gonna
be a really, really crazy month for me. And it's exciting but also a lot of work. Currently just trying to figure out my way to managing stress. But I must say I'm very
proud because today I finished my self-esteem
pack on Headspace. And I'm very, very happy,
I finished all 30 days, so I'm feeling good. And then today I started
the, or tomorrow I'm gonna start the stress pack. If you don't know what Headspace is, you can watch my July
favorites video where I talk about it and explain what it is. So yeah there's a lot of things I want to improve about myself
and managing stress is definitely at the top of my list because it's just, stress is like
one of the top killers. I'm really excited to go to Toronto. I'm gonna film a video
there with my girl Dani of Kastor &amp; Pollux. She is just amazing. I've been such a huge fan
of her work, and also she's a good friend of mine, so
just kinda kill two birds with one stone, working and
hanging out with a friend. - So here I am at Ana and
Jesse's and just ordered some Thai food from Postmates. I got it at this place
called the Pot Thai Cafe. I got the Pad Kee Mao, which
is like a spicy flat noodle, and then I also got a
yellow curry, because I was feeling very greedy tonight. Oh my gosh, my battery's about to die. Okay, well this is as
exciting as things are going right now. Getting my hair, I got my base done and also doing a glossy. Hi guys, so I am popping
in to just wrap up the vlog because I believe the last
clip was just me eating Thai food, and I didn't
want to end it like that. So yeah I am nearly
done editing this vlog. This was supposed to be out on Friday, but unfortunately Cheeki
has like fleas or ticks, I don't know what it is,
but I think it's a tick, but I was just like
petting her, and I just see like this weird black
thing dig into her fur and I'm like hell nah, so
I like looked at her fur, I picked it up, and then I
threw it on the coffee table and then I crushed it
with the remote control. And then I went to the pet
store, and they gave me this shampoo and I used
it, but tomorrow I have to take Cheeki to the vet
because I just want a professional to look at it. But yeah, sorry, I'm like blabbing on. I just want to thank you
guys so much for watching, I know this vlog was more of a chatty one, as opposed to action. Oh, I also wanted to
thank everybody that came to see me at Gen Beauty. Thank you so much. I love the Bay Area. A lot of you guys
thought I was from there. But I'm actually from L.A. Born and raised here. But you know, I'm not mad
at the fact that people think I'm from the Bay. It's a great area. Anyway, thank you guys
so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. Mwah. 
(bouncy music) - Today is the first day of June, so welcome to the monthly vlog. I'm wearing a sweater, because it's actually a
pretty gloomy day today. June gloom is very real, but, as you can see, Ben and I are in our new home! - [Ben] Hello! - He's cooking lunch over
there, he's making bolognese, but, unfortunately, I
won't be able to eat that. I'm heading out to Venice today, because I've partnered
with Daniel Wellington, so I'm going to their
store in Abbot Kinney to check out their brand-new collection. So let's head on over. (bouncy music) Hi, there! Alright, so here is the
gorgeous Bondi collection, apparently Bondi is a beach in Australia, so I guess it's named after that. Oh, so it comes in a rose
gold and a silver option, but I'm digging the rose gold. It's absolutely stunning. These bracelets, you can also purchase to layer with the watch. The watch face is 32 millimeters,
so it's nice and petite, and the straps are also interchangeable, so you can do whatever kind
of color that you like. This is what the watch looks like on, as you can see, the rose gold
really complements everything, it makes my skin tone look very tanned and perfect for the summer. Eee! Oh my gosh, I love the way it looks! These days, I just love wearing watches, because whenever I check
the time on my phone, and I'm around someone,
I feel a little rude. But with the watch, you can be a little
bit more slick with it, and just kind of casually peek like that. If you are interested in grabbing your own Daniel Wellington watch, I have a promo code, Just use "JENN15" and get
15 percent off your order. Also, the couch has arrived. This is from West Elm, and I think Cheeki approves. What do you think, Chippo? Ben and I could both, easily, comfortably, lay down here and watch the TV. Eventually we'd like to get this mounted, maybe we'll get a bigger TV
then and mount it on the wall. But, this is definitively
going to work for now. And then, our coffee table
is gonna arrive tomorrow! Whew, so I've been
sitting at this same spot for the past two hours, I believe. I'm just editing my May monthly vlog, I want to have this out by Sunday, although I think I might
upload this on Saturday, because I'm going to Tokyo! I'm so excited. This year has just been a
string of surreal events, and I just looked up from my laptop, and it's all starting to sink in. Seven years ago, when I started, I had no idea what this would amount to. Now I'm sitting in my own home. I'm just in a spot where
I just feel very grateful, and very thankful for
everything in my life. I just feel really happy, and I just, I don't know, I just want to
share this moment with you. (bouncy music) Our entrees are here, I
got the chickpea bowl, and Dawn got the Halloumi
sweet potato bowl. - Yum!
- Yum! Should I put it all in?
- Just chuck it in, yeah. We're making some vegetable skewers. - Skewers.
- Skewers. We are having some friends
around tonight for a barbecue, here is one early.` He's preparing the shrimp right now, his mom's favorite Bang Bang Shrimp. - I love zucchini. (bouncy music) (guests chatter) ♫ Looks like another love T.K.O. (pilot speaks in foreign language) Alright, so we just got
into our hotel room, but here are our little twin beds! Very spacious, and look at the beautiful bathroom, it's like this gorgeous stone everywhere, There is a Japanese soak tub over here, this is like a wet room, so you take a shower right over here, and then you can soak, and then look at this gorgeous view. Oh my God. I desperately need a shower right now. And over here we've got
the living room space, a nice place where you can
enjoy the view as well, the lady told us that you can
see Mount Fuji in the morning, so another amazing thing about this room. I just did a body shower, and now I'm getting ready to go out, Ashley and I are, we have a meeting, actually, in an hour. But after, we're going
to go grab some ramen, explore Ginza, which
should be really exciting. Pretty much wherever the day takes us. I am here, with Shiseido, I'm
doing a photo shoot with them! And I feel like everything
just kinda happened so quickly, it's one of those last minute trips that just kinda worked through. So, I'm so excited to be back in Tokyo. Tomorrow we have a full free day, so I'm gonna eat as
much ramen and tonkatsu and sushi as much as I can. So, that's my only agenda here. (bouncy music) Ramen is here! This looks delicious. - Cheers!
- Cheers! (bouncy music) Good morning everyone! Here with Ashley, we're in a cab and we are on our way to Harajuku. We're about to go shopping, apparently we're going to
this place called, La Floret? - [Ashley] Laforet.
- Laforet! And it has like 12
stories of amazing stores. So, I'm about to get my shop on. (bouncy music) Morning! Today is day two in Tokyo, and it's also my day of
my shoot with Shiseido. I'm doing a shoot for their
Waso Skincare Collection and it's basically products geared for just younger women on the go. The first scene starts in this hotel, actually in the spa. So, I don't have to wear any makeup. I'm just gonna draw some brows on and then after we shoot that scene, then I'm just gonna do my full face. But, breakfast came, I just
got the egg white omelet again because the Japanese option
is just like kanji and miso and I just feel like eggs
in the morning, right now. (slow hip hop music) Alright, so we just had lunch! I had soba noodles, and now
we're at our second location. We are at a shrine, I
also did a outfit change. Now, I'm meeting everyone
and the rest of the team. (slow hip hop music) I found it! - Yay!
- Yay, Bar Albatross! No! (laughing) Hi, so I just got back from Japan today, or I guess this morning. And the washer and dryer,
finally arrived to the place, so I can wash my new sheets. I'm gonna replace these old ones, which I've had for the longest time. I honestly couldn't even tell you where those sheets were from, I forgot. But, I got some new gray
sheets from West Elm, so I'm gonna put them on right now. (slow hip hop music) Alright, the bed sheets are done. I'm really digging the gray. It goes nicely with the wall. Still need to get some artwork there. We're gonna get new dressers,
that have more storage. And, that thing will not be there. But, yeah, our bedroom
is coming along great. Isn't that right Chippo? Hi guys, it is Saturday. I am currently gathering
all my belongings, because I'm heading out
to South Coast Plaza, which is in Orange County. I am having a meetup with Macy's! There's gonna be three
other Youtubers there. Louis, Tiffany and Sierra. So, it's gonna be a grand old time. I can't wait to see
everyone who comes out, hopefully people will show up! (laughs) Every time I go to meetups
I am always just like a little bit anxious, but
not like a bad anxiety. But, just kinda like
butterflies in the stomach. Ben is coming with me, to keep me company. And I am excited to meet all of you guys! So, I'll see you guys at the event! (bouncy music) Alright, so we are finally
home after the event. And I just wanna thank
everybody who showed up. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. That was one of the best events ever. And, we got through like
300 of you guys today! So, that was phenomenal. I never expect people to come out, but you guys just have me floored and also this not necessary by any means. But I'm just, I don't
know I'm just so touched by everyone's generosity, I've
got so many Hot Cheetos Fries because y'all know that I love this. Someone even gave me
chopsticks to eat it with. I got some books, some candy,
a bunch of these fun snacks. And a ton of these letters. I can't wait to read all of them. Thank you so much! Oh my god I'm literally dying. (laughs) You look so adorable! It says, "Adidog". Cheeki. Walter and Cheeki.
- [Rebecca] Hey, Walter! (whistles) - [Ben] What's up? - [Rebecca] Don't show your teeth. - [Jenn] Be a good boy! - [Rebecca] He's like sniffing something like don't bother me. - [Jenn] Concrentrating.
- [Rebecca] Yeah. - [Jenn] Woah!
- [Rebecca] Woah! - [Jenn] Getting in there! I shot with Rebecca today. - Hey!
- [Jenn] Hey! My parents just left, they came and saw the new
place for a little bit so that was really nice. Today I uploaded my apartment tour video, from my last apartment. And, you know surprisingly, it's getting a lot of mixed reviews. Not everything can be a hit. And it was filmed in a different format, it was more of a, like a storyline. There was some acting involved, this is something that
I've always wanted to do. But, unfortunately, some people did not seem to agree with me. But, what can you do? As a creator, I've been
doing this for a long time. And sometimes I just want to make videos like this because
it's fun and refreshing to me. And those who love the video, thank you so much for giving it a try. I really appreciate it. So we're having movie night, and we're gonna make some popcorn! - Yeah, we've just got two
in there at the moment. We're waiting for it to heat up. Once they pop, we know they're ready. And then we get these guys in. And it's really fun doing this, 'cause you can add your
salt, we got truffle salt. - [Jenn] Ooh! - Cooked in a little bit of vegetable oil, but it's delicious. - [Jenn] Oh my god, when is it gonna pop? It is gonna make a loud noise? - [Ben] It's gonna scare you. - [Jenn] Oh my god. (laughs) I'm getting a little anxious. Riveting stuff. (laughs) - [Ben] Yeah, we gotta
keep a hold of this. We have been waiting for it. (Jenn Screams) - [Jenn] Woah, it did it! It became a pop-- (screams) (laughs) Oh my god! She's licking my toes. I think she thought I was scared. - [Ben] Aw.
- [Jenn] Aw. I was scared.
Oh, yes. - [Ben] You like that don't you? - You like that, don't you Chippo? Anyway, Ben and I are having movie night. We're watching "Catch Me if You Can". - I can't believe you haven't seen it. - I haven't. - It is a classic, one
of my favorite Leo films. - I'm excited! - Any excuse for popcorn! (buzzing) - Taking Chippo to the groomers today. Today, is just a day filled with errands. I just dropped Cheeki off at the groomers, because it's been like
a good month and a half since she's gotten like
professionally washed. And she needed a haircut. So, I dropped her off at
Pussy &amp; Pooch in Downtown L.A. Because they do a good job cutting her. Right, I'm actually on
the way back home because I was gonna go to the gym to workout. But, I forgot my headphones. And, I thought like, could
I workout without music? And I was like, "no that's
really not gonna happen." So, I'm just gonna pop by the house, grab my headphones, do a
good workout and then I have a phone call with a wedding
planner at two O'clock. It's all freaking happening, you guys! I just wanted to make sure,
well now we're in a tunnel. Ben and I just wanted to
make sure that we had, just the house situated first. 'Cause that was just a huge ordeal, and now that that's over, we're gonna put all our
energy into the wedding now. Woo! (slow hip hop music) Hi Genie, this is Jenn! - [Genie] Hi, Jenn, I was
gonna give you a call. I was gonna give you a few more minutes in case you were busy. - Aw thank you! - [Genie] Do you guys
live in L.A. right now? - Yeah, we live in L.A. Alrighty, I just finished filming the speaking portion for my Japan haul. I really like this background. Hopefully the echo doesn't exist. But we'll see when I check
out the footage, but yeah. And happy boys! - Very happy boys. - [Jenn] Very happy boys. And happy girls. (slow hip hop music) Good morning, it is Saturday morning. Currently in front of The Oaks Gourmet, I'm waiting for Ben and Simon to go grab their breakfast burritos. And I'm just kinda holding the fort here. If you guys don't know who Simon is, it's Ben's best friend from England. He is the bassist of Young Guns and he's in town for the week. Our breakfast burritos are here. Simone is in town. - I'm having a good time. (Jenn laughs) Ben is showing me a very good time. So, happy days. - [Jenn] Currently on our hike. You guys holding up okay? - [Ben] Yeah just about.
- [Simon] We're boiling. - [Jenn] We have made it to the top! Well done Simone. - We did it! - [Jenn] Well done Ben. - That was a lot harder than
it usually is, it's very warm. Cheeki was struggling. - [Jenn] Yeah, oh Chippo,
but you're hanging in. - [Ben] I was holding Cheeki, it's like a hot blanket wasn't it Cheeki? - [Jenn] Yeah.
- [Ben] Yeah. Alrighty, back at home I feel amazing, I showered and I just
feel like a new person. But, that hike knocked me out, I really forgot how crazy it is, but yeah, Cheeki is doing just fine. She just had a bath and
she's freaking tired. I am editing my "Favorite Books" video which is out tomorrow! This has been so highly requested and it's been on my to-do
list for the longest time so it feels so satisfying
to like cross it out. But yeah, that comes out on Sunday, tomorrow is also Father's Day. I'm having a barbecue with
like my entire family, so that's gonna be amazing. So this is the state
of my office right now. It is just an absolute mess. I am normally quite a clean person, but this move has just been a struggle because I am just in
desperate need of storage. So Ben actually hung this
rail up, and that one. So, now I'm just gonna transfer all my bottoms onto that rack. I've just been putting this off and off. Today is the day that I'm gonna
try and make some progress because this ain't pretty right now. Hello everybody, today is Father's Day. And my entire family is gonna
come over in an hour or so. And we're just gonna have a
nice barbecue in the backyard. I feel like in this month, we've already done like
three or four barbecues. We've done a lot, so that
grill is being put to good use. Today is also Simon's last day here, he's leaving in around two or three hours. So, it's very, very sad. I think that he had an amazing
week here, so that's good. Last night, I went on a cleaning rampage. I cleaned for a good two hours. And I know it doesn't look like my office has changed at all, but I have pretty much hung up everything. I put the shorts in the closet. I'm just waiting on some more hangers and also the Ikea stuff came in today. I bought three items and
they all came in 45 pieces. It's nuts, I think we're gonna just hire someone to build that. Because that's gonna be
a mission for me and Ben. Barbecue is in an hour and a half? - Yep. We are prepping now. Gonna make some mash
potatoes, some veggie kabobs. Some white mushrooms.
- mm. - Went for the slightly bigger
version, because version. (laughs) Mushroom 2.0. - Yeah, my dad's bringing the meat. My mom's bringing the
salad and the salsa-- - Mm.
- and the rice. - Perfect. - It's like when a server is
like, "tell me when to stop". (laughs) Hi! (speaks in foreign language) She brought a little house warming gift. - [Ben] Wow!
- Wow! - That's so good. - Oh my goodness. Oh, thank you! - [Ben] Thank you! - [Jenn] Happy Father's Day, Apa! - Thank you! - [Jenn] Cheeki is making
sure everything is good. Nothing is dropping on the floor. Alrighty, the food is prepared
for our Father's day feast. This spread is crazy. - I'm so happy. - Are you having a good Father's Day? - Yeah, it's good food
and everything comfort. So, thank you very much. For everything. - Thank you for everything. (laughs) (slow hiphop music) 
(mellow music) - [Ben] Where are we going? - South by Southwest.
(Ben laughs) (mellow music) Hi, guys, so we are officially
checked into our hotel. As you can tell from the previous clips, we are in Austin for South by Southwest. This is my first time ever being here or attending this festival,
so I'm really excited. Tomorrow, I actually have a
panel that I'm speaking at. It's called Create and Cultivate, so obviously, I'll be taking
you guys with me there. Tonight, we've got a couple of plans. I've got this happy hour slash event thing and then we've got a dinner. So we just got some room service
because we were starving. - [Ben] First things first, we have. - [Jenn] Burger! - [Ben] A burger. - It look so sad,
(Ben laughs) quite actually. - [Ben] Here you got a
nice little side salad to go with it as you can see there. - [Jenn] Delicious, nutritious. - [Ben] And then another
nutritious flatbread. (Woman laughs) AKA, pizza. - [Jenn] Pizza! (crowd chatters) - Just the old 4:00 drinks. (Woman laughs)
It's South By, you got to. We're finally inside. It's raining.
- Yep. - Makes I feel like home. We're going to go pick up our passes now and then go have some dinner (mellow music) Yeah! (mellow music) - Wow.
- It's one of the last wild caviars available. - [Ben] Have a try. Yeah?
- Oh, wow. (mellow music) - Hi guys! Good morning. It is day two of South by Southwest, but it's our first full, official day. I'm super excited. Yesterday was an amazing
way to start everything off. My panel is at 5:30 today,
so I've got some time to kill before then. The topic of the panel is
about creating content 24/7. I think that's actually
really fitting for me because it is a little bit of a struggle to find a balance
between creating content, filming, and just enjoying
the moment for what it is. My friend Rachel is also
on the panel with me, so that makes me super happy. But yeah, since my panel is at 5:30, Ben and I are going to go to
the actual convention center, Austin Convention Center
to see some people. (mellow music) We are walking back to the hotel. It is freezing! - It's very cold!
- Oh my God, I know. - We didn't prepare for this.
- No, no. - We don't have any jumpers, sweaters. - Nothing. The convention was really cool, though. - [Ben] It was cool. - We saw one speaker and then
went to the infinity room. (mellow music) Yeah, but I think it just
depends on what platform you personally love the most. - Holler!
- Oh, my gosh. - [Ben] Good job, guys. - I can't feel any of my face right now.
- Oh my! - I'm like Dumb and Dumber. - This is a little.
- I would. (mellow music) - Hi guys, it is day three in Austin. A little bit of a late start this morning, bu we are all dressed and ready to go. Panel went great. I was super cold, but we had blankets and everyone on the panel was so amazing. It was awesome to be around
such inspiring women, especially in my field. And I got to meet so many of you guys. Thank you so much for coming out. I wanted to give a couple of shout-outs. So this portrait is by Tyra. Thank you so much for this. I can't wait to hang this in my house and I can't wait to see
how you draw cheeky. And over here, I've
got two laser-cut pins. It's a donut and a little sushi roll and I can't wait to put
these on a denim jacket. (mellow music) I've got coffee and now I'm heading to my second interview today. It's for What's Trending. (mellow music) 3:27.
(Ben laughs) (mellow music) All right, guys. I am finally home! I hope you enjoyed this little
South by Southwest trip. We weren't there for long, but I really enjoyed what I saw of Austin, just, everyone was so lovely. I'm so glad I got to
meet a bunch of you guys at the panel the other day. I need to go back to Austin though because there's so many things
that we weren't able to do, like go to Home Slice
Pizza, Twitchy's Tacos, but I know that there will
definitely be a next time, crossing my fingers to
go next year as well. I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (lips smack) (mellow music) 
(hip hop music) - Hey everybody, it's your girl Jen, and today I'm filming the My
Perfect Imperfections tag. And I believe this was
created by AndreasChoice here on YouTube, and I remember when she first
uploaded this video in 2010. It left such a big
impact on my self-esteem, and this video isn't meant to just like tear us apart and have us
you know talk negatively about each other. It's meant to showcase that
everybody has insecurities or things that they have
thought about changing. And so that's why I'll be
talking about three imperfections or flaws that I see in myself, and then I'll talk about three things that I like about myself. And I guess I'll start off
with the negatives first so that way I can just like
end it with the positive note. So let's get started. The first flaw I wanna talk
about are my uneven eyelids. So my left eye is my good eye. This is my golden eye. It's got a nice little crease, and the lashes do what they're told. However, my right side
did not get the memo. That's why it makes it
look like my right lid is thicker than my left. And it's because it is. They're uneven, it's not symmetrical, and it's just, it was a little
frustrating when I was like trying to figure out how to do a cat eye. Because the lines would
always look super uneven. In college I actually tried
to do something about it. I bought these little
like eyelid stickers, and you literally just
stick 'em on your eye and it trains your lid to fold correctly. And it worked for like a year or so, but now it's just back
to being this again. And honestly I'm not
losing any sleep over it. I've come to terms with it, and the fact that I can
see out of both my eyes is all that I can ask for. So definitely not taking that for granted. So my next flaw is probably
my biggest insecurity, and they are my legs. If I wanna get real
specific, they are my calves. They're so big and muscular, and growing up I freaking hated them. I hated my legs so much. I would always try and cover them up, and I never felt like, I never felt girly. I always felt kinda like brutish and just kinda manly because my legs were very strong and thick. I was actually considering
getting a calf reduction when I was like 19 or 20. I was saving up for the procedure. But after reading all
those forums and seeing like the recovery process, it was just a very invasive procedure. Like it's not like you're
injecting something or you're putting an implant. Like you're literally
cutting through your muscle, tearing it out, and then
like sewing it back together and expecting everything to be okay. Like your calves are such a crucial muscle in your body. Even in my delusion it
didn't seem worth it because a lot of the
recovery stories are like, yeah I got my calf reduction surgery. It's been like seven months. I still can't really walk or run, but at least my calves
are like an inch smaller. It just didn't seem worth it to me because I would never wanna
compromise my ability to walk and run and climb because
I love being on my feet. I love being active. And I don't think I would've
been able to forgive myself to impair like my legs for something so superficial. And even though I'm not like
in love with my legs now, like I've learned to
love them in my own way. Sure they're big, but they're strong, and I'm a pretty fast sprinter
and I can jump really high. I love my legs because they're mine, and they take me from point A to point B. The last imperfection I wanna
talk about is my height. I am five foot one, so I'm pretty short. Like I'm not the shortest,
but I'm still pretty petite. And I think this
insecurity started to form when I was a kid. My mom would always make me drink like a big glass of milk every day, and she told me that if I drink this milk than I would be tall, and if I was tall I would be successful. And I remember just pounding milk down. And you know who would've though, genetics would play a big factor. Now I'm the same height as my mom. I think that my insecurity got worse when I started to become more obsessed
with fashion and style, and whenever I looked
at models on the runway, they would be at least
five nine or five 10, and so that was my standard of beauty. And I thought that I had to be tall in order to pull off these
outfits that I loved. And that also kinda spurred my obsession with wearing heels everywhere. Like I liked wearing those heels, but I felt like it was
almost like a crutch for me. Because I thought that if I was taller, then people would take me more seriously. But now I've realized
that it's completely bs. No one treats you differently
because you're taller or shorter, it's about who you are inside. And now I'm really starting
to embrace my shortness. I really love the fact
that I am very compact. I can fit in like the economy
plane size seat pretty well. I can even like cross my legs there. It's nice. So now let's move on over to the things that I like about myself. The first are definitely my collarbones. I will never forget the first time I got a compliment on this, and it was by my friend
Ann in the seventh grade. She looked down and she told me that I had really nice collarbones. And in middle school, I was so painfully insecure, and that compliment just stuck with me and my collarbones became
my redeeming quality for everything. Because everything else had
not developed in any way. (laughing) I just really
love how prominent they are. I love wearing off the shoulder tops and just any top that
highlights this area. The decollete is such a beautiful part of a woman's body, and I feel like it just does not get the recognition it deserves. I feel like everyone's
focusing on like the boobs or the butt, but what about this area? This is just, I don't know, it needs to, it needs to
have some recognition. So I thought I would
shed some light on it. Next up, I would have to say my smile. I had braces when I was
15 for eight months. This tooth right over here
actually went all the way in, so I just got braces to pop that out, and here we are today. I brush them two times
a day for two minutes with an electric toothbrush. And I floss, obviously. I think oral hygiene is very important. I really love smiling and just you know having that good positive
energy out there. It's something that anybody can do, and it just has like a huge impact. So whenever you don't know
what to do, just smile. Unless you're doing
something like really creepy, don't smile, that just makes (laughing) it like even creepier. For my third thing, I
would have to say my hair. I love how low-maintenance it is. It doesn't get oily, and when I curl it, like the curl stays for like a couple days. It's amazing. And I think it's because I trained my hair not to get oily. When I was younger, I wouldn't (laughing) wash my hair, I wouldn't shower actually. I like I just wanted to be
as like grimy as possible, and as a result, my hair just doesn't produce as much oil. And yeah it's awesome, now with the invention of
dry shampoo it's great. So I wanted to have a little bonus round and talk about some internal traits because I didn't want
everything to be just about like the physical appearance. So one personality trait
that I wanna work on is definitely the fact that
I overthink everything. I have so many thoughts in my head, and they're always racing. And I will just pick myself apart. I have a lotta regret
on things that I wish I could've done differently or things that I could've said, and it just literally drives me crazy. It's not healthy to do this, and so I am making strides
on quieting the mind by just meditating, going
to the gym more often. It's definitely improved, but still a long way to go. Lastly for a personality trait, I would say that I'm a
pretty good listener. I just genuinely love
listening to people's stories, people's days, I just like
feeling connected that way. And I always like to hear everybody out, even if it's something that I
don't necessarily agree with. Because I feel like by understanding them, we can just like get to the bottom of why we are the way we are. I feel like we're always
pressured to be a good speaker and be a bold personality, but I actually feel like
it's more beneficial to be a good listener
because you learn so much about other people, about yourself, and about the world. And it just gives you so
much more perspective. Alright guys that wraps up this video. I've been wanting to film
this for such a long time. I just wanted to remind
you guys that everybody has insecurities and everybody has things that they don't like about themselves. But it's about accepting
the things that you can't and working on the things that you can. And I'm gonna tag my
girls right over here, my best friends. I really hope they do this tag. If they don't I'm gonna
text them and call them and bother them until they do it because I'm nosy. And I would also love for
you guys to do the same thing as well, do four imperfections, three physical and one emotional. And then four things that
you love about yourself, three physical and one emotional. Or I guess you can you know mix and match. Doesn't have to be three, one, you know, just you know do what you want. I would love to read you guys' answers. I feel like this is gonna
be a really exciting comments section. Thank you guys so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye, mwah. (hip hip music) 
Hi everyone! It's your girl Jenn and welcome back I am here with the very first episode of favorites of 2018 because January is officially over I would love to know how this month went for you because some of you guys are telling me that it went excruciatingly slow. But for me, it was literally just a wash of the month, so please tell me did it go slow or fast Let me know in the comments down below Either way, I'm gonna chat about some of my favorite things of January, so let's get started So I'm gonna start things off with a fashion favorite first. Here I have this windbreaker from Kappa I posted this on Instagram pretty recently when I was up in the bay and a lot of y'all were loving this including myself. I wore it the entire weekend when I was in San Francisco And it truly was such a great day to night peace. In the daytime when the Sun was out the material is lightweight enough So I'm not overheating, but when I would wear at night the material. It just cuts through the strong winds so it's just very Multifunctional, and it looks so cool. It's very retro and vibey. I love this jacket It is a fun teal color and teal was actually my favorite color in high school So I'll always have a soft spot for this shade now. I'm gonna move on to some beauty favorites here I have Fenty beauty's gloss balm, and I know I am so late on the Fenty train But what can I say I feel like I'm always two or three steps behind the beauty trends But I must say this is completely worth the hype. This is definitely on my top 5 favorite things at Fenty beauty and I'm not Normally much of a gloss girl, but when I do find a gloss that I love I'm very loyal to it. I absolutely love the shimmer, and this is just a really universal shade for everybody I think this is flattering on any skin tone And I love that it wears beautifully throughout the day. Normally with some lip glosses It just feels really sticky and there's that weird film on your mouth. It doesn't happen with this guy. Throughout the day it just feels like you have like a nice moisturizer in your lips, and I love that. Also it smells so good It just smells like candy like peach candy. This is bomb. So recently my favorite foundation to use has been this one by NARS This is their natural radiant long wear foundation, and I am in the shade Punjab I wore this in my get ready with me in Phuket and This has been on my face non-stop since then. I think it's because when I was in such a humid climate it held up then So this is just a trooper for me. It likes to just stick onto my face, which I completely love This is also very high coverage So I only need maybe one or two pumps with this guy - One to just cover my entire face, and the other pump to just get around my under eyes when I use this I just skip concealer because I'll just use this product And I really like when I can use one product in many ways. With some foundations I find myself looking kind of cakey, but I love that this has kind of like a velvet satiny finish It just looks like your skin, which I enjoy. For me and my skin this foundation is definitely a fit for me So my next item is a beauty tool I have finally got my very first epilator And I'm very proud because before I got this I was plucking all my armpit hair This is like a weird activity that I started doing since my freshman year of high school Because I never like shaving my armpits because I found that when I shaved them my pits just look darker So it just became a habit to pluck every single one of them And it just became a part of my routine until one day I told Amy and she was like why don't you just get an epilator and so she recommended me this one. And I bought it and honestly this was worth every single penny it now takes less than a minute to take off all Individual hairs from my armpit, and it's been incredible. This is the device. There are two settings There's one and two. Two I never use because it's just too fast I just find it very painful, but one is definitely doable I would show you how to like actually use it, but my pits are actually pretty clean right now I did it maybe three days ago So they were in good shape. Feel free to use this device anywhere that you grow hair like your legs down there It's just awesome because it is so quick, speedy and you stay hair free for a lot longer In January I finally ditched my Canon T3i And God bless her soul because she was the first DSLR that I ever purchased. This was back in 2008 or 2009 so since like the birth of this channel but that T3i Just really documented some great memories any time that I used equipment. That wasn't T3I while I was vlogging. It just didn't compare to the quality and just the standard that I had for vlogging, but I knew it was time for a change because It was just getting way too heavy, like I was lugging around an 8 pound piece of equipment everywhere And I was hurting my back And I just knew that like there is there's got to be something on the market for me Where it is just a lot more efficient, so I asked my friend Jesse who knows a ton about camera equipment And so he recommended me this.This is the Canon EOS M6 I also bought a wide-angle lens to attach with it because when I'm vlogging by myself I don't want the frame to be too close And I like to just have just everything in the screen and I can choose to crop if I want to but yeah I bought these two pieces separately and this has been Amazing to vlog with I've vlogged my entire second half of January with this so you guys will see the footage later But it meets my standard, and it is so easy to just bust it out and start filming with my Canon T3i I would have to like manually focus and set the exposure, but with this it just does everything for you It's kind of like a pimped out version of the Canon G7X and this has truly been such a great investment for me And I can't wait to just start vlogging more. This also has a flip out screen so obviously perfect for vloggers And I am just stoked about this very happy to graduated to this new camera My last favorite is a TV show called End of the F***ing World This is on Netflix and this was recommended to me by Silas who is so so span He just texted me and Ben was like hey watch this new show and we're like okay, and we loved it It is a black comedy Featuring two teenagers it's kind of like a Bonnie and Clyde because they are just the true definition of a ride-or-die and At first when you watch the show you don't really know What to think of the characters like they're actually kind of unlikable in the beginning But as you continue to watch it They become very endearing and they bring out the best in each other or maybe the worst Either way it is a really fun and easy watch. I also love the way it's shot It kinda reminds me of West Anderson with like the cemetry and the flat leis and just the quirky characters I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a new show to watch Alright everyone, that is a wrap on my January favorites. I'm so sorry that I don't have a book favorite for you I actually spent January reading the 4-hour workweek and I Did not like it, and if I'm gonna be frank the author just kind of seemed to kind of douche-baggy I really like halfway through and I was like I just I just can't finish this so yeah, I didn't want to recommend you guys a book that I didn't like. Either way I hope to find a better book to read in January I'm thinking about reading a Thousand Splendid Suns. A lot of you guys would recommending to me that so I Need to go read it. It's been a long time since I've read a fiction book and I also love the Kite Runner So I'm gonna go check that out next month if you guys have any fiction books that you'd like to recommend me Please write it in the comments down below I will add it to my to read list, but yes as usual Please write down anything that inspired you or something nice that happened to you last month in the comments down below I would love to read about it and Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye 
- Ahoy, everyone. It's your girl Jenn, and in this video, I've
partnered with Lorac Los Angeles to show you this soft spring look. I'm using the new limited edition Pirates of the Caribbean collection that I revealed last week on my Instagram, and I wanted to create a
look inspired by the film. So, let's get started with the tutorial. I'm beginning with my base
and brows already done just to speed up the process, so I'm gonna zoom straight into the eyes. For eyeshadow, I'm using
Lorac's limited edition Pirates of the Caribbean palette, which is inspired by Captain
Jack Sparrow's compass. There's a whomping 18 eyeshadows in this PRO formula palette, and they're all unique
because Lorac never repeats any shades. So, I'll be dipping into Pirates Chest, which is a matte tan shade, and I'm gonna throw this
right on the outer crease. This is gonna be a
beautiful blending shade to start everything off on the right foot. Then, I'm using Lorac's
Front of the Line Eye Pencil in bronze, which is a
gorgeous shimmering metallic, and I'm gonna start
filling in my actual lid with this color. Next, I'm using Sea Haze, which is a nice sea foam/olive color, and I'm gonna apply that right where we put the bronze pencil. It just acts as a nice base so that the colors come
out more saturated. Then, going into Arrgh!, which
is a shimmery dark brown, I'm gonna use this as a transition color from where I applied the blending shade and the sea foam color. It's just gonna tie everything together. Now, I'm using Menace, which
is a deep forest green, like almost a black shade, and I'm gonna apply that
right on my bottom lash to intensify and give
it more of a smoky look. Then, using the Front of
the Line Pencil in black, I'm gonna start lining
the top lash like this, and then, I'm gonna grab an angled brush and start flicking it out
for a soft cat eye shape. I didn't want something too defined, so I've opted for this method. To make my eyes pop even more, I'm gonna use Shiver Me, which is a shimmery white highlight shade, and I'm gonna pat that right into the inner corners of both eyes and then right on the brow bone. I want to give this look
a little bit more green, so I'm gonna apply Sea Haze
all over the bottom of my eye just to give it more fade. Then, I'm gonna use Lash Pomade mascara, and I'm gonna do a very generous
coat to my bottom lashes and then pop some on the top but not that much because
I'm totally gonna throw on some falsies in there because I always want that extra flutter. Moving onto the face, we gotta contour. I'm grabbing the PRO Contour palette, and I'm using the light shade. And I'm gonna start
making those cheekbones really come through. Now I'm grabbing the Pirates
of the Caribbean cheek palette, and this packaging is inspired by Carina Smyth's diary in
the movie and it's so cute. It looks like a little notebook. I love that you can store
it inside the pullout panel on the side of the eyeshadow palette. Inside, there are six shades, some shimmery, some matte, and I'm gonna use Caribbean and dust that onto the
apples of my cheeks. For highlight, I'm using Star Reader and dusting that onto the
highest points of my cheeks, nose bridge, and the
Cupid's bow, of course. For the lips, I'll be
choosing from the six shades from the limited edition collection, which are inspired by
a trident in the film. These are so cool because on the end, there's a lipstick and
on the other is a gloss. These cream lip duos are
designed with complementary rather than matching shades, so you can decide to wear them together or each on their own. And this is the finished look. It's perfect for this season if you want something soft and smoldering. Alright guys, I hope you
enjoyed this makeup tutorial inspired by Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. It is out on theaters on May 26th. You could also grab this sick collection on loraccosmetics.com on April 14th, and then it'll be available on Kohl's and Ulta on April 16th. If you do decide to try this look out, make sure you use the hashtags #piratebeauty and #pirateslife, and I would love to see
what it looks like on you. I feel like this type of look
is suitable for everybody. Olive green, you know, it really goes well with a lot of stuff. If you guys enjoyed this makeup tutorial, make sure you hit the Like button, subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. 
- Hey everyone! It's your girl Jen, and for
today's face of the month I'm giving you this very
wearable fall autumnal look. I have partnered with Clinique
again and I'm so happy because they're literally
one of my favorite brands. They came up with a new
foundation, which is their Even Better Glow Light
Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum, and obviously I'm wearing
this on my face today. It gives you a nice radiant glow, and I've paired it with
some nice coppery eyes. So if you'd like to see how I did this, then let's roll to the next clip! So here's my face with no makeup, and I'm just gonna start with primer. I'm using this one from Laura Mercier. This is just going to
create a nice smooth base for the foundation we're about to put on. So let's move on over to the foundation. I'm using Clinique's Even Better Glow Light Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum. I am in the shade Meringue. This actually improves your
skin's radiance instantly and over time, because it has
like luminizing properties and vitamins C and A, so,
I'm very excited to see what my skin looks like
by the end of the month, as I continue using this. Gosh, it's given me like
a nice glowy look already. I would say the coverage
is sheer to moderate. My skin is still peeking
through, which I like, because I don't want to cover anything up because it's just nice
when skin looks like skin. So the foundation's all blended in, and I love the way it looks. This is only $28, and you
can grab it at any Clinique counter nationwide, or just
get it online at Clinique.com. I literally purchase everything online, or on my phone, so if you're lazy like me, that's always an option. I want a little bit more
coverage under my eyes, so I'm going to use this
concealer from ColourPop. It is their No Filter Concealer, and I'm just going to pop
that right underneath my eyes just to brighten up this area. Might as well do a little bit on my nose and forehead and chin. I'm going to blend this out
and answer the first question, this is from Sherilyn. What are the first three things you think of when you wake up? By the way, I love you,
congrats on Eggie Shop, I can't wait to see what's next! Aw, thank you! So the first thing I think about is, what did I dream last night? I've always loved to log my dreams. I really should journal them more, but if a dream is really
unusual or interesting, I'll try and like write a little two or three sentence
synopsis on my phone. Number two, I just check my Instagram. It's just a really easy
way for me to you know, keep up with my friends,
see what they're up to, and just stay connected,
and the third thing is just taking Cheeki out to go pee. She needs to go, so, I let her out. So now I'm just going to set
everything with a powder. I'm using Too Faced, Born This
Way Ethereal Setting Powder, and honestly this is one
of the finest powders I've ever used in my life. I'm just going to dust some off and then, I'm going to pack it
underneath my eyes, forehead, smile lines, ooh. (coughs) I always try my best not to like inhale any of it when this is out. So now the base is all done. I'm going to move on to brows. I'm using Diorshow's brow styler, and I'm just doing what I normally do. I'm going to go in to the meat of my brows and just fill that in. What was your favorite part in creating your brand Eggie Shop? By the way I love you. Aw, thank you! My favorite part was
definitely seeing the samples for the first time, and
it was just so crazy to see something just in theory, into like concrete, tangible things. As you guys know, I didn't
go to fashion school or design school, so it
was really important for me to build a team around me
that knew how to do it, so I worked really closely
with the design team at Eggie, and I just
feel so lucky and blessed to have them on my team. They have been amazing to work with, and it's just been awesome
to put whatever idea that's in my head, into
just concrete pieces. I love going on my Instagram
and Eggie's Instagram and just seeing who's tagged the clothes. It means so much to me that
you guys are supporting the brand, and I just
can't wait to show you guys the next drop, it's going to be insane. And now let's move on
over to the eyeshadow. I am gonna use this huge
palette from Lorac Pro. It's their Mega 2 Palette, and
it's just got so many colors. I think I'm just going to go
in with this shade over here, called Burlap, and I'm
just going to use that for the outer corners of my eyes. (light jazz) So now I'm going to go in with Goji, which is kind of like a soft plum color, and I'm just gonna put
that in the crease again, but closer to the eye. I'm just going to intensify
this a little bit more, and I'm going to go in to Cabernet, and I'm just going to start
putting on the outer corner, again, like even closer to the lid. I'm also going to try and
like feather a little bit of this outward, so it just looks like nice and soft and sultry. So now I'm going to go in
with ColourPop So Quiche, and this is kind of like
a metallicy copper shade, but it has like purple reflects in it. I'm not sure if they'll be shown, but I'm gonna just pop it
on my lid with my finger. Here goes nothing. (light jazz music)
♫ Ooh - Looks pretty good! Now I'm going to go back into burlap, and I'm just going to apply
this all over the underlid, so it can balance the entire eye out. I can't forget the inner corner highlight, so I'm going to go in with seashell. I'm going to pop that
in the inner corners. - [Woman] Ooh! - And all over the browbone. I'm going to intensify
this a little bit more with Smashbox's Always
On Gel Liner in Moody, and I'm gonna line the upper eyelid. I'm trying to skip liquid
liner for this look, so I want it to be really soft. Gonna give my lashes
a nice little squeeze, and then I'm going to use
this mascara from Innisfree, it's their Skinny Microcara,
and look how tiny the brush is. It's literally like a little stick, but apparently they're
supposed to be really good for tiny lashes like mine,
so we'll see how it goes. Hey Jen, what has been your motivation to continue filming slash
working through a creative block? I'm going through one
now and I need advice. Honestly, I go through
creative blocks all the time, and the way I deal with it is
just by powering through it. I feel like, as an artist,
it's important for me to have my practice as a daily thing, and my practice is to create videos. I was watching this interview
by this incredible artist named James Jean, and
he is one of the most like prolific artists out there, he has so much work, and
it's because he paints every single day, even if
he doesn't feel like it. And he was explaining
how our bodies are just mechanical vessels for our mind, so there are going to
be times where our mind just isn't all there, but
your body's still functioning, so you might as well just carry on. Like I've noticed that once I'm on a roll, I just like to stay on that
roll as long as possible. For me it's all about having a streak, and even if I don't feel like doing it, I just suck it up and do it. It's impossible to feel
creative all the time, but it's important to make
sure that you're prepared, so when that spark of
creativity does come, that way you can ride the wave. So now I'm going to just
put on some falsies. These are by Velour, they're
called Girl You Crazy! And I'm just going to pop 'em on my eyes. So now that the falsies are on, I'm going to move on to bronzer. I'm using this one by It Cosmetics. It has like a spectrum of
different products you can use. You have a bronzer, a
blush, and a highlight, but I'm just going to go
into the bronzing section, tap some excess off, and
I'm just going to start warming up my cheekbones. What is the most important
relationship advice you would give on how to keep
a strong lasting relationship? That is a very good question. I would say communication,
and delivery is key. I feel like when you're open
and honest about everything, then there's no room for
distortion or secrets. If I ever have an issue or
if Ben every has an issue, we talk about it, and
the way you communicate is a huge thing as well. Make sure that you're not
coming off like too naggy or your tone is right, also,
make sure it's an environment where you guys are ready to have like a long open
conversation, 'cause sometimes when you don't plan or time things right, it can just kind of blow up in your face. My relationship is definitely
not perfect and it's something that I'm working on as
well, especially the tone. Sometimes when you're upset,
it's hard to control it, so this is advice for both of us really. For blush I'm just going
to use the middle strip, going to dust that onto
the apples of my cheeks. - [Woman] Oh that's nice! - For highlighter, I'm using Fenty Beauty. I just got this, and look what I did. I literally dug my nail into
it as I was trying to open it and (sighs) I was so devastated you guys, 'cause now it just looks so morphed. I'm going to put a little bit on my nose, and on the cupid bow. For the lip color, I'm just
going to go with a nude. This is Dior's Rolling, and it's just like a really gorgeous
moisturizing salmon shade. All right guys, this is
the finished makeup look. I wanted something that
was still very everyday, but just something that popped too. If you guys enjoyed the video,

(high energy upbeat music) - Hi everyone! It's your girl Jenn, and I am
back with a fashion video. I have always been a woman on the go, I just like to keep busy, and sometimes my day is booked up from the morning to the night, and so I thought it would be
a really great opportunity to show you guys how I
keep my outfits poppin' no matter what hour it is. So, I got three closet
essentials that I wanted to show how I transition from day
to the night, so, yeah! Let's get started with
the outfit transitions. So the first essential
I'll be talking about is an everyday cardigan. This one over here is from
my clothing line Eggie and it's definitely one
of my favorite pieces in the collection, because
of its versatility. I really love the color, it's in this really fresh salmon shade and it's kind of like a blushing nude. So here's how I style
this outfit for the day. I've just gone for a really
casual, everyday look. I paired it with this comfy striped top, and then I tucked it
into some white mom jeans and I think it gives it a
really nice relaxed feel. I really like this silhouette, because it's really practical and very forgiving. For shoes, I wore some sneakers. These are from Adidas, and
then I added a white belt to just cinch the look. This is aa really great look for school because of how comfortable it is. I definitely would have worn
this to class in college. Now this is how I transform
the look into something more suitable for the evening. I switched out the light denim
for some black wax bottoms. I decided to keep the striped top, but I added a knot, just so I can show how high-waisted the bottoms are, and then I added a beanie from Team Cozy, because I just wanted to stay a little bit warmer for the evening. For shoes, I stepped into these
studded flats from Azalea, and I think this look would be perfect for a dinner with the girls
or even going into a dive bar. Basically, a casual evening look. Now I'm going to move on to
the second closet essential. You've gotta have a white
blouse in your closet. This one is also from my line. This one's a little bit more daring because of the plunging neckline, but honestly, as long as you have like a crisp white button-down, all the tips I'm going to
give you are gonna apply. For the daytime, I styled the blouse with these two-tone panel jeans. These are from Grlfrnd and
they're just a killer fit. This is made from that hard raw denim, so it just really sucks you in. The slits on the bottom make it easier to show off your shoes. I decided to rock these strappy nude heels to elevate the look. For accessories, I wore my
nameplate that I never take off, and some hooped earrings from Adornmonde. This is an outfit that
I'd wear to a meeting, or somewhere where I want to look a little bit more put together. I know, this is showing some skin, but I think because I work
in a creative industry, it's fine, and it's acceptable. Now let's switch it on
over to the night side. First, I wrap the top in a different way. Instead of a knot in the front, I just made one in the back, and now it looks like a new top. I added a moto jacket
to toughen up the look, and it also adds another layer, since it'll be colder. I accessorized with this baker boy cap, just in case my hair got
greasy throughout the day. I also added these silver
hoops in a cooler tone. They coordinate really well with my heels, and this is just a great edgy look that you can rock to a fun party. For my third and last closet essential, I have a statement coat. This one is in this
really fun gingham print, but I love the fact that it's a blazer, because this is such
a universal silhouette for so many settings. So this is my daytime look. I went for something that looks a little bit more equestrian. I wore the blazer with a
black cropped long-sleeve. It's ribbed, and it just
matches with everything. I decided to go for a denim skirt, because blue denim just looks
really fresh during the day, and it just brightens this
whole dark palette up. For shoes, I wore these black slingbacks, and then I topped the look
off with this wool cap. I love how put-together this look is, but it's still casual, because we've added the denim and the hat combo. I think this is a really great outfit for just going to brunch or
just a day out in the city. Now I'm going to show you how I rock this baby in the evening. First, I got rid of the skirt, and I just button the blazer into a dress. I love that this coat is
long enough to do that, and if you're just wanting
to show your figure more, you can easily throw on a belt and you'll regain your shape. I added some thigh-high
socks for some warmth, and I just streamlined them
with some black booties. The finishing touches are
in my black leather beret, and a statement lip, and now you're ready to take the evening by storm. All right guys, that is
a wrap on this Lookbook. I hope you enjoyed it. I actually had a really fun
time styling these pieces, and thinking of multiple
like clothing combinations. You really get a lot of
wear out of a lot of stuff in your wardrobe, but I feel like, you just gotta challenge
your mind a little bit more and think of all the
options you possibly can. Also, I enjoyed this
because we filmed this with a C-stand in the living room. Most of the times, with Lookbooks, we're just kind of like
driving around in the street and I'm like changing in my car, and it's just uncomfortable. So I really like this
new setup that we have. Please let me know what
kind of styling videos you'd like to see next in
the comments down below. Also tell mem what was
your favorite outfit. I love to hear you guys's feedback, and seeing what you guys like. I want to thank you guys
so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye, mwah! 
(jazzy hip hop music) - Okay, hi, guys. Welcome to part two of the November vlog. I am all spruced up
because I'm heading out. I'm heading out to two events tonight. I'm going to Raye's makeup launch. She did a collaboration with BH Cosmetics. And then after, going
to the Too Faced event. So yeah, got a full night ahead. I'm gonna give Chippo
her little bully stick, and then I'm on my way. Here is Raye's palette. It's actually the exact
same color as my robe. Wow. I really coordinated well with this, geez. Dang, this looks delicious. We are at Too Faced event. And they have McDonald fries!
- McDonald fries! - [Man] Have you seen the dachshund? - [Woman] Oh, my God. It's like throttling the floor, okay? - I am halfway being ready,
but I just made some lunch. This is dak-bokkeum-tang. It's one of my favorite Korean dishes. But yeah, I'm about to dig in. Also, I forgot to mention that Ben is out of town for a total of 10 days. He is in England. He hasn't visited in two years. And so it's been just really amazing and surreal for him to be back. But yeah, that means that
I have the house to myself. I'm home alone. Yeah, I haven't been
home alone in this long. And part of me feels good, because it just really
tests my independence. And it also makes me realize how much Ben actually does for me. For example, cooking, he pretty much takes care of all of that. And then filming. And so, yeah, it's been a good transition because it makes me appreciate
all the things that Ben does. And yeah, I really do miss him. But it's good to get some
time away from each other. When you are in such a long relationship, sometimes distance makes
the heart go fonder. But yeah, I'm gonna eat this. I'm frickin' starving. Oh, my God. I decided to throw in some
broccoli just so I feel better. (jazzy hip hop music) Mm. - The bad Christmas? - I don't know, it's like Willy Wonka. (gasps) Wow. Oh, my gosh, look at our dinner for four for two with Aimee. My God. (sighs) This feels so nice. Isn't that right, Chippo? Hi. (laughs) It feels so rewarding to
just lay down and do nothing. But yeah, I just got back home. Today we went to the
Happy Place exhibition as you saw in the previous clips. It was really cool. A really fun, bright,
positive installation. It is temporary, though. It ends on January 7th,
so if you happen to be in the Arts District and you have tickets, I definitely recommend you go. Right now I just got back
from dinner with Aimee. It was so amazing, again,
to meet up with her. We have been trying to have
dinner for the longest time, but with both our crazy schedules, it's been like a mission to plan. But the stars aligned, and we
met, and it was so awesome. We talked for a good three
hours in that restaurant. Even though Ben's not here, I still love just sleeping
on my side of the bed, because it feels weird
being in the middle. Chippo's taking his spot. Before I go to bed, I think I'm gonna read a couple chapters of The War of Art. My brother gave this to me
for my birthday present. Or it was one of his
birthday presents to me, and I'm excited to continue with it. Definitely going in my faves. ♪ But I like that girl too much ♪ ♪ I wish I never met her ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ Hello, happy Saturday. I'm shooting with Jami and Kaile. Can you see 'em?
- Hi. - Hi.
- Hi. - There you are, and then Keith is our lovely photographer. - Hey. - Hello. And then here's Janice helping out.
- Hi. - But yeah, we are at our second location. Check it out. I know it looks very
decrepit, but trust me, we're gonna make it look very chic. We are at our third location. Keith has found this
really cool tangerine wall. And I'm wearing my little
country bumpkin outfit. (jazzy hip hop music) Happy anniversary. - Thank you. - [Jenn] Here we are at Dae
Bok Jung about to have some, I don't even know what this is called. - [Dad] Huh? (speaking foreign language) Nakji. Nakji? - Nakji jeol pan.
- Nakji jeol pan. - Celebrating my parents' anniversary. Hi. Welcome to our trunk. - Hi.
- This is Vincent. Katie.
- Hi, I'm Vincent. - Hello. - You guys have seen
them in my vlogs before. But basically, we're doing
a little shoot today, shooting Eggie, and then Katie has put her little flair in with her wardrobe. (Katie giggles)
Yeah, it's been awesome. But yeah, we're on our third look now. We're all hunched over. - We're all like, hey. - I'm wearing Eggie, too. - I know, Vince season one.
- Yass! - I love it. (jazzy hip hop music) - Cut that you need to listen to, and then you would be like, and then you could like, oh, actually, I don't really like that, and you're like, oh, I'm okay with that. - Okay, cool. Hey, guys. Today has been a very full one. I didn't get to vlog too much. But in the morning, Amy came over and we filmed The AM with Amy. By the time you're watching
this, maybe it's already out. But we basically talked
about negative emotions and how we deal with them. I felt really good to talk about a subject that I don't really talk
about on my channel. I'm practicing being more
vulnerable on my YouTube channel. And I think it's just hard, because I don't wanna come off like I'm just one-dimensional
and I'm happy all the time. Obviously, I only like
to vlog when I'm happy, because I'm feeling
good and I wanna share. And I don't know. So it was good for us to talk about negative emotions that we deal with. And for me, it was mostly about
stress, anger, and jealousy. Jealousy is something that
I don't really feel anymore, which is something that
I'm really proud of. Because growing up, I was
just so envious of everybody, whether it was their style, or their body, or whether they were funny, or smart. It was a lot. So I feel happy that I was able to conquer that negative emotion. But the two that I wrestle
with are stress and anger. And anger doesn't happen all the time, but when it happens, it ain't pretty. After that, Amy helped
me shoot so many things. I had a lot of campaign photos due today, so it was good to get that done. Then I did some errands. And then the last clip you
saw was me doing a podcast. So I did a podcast called
Perfectly Imperfect with Christine and Regina. And it was also something
very cathartic for me. And it's basically as a subject
about connecting the dots, how we were able to get
to where we are today. And I didn't expect to get so emotional, but you know, that's
another thing I wanna share. I'm a very emotional person. Any emotion that I'm
feeling, it's just raw. And I can't control it, and I feel like I've always struggled with hiding my emotions. Maybe it's a good thing, because what you see is what you get. I can't fake anything. And sometimes I wish I could fake it when I am about to get really emotional. I had a really difficult call earlier, and I started crying on the phone, and I was like, Jesus, get it together. And then on podcast, I was crying. I think I'm just going
through a growing pain phase. I am juggling a lot. Whenever I feel stressed
or anxious about work, there's a part of my
brain that's telling me, no, stop feeling this way. You should be grateful,
and you should be happy that you even have this set of problems. And I think that's what
I'm just trying to deal with right now, because I
am so grateful for my life. Even though I, quote unquote, have it all, emotions are always gonna come. It's like the weather. Some days it's cloudy,
some days the sun's out, some days it's a little foggy. And you can't control it, but you just have to
roll with the punches. For that podcast, I think I got emotional because I was just really
connecting the dots, and every dot that I made, it all kinda stemmed from where I, what my childhood was like. I don't know, I think growing up, I've always had really low self-esteem. It's crazy how much I
still carry that today. I'm realizing I really can't
control what you think of me. All I can do is find
inner peace with myself, and that's what this year has been for me. I'm trying to figure out
the core of who I am, and just being happy with myself. I am confident in certain things, but there is still so
much growth to happen. Talking about my insecurities
and being more vulnerable is something that's really good for me. And so yeah, I think by
the time you watch this, that podcast might be out. It is a long one, I must say. So stay tuned. It feels really good being
home alone, actually. It's reminding me of how
I used to feel in Oakland when I had my own space, and everything I left
it is the way I left it. And I can't blame anyone
if things are dirty, because it's my mess. I freaking miss Ben, but it's also been really
nice to have my own space. It's like the first time
I've been alone in two years. It feels refreshing, but I
think by the time he comes back, I'll definitely be ready for him to. But this has been some good
time to reflect on myself. - [Woman] I injured my
shoulder, this is bad. - You wanna be in it,
even though we're so dark? - We did it.
- We did it. We're so sweaty. - Our first time actually
hanging out, and we just sweat next to each other.
- I know, right? Of course. - [Blonde Woman] That's
the best way, right? - It really is. - Keon, is this where?
- Yeah. (thumping) (coughs) - Morning. Good morning, Happy Thanksgiving. I just made myself a delicious
green tea matcha iced drink. I'm not sure if you're
supposed to have it iced, but I don't care. It is hot, and I love iced drinks, and I think it tastes delicious. Anyway, since it is Thanksgiving, I thought that I would tell you guys some things that I am grateful for. So the first thing that I'm grateful for is definitely my health. I would say that my body
is in fine condition. I can exercise, I can dance, I can eat pretty much whatever I want. When I hear my friends
who have health issues, whether it is tonsillitis, or arthritis, or just any sort of chronic pain, it makes me really feel for them. It makes me check myself, and to never take my health for granted. The second thing I'm
thankful for is my family. I love that we are finally at a place where we could all just be
so open with each other. Even though there is a language barrier, we're still able to communicate. That's what I want to express to you guys. 'Cause some of you guys are like, well, if there's a language
barrier, how do you guys talk? I mix in Korean with English, and so they understand more English words, but they can't speak it, just like I can understand more
Korean than I can speak it. I am also so thankful for the
relationship I have with Ben. Before I met Ben, I didn't really think that marriage was for me, honestly. Kinda weird, but I really thought that love was just kinda about settling, 'cause no one could be perfect. And I have never, I've always been a realist,
and never romantic. And so I thought maybe, I don't know, like when I was younger, I
was like, maybe I'll marry if I want to eventually
reproduce or something, and I would settle for the best companion. Ben just completely
changed my mind about that. It's weird, whenever I get
those comments being like, wow, Ben's so lucky, I'm like, no, I am the lucky one. And lastly, I am so grateful for you guys. I couldn't have asked for
a more loving, dedicated, supportive group of
people to watch my videos. Thank you, guys, so much. Honestly, you guys have helped
with my self-esteem so much. And sometimes when I don't
even believe in myself, I look at your guys' comments, and it truly, truly does heal me. And I wanna thank you
guys so, so much for that, and I'm so grateful. Lastly, I am very grateful for my Chippo. Alright, I am at my old childhood room. Got James playing Zelda. - Hi. - And I also went to the gas
station to get some chips. We've got Chester's Fries, they're a constant favorite, these Munchies Flamin' Hot, Snyder's as per James' request, and Hot Cheetos Oven Baked. These are slightly healthy, so I thought that I would get 'em. But yeah, here's my old childhood room. There's so much stuff in here. - [James] Yeah, it's
like all my old stuff. - [Jenn] Yeah.
(both laughing) Yeah, and all my old paintings. Just eat it, just eat it. (chuckles) - [James] Mm, it's good. (laughing) - I made it. - [Jenn] Yeah, papa made some weird, oh, no, I mean delicious avocado puree.
- Thank you. - It's weird.
(laughing) (speaking foreign language) - Yum, here is my plate for Thanksgiving. There is no turkey or the
traditional Thanksgiving food. We have a nice Korean-style
Thanksgiving every year. (speaking foreign language) Mm. (speaking foreign language) (woman laughing) (game pieces jingling) - 35. - 35?
- 35? No. (game pieces jingling) Alright, what could it possibly be? - It's a size small. (laughs) - [Jenn] Does it mean small? - Oh. - [Jenn] Will you be my bridesmaid? - Oh, yeah.
(Jenn laughs) Hey, can you be my bridesmaid, too? - [Jenn] Yeah, of course. (laughs) (high-fiving) Aw. (laughs)
- Aw. ♪ They cover their heads ♪ ♪ I can't see their faces ♪ - What's up, guys. I am on my way back from the airport. I just got qualified
for Global Entry, whoo. If you don't know what global entry is, it's something that you can apply for, and then you don't have
to wait in any lines. You have TSA Precheck-in, and then when you come back
from a foreign country, you don't have to wait
in customs in America. So I am stoked about that. As long as you have a clean
record, you're pretty much good. But yeah, yesterday's
Thanksgiving was so much fun. It was awesome just getting
to hang with the family. I ate so much food, and I brought back leftovers, too. So I had that for breakfast and lunch. But yeah, I'm gonna go home
now, and just continue to edit. He's back. - I'm home. - [Jenn] Yay. - [Ben] I did miss my girls. - [Jenn] Do you like, (coughs) do you like Chippo's new haircut? - It looks cuter than what I thought. It looks cuter than it usually does. - [Jenn] Yeah, uh-huh. - 'Cause it's usually a
bit like a rat, don't you? - [Jenn] 'Cause her face is cute, though. - Her face is cute, isn't it, Chippo? - Oh, my gosh, Ben brought back so much. Holy cow. Wow, okay, first we have some chocolates. This is my dream. We got Monster Munch. Wotsits, ah! - [Ben] Chocolate Digestives. - Oh, my God. That is so big. (Ben laughs) This is amazing. - [Ben] Look, it's massive. I got some things for the guys as well. - What are these? - [Ben] English choccies, you know? - What's this? Jammie Dodgers.
- Jammie Dodgers. I'm not sure if you've ever had them. - I've never had them. - Bloody lovely. - Oh, my God, yes.
- Some Skips. - Some Quavers.
- Yes. - Some Monster Munch.
- Oh, my God. - Oh, one of the, I noticed there's a
Wotsit hanging out free. Some choccy as well. There's a Wotsit gone loose, so obviously, one of the boxes-- - Popped? - They've popped.
- Ooh. - 'Kay, so we've got to eat them, then. - Hmm.
- Mm. - So these are basically like, like smaller Cheeto Puffs. But they have like a
lovely, fluffly texture. - They're delicious, very similar. I missed you, mm. - [Jenn] The final one. - Oh, my goodness. - [Jenn] I wonder what it could be. - What could this be, huh? (Jenn laughs) Oh, my goodness. Ah! - [Jenn] Will you be my bridesmaid? - I do. - (laughs) Yay.
- Thank you. - Aw.
- Aw, thanks, Jenn. - Okay, so I'm at Steph's place. - Heyo.
- We just finished filming a SippingSista. - I still have some of the first one. - Oh, really? Okay, bring it over. - [Steph] Bring it out, bring it out.
- Oh, my gosh. This one was the crowd favorite, though. - It's beautiful, too. It's very aesthetically pleasing. Cheers again.
- I know. Cheers. Mm, it's good cold, too. - Yeah, it's pretty much just apple cider. It was hot apple cider and whiskey. I mean, you really can't
go wrong with that combo. - No, no. - Apples and whiskey, come on. - When you used to make us hot toddies, it was just whiskey and
black tea and honey. - It was raspberry tea, which is random, but that's all I had at the time. - Uh huh. - Bulleit bourbon. - And agave. - A little bit of agave,
and then I had kumquats. Remember, and I muddled
kumquats at the bottom? - What? - That was in San Francisco. I made that for you one time. - In your apartment? - Yeah. - Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah. - Dang.
- That was really good. I love kumquats, 'cause
the insides are super sour, but then the skin is really sweet. - And yeah, we filmed a SippingSista. We made three holiday
cocktails featuring apples. - Yeah.
- So by the time you watch
this, it'll already be out. So hit the card to check it out. - Thank you, thank you. (laughs) - [Woman] Oh, my gosh,
that's so pretty, girl. - Hello, happy Tuesday. I am at Aimee's house.
- (laughs) Hi, guys. - We're filming our collab video today. I just got some nice slippers. She is styling me in her closet today. I'm so excited. We've got a little set-up over here. We may build it. But yeah, let's get started. (jazzy hip hop music) Cool. Yes! Ooh, oh, it looks amazing. - [Woman] Actually, I think it's like a-- - Fudge.
- Okay, so this is the sponge cake, right? - No, that's the butter cake.
- No? - Butter cake.
- This is the butter cake. Okay.
- That's the vanilla bean cake with vanilla bean butter cream. - Okay, you ready?
- Very excited about this. Yeah, cheers.
- Cheers. (woman laughs) - [Ben] Mm. - Whoa, mm.
- Mm. Wow. - Oh, my God.
- Wow. - [Woman] What do you like best? (jazzy hip hop music) - We're at the Laker game. I'm with Lauren. - Sports. - Sports.
- Sports. - Action. (laughs) Drinks. - Whoo. - It's the biggest game
of the season, I think. It's the Lakers and Warriors. I'm rooting for the Warriors. Who are you rooting for? - I'm just here for the Ryu. - (laughs) For the energy. - For the energy. - And then James, who
are you you rooting for? - I'm gonna commit to the
Lakers, since it's where I live. (jazzy hip hop music) - Good morning, everybody. We are shooting Eggie Drop number three, the holiday collection. I've got my glam squad here. We've got the lovely Mitchell. - What's up.
- Hello. And then David, of course. - What up. We're reunited.
- I know. So excited. - Super excited. - And lastly, here she is, yay.
- Oh, hi. (jazzy hip hop music) - Outfit number one.
- Sultry. - Alright, guys. That is a wrap on this November vlog. I am obviously in a different place, because I'm currently in
New Orleans right now. I'm just gonna sign off here. Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you guys on the next one. Bye. (jazzy hip hop music) 
(calm music) - What's up, guys, it's your girl Jenn and today, we've got a styling video. As a fashion enthusiast, I've gone through so many
different types of clothes but there are a handful
of items in my wardrobe that I just simply can't let go of and today, I thought I
would showcase them to you in this video. All of these items I've styled
in my channel in the past so I thought this would be a fun treat for all you OG subbies out there. If you're a fan of styling
videos or fashion videos, make sure you subscribe to my channel. I upload twice a week or I try my best to upload twice a week but definitely every Sunday. So with that said, let's
get on with the program. First up on the roster, I have to talk about the
American Apparel disco pant. Here they are, these
have gone through a lot and if you were in the
scene from 2007 to 2010, you owned these pants or you
wanted to own these pants. Saro was working at American Apparel and so we got that 50% off discount. Hell yes. But this is how I styled
it back in the day. I decided to wear it with this
really cropped denim jacket from Goodwill. This was literally from
the children's section and then I paired it with a gold lace top that I decided to knot and looking back, that long knot that's just
sitting on the crotch, it just looks very phallic and yeah, I just really liked doing
those knots back in the day and this is how I would
style these pants today. Honestly, I still think
that these pants are fire. I love them. I decided to wear them
with a more muted palette. I wore a fitted floral top that
adds a nice feminine flutter and then I toughened it back up with this oversized Levi's denim jaket. To elongate that body, I wore
these patent boots from Zara and these pants just bring
back so many memories to me and now that American Apparel is gone, rest in retail paradise, maybe these pants will collect in value. Maybe they'll be like a
vintage hipster era piece. Next up, I've got this old Ratt tee and I believe this was
my first vintage piece that I've ever purchased. When I was 17, I kinda
had this phase of metal and when I saw this shirt
at Wasteland on Melrose, I had to have it. It was over $100 and I
remember all my friends trying to talk me out of it being like, Jenn, you're gonna spend your
entire paycheck on this shirt. I didn't care, I just, I had to get it. It was this urge that was within me. It was like a guttural feeling and I remember at the
register, I gave the money and a part of me was sad because I just spent my entire paycheck but a part of me was so happy that I finally had something
that had Ratt on it and I remember going home
and cutting off the neck and cutting off the sleeves
and now looking back, I kinda regret that because I kinda wish it
was just a normal t-shirt and this is how I styled it back in Davis. This was for my how I style band tees. I paired it with some denim cutoffs with this sick gold
studding on the pockets. Honestly, I'm just kinda wondering where those shorts are now but I thought that they
would look really cool when paired with this
huge chunky gold necklace and then I guess to soften it, I added this little crochet
cardigan and some black boots. I think this outfit is still cute actually but maybe I just would
switch out the necklace for something a little bit more demure. Flashback to the now, this
is how I styled it today. I decided to style it in
more of a rockabilly style if you will. I pulled the tank down to make it look like
an off the shoulder top then I tucked it in to
these gingham trousers. I slipped into some
suede Mary Jane platforms and then for accessories,
I added a cool, kinky belt and a little bandana as a choker. I really love that I
have this piece today. It just brings back so
much sentimental value because I've always worked
really hard for my belongings and this was definitely a milestone for me to own my first vintage band tee. Alright, so my next piece
is also from Wasteland. It's these acid wash denim shorts. These are also vintage and I believe I got these at
the Wasteland in San Francisco when I was 19 years old. They've always just
been a really great fit and I still love an acid wash moment so I haven't been able to let it go. I found this old clip of
me wearing these shorts. I wore the shorts with this
cute floral crop top tank and then added this western belt along with this concho hat to accessorize. I think this outfit is still super cute. You go, young Jenn. So this is how I style the shorts in 2017. I went for a light blue theme and paired the shorts with this off the shoulder ruffly blouse and I used the same belt as my last outfit because I couldn't find
my white one, sorry, then I just wore some nude mules to let the rest of the outfit shine. I always bust these shorts
out in the summertime. I feel like that 80s bleach
look looks great in LA heat. So we've got another band tee and this is one of my prized possessions. It's this Pink Floyd tank. I got this at the Rose Bowl Flea Market I wanna say when I was 20 years old. I remember that summer. It was super hot and we came to his vendor who just had huge mounds of clothing like just piles of clothing
and it was all dirty and I remember just like flinging through trying to find something and there was dirty underwear in there. It was really gross but when
I landed on this, I was like, I couldn't believe my eyes and this top was actually a
huge t-shirt which I wish I had, I just wish I didn't cut it but I saw this, my heart stopped. It is double sided so it's two tees in one and I remember when I
was going to the vendor, I had like a pile of five things and I was just trying to play it cool as if I didn't know the value of this but yeah, in the end, I got it for $6 and this is an absolute gold mine to me. This is how I styled it in 2010. I wore it with a vest from Forever 21 and then a maroon skirt that
was also from Forever 21. At the time, I worked there so I just had a lot of clothes from there. We only got a 10% discount though so that was not very fortunate. Anyway, I decided to wear it
with these buckled sandals and I always wore socks with these sandals because these sandals
were so uncomfortable. If I didn't, I would get blisters and that's how I made it work. So this is how I would style it today. Instead of being all over
the place with color, I decided to let the blue
really shine and pop through. I added this plaid faded
print vest to layer and to make the outfit look a
little bit more interesting. I tucked in the tank in
this killer buckled skirt and then I wore these
thigh high sock boots from Style Nanda. To accessorize, I had to throw on a beret because that's just what
I like to do these days. To this day, Pink Floyd still remains one of my favorite bands of all time and Dark Side of the Moon changed my life. That album changed my life and I know it sounds really cliche to say but it's the truth. I remember I was 18 when I first started to really listen to the album and there's this one
distinct memory I have with me and my friend
listening to it in my car and we were in a parking lot and we were just looking at all the lights and the song Time came on and we were really focusing on the lyrics and we were just like, what? It's about the concept of time and how when you're younger, it feels like you've just
got all the time in the world and you're almost like bored and then when you're older, you're just always rushing to find time and by the time you know
it, you're freaking dead. So yeah, definitely check out the album. This is so funny. I look like Pink Floyd's
number one fan right now 'cause I'm wearing two t-shirts right now but yeah, these are both vintage
but nothing beats this one because I actually had
to really really fight and dig for it. Moving on to the last item, here I have this red plaid blazer. This is from K-Styleme and
this is an online Korean store that I used to work with all the time. I love their products. Things were quality, things were lined but yeah, every time I
wore this, I felt powerful, I felt like a boss and I just
loved this red punchy color. This is how I styled it back in the day. I wore the blazer with a lace button down and then some high-waisted black shorts which is like a classic and then I rocked a little
beret and some Mary Jane pumps and honestly, I would wear
this outfit in a heartbeat and it was a little challenging
to style it not in that way because naturally I just wanna
wear a beret with this blazer so let's fast forward to today. I styled the blazer in an all red outfit and I just went super bold with it. I paired it with a red top from LPA and then this awesome circle printed skirt that's giving me total mod vibes. I wore nude heels for a safe bet and some dangly little gold earrings. I just love this look and
how unapologetic it is. I'm still on a search for matching bottoms that would go with this blazer. It would be my dream to
make this a matching set. So if guys ever see like a
red tartan pant like this, hit me up 'cause I need
to complete this suit. So those were all the outfits and five pieces that
I just can't let go of from my wardrobe. If you would like to comment down below and describe a piece that
you just can't get rid of in your closet, please do. I love reading your comments. It's like one of my favorite
things to do after I upload but yeah, if you guys enjoyed the video, please hit the Like button,
subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. (calm music) 
- Oh my God, I can't
believe it's already time for you guys to start
heading back to class. I know it's really depressing
that summer break is over, but you know, starting a brand-new year in college is actually pretty exciting. It's a chance for you to
reset and start fresh, and in this video I've styled five outfits that I would march into my classrooms. If you enjoy Lookbooks,
hit that subscribe button so you don't miss a single video, and with that said, let's
get started with Monday. The first day of school always
gave my stomach butterflies. It's generally a chill
day where the professor just hands out the
syllabus, and you get just get a feel of who's in your class. That's why I went for this casual look that still feels put together. I'm wearing this thin, patterned blouse, and tucked it into these
sequined denim shorts. Then I slipped into my comfy suede Mules to tie in the blue hues of the look. (upbeat music) Moving on over to my Tuesday look, I went for something a
little bit more moody. I'm wearing this
all-black number but added a splash of color with
my Dead Kennedys tee. I love rocking band tees,
because if someone loves a band too, then you guys already
have something in common and it's an instant connection. To spice it up, I've added
this interesting lace top underneath to layer, then
I streamlined the look with my black skinnies and black boots. (upbeat music) Yay, it's hump day, and I'm wearing the most comfortable outfit of them all. I'm rocking my big old
checkered top from Japan, and I chose to go pantless. Wearing huge shirts as dresses
is like my guilty pleasure on days where I literally can't be bothered to make an effort. I put on fishnet stockings
to add a nice texture to the look, and then
slipped into my favorite sneakers of the moment. (upbeat music) This is my Thursday look and quite possibly my
favorite outfit of them all. I'm wearing these sick
custom overalls by Kaemi. And these illustrations are
hand-painted by the Aaron Kei, and I just love the
little details he added. I feel like it really
spruces the overalls up and gives them new life. Underneath, I wore this
beige turtleneck top from American Apparel, and then carried on with my Vans from the previous look. (upbeat music) It's finally Friday, and I saved the most polished outfit for the last. I'm channeling my inner
Gossip Girl with this outfit, and I'm just loving
how scholarly it looks. I picked out this cream satin blouse with these amazing ribbons on the sleeves, and then paired it with this
tartan skirt from Related. (upbeat music) So that is a wrap on my
back-to-school Lookbook. This is definitely geared
for the college student, so if you're in high school
and you have a dress code, I'm sorry, just pick and
choose what works for you. These videos are meant to
be a source of inspiration, not just like a carbon copy. So if you can't wear shorts, definitely wear something that's longer. If you can't wear sleeveless tops, wear something with sleeves. Just, you know, adhere
to what works for you and what you need to do. I just wanted to emphasize the beauty of dressing up for yourself. Every time I upload these
like back-to-school Lookbooks, I get like a handful of
comments of people saying like, who wears that to schoo? Or why do you look so dressed up? It's a choice, and when
I was going to college, and even in high school,
I loved dressing up. I realize that when I feel
confident in my outfit, I feel confident in my classroom. And feeling good and
comfortable in the classroom is what really helps
you absorb information. And for me, that was to
feel good about my outfit. A lot of people are
scared to truly wear what they wanna wear because
they care what other people think about them, and I
know it's like a tough pill to swallow, but the sooner
you wear whatever you wanna wear, the easier it becomes. Remember, college is
such an exciting time. I know it's easier for me to
say because I'm already done. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Please write in the comments
which outfit was your favorite. And let me know when you
guys start school, too. I feel like everyone
starts at different times, but it's like generally, end of August to end of September. So good luck with your studies, work hard, absorb as much as you can
and learn as much as you can. Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. School, studying, knowledge. ♫ Ooh-Ooh-Ooh, it's something ♫ You and I 
(smooth music) - Hello, everybody! It is December 1st, here
I am in New Orleans. I am here for vacation
with my brother and Ben and I'm so excited to just relax and spend some time with them. So, back in September, for
my brother's 30th birthday, I gave him a roundtrip ticket
to anywhere around the U.S. And we decided to pick New Orleans because we've never been here
and there's just so much of the United States that
we haven't explored, so, yeah, we're finally here. This is our Airbnb. I will give you guys
a tour in a little bit but right now we're
gonna go grab some dinner because we're starving. Hopefully we're gonna get some seafood. (smooth music) Oh, that's good. So we are at the oldest
bar in the United States. - [Ben] Purple. - [Jenn] Yeah, I got a purple daiquiri. - [Ben] We were warned about
this from our Uber driver. - [Jenn] Yeah, he said
that a lot of people black out from this, so. - What Jenn got.
- Yeah, of course. Good morning. Here is our breakfast. I've got a veggie omelet. James got the-- - [All] Chicken and biscuits. - And then Ben.
- Steak and eggs. - Steak and eggs.
- It is 12:14. This is our first meal of the day. We're absolutely starving.
- Yes. - And the excitement, I'm hungover. (laughing)
So this is gonna help. (upbeat music) ♪ I think about loving you ♪ - Cheers, yay.
- No more hangover. We have a Camembert here, we have a Gouda, which I hear is very good-a. And we have a Manchego, Manchego. ♪ Loving you ♪ (smooth upbeat music) - [Jenn] All right, the
fried oysters are here. They smell delicious. ♪ I think about loving you ♪ ♪ I think about ♪ - Good morning, it is Sunday. Eating a very large salad
for breakfast because we've been having a really
gnarly weekend of crazy food. So, gonna throw some health in here. We're at a vegan restaurant called Seed. - It's really good.
- And it's just right across the street from our
Airbnb, so very convenient. ♪ Loving you ♪ - All right, we made it
to the swamp in one piece. That was so convenient. - It was so easy. - Real easy.
- Yeah. They picked us up and now we're here. - Now we're here by the water. It's very nice, lovely day.
- Mm-hm. I think this is the beginning of the swamp but it just looks like a really nice dock. There's an airboat that
we will get on later. (smooth upbeat music) Good morning, it is our
last day here in New Orleans and I realized that I didn't
even get to show you guys the Airbnb that we stayed at. It was lovely, it felt very central. But yeah, I'll give you guys a little tour of the space before we head out. Over here we have a lovely living room. Over here is the kitchen. We did not cook at all but
we did eat a lot of chips. We have the room that Ben and I stayed in. - Hey, guys. - [Jenn] Ben is packing up shop here. - [Ben] Been a lovely time. - And then over here we have James' room. Hello!
- Hi. - But yeah, this is the
apartment that we stayed at. It was so wonderful, very
clean and comfortable. I think we did a really
great choice in the Airbnb because we were just really happy and every time we got back home,
it really felt like home. We are gonna pack up all our things, we're gonna go for breakfast. Unfortunately, I got a little cold. The sniffles are in full force right now. It is not fun. (smooth jazz music) All right, we're all
sitting down at the table. Got Ashley. (smooth music) Currently on a hike with Cheeki and Ellie. Looking at the beautiful sunset. - [Man] For a milestone we're going to reach and meet this year, so. - Hello, everybody, happy Monday. I feel like I have been vlogging a lot but I haven't had a chance just to sit down and explain and process
everything that has happened, so I'm just going to
backtrack a little bit, talk about my New Orleans trip
because that was incredible. I loved the fact that I got to travel with my brother and Ben, two very close male figures in my life and it was just a freaking amazing trip. Everything felt effortless
and I loved that we all contributed equally, whether it was getting the Uber or finding
out a cool restaurant or arranging the swamp tour. Me and my brother are so
similar and it's crazy, 'cause I never thought that
we would be this close. And this relationship
was not always like this. I don't want to get too into it, but, basically, when we were younger, we hung out together every single day, we were best friends, and
then middle school happened and then we just stopped
talking until college, until after I graduated college. That was a big gap to just not
be speaking with your brother so I'm glad we're past that phase and we're at a good terrain now. It's awesome getting to see Ben
and James just bond as well. We all just needed some more quality time and New Orleans is such
a freaking great city. It's so underrated. The food is amazing, the
people are incredible, and just the architecture
and the community is just so lighthearted and resilient and I just really, really love New Orleans. If you haven't checked it out,
I highly recommend you go. And then we went to the
Refinery29 29 rooms installation. That was such a cool exhibition. Basically, Refinery29 does this every year but they create 29
different installations. So, each room signifies
something different. If you love the arts, I highly recommend you guys go check it out. And then, of course, there
was the Unforgettable Gala. This was my second time attending and this experience was completely different, because last year, I was presenting and I was presenting the last award, so I was so nervous
about going on that stage that the entire time I was just like I was there but I wasn't present because I was so, like, anxious about, you know, speaking in front of everybody. So this time around, I was just a guest. And it was just so inspiring being around the Asian American community. After that gala, it reminded me that it's beyond just showcasing
your fashion, style, and beauty. This is about visibility and the fact that growing up as an Asian American woman, there was nobody that looked
like me in traditional media. So it only makes sense that growing up I felt like I couldn't do anything. I felt powerless, I felt like the great opportunities in entertainment was only for people that
looked a certain type and I knew that I wasn't it. And the fact that Asian Americans are pressing the boundaries and living our passion even though the traditional Asian parent
tells us to go the safe route, they tell us to be a doctor
or a lawyer or a scientist or something, or engineer. That's what the traditional path is and so to be able to do what I want to do and express the way I want to express myself is so empowering and that night was just incredible. When I woke up today, I
felt pretty overwhelmed because there were a lot of
things to do on the agenda. The holiday drop for Eggie
is happening next week, so I have been preparing
for all of this for the entire month, so I'm
just at the final finish line and then I need to head to the gym because it's just good for my mind. I have been going to the
gym pretty regularly but I haven't made it a
habit to bring my camera. It's because when I'm there, at the gym, I already don't want to be there and the last thing I want
to do is, you know, film. But yeah, I've been going to the gym and every time I come back from the gym, I feel like a new person, so, it's really for my mental health. (smooth music) Hello, everybody, happy Tuesday. Currently in traffic on
the way to the West side. Today is the Eggie holiday lifestyle shoot and I'm really excited because we got Mel Joy to be the face of it. I'm so excited. This shoot is gonna be in Abbot Kinney and so it's gonna be really awesome and hopefully there's
some festive things that go along with the collection. Also, I got my nails done yesterday. They're in this really cool,
rose gold, chrome finish and I really love it. Normally I don't go for stuff like this, I just kind of go with something natural or just basic because I, I don't know, I just want
my nails to look polished, but I don't really care about designs, but since it's the holiday season, I thought I would splurge a little and get something a little special. All right, we are shooting
Eggie Holiday Three Collection. We've got Mel's outfits over here. She's got kind of more of like
a street style fashion vibe, so everything's casual
and there's pops of color. - This is such good quality.
- Thank you, yeah. - What is this?
- So this is the Canon T3i, I threw on a wide-angle lense, but yeah.
- This is great. - Thank you.
- Hi, everyone. - Yeah, this is Mel. - We're here in LA, about to film. I'm so excited, the clothes are so cute, make sure to check them out. - Thank you.
- They're so adorable. - Yeah, she's wearing the
lateshift trouser here, it looks so sick.
- I love this. - So she's gonna be the face
of Holiday Three Collection and she's from the Bay Area.
- Yeah, Bay represent! - Hi, Mochi Bear. I never showed this to
you guys, but I bought, oh, you can see me through the screen. But I bought the Nintendo Switch and it was supposed to be for me and Ben, but it turns out I'm the
only person playing it. Also, because I'm hogging
it most of the time because I'm playing this game. It's called Stardew Valley. This is my little farm and
it's kind of like FarmVille but way better and there's just a lot
more things you can do. So right now I am on my second spring and these are all my crops. I've watered all of
them and I got my horse. If you don't have a horse,
you gotta get on that because it's freaking amazing. You get to go around
the town so much faster. There's my dog. My dog's name is Chippo
in this game as well. But basically, this is my
little world that I go into because sometimes when I
just want to take a break, it's hard for me to relax and watch YouTube or go on Instagram
because sometimes it just feels like
work, so, when I come on this lovely farm, it's
like my own little escape and it's very, very, very relaxing. A little guide for more comfort
and joy by Courtney Carver. When I think about all the times I was wrapped up in the pursuit of more, it's clear that I really did want more. I just finished reading for a podcast called Optimal Living Daily. It is one of my favorite
productivity podcasts. So, every day, the host, Justin Malik, he reads out blog posts about minimalism and productivity and Amy reached out and
asked me, or asked him, if we could both read for his podcast 'cause it's always been a dream of mine and now it happened,
so, I'm really excited. I will definitely let you know when that, or when my episode comes out, I'll blasting it on my social media 'cause I'm really excited about this. So Ben just made some cod,
is that what this fish is? - [Ben] Yeah. - [Jenn] Some cod, green beans,
and some roasted potatoes. I've got some wine and the
Great British Bake Off. (smooth music) All right, for dinner tonight,
Ben is making veggie burgers. Yum! - We've got enough in
the fridge but we just thought we'll go for a
nice, simple veggie burger. Gonna get some sweet corn,
some tomato, some onion. - [Jenn] Oh, and, yes,
red onion, my favorite. - Got some raw as well.
- I know. - [Ben] So that your breath is lovely. - [Jenn] I know, well I'm only
smooching one person tonight. - That's true, then I'll be
stinking of onion too, so. (laughing)
Together. - [Jenn] Also, I didn't
get to vlog this but Ben and I spent last week decorating the inside of our home. It looks fairly festive. - [Ben] Festive enough. - Festive enough, yeah.
- There needs to be more. - [Jenn] I wrapped this
lovely tinsel garland all across the stairs. I feel like it has a really
nice holiday element to it. And lastly we have our
festive Christmas tree. We got this at Home Depot
and, yes, it is fake-- - [Ben] Get over with it. - I mean, I've always had
a fake Christmas tree. Tomorrow is actually a really huge day. We are shooting the Eggie Holiday Lookbook and it's gonna be with LR Creative, so I'm really excited to
be teaming with them again because I feel like
they are such creatives and I love that we're all not
afraid to try something new, so this one's gonna be
pretty interesting and fun. Oh, wow, where do I get started? Is this my red onion? - [Ben] Well, you
shouldn't have all of it, so I was just gonna
have whatever you don't. - Oh. I would eat all this red onion, though. - Once when me and Jenn were first dating, she sent me a photo of a
burger or sandwich she made. - Yeah.
- And there was literally half a block of red onion in there. - And then I took a bite into
it and I was like, "God." Good morning, everybody,
it is Thursday at 11 a.m. Today we are shooting the
Eggie Holiday Lookbook. I'm with my crew from LR Creative. It's gonna be a dance party,
it's gonna be real, real fun. We've got a hazer here. Vu, can you walk us through this machine? - So, it's, like, a fog machine. It basically it is, but
it uses different liquid. So it creates more of a atmosphere versus, like, just a thick cloud of smoke. - [Jenn] Oh. (smooth music) - So, basically, fire
alarm all the way up there. We need to turn it off because
we've got a haze machine. Somehow, we need to try and reach it, so, we're getting pillows, plus Trevor, plus me on top, and we're
gonna try and get it. And, first of all,
health and safety people, look, I know, we'll put it back in, everything's fine, it's just a hazer. No fires are going on. This is my crash landing. - You can step on my
back, just don't kill me. - [Ben] Okay. (light music) Yay. - [Jenn] Yes. - This is like one of the most luxurious. (laughing) It's high on the new thing. On the camera, that's not that high. It takes Trevor plus me plus Vu. - How tall are you, Trevor?
- I'm like 6'4. - And I'm not.
- I was-- - How about this? Just behind her like this? How about just like this? I'll do the thing.
- This okay? (vocalizing) (laughing) - [Ben] What is that? - [Jenn] This is Ben's laser. These are Trevor's lasers. Oh my god.
- Oh my god. - It's crazy. Whoa. Oh my goodness. The shoot is finally over and
it couldn't have gone better. It was incredible and I'm stoked. It also involves a lot
of dancing and, honestly, if someone had brought
this video idea up to me, like, a year ago, I would've been like, "No, absolutely not, I'm
not doing that," but, this year is the year
where I am testing myself and I want to get out of
my comfort zone because you can't get out of your comfort zone if you don't actually
go out of it, I mean. But yeah, this video's
gonna be really fun. I just want to make a disclaimer that this video is not meant
to be taken seriously. It's supposed to be lighthearted
and just a good time. It's meant to showcase
that you can have a party wherever you are, including your home. So yeah, I hope you guys enjoy it. Anyway, I am gonna get freshened up because Ben and I are going
to Sophie and Si's place. They're having us over for, just, like, dinner and some games. A lot of people are leaving
for the holiday season, so, this is just our last hurrah
before everybody dissipates. So, yeah, it's gonna be great. I am Sophie and Si's place. Look at their beautiful
charcuterie spread. I love this. Hi, Weylie. (laughing) Okay, who goes first? - I will go first.
- Oldest person goes first. - [Jenn] Oldest person. - I have wings but I can't fly. There are more of me
than any other bird on-- - [Jenn] Chicken! - Yes. - Yay! - Boo! (upbeat music)
(overlapping chatter) - [Woman] Freeway, highway! - Yeah. Hello, everybody, it is Friday. So, yeah, I guess that wraps up the first episode of Jennglebells. I shall continue vlogging
for the rest of the month and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (smooth music) 
What's up, jems? 
Your girl is back with a lookbook and this one is all about outfit ideas for 
future dates. V-day is coming up so
I thought that this would be very timely to post If you enjoy watching lookbooks, 
make sure you're subscribed down below so you don't miss any upcoming videos! Alright, so let's get started with 
the outfits! My first date outfit says "Yes" all over it! I think this look is perfect for any outing
where you want look flirty and refined. A long black coat is such a timeless piece
and it tends to elongate you. Underneath I went down with the brown with this 
patterned long sleeve blouse and suede lace up skirt I think this combo melds beautifully together. On my head I popped on a beret for a little
Parisian twist and then slipped into this thigh high sock
boot that makes any pair of legs look killer! This next look is for those who are out
on the prowl This edgy furry number has a touch of
punk and glamour. These days it's been getting pretty chilly so this has been keeping me extra toasty! and don't worry guys, 
this is faux fur. Underneath I went for a vintage tee with some
Old English lettering painted all over it and then coordinated with a "J" necklace
in that same font. I wanted to stay in the tough family so I paired this
with some wax denim and some pointed platform boots 
to stomp around in. Overall I think this is a look that would be
perfect for any concert or show! A little black dress is a must have in every
girl's closet and instead of going for a slinky LBD,
I went for something with a little more flounce. Here I'm wearing a cutesy strapless 
striped tulle looking dress. and I just wanted to toughen it up a little bit
so I added this moto jacket. and I think the end result looks pretty good! These two opposite textures really
compliment each other and I'd probably rock this
look to a nice dinner. Outfit number four is this 
fresh looking ensemble. There's something kind of nautical about this look so I feel like this would be perfect for any events that are close to the water. I'm wearing these wide leg chambray pants
with this sick lace-up detail in the back Since the bottoms are so flared,
I went for a snug wrapped blouse with a bow right in the middle and then I paired it with some 
unusual quirky earrings. For my last look I wanted to rock something 
super casual, but still chic So I built this outfit all 
around this satin bomber I love that it mixes gold and silver together
for a fun mixed metallic look Underneath I wore this white 
tank that I thrifted and I threw on some gray skinnies just
to keep the palette light I accessorized with my Links Front choker
from Mejuri and I kept the rays out
with these sunnies. This look is great for any type of date really Whether it's going for a lunch, movies,
or even bowling. just make sure you wear socks! Alright guys that wraps up my

(upbeat jazz music) - Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn and today's video is
about posing for photos. I know it can feel pretty
awkward and daunting getting your picture taken, but it doesn't always
have to feel that way. This is why I've whipped
up ten of my go-to poses so it just makes life easier
in front of the camera, and if you enjoy videos like this, make sure you're subscribed,
the button is down below, so join the family! All right, so without further ado, let's get on with the poses. So my first pose is called The Lean, and this one is super easy. All you've got to do is
find a wall and lean on it. You can lean on it
sideways for something more laid back and chill, or you
can lean on it just directly for something that's more straightforward. But my little pro tip is
to kind of arch your back and pop your butt out a little bit and have that resting on the wall. It looks really weird from the side, but directly it just slims you
down and makes you look good. Pose number two is called The Crossing, and this is when you
have your legs crossed. I find that when my legs are crossed, the pose looks a lot more
dynamic as opposed to just having my legs just
parallel next to each other. I feel like the pose looks
a little flat that way, but when you've got it crossed,
I feel like it elongates your figure and it's just
more flattering to your body. If I'm not wearing heels, I
always make sure to tiptoe. Those two extra inches goes a long way, and when you are tiptoeing,
you're flexing your legs so it looks leaner and
elongates your body. The next pose is called The Strut, and this is pretty much
like the previous pose, but you're actually walking. So instead of just having
one leg other the other, you're actually gonna give
yourself a little one-two step. I find that when you
try and physically walk, it's hard for the photographer
to capture that moment, so I do a little rocking motion, to try and capture that shot. It looks really dumb in
real life, but I swear when you get the photo, it's
totally gonna be worth it. I find that the most
difficult part about The Strut for some reason is I
always blink when I walk. I don't know why, but just
try and keep your eyes open, or if the eye contact's not happening, feel free to just stare forwards for something that's a
little bit more candid. So pose number four is
called The Coy Arms, and I decided to name it this
because when I do this pose, it kind of looks like you're a little coy, like you've got a little secret, but this is when you have
one hand and you place it on your elbow, your
forearm, or even your wrist. Even the shoulder, I mean
depending on the mood that you're going for
or the variety of shots you want to take, just
basically move your hand all across the opposite arm. One little pro tip is like
to pop up my shoulder, just to give it a little bit
more of an elongated arm, because it looks like it starts from here as opposed to here. So the next pose is
called The Candid Hands, and this is essentially just
keeping your hands busy. One of my favorites is
just a little ear tuck, like you're just kind
of adjusting yourself, kind of caught off-guard a little bit. Just kind of fix your
hair behind your ear even, kind of flip your hair over, keeping your arms moving
and your hands busy, I feel like that always
translates really well in front of the camera. If you're wearing an
outfit that has pockets, definitely use them because
you can just throw your hands in your pockets and you don't
have to worry about posing them, it just looks like
you're keeping your hands warm. The same thing goes with pants pockets. If you have a pocket in your bottom, definitely just throw that hand in, make it look like you're
reaching something out of there, and if you don't have any
pockets but you got some belt loops, those work too,
just throw your thumbs in. Kinda looks a little cowgirly
but I think it looks cool too. If you still can't figure out
what to do with your hands, just throw in a prop. My favorite one is definitely
a drink in your hand, maybe a Starbucks cup or
a mug, a cup of coffee. It just keeps your hands busy, you can throw both hands on
them, take a little sippy sip. It's just about interacting
with something in your photo as opposed to just standing there blankly. Next up we've got the Sit &amp; Stare. One of my favorite places to take photos are staircases because I just
love how relaxed they look. It's very street style. One tip I have is to always keep your feet on different stairs or different steps, because it gives the photo more layers, and it give a chance
to elongate your body, even though you're sitting down. It just looks like you're chilling, or you've had just a really long day, and you just had to
sit down on some stairs and take a breather. Pose number nine is called
The Look Back At It, and this is when your body is
facing away from the camera, but your face is facing
towards the camera, so it looks like you've
just been summoned. Like "oh, you called
for me?" type of thing. This one definitely
requires some synchronizing with your photographer, so maybe have them count down when they're
going to take the photo, so you can move your head. The goal is to have a little
bit of move in your hair, but sometimes it's just
really hard to get the shot, so I'll just literally
just look back this way, and just get the shot that way. When all else fails and
you don't know what to do, just pop the peace sign. This is an easy pose that anyone can do. You can have it directly next to you, close to your face, above, on somebody. I mean, anything goes with the peace sign, it's just, I don't know,
I always think it's cute. This is one of my go-tos when I really don't know what to do. I feel like it's really
light-hearted, cute, and it promotes a good message, peace. All right guys, so those
were ten poses that you can try for your next Instagram post, or just any photo you want to in general. I am definitely not a professional model, and I know that there
are so many other poses that you can do, but honestly
these ten are the ones that I just kinda gravitate toward most because they're
comfortable and easy to do. If you end up trying any of these, make sure you tag me on
Instagram and write down the pose that you used in the caption, I would love to see what
you guys come up with. It's all about having fun
and capturing the moment. If you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you hit the like button so it'll encourage me to film
more of these videos for you. I think for my next photo-taking
series video, it might be different locations you
can take a good photo at. I think I would divide it, I mean, even Los Angeles itself has
so many different backdrops, but yeah, I hope you
guys enjoyed this video, and thank you so much for
watching, bye! (kisses) (upbeat jazz music) 
(whimsical keyboard music) - Today is the day of my lunch. We are at the Lombardi House and check out this freaking barn, guys! Look at this installation, these are all balloons! And, they're weighted perfectly
by some water balloons. So, it's just perfectly balanced. I literally can't believe it. Now I'm just waiting for all
my friends to come through. This is amazing! Absolutely incredible! I'm just, my emotions are everywhere, I couldn't be happier. (laughs) (whimsical music) - Hey! We are all sitting down now about to nom on some freaking delicious food. I'm so excited about this! - This is the menu I picked out myself. A lot of Korean bites, we got kimchi fried rice. (whimsical keyboard music) - [Crowd] Speech, speech, speech! - Thank you guys so much for being here. You guys could have been
anywhere in the world, but you chose to come to my lunch, and I am so grateful. This whole experience has just been just incredibly surreal
and I feel so lucky to know each and every single one of you. Each one of you guys have made such an impact on my life whether you know it or not, and thank you so much for being here. Cheers! (crowd cheers) (whimsical keyboard music) - What a freaking day! It is 9:30 now and I just ordered some food on Postmates. I didn't really know what I was craving, and then I just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna go for some classic burgers and fries and onion rings. (laughs) This place is called Burgerim. I thought it was really funny because it's got my last name in it. But, yeah, today was so unbelievable. I couldn't even believe what happened. It just, everything happened so quickly. Today was one of the
fastest days of my life, and I just feel so grateful for all my friends that showed up and for the support that I received and also reading all you guys' comments about the line has been so encouraging and I can't thank you guys enough. I feel good. I think when I first got home, I was just completely drained because it was a whole group of, I think around, 50 people were there, trying to get every single one of them. It was so fun, but now I just need to just recharge, be alone, enjoy these, these fries. Look, look. They're like the shape of a potato chip, but they're french fries. That's good, that's real good. I bought three burgers, which is really cool. I'm at a point where if 2017
is the year that I peak, I am at peace with that as well. I lived a freaking blessed life, and I am just, I'm just over the moon. Thank you guys so much. I'm gonna enjoy this now and watch my YouTube videos. - [Man] Yeah, whatever. - [Woman] Listen, if Game of
Thrones can mess with time, so can we. - [Jenn] Yeah, that's true. - [Woman] (laughs) - Hey guys! So it is 5 o'clock, I'm
stuck in rush hour traffic, which is very unfortunate. I'm driving back from the Pop
Sugar interview that I did. I did an episode of Pretty
Unfiltered with Kirby, she was so wonderful! What a great host! And, everybody at the Pop Sugar family, so nice, love them. And, it was cool doing
that whole experience, because she asked a lot of questions that I normally don't get asked. For example, like my Korean-American background and what it was like being just Asian-American growing up. The plan is I'm gonna to pick up Cheeky and then I'm gonna drive
over to my parents house. I haven't seen my dad in like three weeks. So, it would be really nice to see him. And, I don't know, I know when I see them I'm
gonna feel a lot better. I think I'm just having one of those days where I just feel kind of off and I'm being way too hard on myself because I know the interview went fine, I just, I'm just like picking myself apart. - [Jenn] (laughs) Cheeky, go play with Haraguchi. (laughs) For tonight's menu, oma has made bokkeumbap! - [Oma] Bokkeumbap. - And then of course, kimchi chicken! (speaks in foreign language) [Oma] Mm-hmm. - Mm, mm. Too much salt. [Oma] Too much salt? - [Jenn] So, this is my mom, wearing the wide trouser pant outfit. [Oma] (speaks in foreign language) - [Jenn] (speaks in foreign language) Very comfortable, huh? - Very comfortable. [Jenn] (laughs) (both speaking in foreign language) - [Jenn] (laughs) - [Dad] (speaks in foreign language) - [Jenn] Oma, model. (whimsical keyboard music) - Wow! I love! Thank you so much! - You're welcome. (whimsical keyboard music) - [Jenn] Ashley, the boss. Rev's outfit is on! Oh my gosh! Looks like a spider. (whimsical keyboard music) - So amazing! (techno music) (speaks in foreign language) - [Girl] Hello! - [Boy] Whenever we had Chinese New Year, my mom will make it for us. - Turnip cake? - We got dumplings. - Chou em bao. - Chou em bao! - Mm. - Oh, Ramen. - Oh, yes please. - [Boy] Bok choy. - Vegetables to make us feel better. - [Boy] Yeah. - Hello birthday girl! - Hello! - It is Stephanie's birthday tomorrow. - At midnight tonight. - At midnight tonight, yeah exactly. - And everyone's here! Everyone arrived all at once. - Uh-huh, promptly. We have a sushi chef. - Two. - Two. - Mm-hmm. - I'm stoked. They already gave us a
little sampler and it was- - It's already gone. - Pretty good. - I literally ate it all, it was me. I had like five pieces. - Oh my God! - I'm hungry! I've been waiting for this moment since- - Slow your roll turbo. I know, actually didn't
eat that much today so I'm ready. My body is ready. - Body is ready. - Yeah! (whimsical keyboard music) ♫ Happy birthday to you! (cheers) - [Boy] Blow em out! - Oh! Shut the fuck up! [Jenn] Yeah! (cheers) - [Girl] What? Oh my god! (cheers) - [Jenn] So, we're having
the Game of Thrones finale party at our house. We got sushi from Steph's
birthday last night. Got some burgers and veggie burgers, sausages. Got Ben's famous potato salad. - [Girl] Potato salad. (laughs) ♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish! ♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish! ♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish! ♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish! [Group] (hums Game of Thrones theme music) (whimsical keyboard music) - Hello everybody! - Hello! - We are here at Delilah's! - In the private room, so fancy! - Private. Cheers! - Cheers! - We're here for a Calpak event. They've invited a selection of girls and we're just here to just enjoy some food, and look at some new products. - Yeah. There's some gifts over there that we can see, you can't see it, but I'm excited to, to open them up! (laughs) - (laughs) - I'm excited to, open them up! I was like, what did
you get Dana? (laughs) - Look at this bountiful feast of ketchup. (laughs) Wait, look how big it is! (laughs) - [Jenn] It's the size
of your hand! (laughs) Oh my God! And, I was thinking about
french fries all day y'all. - [Stephanie] Yeah, she was. - [Jenn] I manifested this plate of fries. - [Stephanie] (laughs) (whimsical DJ music) - Look who it is! - Hi! - Ingrid! - This is our first time hanging
out and meeting each other. Which is so crazy! Like, how have we not met before? (laughs) - Seriously! - I know! - No, but I've been watching you for like, such a long time. You were one of the first
people I saw on YouTube, so- - I know! I remember you as like, one of the people from
like back in the day. One of the first like fashion people that I was aware of, so- - Wow. - I know, it's like two
oldies coming together. - I know, right! And, she's at my house now, so- - I know, it's so crazy! - Hey everybody! This is the most recent version of me and, as I was editing this, I realized that I've done it again. I ended the vlog super abruptly so, giving you an outro. Thank you guys so much for watching. And yes, stating the obvious, I do have bangs now. I was getting my hair colored by Anna and, I was just like, "Should I get bangs?" And she's like, "Yeah, Chaz is right
there, you can ask him." And, it just happened so suddenly, but I'm so happy with the change. I know whenever like
drastic differences happen people really like to put
in their two cents in. But, I just really, really wanted a change and hair just grows out
at the end of the day. So, if you don't like it, it's gonna be back to normal
in the next couple of months. So, chill out! I am vlogging all of September. I've already missed a couple days, but, I think I'm just
gonna do like a, you know, my monthly compilation as usual. Thank you guys so much for watching, and, I will see you guys on the next one! Bye! (whimsical keyboard music) 
(upbeat music) - Hi, everyone! Welcome back to my channel. Today I have partnered with Dr.Jart to show you what I pack in my carry-on. I would say that I travel quite a bit and I feel like I finally mastered down what I need to take with me
when I'm up on that plane. I know that traveling can be so stressful. There's lines, there's
anxiety, but I feel like the best way to calm that
stress is by being prepared. So here are my necessities
for my carry-on. My carry-on is from Calpak and I'm obsessed with the champagne color. I always feel so chic and
sleek carrying this guy around. It also matches my bigger case, and I love that it just comes in a set. So, let's crack that baby
open and get started. This is my toiletry case
that I got a few years ago and I love the first
aid cross on the front and the fact that it's lined with rubber. So when things explode in here, it's okay. I gotta have my little
tub of face cleanser. I like using this small container because it's travel
friendly and I can squeeze whatever cleanser in
here and be on the go. Essence is a must, I've
been using this for my face for the past four years. And honestly I think it's the reason why my complexion is the way it is. I actually need to get
another travel-size bottle because this one's running pretty low. During overnight flights I need some extra loving for my skin. I love packing these masks from Dr.Jart. This is their Cicapair Tiger Grass Nightly Re.Pair Mask. And they're very convenient on the go. You just rip it open,
apply it all over the face and just let it sink in. The key ingredient in this
line is Centella Asiatica, which is also known as tiger grass. It gets its nickname
because tigers in Asia used to roll around in it
to soothe their wounds. This overnight mask is amazing for soothing redness while you sleep and you can grab it at Sephora. I always travel with
my electric toothbrush because it works for a good week without having to charge it. Then I have my toothpaste,
I love this one from Colgate because it just keeps
my breath extra minty. When you're traveling, you
pick up a lot of germs, so I love to pack these little hand wipes in case I don't have any
access to clean water. It's also really great to
use to wipe down your seat. Next up, I'm moving on to makeup. I'm only gonna show you
the bare minimum products that I bring on the flight with me. First, I have my Dr.
Jart Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment. This is an all in one
color correcting product that hides redness and
preps skin for makeup. I like to use this to
even out any red tones on my face and this line
is aimed for everybody but specifically for
those who have redness, rosacea, sensitivity, and acne. I gotta pack concealer,
this one has been my favorite to use at the moment. It's easy to pop underneath
the eyes or around the nose. So that way my skin looks
fresh out of the plane. I can't forget my brows. Until I get them micro-bladed
a brow pencil is a must. My lips always get so dry when I travel. This universal salve
from Glossier is awesome to put on lips and any other areas that get dry like the
knuckles and cuticles. Now, let's move onto important
stuff you can not lose. This is a separate case where I keep all my important travel documents. Like my passport, a pen to fill out forms, medication in case I get
sick, and my boarding pass. I like putting all of this
stuff in one container so that way I'm not frantically fishing around for it in my purse. Okay, now for technology. These are my must have tech gadgets. I gotta pack my laptop, of course. I'm always working,
even when I'm traveling. And my laptop is a must
so I can hustle 24/7. Can't forget the charger,
I've forgotten my laptop charger too many times to count. Speaking of chargers,
bring your phone charger. I like to keep it in
this blue squishy case so it's easier to find. Next up, I've got my vlogging cameras. Here I have my Canon t3i,
this is the main camera that I use my vlogs
with and I don't really have a case for it so I
just stuff it in a beanie. Then I have my Canon g7x,
this is for evening footage and if I happen to carry
a purse that doesn't fit my bigger one, I'll just use this. Headphones, this is
possibly the most important must have for flying. This is my favorite way
to deal with long lines and waiting periods at the airport. Reading on the plane has been my favorite way to pass the time. I love how light weight this
is and the fact that I can carry thousands of books
with me with just one tablet. I highly recommend getting one. I like to stay comfortable
and these are the things that keep me cozy
and sleepy on the plane. There's nothing worse than
getting off a plane with a stiff neck and it's
really hard to get sleep when your neck is
resting on your shoulder. That's why this neck
pillow has been amazing. It keeps your neck nice and snug and honestly when I pop
this on I just knock out. I swear there's always a
screaming baby on the plane or there's someone complaining about the screaming baby on the plane. So, earplugs are a must. Lastly, I gotta have a sleep mask. When I put this on I feel
like I'm in my own dark room and less affected by distractions. Alright guys that is what
I pack in my carry on I will do a separate video on what I pack in my actual suitcase. I wanted to separate the two because it would just be too much information if I put them all together. I would also love to know what you guys pack in your carry-on. If there's something that I missed or if there's something that you just absolutely have to have in order to fly. Leave it in the comments down below. I love reading them and responding. I want to thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. Muah. (upbeat music) 
(alarm chimes) - Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll be showing you what my morning routine
is like these days. I've partnered with Simple Skincare again to show you how I make up
for my makeup every day, in this episode. I'm always super hungry when I wake up, so the first thing I got to do is eat. My favorite breakfast, hands
down, is beans on toast, but not your normal baked beans. These are the Heinz
baked beans from England, so they're more tomatoey and savory, and they're amazing with hot sauce, yes! Then I'll make myself a little
espresso for a pick-me-up and then take a moment to collect myself before the day begins. Obviously, I can't forget
about my little Cheeki. Ben walks her in the morning
for her to do her business, and then I'll give her breakfast. Okay. Now it's time to brush the teeth. I love my electric toothbrush, because it forces me to brush
for the entire two minutes and keeps my teeth clean and fresh. For my face wash, I'm using Simple's
Moisturizing Facial Wash. I really love this cleanser, because there's no harsh chemicals in it, and it doesn't leave my
skin feeling tight or dry. Then I'll go in with Simple's
Protecting Light Moisturizer. This has SPF 15, and I
apply this all over my face to hydrate my skin and
protect my face from the sun. All right, so now it's
time to hit the gym. So late last year, I really started to take my health game pretty seriously, and I wanted to show
you my workout routine. I always start off with
20 minutes of cardio. This can be anything. I used to do the treadmill, but now I'm getting old
and my knees are bad, so I do the StairMaster or the elliptical. After cardio, I'll do 20
minutes of strength training. And this is where you're really melting and burning everything off. And these are a few exercises
I'll do in three circuits. (gentle music) I don't like leaving any
sweat on my skin for too long, so that's why I use Simple's
Cleansing Facial Wipes to leave my skin feeling
instantly refreshed after a tough workout. (gentle music) Now that my training is
done, and I'm showered, I'm gonna show you guys a really quick and natural makeup look that I like to rock on just like an everyday occasion. For my foundation, I'm using Clinique's Beyond
Perfecting Foundation. I just like to concentrate
this under my eyes and any areas I have discoloration. To prevent everything from moving around, I'll seal it with Pony's Blurring Powder. I just started trying
this out a few weeks ago, and I love it. It's such a fine powder and
blurs out any of my pores. For my brows, I'm using
Dior's Brow Styler, and I'm just gonna quickly
shape them into how I'd like. Naturally, I just like to go for something that's a little bit more straight. To slim down the face, I'm
grabbing Benefit's Hoola Lite in this awesome cheek palette. I'm gonna make my cheekbones really pop and bronze the temples
on my face to warm it up. I'm gonna add a flush back
to my face with NARS' Orgasm. This is a beautiful coral
shade that I love applying, especially in the warmer months. For highlighter, I'm
using my recent favorite. I'm gonna apply this
all over my cheekbones and the usual areas to give
my skin a nice dewy look. I'm also just gonna dab some on my eyelids for a light shimmer. Moving on to the lips, I'm
using this color by Hourglass. And this is just a better
version of my lip color, so I'm just gonna splash that on. Now to do something about this hair. I'm gonna show you how I do my braids. This is pretty much the
only braid I know how to do, and I'll show you guys again (chuckles). First, you grab two pieces of hair, twist it and then grab
a little bit of hair on each side and then twist. You keep doing that all the way down until the base of your
neck and then switch off to a three-strand braid, easy. This is such a fast way
to deal with wet hair if you're too lazy to
blow dry or style it. This is a really fresh and quick look that's great for every day, for school, for work, anything really. All right, guys, this
is the finished look, and I hope you guys
enjoyed my morning routine and just getting ready with me. I am so happy to be working
with Simple Skincare again, because they really allow me
to make up for all the makeup that I use on a day-to-day basis. I just feel confident,
because my skin looks and feels really healthy. If you still have not
tried Simple Skincare out for yourself, I highly
recommend that you do. I will leave a coupon
in the description box, so please hit that and
try it out yourself. If you enjoyed this video,

What were your first impressions of each others' boyfriends? - Hey, I like this question. - That's a good one. Huh, I guess I'll talk about Wah first because I technically
knew of Wah before Silas. - Okay. - Because I used to watch guys vlogs. - True. - Yeah, I don't even
remember the first time you guys met in person. Like how did we all meet in person? - Was it at Outside Lands? - Oh, it was. - Was it this year? - No, last year, last year. - He's pretty much identical
to his camera personality. - Yeah. - He's just very friendly, warm person. - He is. - And he just, he really cares for you. I remember when we were outside and he's like "Oh, does
anyone want to get a drink?" - He better. (laughing) Like I'm buying! - And then he's a gentleman, ya know. He treats you right. - Good job, Wah! - Good job, Wah! And for Silas, I remember you as like
kinda like cool, tough dude, got tats and got great style and he's from England and he was a little intimidating at first. I was like okay, alright but now that I actually know him, he's literally the goofiest
person on the planet. He's so dorky and he's just-- - And it comes out of nowhere. It's unexpected. - Right? - You will have a really
serious conversation and out of nowhere, oh sit! (laughing) Wait, could I just ask you, what is this? - What? - Is this a hat or-- - No! It's a basket. I got it from Target. - Oh my. - Alright, I'm going in guys. - Okay, I hope you get a dare. - Yeah, I'm gonna get a dare too. Aww. - Which one of you girls do you think would be the first to be taken by zombies in an apocalypse and why? - [Weylie And Jenn] Oh. - Okay. - I wish I could answer this one too. - Jenn. - I would just die of anxiety and panic - Jenn, I'm so sorry. - It's true - And then probably me. - Really? - Yeah. And then you. - Really? - Yeah, I feel like you'd be last. - Yeah. - No, really? - Uh hm, something about you. - You got big hands, girl. - I got them hands, I do? - You strong. - Back to me. - Okay. - Give me a truth. Give me a true truth. From Kacie Miya, who is your celeb crush? - Oh, this is easy. - This is easy. Okay, if you guys watch my videos... - Oh gosh. - It is Trey Songz. - Oh it is? She loves Trey. A little FYI, Trey Songz is actually from where my parents' store is. - It's crazy. - Oh, he's from Virginia? - 804. - It was meant to be, like my best friend's from there and my future man's from there. Like it was just meant to be. - Okay, let's see. Aww damn it. - Dare! - I didn't want this one! (laughing) (clapping) I was folding this in the basket and I was like I hope
I don't get this one. - Let's see it. - This is from Julia. She says "I dare you to wall twerk." (Sophia gasps) - Wall twerk? - Where you put your legs on the wall? - Wait, what's that? - Oh my gosh. - Oh and you're like hand-standing? - When you're upside down. - Yeah! - Oh my goodness. I can't even twerk on both feet. - I have scoliosis. This will be so bad for my back. - I am very excited to see this. Let's make it happen. - I'm excited! - Help me, wait, I gotta
just tuck in my shirt. - [Weylie] Okay, tuck it in, tuck it in. - [Jenn] It's like Dance Moms right now. You gotta stay up there. You gotta stay up there. - Alright, go! Ahh! Get it, get it, get it, get it! - There's a lot of dares left. - It's time you get a dare. - Uh hm. - It is time. - Uh, if I just get a truth, it could prove you guys wrong. Ahh! I'm scared! Give your phone to someone else and let them text anyone in your contacts. You can't see the message
until after it's sent. - [Weylie And Jenn] Ohhh. - Oh my God. - [Weylie] This is
literally how she texts. - [Jenn] One text at a time. (laughs) - [Sophia] I'm coming, you sent it. - [Jenn] Okay, that's good? - [Weylie] Do we wait for the response? - [Jenn] I don't know. - [Sophia] No, I get to
read it but I don't reply. - Okay, truth. - Oh! - From Andrea. Truth, have you ever lied
about how good one's makeup or outfit looked? - I don't think I've ever lied cause if I don't like it I
just wouldn't say anything. - Wow. - What if they asked? - If they asked, whoa. - And they really liked it. - That's a good point. - I would probably tell
them it looks great because for her to walk out the house, she must have felt good about it. So it's not in my right
to tell her it ain't cute. - Oh, truth. This is from Connie. Truth, what are your biggest pet peeves about each other? - I like this one. - Oh my. - Oh my God But this is tough because with Weylie we just, you know, we're still really, really starting to get to know each other and I still haven't gotten to that level. - There has to be something though. - There has to be something? - And it's not like a negative thing. You know, like some pet peeves
aren't a negative thing. - Something that you could work
on, that she could work on. - She could work on? Really? - Constructive criticism here. - Constructive criticism? - I could think of many, - Oh I know one pet peeve. I think it's I feel like sometimes or okay-- - This is so high school, oh my God! I used to sit with my best friends and okay, like tell me one
thing you don't like about me. - I know, tell me now! - I think sometimes you have to work on putting yourself first. I feel like you're very accommodating and that's amazing to have but I feel like you
sometimes get walked on. - Yes, no, I do, I do. - Because you have a fear of not wanting to disappoint someone and it's a good characteristic but in the end you gotta
really look out for yourself. - That's true. - You know? - True. - I know I am. I'm like the biggest pushover and I've been the biggest
pushover my entire life. Even my dogs know that. - Yeah, they know. - Yeah, and then they bully me. - For you, So So. - Yeah, you know me. - Yeah, I do know her very well now. - Oh my gosh. - For you, your attention to detail is a blessing but also a curse. If you're working on something and something's not completely aligned, that could just ruin your entire day. - Uh hm. - And I feel like you gotta, and this is something I gotta work on too, I think we both need to work on just letting go a little, and relinquishing control. - That's a good one. And you don't have to be
nervous about telling me that. I really appreciate that. That was good. I need to hear that, ya know? - Dare. - Cool. - You guys to show your
last text message you got. You can take my phone. - [Jenn And Sophia] Okay. - My most recent message,
oh it's a group text. - Let's see. Oh it's from us. - It says cool, see you girls soon. That's from Jenn. (laughs) So juicy. - Dare, dance outside on
the sidewalk for 30 seconds. (claps) - So I did a wall twerk and I have to-- - I know! I can't wait for this! - [Weylie] Go Jenn! - [Sophia] Go, while the guy is there! Get it, get it, do some crazy shit! Yeah! (laughs) Do the worm! Do it! Yeah! Okay Cheeki. Cheeki's like Mother. - [Weylie] Cheeki's not liking it all. Oh my God. - Worst drinking experience. Oh, I remember that. I'm allergic to alcohol and I've always been but I would still just do it, you know, and get super-red and itchy but it wasn't until this time which was like the worst experience ever. It was two years ago and I was in New York with my sister and my cousin Andy. We went out to a bar. It was just one drink and from that drink I guess I had a really bad allergic reaction and the, I feel like, right here, my throat, just swelled
up and I couldn't breathe. - Ohh, I didn't even know this story. - Oh yeah, this is why I stopped drinking. Puked all night and I was itching and it was just the worst. I felt like I was going to die. - Dang. - So since then I've like made it a point to not drink anymore and I just didn't ever
really enjoy it to be honest. I'm so good without drinking. And I'll still go out with my friends and I won't drink but I'll still have so much fun, you now? - Ugg, dare. Belt "Part of Your World"

It's more liquidy. - Really? - Yeah. - I feel like this is really acidic. - [Weylie] Do you have milk? You can chase it with milk. - I do have milk.

(upbeat music) - Hey everyone it's your girl Jenn and I'm sure a lot of you guys are curious as to what this title is. Well I have partnered with Revolve to create the ultimate festival beauty box and it's called Jet-Set Jenn. So here is the box in all of its glory. I freaking love the packaging. In this box there are a slew
of high quality products that I absolutely love that I think are festival or travel must haves. This is a hefty little box. So let's open it and see what's inside. So the first item in the box is the Jenn Ne Sais Quoi eye shadow pallette. This is the collaboration
I did with Colour Pop. They're back only for the time being and they're only available in this box. And there's four killer shades inside. The first one is this
shimmery champagne color that goes all over the
lid or the inner corners. The second shade is my
perfect go-to blending shade, I absolutely love it. The third is this nice deep brick red that makes your eyes
look very very striking. And the fourth is this
dark chocolate brown that's perfect for intensifying the eyes. I'm currently wearing all the colors on my eyes right now and
I feel like this look is perfect for any music festival that you'll be heading out to. I'm definitely a falsies type of girl and inside the box I've
got this pair from Velour. I really like how they're there you can tell that I've got lashes on but they're not too dramatic. This is more of an every day, or a bumped up every day type of lash. And I think they're perfect
for music festivals. Personally I love having falsies on as opposed to lash extensions. I've just had a bad experience
with lash extensions. It involved a sty. I like how I've become the sty queen. So I just prefer to have falsies on because at the end of the
day you can rip 'em off and then you can just rub
your eyes and be free. I cannot live without dry shampoo and inside the box you've
got my favorite brand. This is R+CO's Death Valley dry shampoo. I've mentioned this in
my favorites for sure and also in my top 10 products for hair. And that's why I was so
stoked that I was able to get the full sized bottle in this box. This does an amazing job absorbing any oil that's in your hair, and it
doesn't leave a white caste. All you gotta do is kinda
section off your hair, blast at the roots, and
just kinda rub it in with your fingertips, and
boom you've got volume you got texture. If you just want some
extra grit into your hair this is great to do on day one. That way your hair just kind of is a little bit more obedient. And it does what you want it to. Especially for braids. So this is a product that
I've also incorporated in my previous videos. I've got the Ouai's hair oil and I love this because it keeps my hair feeling smooth and protected. So what I'll do is I'll do one pump onto the palms of my hands. And then I'll just kind of rub it onto the mid to end shaft and I feel like it does a great job just keeping everything frizz free and as smooth as it possibly can. You can also apply this
on towel dried hair. Put a couple of pumps on your hand and as it dries it's gonna
act as a heat protectant so that way you can just
go in with your hot tools and not worry. Next up I've got this lip polish by The French Girl. And this is a lovely lip scrub made from sugar, shea butter, coconut oil, and the exfoliation keeps your lips soft and hydrated and ready for any lip color you're about to apply. When you're at festivals your lips just endure a lot from the
elements whether it's crazy wind, the cold nights, and also like the scorching heat. So this polish is gonna
keep your lips feeling kissable and comfortable. I'm a huge fan of
multifunctioning products which is why I am happy to
announce that I've got this RMS Lip 2 Cheek product. This is in a really
fun punchy coral shade. And you can apply it onto the cheeks as a cream blush. And I like to use my beauty blender because I just do not trust my fingers. It always goes on a little too strong so with your beauty blender just use the end and just kinda bump it on there gradually. This also makes for a beautiful lip color. You guys know that I love anything coral, anything peachy, and this
gives a beautiful flush to the cheeks and the lips. Also the formula is nourishing and creamy so you don't have to worry
about your lips crumbling off. So this box wouldn't be complete without a highlighter and bam
I've got three in here in this Stila pallette. This is their Starlight Star
Bright highlighting palette and they've got three
gorgeous shimmering shades. The first one is called transcendence. This is a nice iridescent pink
slash lavender highlighter. The second is called
Kitten and this is one of their most iconic shades. I'm wearing it on my cheeks right now and I think it's perfect, it's shimmery. It's like a shimmery nude, it's great. And the third one is called bronze. This is just great if you
want a sun kissed glowy look. It goes on the skin so beautifully and it's gonna give you
that gorgeous dewy finish. Whenever I'm traveling I love when things are travel sized, one
because they're so functional and two because they're so darn cute. So inside here I've got
five products from Kai. This is an amazing
brand, it smells so good. It's like gardenia and white flowers it smells really light and fresh. So you've got your shampoo and conditioner so you're sorted for that. You've got your body wash and body lotion so you're cleansed and moisturized. And the last one is like a linen wash so in case you soil something or soil a garment you can wash it and it all goes into this
nice little hemp case and you throw it in your
bag and you're good to go. All right guys so that's what's inside my Jet-Set Jenn slash Revolve beauty box. But now I'm also gonna
show you some outfits that I created at Revolve. So I'm gonna roll the look book now. (upbeat music) So I hope you enjoyed this unboxing and also that little
quick festival look book at the end. If you are interested
in purchasing this box or any of the clothing
items in the look book, please open the description box. All the links will be down there. Also I am so pumped for Coachella. It's gonna be in five days by the time I upload this and I am beyond excited. If you guys end up
seeing me at the festival make sure you say hi,
do not hesitate at all. Give me a hug, I would love to meet you. I can't wait to see so many people. There's gonna be
Radiohead, Kendrick Lamar, Bon Iver, who else is playing? I feel like there's a whole list. Lady GaGa has replaced Beyonce, I'm not mad about that, that's also good. So yeah, I can't wait for the festival I will also be vlogging that so stay tuned for that. Yeah, I wanna thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye! (smooching) (upbeat music) 
(electric guitar) - Yay, it's finally summer. It's my favorite season, so
it's time for a Lookbook. I got five outfits that are
perfect for hot weather. Also, if you're not subscribed, please do. Button is down there, so hit it so you don't miss any updates. All right, so let's get into the Lookbook. All black in the summer
has never looked hotter. I rocked black on black
for a cool athletic look. My T-shirt is huge, and I just
love the graphic in the back because it has all these Greek gods. I really loved learning
about them in school so it's just like a little
reminder for my elementary self. I did a little half-tuck
into these runner shorts for a sporty feel. And then I rocked my Vans
to stay comfy in the heat. This next outfit is
ideal for sunny days out. For this look, I'm wearing
some white on white. This little wrapped top from Are You Am I is one of the easiest pieces to style because it just complements anything like this fringed skirt. I love that it has so much movement and swing with each step. And I can like totally imagine myself dancing the night away in this get up. ♫ No, you don't know me ♫ And every little thing
only time will tell ♫ I may be climbing a rainbow ♫ But baby, here goes Summer time always makes
me want to bring out some unusual materials like mesh so I thought it was time to
style this daring yellow top. This was kinda tricky to style, but I thought the best way to
go about it was to pair this with a pleather bra over
it for more coverage. For bottoms, I'm wearing these
denim cut offs to complete this Kill Bill inspired look. So here we have a super
casual summer outfit. I think this is great for everyday. I'm wearing a fitted
mock neck top from Guess. And then I just tucked that
in to my two-tone denim skirt. I love that I'm wearing
red, white, and blue, but it's not giving me
like, too patriotic vibes. I think it's because
of the checkered belt. It just breaks apart the
colors really nicely. My last outfit is elegant and flouncy. I love wearing more color
as the weather gets warm and I think forest green
just really complements my olive skin tone. I love that this
off-the-shoulder top has straps so that you don't have to worry about fumbling with the fabric or
constantly pulling your shirt up that's always annoying, so having those straps there are key. ♫ No, you don't know me well ♫ And every little thing
only time will tell All right guys, those were
five of my summer outfits. If you want me to do more
summer styling videos, please let me know in
the comments down below. Or if there is like a
certain fashion trend you want me to style, write down below. Also, if you couldn't tell,
I got a new background! This is my new office and uh! These shelves from West Elm
took forever to get here, but I think it's all coming together. I can't wait to show you
the rest of this office. That will probably be in
my like June monthly vlog. But I can't wait to give you guys a tour! It's all slowly coming
together, finally, at last. I hope you guys have a beautiful day and I'll talk to you guys in the next one. Bye! Mwah! ♫ I'd like to make it with you ♫ We can make it if we try ♫ I really 
- Hey, everyone, it's your girl Jenn, and today I have a fashion haul for you! I just got back from
Tokyo a couple days ago, and dude, the shopping was incredible. Ashley and I went to
Harajuku and Shinjuku, and we shopped for,
like, six hours that day, and needless to say, that was one of the longest shopping trips
I've done in a while, and so I wanted to show you the loot. If you are a fan of hauls like this, make sure to subscribe to my channel, hit that button, become a gem today, and with that said,
let's jump right into it. So I'm gonna start with tops first. Here is my first one. This is a gorgeous off-the-shoulder top in a nice slate color. It's got this great ruffle detail all along it, and so it gives it just like a fun, fresh, flirty vibe. Since it's so cropped, it looks great with high-waisted things, and I recently posted
this on my Instagram, but I couldn't tag the brand, but I got this at La Foret in Tokyo. My next item is also from La Foret. It's this black crop top with this fun athletic stripe right down the center. It's got a cool metal ring detail, and it's on a zipper that functions, so you can bring it up or
down wherever you please. And it's just funny that
I even have to call out that the zipper works because there have been a number of
shirts that I have purchased where the zipper is purely for
aesthetic and not function. Next up, I've got this graphic
crop top from Stylenanda, which is probably my favorite store ever. But this is a white spaghetti strap top, and it's go the graphic "EE agency "Makes a Great Trips!" I don't know why, but I just love when things have improper
grammar and spelling, especially on clothing. It's just, I don't know, it's
just a nice little touch. My last top is this huge,
oversized checkered top that I'm definitely gonna
be wearing as a dress because it's long enough to do that. I feel like checkers have been
the "it" print of the season. I know Givenchy just had
checkers in their collection not too long ago, and
I feel like that's what made it all surge back, but either way, this is a really fun way to
showcase black and white, and it's a really fun nod to the Ska era. So now I'm gonna move on to bottoms. I only got one pair of
shorts, unfortunately, and they're these ones. They're high-waisted, they're black, they've got red stripes on the side. They also have this fun metal
detail on the side where I guess you can hook things, but I don't see myself
hooking any time soon. But yeah, they're in a nice,
breathable cotton fabric, and personally, I just love the way red and black have been looking together. Before I would think,
oh, that's a little Goth, but I just have been really enjoying this combination lately. I also bought a pair of trousers. They're these black high-waisted ones, and the fit is just perfect. I really love shopping
in Asia because for once I'm considered normal size and not petite, so these just fit better. But these are so cool. They're like a nice menswear work pant, but they've got an edge
because they have this amazing metal link all across the sides. I just think it's like a
really cool combination or blend between business
professionalism and punk. Now I'm gonna move on to
some accessories that I got, starting with this checkered belt. And yes, I got this checkered belt and that checkered top at the same time. I got a little carried
away, but I don't know, I'm just living for this trend right now. I think accessories are
a really easy way to, you know, test out a trend
if you like it or not because it's very low-risk and just easier to incorporate. So this is the other belt that I got. It's this yellow one with
grommets all around it. I love the fact that I can wear this with high-waisted things,
mid-rise, low-rise, dresses even. Because of the studs, it
gives me the flexibility to wear it in whatever size that
I want and what's needed. I just grabbed a bunch of
statement belts because they can really just be the
cherry on top of an outfit. I couldn't leave Tokyo
without buying a hat. Here is this cobalt blue beret, and it's just a divine color. I absolutely love it. It's like a nice, good primary blue color, and I guess I'm just on the hunt of getting berets in every color, and I guess blue is checked off the list. I feel like these days I've been wearing a lot more neutral colors, so I feel like this is a really fun way to add a pop of color. For example, I'd wear
this with my outfit now. I think it looks great! Moving on to jewelry,
I got these two pieces at the same place. The first one is this barbed wire choker. I really like the fact
that, with the clasp, you can do it as tight or
as loose as you'd like. I just, I don't know, I've always been attracted to barbed wire. I think there's something
very edgy about it, and I just love me a good
piece of costume jewelry. So here I have another necklace
which is also inspired by the punk rock era. I just think little elements like this can really toughen up a look. Like, I feel like the 13-year-old me would've loved these items,
and it's just funny how fashion tends to recycle itself. Oh my, these are also
functioning handcuffs, so I could even handcuff
Chipo if I wanted to. But I wouldn't, but I could. My next item is hands-down my favorite thing that
I purchased in Tokyo. They're these oval Ray Bans with this cool rose gold mirrored effect. I had to do a double-take
to make sure that these were actually by Ray Ban, because I've just never
seen this style before, especially created by them. And I just, I freaking love it. It totally has late 90s millennium vibes. I feel like Alia would've worn these. These are my first
sunglasses in this shape, so that really excites me. I feel like these days for sunglasses, I'm trying to just find something that I've never seen before, or at least that I don't already have, and these just take the cake for me. Lastly, I got a few beauty bits. These are both from 3CE which
is Stylenanda's cosmetic line. They had a physical store there, so I was able to try everything
out and swatch everything. So that was amazing. I picked up this yellow eyeshadow. It's in the shade Yolk,
and I have just been dying to experiment with yellow eyeshadow, and this was just my
chance to finally do it. I'm wearing it on my eyes right now, and surprisingly this
is a really easy color to incorporate on my face, and so I'm definitely gonna be doing a makeup tutorial on this. I promise, I seriously swear. I know I missed last
month's face of the month, but I'll have one this month, I swear. Then I grabbed this liquid lip color. This is in the shade Tamed, and it's in this nice, nudey salmon shade, and I think it's a good nude on me. I am also wearing this right now. If I'm gonna be real, the
formula's not amazing. It's very dry, and it
leaves a weird white film after you wear it for a while, but I don't give a damn! The packaging is so cute, and I feel like the shade looks really good
for two or three hours, and then it just goes downhill from there. It just requires a little
bit more maintenance, but if you're willing to put in the work, then I would say get it. All right, guys, those are all the items that I got in Japan. It was definitely a really short trip. I was only there for three
days and it was for work, but I tried to vlog as much as I can, so all that footage will be
in the June monthly vlog. I definitely wanna make it a goal to go to Japan for at least a week next time, and then spend a week in Korea. That's like the dream, and I'm definitely gonna try and make that happen. But anyway, if you guys enjoyed the video, please hit the like button,
subscribe to my channel, drop some love in the comment section. I would love to read about your day or just what's going on with you. Also, this is a new background because Ben and I moved a week ago, or a week and a half ago. But yeah, the move went super well. We're pretty much all unpacked, but my office needs a lot of work, and also the closets, because
we just need to have more, it just needs to be more secure, because right now all
the rails are sinking because they can't hold that much weight. So yeah, I'm just waiting on, like, three wardrobes from Ikea. That's gonna be very fun to build. But other than that,
once that all comes in, I'll have my life in order, everything will be organized and then we will shoot a home tour for you. So those are all the
updates that I have for now. I am wishing you a beautiful day, and thank you for watching. Bye! 
(upbeat jazzy music) - You see a difference? I'm just putting, like, a
ton of texturizing spray. This is Drybar's Triple
Sec, this is my favorite. Hello, hi, here I am at Toronto. I feel like I've just created,
like, a smoke of hairspray but I'm staying at The Drake Hotel. This is actually the exact same room that I stayed in last year when I came. So it's like a little bit of just a lot of fond memories spilling back in. But a last year I didn't vlog, so this time I'm gonna change that. So, yesterday I came in
around, like, 8:30 p.m. I am here in Toronto for a video shoot. I am so freaking excited, this is something that Dani
and I just randomly planned like three weeks ago at my place. And now it's here, it's happening. I'm gonna go get some breakfast
downstairs because the in-room dining service has been busy for the past 30 minutes. So I'm just gonna go
down the stairs myself and then head on over to the studio. (smooth music) ♫ Groovy, groovy We're having lunch at La Cubana. This is like one of the cutest little restaurants I've ever seen. The color scheme is wonderful. I got the veggie plate. It's so healthy. Okay, let's dig in. All right, so this is
our last scene of the day and probably our favorite
because of that orange TV, which they have spray painted
and it still functions. It's amazing, I love it. Well done, team, thank you so much. Hi, guys, I am back in my hotel room. I'm sitting like this because I'm not wearing any pants, TMI. I love, love, love, love the
team at Kastor and Pollux. Sabrina, Emma, Leah, and, of course, Dani. I love them so much and today just was, it just couldn't have gone better and I'm very, very happy. It's all just, like,
starting to sink in now and it feels amazing. I've always had trouble processing things, like, I can't be excited for something until it actually happens. So, for example, like, let's say I'm going on a trip to Japan. Like, I'm not gonna be excited until, like, I'm in the plane, sitting down, and we're taking off and, like,
we're about to go to Japan. Like, that's when it all hits me. So, I feel like with the launch
of my project coming out, it's finally, really
starting to feel real. Because here I am, in
Toronto, filming this, and it just, it just feels so surreal and I feel so grateful to
have these opportunities. So, yeah, I've been here
for a good hour or so, I've just been working
and editing, over there. Now I'm done, so Dani
and I are gonna meet up and we're about to have a night. We shot six looks today, so we
only have to do two tomorrow. So I think we deserve, you
know, to have a little cocktail, have a little dance,
and just enjoy the city. Oh, wait, go away, fly,
don't ruin my shot. I'm here with the lovely
Dani, she's still here. - Still here. - [Jenn] I love you so much. - I love you so much. - I love you so much.
- I love you so much, Jenn. - [Jenn] Okay, I'll stop, anyway. We just got a little
soup as our appetizer, let's go check it out. It's tasty. ♫ Groovy, groovy Morning, everybody. It is Thursday and it is also
the last day of the shoot. Today we only have two looks, I am wearing one of them right now. And this is the last world. It is, yeah, just an orange room with a bit of furry
blue stairs, I love it. What's up, guys, I am
back in the hotel room. The shoot went amazing
and I just wanted to shoot my hotel room tour
before I completely forgot. I am staying at the Drake
Hotel and I freaking love it. So this is the door that you come in, you're greeted with, like,
a full-length mirror, and then another mirror here, and then you walk in and you
put your suitcases to the left, and here we have the nice,
spacious living room. Got a little couch here where
you can watch TV and relax and I guess you can host guests here. On this side, there is a bar. There is a medley of alcohol choices and a little tiny champagne bottle, I may or may not have
drinken one last night. And, of course, I have my sippy cup, I can't travel anywhere without it. And then over here, we've got the bedroom, this is, like, a nice king-sized
bed, it's very comfortable. I've got some abstract art on top and I like to sleep on
the left side of the bed, so, just all my essentials are there, the Kindle, kettle corn. Over here, a little desk
area where you can work, I've yet to use that. Then over here I've got a
bathroom, nice little set-up, shower over here, and then the toilet, the throne. That concludes the hotel room tour, I'm just waiting for Dani now, I believe we are gonna go get
some Korean food for lunch and then we're gonna go on that tower. I always forget what it's called. The CN, C-N Tower? Well, yeah, we're gonna
go up there because that's like one of Toronto's
monuments, or, like, landmarks, so we're gonna head on over there. (smooth jazz music) Today's mission is to go up
on the CN Tower, here we go! - [Dani] We're at the CN
Tower and Jenn's about to fly. - Hold on, hold on, hold on, oh, God. - [Dani] Are you good? - [Man] Bending your, just
put your arms up like that-- - This is the worst dress to do that pose. - [Man] All right, three, two, one. (smooth jazz music) - So, it is the last day in
Toronto, I'm leaving today, I just packed all my bags
and I'm about to head out into the lobby to meet up with Dani. We're gonna have, like,
our last brunch, I suppose. So, I still don't know where we're going, I think we're gonna go
get dim sum, perhaps. Surprisingly, I'm feeling
pretty sad about leaving. I don't know, something about this city, I really like it here, I like the people, everyone is so nice and
everyone that I've met has been, like, so creative and inspiring. The food has been bomb and I just, generally just like the fact that we could just walk around everywhere. I think we've walked, like, a good five or six miles every single day and it feels good, I like being active and I love exploring the city,
through foot, or by foot. I think once I'm on the
plane I'll be, like, excited to go home but, I just want, like, a couple more days here, I
definitely need to come back. This is an amazing city. All right, so we just finished dim sum and now we are at the
Art Gallery of Ontario, it's so beautiful. There's no art in here, in this room, but, just the natural lighting, it's gorgeous. (smooth music) Oh my God. Hi!
- Hi! - Lavender in the car. - What's up? - We are heading to Jackie
Aina's 30th birthday party. - We are stoked. The dress code is all white, so we're looking fly in all white. - Stephanie, it was a
struggle for Stephanie. - Dude.
- She doesn't have much white clothing. - Jenn went out to Zara yesterday and she found white pants for me, my personal shopper. - Yeah, but I did a pretty good job, these are exactly what she wanted, just, like, some white
joggers, they're real good. - Yeah and I already had, I
only own, like, two white tops and then I had to borrow a
white cami to go underneath it, otherwise it's gonna be,
like, too see-through, you know?
- Yeah. - But, yeah, I think, Jenn, thank you for the assistance.
- Thank you. I really have so much white clothing. I had so many options,
so for me, I was like, "Okay, do I wear this dress
or this, like, jumpsuit." Yeah. We're so excited to be
going to Jackie's party, it's gonna be at Mr. C in Beverly Hills, so, we'll see, you know, what happens.
- What happens. Hopefully there's some nums. - Yes, absolutely, I'm starving. - [Woman] Nice! - I am in heaven. Am I dead? (smooth music) All right, here we are at Beautycon LA! - 2017! - 2017, Los Angeles. - Our background's so cool. - I know.
- For our meet-and-greet. - Look at these little sculptures. There's Natalie and Dennis. Yeah, we're about to start
our meet-and-greet right now. So excited!
- Let's do it! (upbeat music) - My favorite part of the day. Look who I found, Miss Weylie. - Hey. - Eating her veggie fung mei. - So good. - And Miss Elsa! - Hello! I'm here. - Eating, of course. - Stylish. (upbeat music) ♫ Ooh, it's something, ♫ You and I have something (vocalizing Game of Throne's theme song) (upbeat music) - We are here at the UCLA campus, Amy is our lovely tour guide. Doing a back-to-school lookbook today, we're finally on Friday, last outfit. As Amy just nods behind the camera. This is Amy, she's helping out for today. She's helped so much, like, look at this nice bathroom in UCLA that she found. Go Bruins! (upbeat music) ♫ Ooh, it's something, ♫ You and I have something Hi, everybody, good morning from New York! Here I am, at the SIXTY SoHo,
it is a very nice hotel. I'm in New York for a press
preview for my clothing line that's coming out, Eggie,
I can finally talk about it and I feel like this vlog is really funny because you can see,
like, the different stages on how much information I can
reveal and how much I can't. I'm here to do a press preview, if you don't know what that is, it's basically, like,
just a bunch of interviews with publications, explaining and showcasing what the brand is and I, it's like my first time ever doing anything like this, so I'm just gonna kinda take it with each interview
and that's all I can really do. But I know this is gonna be, like, really good practice
for me and a very, very amazing opportunity, so I can't let a couple nerves just shake me down. It feels really, really
nice to be in New York, but if I'm gonna be completely honest, I do feel just, like, a smidge bit fried from how manic this month is. I can't believe I'm here, like, I've just been taking
everything day by day and I feel like every
day has just been, like, just overstimulation. I'd rather be too busy than too bored, so, definitely gonna
count this as a blessing. For my hair, I'm just
doing, like, normal curls, just doing a couple
inward, couple outward. Something easy. (smooth music) Oh my god. It just appreciated in value, that dollar. We see both sides. Good morning, everybody. Today is my final day in New York and quite a big day. I am at the EDITION Hotel in New York and this hotel is just stunning
and it smells amazing too. So far we've done WWD, which was, not gonna lie, pretty nervewracking. She had, like, a tape
recorder and asking some, like, really hard questions, but I think I managed to pull it together. The article comes out
on the 21st, I believe. Don't quote me on that, but
we'll see what she has to say. The line is up for preview over here and it's so surreal being
able to talk about it and have people come in
and touch the clothing and it's been so amazing
getting to explain everything. I can't believe launch
day's really coming up. All right everybody, that is a wrap. The racks are bare, the
mannequins are naked, Ashley had to take off her sweater. Thank you! Ah, star of the show, Cole, thank you! (smooth music) I'm having lunch with Hitomi.
- Hey! - [Jenn] Hi! - It's one of my favorite spots. Look at this. Oh my god. - [Jenn] And this is the
spicy kale salad, yay. - With rice flour chicken, like. - [Jenn] These look like french fries. - Yeah, wait, let's do a taste touch. - [Jenn] Okay. - Cheers.
- Cheers. (Gasps) Oh my god. - Whoa!
- Whoa, this is really good. She also got me a gift from Big Sur. This is the California
national flower, poppies. How nice, thank you. - It says, "All you need
to grow a whole patch." - [Jenn] Yes! Ben and I are gonna be popping
some children, poppies! - Creating some life. (upbeat music) (exercise machine beeping) - Hi, guys, so I'm back from New York, it feels so good to be home and I'm still kind of decompressing from my trip. This trip was actually a pretty big deal. This was the first time I've ever done something like a press preview before and I feel really confident
in everything that I did, and I think that's, like, a
big step for me because, even, like, earlier this year,
I was always second-guessing myself or replaying different situations that I would have done differently but I'm really just starting to let go. It happened, I can't change it, and I feel like a lot of my
mental growth has been through, like, meditating. And I feel really proud of myself because last time I went to New York was, I think it was like in March or something, the end of March or April, but I was out in New York there for a week and I was doing back-to-back shoots, my schedule slammed and I actually had, like, a pretty crazy meltdown, I was, like, crying in my hotel room, feeling really overwhelmed
and I always thought that that was just the cycle, but
I really do enjoy working but there's always, like, a threshold when I take up too much on my plate and then I have to have a release. It's always been that way and
I've actually never opened up to you guys because,
if you watch that vlog, I'm like, "Hey, everybody,
I'm in New York," and I just completely
cut out the part where I'm, like, sobbing
uncontrollably in my hotel room. I feel so much stronger now
and I'm in a place where I'm not, like, regretting anything. I'm just letting go and I
feel really proud of myself and I feel so free, finally, like, I went to New York, did, like, I don't know, it was,
like, seven interviews, and I don't have any regrets. It's, everything has been
done and I did the best that I can and I have, like,
my amazing team to thank for, like, I have, my clothing
line has a publicist, his name is Cole, and
he did an amazing job guiding me and walking me
through by talking points, and, of course, Ashley, my manager. I feel really proud that
I didn't have a meltdown. Gold star for me! I am all dolled up because
I am filming my Eggie haul! This video's gonna come out on Tuesday when my line launches,
so I'm so, so excited. I don't know, I'm just so
grateful for all the opportunities that I've had this year, it's
just been absolutely surreal. Thank you to everyone who
said hi to me in New York. That was amazing, just literally
walking down the street and I meet, like, a handful of you guys every time I've been walking around, so that's been an absolute gift. That is truly, like, my
favorite way to meet you guys, just, literally candid, impromptu moments where, you know, we get to, like, chat, chat about where you guys are
from and why you're there. But yeah, I'm just gonna
finish up getting ready, I got to do my hair and then
get cracking with filming. (smooth music) 
[Music] hey everyone it's a girl dren and today we have a brand new episode of what with Jen where and if you're new here this segment is where you tweet me or fashion dilemma and I answer them using the items in my wardrobe and if you enjoy fashion Q&amp;A like this make sure you subscribe to my channel the button should be somewhere down below so with that said let's get started with the first dilemma the first question comes from Alisha she asks how to style the fishnet trend I've been saying this fishnet trend spiked up on my instagrams past few months and this is one of my favorite ways to pair this tricky piece of hosiery I've gone for something more polished because fishnets can look a little messy sometimes I have this drifted satin coat from Goodwill and I actually really love the oversized shoulders because it gives it kind of like a retro high-fashion vibe underneath I wore a plain black turtleneck and then I rocked this true blue denim skirt to add a pop of color personally I love when I pair of fishnets with a miniskirt because you just get the most out of the pattern I've added a white Western belt to cinch the waist and I popped on e Pierce beret for some edgy class the next question comes from Ileana how do I stop Ajay my inspired pieces without looking like I just got out of bed I recently got this amazing pajama set and I thought it would be perfect for this question this is super comfortable and I love the pattern print but with a few tweaks you can really make it look like you stepped out of a runway instead of your bed frame I made to look more tailored by cooking in the shirt and then cinching the waist with the drawstring and then I pulled up the sleeves so I've got some skin peeking through little details like this make it look like a jumpsuit instead of a comfy PJs I've added some bringing accessories like these chrome sunglasses room key and these bauble earrings from forever 21 so the third dilemma comes from Vina I've been in love with the show Daria lately how would you recreate Darkness outfit so it wouldn't look to be anyone's crazy I've actually never seen an episode of Daria I've always wanted to but when I was a kid and it was airing it was always playing around 1 a.m. 2 a.m. and by then the TV was also parents made me go to sleep so I never actually seen an episode but this question just reminded me that I need to start it and just kind of make up for lost time but this is the best outfit I could come up for this question I actually don't own any green outerwear so I thought that's this olive farmer was the closest thing it gives it more of a sporty feel to make it look less geeky underneath I'm wearing the only orange item in my closet and then I tucked it underneath to start didn't skirt I think Daria wears off Martin so I just went for some buckle boots from public desire and then lastly for frames I'm wearing these new ones from coconuts and I can't wait to get them prescribed because I think they're gonna be my new favorite frame question number four is what do you do if you feel self-conscious about your body what do you wear so when I'm not feeling my body this is the type of out that I go for I like to wear just like a really loose dress and when I'm feeling uncomfortable like I just hate wearing pants I hate letting my legs in and hate buttoning up so wearing like a loose dress always makes me feel just a little bit more comfortable I wore a lightweight denim jacket just to give it some more layers because this dress is pretty plain on its own are some white tennis shoes to keep everything comfortable and to hide any greasy air I think this is a really easy outfit that can rock on days where you don't exactly feel 100 next up we've got Britt she asks Han style bootcut denim jeans effortlessly but still of chic so I've never actually been the type to like bootcut jeans but 2017 has proved me otherwise so this is my outfit incorporating this type of change since the bottoms are a little on the wider side I made sure to wear something very fitted for my top then for outerwear I threw on this massive coat from JOA and this coach makes me wish that LA got a little bit colder because then this coat would make sense I got a little hot in this coat but I wore it for the speaker to look for accessories I wore these huge hoops to add a little glimmer and that's who felt to coordinate all right so I've saved the most interesting questions for the last whatever you're a favorite art piece use that as your color palette to create a fashion inspired look to it okay I just love this question I think it's so creative so if you guys have been following my channel for a while you know that one of my favorite artists is rene magritte is one of the founders of surrealism and I just think so much of his work is dope I decided to recreate this photo and right over here this is just really creepy it's trippy and it's one of those images that just kind of really stuck in my head from like my teenage years pretty much so instead of being inspired by this book I just literally full-on recreated it I threw on this tailored blazer from the kugels and underneath I wore this cropped turtleneck in a beige shade to match the color scheme the painting doesn't show his bottom half but I'm just going to assume that it brings me dark so I wore these pants and the shoe combo to match the gold on frame I wore my Jenny Byrd earrings and then I picked out my grapes of wrath' book because it was the only turquoise book on my bookshelf honestly I had so much fun recreating this outfit that I think I'm going to do like an entire video recreating art pieces so if you guys would like to see that definitely write a comment down below I can gauge your interest or if you want to tweet me your favorite art piece and like put the hashtag www I'll try and recreate that Q alright guys that wraps up this episode of what would Jen wear these guys would like to be featured in the next episode feel free to tweet me at em join em and just write your fashion dilemma or question there and just use the hashtag WWJ w and yes that's pretty much it alright guys I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I'll see you guys in the next one ah [Music] you 
(calm music) - What's up, everyone, it's your girl Jenn and today I'll be showing you
how I edit my YouTube videos. I have been creating videos
for a number of years now and I thought that today I
would just kinda guide you on what goes on in my head as I'm editing and I know I do a wide range of videos but today I thought I would just show you how I do a basic vlog. Thought I'd keep it
simple and informational. Also, if you are not
subscribed by now, please do. Button is down below. Hit that and become a Jem today. Alright, so with that
said, let's get started. Alrighty, so here is my desktop. I'm gonna open up Final Cut Pro X. This is what I've been using for years now and it's what I like. I have already imported my files and now I'm going to create a new project. This one is called June Vlog 2017 for now and all my clips are in
there and ready to go. So my first step is to create a rough cut. I like to make sure that I have
all the right clips in order and have them chronological. So I just drag each clip and bring it down and I'll start piling them
all down where they belong. It just helps me keep
organized and keeps me sane. I know some people just like
to work it little by little. I just like to dump it all
at once and trim as I go. Once you have established the positioning, I just kinda scrub through the footage and I try my best to get
rid of any ums or gaps. Like in this clip, I'm just rambling so I'm just using the Blade tool and I'm just gonna cut that out. No one needed to hear me
remember if it was Tuesday or Wednesday. I just have found it best
to keep your dialogue as effective as you can. Alright, so let's talk
about transitions now. When I'm jumping to one scene to another, I'll go into Transitions
and then I'll use Slide. I like to use Slide when I'm
transitioning in the same day but when it's a new day,
I'll go in with Flash which is in the Light section and it will just kind of burst and that'll indicate that it's a new day. Once all the clips are in place and I'm happy with the rough cut, I'll just match the clips
to the beat of a song. You can develop a relationship
with a music artist and agree to have their
music on your channel. I'm really lucky that I've
made friends with Go Yama and DJ Grumble and we have
an agreement with the usage. Another way is to get songs
from a royalty free library. There is a lot out there but
my favorite is Epidemic Sound. Believe me, I've gone through a lot. The quality of their
music library is bomb. I've thumbed through
so many music libraries where everything just sounds like crap but I find Epidemic Sound's library to have such a wide range
of genres and artists. One of my favorite artists
there is Axel Ljung. I'm probably saying that wrong
but I love what he produces. It really goes well with my channel and creates a great vibe. It just feels good knowing
that these songs are 100% safe. You don't have to worry
about copyright claims. There's a 30-day free
trial for all new users so sign up and start browsing the music. So now that I got my song,
I'm gonna work on my intro. I'm gonna go to the
library, drag this song in and this is where you can add
cool text, effects with fonts. Personally, I have a graphic
designer that I work with and she creates these
awesome images for me that I can overlay with. This is not necessary by any means though. You can find a cool font
on a ton of websites. My favorite is dafont.com and here's a few of my favorite
fonts to help you start out. Also, there is always Pixel Film Studios. I feel like this is a
well-known YouTube secret but you can just buy plugins here that just jazz up your
videos with minimal editing. Now, back to the intro. I'm just gonna throw in some fun stuff. I'm gonna put a little TV static to make it seem like you're
dialing into a new episode. So now that my intro is looking good, I'm gonna start adding music to all the montages in my videos. I'll try and make the
clips change every time when it hits a beat. It just makes the viewing experience a little cooler, more artsy. I know some people won't notice but at least you'll know that it's there. Now that the music's done, I'm gonna go ahead and add the dates. I always make sure I put
my Snapping option on because this always makes sure that the graphics on top synchronize with the clip on the bottom. So you see that yellow line? It snaps back in. That indicates that
it's perfectly aligned. Now, I'll go back to the vlog
and I'll stop at every clip where a new location is established. For example, here's a clip of VidCon. I am gonna put a basic text on it. I'm gonna write VidCon
because this was at VidCon and I'm gonna change the
font to my favorite, Brandon. I'm gonna make it Bold and I'm gonna just space
out the text a little bit to make it look cooler. I know it's obvious that it's VidCon but it's little details like this that make the vlog more fun and just keep the viewer stimulated. The last thing I'll do
is add an end slate. This is a landing page for you
to write any of your socials or where your viewers can find you. This also isn't necessary but I just find that it adds
a nice professional touch. Make sure it's at least 20 seconds long because that's what YouTube recommends. Alright, guys, that is
just a brief outline of what goes on in my head as I'm editing. Obviously, finding your
own video and editing style comes with time and experience and you just gotta be consistent and things will just
kinda fall into place. It took me a very long time
to get to where I am now and there's still so many
things I need to learn but regardless, creating
videos is such a fun and just good outlet especially
if you're the type of person that likes to document and
just remember memories. If you enjoyed the video,
please hit the Like button and also open the description box. The link for the Epidemic
Sound deal is there. Music is such a key
factor in YouTube videos and it's just good to be safe. So please open that, check it out and thank you so much for watching. I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. (calm music) 
(instrumental music) - Happy November First, yay! - Yeah. - I always love the first of the month. It feels like a chance
to restart everything. Ben and I are on our way to Catch LA. We are going to the
Revolve nominee brunch, and that's gonna be really
exciting because we're gonna be reunited with our Revolve family. - That's perfect, isn't it? We go to Catch LA, which is so so good. We went there a couple of weeks ago, unbelievable, and we get
to see the Revolve crew, so, good day. - It's gonna be cool. It's their first time
doing an awards show, and I know it's gonna be good because they don't half-ass anything. - Nothing. (soft music) - [Jenn] We have a very special delivery. - Yes, we got a nice new TV. It's pretty big. - [Jenn] Yeah, it's fricking massive. This has been a long time coming. We got a whomping 65 inches. Chipper, what do you think? - [Ben] What do you think, Chips? - [Jenn] Well, the TV
had a big crack in it, so we had to put it back. - It was really good actually. We got it out, we set it up, I screwed everything really
tight into the stand. Got it up, put the other TV upstairs, woo hoo, here we go, Stranger Things. There's a crack on it, so, it took me about an hour
trying to drill this out, because it's one of those that you can't really reverse it very well. So it's been really fun,
and the best thing about it, they can't come pick it up and exchange it because they don't have any more. So, yeah, that's that. - Oh my gosh, you can't
really see on camera, but the clouds are looking
very ominous right now, but kinda hopeful as well. Hello, everybody. Please excuse the messy office. The reason why all
these trash bags are out is because tomorrow I am shooting the second drop for the Eggie Collection. I'm so excited to be doing
that because, believe me, it has been an entire process. A lotta things go into it. There's a lotta logistics. Samples weren't on time. Some samples weren't like, acceptable, so yeah, things just get pushed back, but it's all right, I'm so happy that we're getting closer
and closer to the date. The reason why I'm in such a fancy outfit is because I am going to
the Revolve Awards tonight. Yesterday was the brunch, but
tonight is the actual thing. I am wearing a Maijerel. It's this gorgeous, fleecy number. And then, I'm gonna throw
a big faux fur coat on. (upbeat music) - Let's go. (upbeat music) - Welcome to the
first-ever Revolve Awards. Give it up for yourselves. (cheering) - I'm honored to be here to present the best beauty influencer award. And the award for best
beauty influencer goes to Jenn Im. (cheering) - First off, I need to
thank my subscribers for voting for me, and I really don't know what I did to deserve such
loyalty from my Eggies, and I wanna thank you so much. It's crazy to win an award like this, because growing up, there
weren't that many people that looked like me in traditional media. I am a short Asian chick, and you know, in the 1990s,
there was not that image on the screen, and through
YouTube I was able to build a platform and just showcase what I loved, which was fashion, beauty, style, just feeling good about yourself. And I wanna thank,
obviously, my subscribers, my frickin' manager. Love you. Ben, my fiancee. You have seen me through thick and thin, and I wanna thank Revolve. Like you guys believed in us,
and I wanna thank you guys for creating such surreal moments for us. It's all about having a
good time and celebrating, and I'm down for that. (cheering) Thank you so much. - [Man] Her speech was good. Dude, that was so good. - We're on our second award of the night, and we're on three fucks already. (laughter) I had no idea that was
gonna come from her. She's like, as a young
Asian woman in the industry, I fuckin' love you all. (upbeat music) - You know my beautiful manager, and my best friend, the villa sisters. - Congratulations, Influencer of the Year. (upbeat music) (soft music) - Good morning, we are here at the cabin. I am getting ready right now. I've got Amy right over there, hello. We've got Jeff, hi. It's behind the scenes of the Eggie team. And then there's Ted, of course. Yeah, so I'm just doing
my makeup right now. And then Adam and Mitchell
should be here soon. And yeah, trying to knock out this whole shoot by four, so really gotta hurry up. All right, so the crew
is starting to roll in. There's Adam, the
photographer, I love him. There's Jen, another Jen, from the house. Obviously Ben and Wa over there. Wa is filming the editorial
look book, along with Ben. And the makeup is done. I'm gonna take you downstairs with me. It's a little dark, but I'll show you. Here, got Mitchell, oh, also creating content, hello. We have taken over the foosball room. Gonna make some hair magic in here. Amy, oh there you are. - [Amy] Hello, hello. - Steaming, organizing, she is incredible. And, we are ready to go. Let's do this. (upbeat music) - [Ben] Done, is that a wrap? Yeah. Yeah. - Are you excited to
see your grandparents? Chippo. Okay, she's ready. (car beeping) Okay, now up. Yay! 10 seconds, 10, nine, eight, seven. (laughter) (upbeat music) - It's so perfect. - [Jenn] I know, it looks so perfect. It looks like a set. - Oh my God, it does. - [Jenn] It's really dark,
but Emily has accepted my bridesmaid proposal. - I said yes. - Thank God. So it is Tuesday now, my hair is darker. Pretty slightly, maybe
like two shades darker. Anna just gave me a glossing and toned it and did my base, and I am
obsessed with the way it looks. I mean, I just need to
brush it out right now. I just woke up. What is going on today? Today is a day of editing. I'm trying to get out
my October favorites, and then also finishing
up a bunch of videos for a deadline tomorrow. And I'm also filming with, To the Nines, Amy, Drew,
Scott and Karen today, or I guess tonight. We're gonna do like a night out look book, so that's gonna be really fun. It's really cool doing like
collaborative look books because we only need to wear one outfit and then we've got like six, so I'm very very happy for that. I'm just trying to get as
much stuff done as possible before I go to Toronto on Thursday. I am so excited for that trip. I'm going for my friend Dani's birthday, and I just got her
birthday gift right now. I'm getting her a Kindle. After I filmed my favorites,
and I was like raving about my Kindle Light, I was like, I should probably just like get people, or get like my loved ones a Kindle, because it just makes
reading so much more fun. Yeah, I can see your screen. - [Woman] Yeah, it says Eggie dot web. - [Jenn] Leo has cooked
his famous El Pastore. I'm at Karen and Leo's place. - Hi. - [Jenn] Oh my gosh, look
at this bountiful feast. (chattering) - [Leo] It's like this is your canvas. These are the paint colors. (laughing) - [Jenn] We got all this camera equipment. Adrian came very prepared. Thank you very much. - I have two. - [Jenn] Do you wanna say something? - Do I wanna say something? - [Jenn] Everyone's in their
beautiful night out outfits. We should go somewhere after this. I can't believe we're just gonna do this and like go home after. Everyone's looking really fly. - Perhaps Drew's friend's birthday party. - [Jenn] Oh yeah, Momma Shelter. - Momma Shelter, mommy. - All right, doing my dress
fitting with my girls. Maid of honor and my bridesmaids. Oh, before I forget, oh wait, okay. All right, this one is for Ashley. - Wow, I love presents. - [Jenn] And this one is for you. I wonder what it could be. - Oh, I love it. - [Jenn] Yeah, it's so minimal. - Thank you.
- Thank you. - Oh my gosh, my favorite
sisters in the world. (gasping) Cute. - Actually, that's really gorgeous. - [Camerawoman] Wow. Ooh. Oh my God. So this is the separates one? - Yeah, it's a bodice. - [Camerawoman] Wow. That one is beautiful. I love the little ties on the sleeves. - [Saleswoman] The
little scallops on there are made to measure, so it would be your proportions, which is really great
since you're so petite. - This is serious stuff, y'all. - [Camerawoman] Yeah, look at that. Wow. That one is beautiful. I know we say that for every single one, but this one. I love it. - It's very wow factor. - Yeah. - This is hands-down my
favorite gown of hers. I'm gonna layer a little bit. - Long. - [Camerawoman] Not the one. - It's so big on her
that, even if I clip it. Even clipped it's just like hanging off. - [Camerawoman] I totally understand the sleeve thing now. You have to be like six feet tall to wear that. - Yeah. And like the arms, I feel like. - [Camerawoman] Yeah, it's just heavy. - [Saleswoman] It's like you're playing dress-up or something. - Yeah. (laughing) (chattering) (soft music) - Hi, everybody, oh God. Amy and Jenn here. If you guys don't know
who Amy is, here she is. I talk about her in my favorites a lot. - Yes, the one and only. I'm holding the camera for Jenn, because no tripod. - Yeah, it keeps falling. We are on our way to Sherman Oaks. But we just got back
from the Eggie spring, I guess that would be
like drop three meeting. Or drop four actually. There's a lotta stuff
in store for you guys. There's the winter,
spring and also summer. It just never stops, but I'm so excited to show it to you guys when it's ready. Oh my gosh, I look like a hot mess. Because I feel like a hot mess. Today's been one of those days where it feels so
rewarding just to sit down and not have to do anything. Definitely did the most today. I've got my kimchi-jiigae here. This is the best kimchi-jiigae
of all time, I must say. I wish I could just learn how
to make it exactly like this. I went them to tell me like,
where they buy their kimchi. Like what the measurements are, because this would be phenomenal to cook and I'd probably save a lot of money if I just made it myself. But yeah, today was so
amazing and productive, and just exhausting. Yeah, I feel like I
haven't even gotten to chat about like my Toronto trip. When I was out there, I didn't vlog. I started to, and then, first of all, it was
just too cold to vlog. When it's freezing, it's
just like, not ideal to like, take something out and have, you know, equipment to fumble around with, so I wasn't able to vlog there. But it was actually good
that I got three days just to myself, I was still
working but not filming. So I'm really happy
that it was productive, but also restful as well. Sophie's gonna come later. I haven't seen her in like a couple weeks. But, yeah, we've both been frickin' busy, so it's gonna be awesome to get some one-on-one time with her. You guys, how funny is this? I'm in like the exact
same spot as last night. But yeah, it's the next morning, and it is the day of Eggie drop two. It is one p.m., and it's
been a couple hours, and the support has been incredible. Can't wait to see how all the
pieces look like on you guys. If you happen to support,
and you receive your items and you love it, and you take a photo, please tag us at EggieShop. I love seeing you guys rock Eggie, and it makes me so happy. That is probably the
most like rewarding thing that can possibly happen. But yeah, unfortunately, I
think I'm getting a cold. I feel like I've been
fighting off this cold for the past like two weeks, but I feel like my immune
system's pretty strong, but yesterday when Sophie came over, and we literally talked
for like five hours. So my throat feels so hoarse right now. I think I'm just gonna
probably end the vlog here, and then start part two of
November later on today. So yeah, I just wanted to thank you guys so much for watching and
supporting my channel. I feel like, I feel like November has already been such an amazing month. And I can't believe that
next week is Thanksgiving, so we're really plowing through this year. So yeah, I wanna thank you
guys so much for watching. And I'll see you guys
in the next one, bye. (soft music) 
(slow instrumental music) - Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn. And today I am filming my fall haul. Bu this isn't just your
normal, average haul because I'll be talking about all the new items from
Eggie drop number two. For those who are just tuning in, Eggie is my clothing line, and I've put my blood
sweat and tears into this and I'm so proud of this collection. This season is inspired by my past, specifically high school
and like early college. So that's why there is a variety of hoodies, long sleeves, tanks and also just modern
trends that I love today. Just a nice mix-match of everything. I've already uploaded the video look book so please hit the cards or the down bar. But I honestly just wanted to sit down and talk about each item piece-by-piece in a good old-fashioned haul. So let's get started. I wanna chat about outerwear first, so here is the Tardy Bomber. This is the perfect fitted bomber that everybody needs in their wardrobe. I put it in this really flashy red because I feel like red
is a statement color that's here to stay. You can obviously wear it
just zipped up normally, or you can just simply snap the top button and
leave the rest open. I feel like that's just a
really chic way to style it. In the last collection we had
a really oversized bomber, but I thought for this
season I'd dial it back, create something that is
slightly cropped, more snug, and perfect for the chilly weather. Next up I have the Tardy Hoodie. This is a really cute oversized hoodie with this amazing chain detail. At first we were just gonna
have normal drawstrings, but I thought we would
just amp it up a notch and add this chain detail. I made sure that you could remove it, so that way when you wash
it it doesn't get all rusty. So you can wear the chain in two ways. You can either just wear it like this, or you can loop the chains together and create kind of like a necklace effect. I feel like with this hoodie
you don't need to accessorize because the chain does all the talking. It also has these massive balloon sleeves that are very long. But there is like a cuff detail, so if they're just too long and you wanna be able to function, you can just push it
up and be on your way. So I have another
comfortable hoodie for you. This is called the Left and Right Hoodie, and I named it that because it has left and right
in Korean on the pockets. So it says (speaks Korean) on this side and (speaks Korean) on the other. And this is a longer hoodie so
that way it covers your butt. You can wear it as a dress or you can just wear it over
like a jeans and a t-shirt. This is something that
is super easy to style, a wardrobe basic and very very cozy. So this is the last piece of outerwear and it is called the two tone hoodie. It comes in two color ways. One is in this nice beige and white and the other is in a red and gray. And I just wore a lot of
hoodies in high school, and I wanted to just jazz it up by making something mismatched. I feel like this hoodie
would also look really cute with some thigh-highs,
or you can just wear it like off the shoulder as a dress. I think that would be super cute. But yeah I think this
is a really fun piece to wear on its own or to layer with. Now I'm gonna move on to some tops. Here is a no-brainer basic. This is called the Charlotte top, and yes this is named after
Charlotte from Sex and the City because it's elegant and chic. This comes in two color
ways, black and periwinkle. And it has this lettuce
ribbing all over the top, and a cute keyhole that you can adjust. The size does run a little bit large, so make sure if you are
interested in this to size down. The next item is a really
sentimental one to me. This is called the Love Letter Romper. So basically I went
into my childhood room, and I found this box of letters. And I thought it'd be really
cool to put them up on a shirt. So on the left side I've got a letter from my very first
boyfriend when I was 13. And then on the right side
I've got a love letter from a crush from summer camp. You can't really see what the message is because I wanted to respect their privacy. So yeah it's a little distorted
but they're still on there. The greatest part about this shirt though, is the fact that this
is actually a romper. This was my designer's idea, Angela. So thank you so much for that. So yeah we just wanted to create a piece that was comfy and secure. I love going out, so I wanted to make sure that I had some pieces that I could wear on like a night dancing
or out with the girls. So here is the Wrap Tank. This looks like a hot mess on the hanger. But trust me when you put it on it's cute. This is a ribbed tank that is fitted, and it just wraps around the waist. It definitely is a sexy
little number to rock when you wanna bear some skin. Next up I have the K-Tank. There are just normal
spaghetti strap tops, with a contrast trim and a little Korean slogan in the middle. The first one says (speaks Korean), which means your mom in Korean. Then I have fighting, which is
a phrase like you can do it. And then I have (speaks Korean) which means let's play or
like let's hang out in Korean. These are really cute tanks that you can wear on their own or layered. Winter is coming, so
staying snuggly is a must. That's why I made more long sleeves. This is the O Dang long sleeve and o dang means fish cake in Korean so that's why there are fish
cakes where the nips are. This comes in three colors,
this one is in a dusty blue, the other is in a dusty maroon and the last one is in a classic white. Moving on to another graphic tee, This is the nobody puts
Eggie in the corner. Obviously this is a play on
"nobody puts baby in the corner" but I just replaced Eggie. This is in a really kind
of like metal band font, because it kind of just reminds me of all the metal bands that I
used to wear in high school. Overall it's just a
very comfortable shirt, that you can rock on casual days. The last graphic tee that I
have is the Blur Baby top. This is a cute crop top that has the graphic Eggie in the front. I just love the blur
effect because it's quirky, and it just, I don't know, makes it seem like time's
going by really fast. I've always considered
graphic tops as a basic, so that's why I wanted to add
more of them to my collection. I consider polka dots a timeless trend, so naturally I wanted to
add some into my collection. This is called the Spot Top, and it's just an off the shoulder blouse with this gorgeous dot
pattern all over it. It's got cutouts on the sleeves, and it has a nice ruffle on
the shoulder and the ends. This is really cute to wear
with high-waisted things because it's so cropped, and it's just like nice item to wear when you wanna look all spruced up. The other polka dotted item is one that I'm wearing right now. This is called the Dot Jumpsuit, and this is a daring number for those who just wanna strut their stuff in a power jumpsuit. I love that it elongates you and it's just easy to
take it from day to night. This is clearly one of my favorite pieces because I'm rocking it right now. I wore it with a long sleeve just so it's warmer for the weather. The sun keeps coming into my room, so I've been like scooting
further and further back. But basically, here is the next item. So this comes in two pieces,
first I have the Connor top. This is a strapless top with
this awesome contrast stitching so that way it really pops. It's got this cute ruffle detail
on the top and the bottom, and this top coordinates
perfectly with the Connor pants. These are definitely one of
the most comfortable pants that I've ever worn. They are very loose and baggy, but fitted on the waist so they look perfect with the top. This set is named after Sarah Connor who is probably like the
most badass woman in film. So I wanted to just dedicate
a piece of clothing to her. Here are some more trousers that I love. These are called the Late Shift trouser, and they come in two
colors, black and olive. They kind of remind me of a work pant, but way softer and definitely more chic. They are also high-waisted
and the bottoms are still baggy but not as baggy but not as baggy as the Connor pant. The highlight of these pants
are definitely the chain. It's in this really awesome gold, and it's quite substantial,
it's pretty heavy. And if you like the chain, you can move it on over to any of the other pants in your closet. As I mentioned before, I'm having a huge moment
with red right now. So here are the Bench Warmers. They're these sick red joggers with this white striping on the sides. This is just a really nice tailored jogger in a fun red print. And I feel like they're a great way to play with the sports lux
trend that's going on right now. So we only have two more
items left in the haul and they're both skirts. Here is the Criss Cross skirt. This is a tight black and red miniskirt with this cross stitching on the side. I feel like red and black is such a classic color combination and I just love how striking it comes off. Alright the final item
is the Clueless skirt, and I feel like this name
is pretty self-explanatory. It's inspired by the 90s
classic film, Clueless. And you can channel your
inner Cher with this skirt. So that is a wrap on the haul, please head over to Eggie.us
if you are interested in any of the pieces. Also I have a huge announcement for the international Eggies out there. I know shipping has been brutal, I know some of you guys
have been paying 50 60 bucks for shipping and I know
it's been unreasonable. But I have been working
on this with my team, to lower the cost and we
have finally succeeded. So for most places it should be around seven to 15 bucks for shipping now. There are some places that are excluded, they're still like 30 bucks. But there's gonna be a
list, like a full list, on eggie.us so please head
on over to the website to see what your shipping costs are. I've been getting so many
DMs and comments and messages about this issue and so I've
been working on it so hard and I'm so happy that it happened. So thank you so much for you
know, voicing your concerns, and I will do anything that I possibly can to make your requests a reality. I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching, And I will see you guys in the next one. Bye! (blows kiss) 
(electronic music) - Hello there. Welcome to our hotel room! - [Ben] Woo! First of all, Ben, and Jenn robes, and they're lovely and thin.
- I know! - This is like the dream. I've always wanted a nice
robe with my name on it. A nice shower there. Oh, yeah. - Sit and think. You know, about life as the
water's coming down on you. (Ben laughing) (electronic music) What's up, guys? Today is the first day of Coachella. (cheers) Oh, I'm so excited. As you can see I'm just doing my hair. I'm just gonna do what I always do, which is a smooth wave. For those who are
wondering, I use this by T3. I don't know the name of
this, but it looks like this. It's got rose gold hardware and I really like the big barrel. That's what gives your
curls that fluffy look. This morning, went to a little bruch for House of Harlow, which
is Nicole Richie's brand. Had some food and then I uploaded my spring make up tutorial. If you haven't seen it, I'll
leave a card right over there. It's inspired by the Pirates
of the Caribbean movie and I used the Le Roc's
new palette for that, so. I really had a fun time
creating that look. The agenda's quite packed already. We've got pool party from one to five. John Boy's doing tattoos. A$AP Ferg is playing at three, and then by five we're hoping that we can, we're just gonna be at the festival and we can meet up with
everybody, so excited. (electronic music) Men shaving men. (hip hop music) Here we are about to
have a nice little lunch. How's your tattoo? - Yeah, I said all right. - [Jenn] You gonna show? - It's a nice little chile pepper. - Oh.
- You know? - [Jenn] It's so cute. I was so tempted to get one myself, but oh my gosh, my mother texted me. She says (speaks foreign language) "No more tattoo." And I said, "Only Ben is getting a tattoo. "I am not getting a tattoo." (electronic music) ("Shaba" by A$AP Ferg) Way to the festival now on the shuttle. Excited, we're gonna
meet up with everybody. - Yes.
- Yes. - [Ben] I love Rocky. (electronic music) - Good morning, guys. It is day two of Coachella. Yesterday, Friday was definitely needed. If I had one word describe
last night was overstimulating. I truly forget how crowded
and intense the festival is. You've got all these lights, all these acts, all
your friends are there. Wrangling people. I think Friday was to just break us in. We saw Steve Angello last
night, Dillon Francis, Travis Scott and DJ Shadow. DJ Shadow was sick, though. I didn't know he was a fellow Aggie. He went to UC Davis, too. It's so sick, Stephanie told me. Right now I'm putting on some
of this body glow by Kopari. This is just a body shimmer. It gives your skin some nice gold flecks and it looks really great in the sun. I'm obsessed with it and
it smells like coconut. All right, now we are
heading to the guy's house. We're gonna just settle in there. - Barbecue.
- Doing a barbecue, perhaps. - Catch up.
- Head out the festival. - It'd be nice to have a relaxing time and actually talk without having to shout while we squeeze--
- Yeah, all right. - Through people.
- I know, I know. The group we are going with
go together to the festival. It's too hectic to meet with
your friends at the festival. - The rose garden.
- The rose garden, the Sahara tent. We're at the house, we are prepared. We've eaten, go rally up the troops. This is the house that they're staying at. It is in Palm Desert. The lovely Hannah. Oh, my God, dang, Sophie. Hannah, Sophie, you guys look so good. - Thanks, Jenn. - Coachella ready.
- Ready. (electronic music) - So we just made it to the festival. Oh my God. - We have made it. It was so easy to get in today. - I know.
- And it's still light. Look at this, lovely. - It's daylight. (tranquil music) ♫ Had to go to LA for the winter ♫ Had to vibe out, just

- Very delicious. - [Ben] Changing. (electronic music) - Bye. Bye. (electronic music) 
(upbeat music) - Hey everybody, it's your girl Jenn, and today I'll be showing you how I did this yellow eyeshadow look. This has been highly requested
and very long awaited, so thank you so much for your patience. Last month was really, really crazy. I finally had a moment to just sit down, and just chat and show
you guys how I did this. Since it's back-to-school season, I thought I would just
grab a bunch of questions about college on my Instagram, and you know, chat about it, because this is a really exciting, but also scary time for a lot of you. So I thought I would put my two cents in, and also show you how I did this. So let's get started! I am gonna hydrate my lips first, by using Glossier's Mint Balm
Dotcom universal skin salve. I've used all their formulas, but the mint one is by far my favorite. It has like, this nice cooling sensation, similar to Burt's Bees. But the packaging is just so much cuter. Now I'm gonna move on to primer. I'm using this one by Too Faced. It is their Hangover Rx. And this one is probably one
of the most nourishing primers that I've ever used. Before, I was just really on the ball with anything that was like, mattifying and stuff that didn't make me oily, but these days, I've just been enjoying
like, a nice dewy look. It just looks youthful and in Korea, you know they like that dewy face, so that's just the card
I've been playing. (laughs) Ah, okay so primer is finished. Now I am just gonna skip
foundation completely, and I'm just gonna go
directly to concealer. I'm using this concealer,
this is by Hourglass. And it is a stick. And I'm just going to put
it underneath my eyes. Right over here, wow. And then I put it around my nose. A little on my forehead. And then on my chin. So basically, all the
dark areas of my face. And while I'm blending, I might as well get
cracking with the questions. (laughs) I've just been
getting carried away with the makeup. So this is from korleyan. "How was community college
compared to a university? "And if any differences or
similarities between the two? "Love you!" First off, community college
kind of feels like high school, the sequel. (laughs) You're gonna know a lot of
people there from your school, but there's also a new flush of people. Honestly, looking back, I'm so happy that I went
to community college, because just the amount of
money I saved from tuition is just, like, unbelievable. I was able to just take my time, and figure out what I wanted to do. I was not the best student growing up. I was always just a very average student, and in the eyes of, you
know, a Korean family, if it wasn't straight A's,
it wasn't good enough. And I definitely never,
ever got straight A's. I think I was really in my head
when I was going to school. I was just so focused on
trying to get the good grade and memorizing everything, that that anxiety and that
pressure actually crippled me, and once I stopped caring
about what grade I got, that's when I started
getting good grades. (laughs) That was my senior year of college. Because I went to community college, I was able to really figure
out what I wanted to do. Obviously, math was not an option for me. I do not understand how to crunch numbers. Writing, I was horrible at. Science, a mystery! (laughs) And I finally went to my
counselor, and I was like, I really don't know what I wanna do. And she said, well what do you like doing? And I told her that I liked going out, I liked meeting people,
I liked socializing, and she told me of this
major called Communications! But I was able to take
all the units I needed to be able to transfer. And once I did transfer, it
was just a whole new world. I never lived away from home before, so I got accepted to UC
Davis and UC San Diego. And I was pretty torn, because as much as I wanted
to go to UC San Diego, I wanted to just get the hell
out of southern California. I was over it. I wanted to just start completely fresh, and just be the new
girl at school for once, because growing up, my parents
never moved, which is great, because I never had to
feel displaced or anything, but you know, when you watch those movies, and it always starts off with like, ah, the new kid at school. Who is she? So I don't know, I just wanted to basically
get out of my hometown and just start completely fresh. And San Diego is only two hours away, but I wanted to be far. I wanted people to have
to go on a road trip or a plane to go see me. (laughs) If I had to say a difference, whether like the classes were better or the professors were
better at community college or UC Davis, I would say
it's pretty comparable. I mean, it's really what you make of it. You can go to the best Ivy League school, but if you're not there to absorb, then there's really no point. And I also would like to say
that what school you go to does not define you at all. Maybe I'll do another layer. (laughs) It's so funny, the day I'm like, I'm not gonna wear foundation, I'm like, it's not covered enough. Alright guys, I think that is blended. I'm just like punching myself with this beauty blender. (laughs) So the concealer is all blended out. And now I'm gonna seal that with a powder. I'm going back to an old favorite of mine. This is the Rimmel Stay Matte Powder. Look how old this is. I should have probably gotten a new one, but you know, this will do. I'm gonna grab this flat
brush by Marc Jacobs, and I'm just gonna scrape
what is left of this guy, and I'm going to put it underneath my eyes just to set everything. As you can see, I'm grabbing this, and I'm just literally patting it, no swirling, just patting, because I don't wanna ruin the good thing we've got going down here. So now that powder is done,
I'm gonna move onto the brows. Here I'm using two products. First I'm gonna use Dior's Brow Styler. I've mentioned this a
million times before, but this is just a great pencil
for the meat of my brows. It's like a nice color shade. And then for the tails, I go in with Benefit's
Goof Proof Brow Pencil. This is a darker color, so it
just really defines the tails. I like my tails to be the
darkest part of the brow. "How did it feel when
you moved to UC Davis "as a transfer student? "Did you have trouble making good friends "since people already knew each other? "Did you feel left out at all? "Did you join any clubs? "I'm transferring from a
community college next year, "so I'm super nervous about that. "Thank you!" Being a transfer student
was definitely really hard, because yeah, everybody
already has their friends. They have their established
cliques already, and going in as a transfer student, I was starting completely from scratch. And I made sure to use the internet (laughs) to help me find some friends. So when I was trying to find housing, I found this Facebook group, where it was just for UC Davis transfers and people who were
looking for housemates, and I made sure that my profile
was as detailed as possible. I said where I was from,
what my interests were, I wrote all my favorite
bands, all my favorite books, all my favorite films,
and using that profile, I was able to find someone
that I really clicked with. And she was going to be my housemate. She had the same interests as me, and so it wasn't a huge surprise
when we actually got along. So she was my first friend, and she was the person that I
spent my 21st birthday with, and if you're watching this So, I love you, thinking about you. I feel like social media
gets like, a really bad rap. But it actually helps in the end, if you utilize it correctly. Personally, I didn't join any clubs. I just spent any extra
time filming or editing, I was just always consumed by my studies or my YouTube channel, and in a sense, it was good, because I
became very independent. I just had to entertain myself (laughs), so whether it was like, going
to the movie theater by myself or going to the thrift store by myself, I was always keeping myself preoccupied. But if I could go back in time, I definitely would've
joined at least like, one club or something, because I know a lot of
my friends that have been in organizations and clubs and sororities, where they have and left
with lifelong friends, and it would've been really awesome. So I think if you are
looking for a community, I would definitely recommend
you joining a club, because there are good people in there. So now that the brows are done, let's move onto the fun
part, the eye shadow. So I am gonna use Nars'
Radiant Creamy Concealer as like a primer for my lids. So I'm just gonna pat
this all over the lid, and this is just gonna
really enhance the colors of the eyeshadows. I literally just
discovered that this works, so I'm very excited to implement
this into my tutorials. So once that's all blended out, I'm gonna grab my yellow
eyeshadow from 3 Concept Eyes. This is called Yolk,
which is the perfect name. So it's a very yellow eyeshadow. I'm gonna grab this flat
brush, this is by e.l.f. Doesn't have a number, but
it just looks like this. Yeah, so as you can see,
I'm not swooping it, or else that would
cause too much fall out. I'm literally just petting it. I think maybe the reason
why I didn't join any clubs was that it was hard to
find time in my schedule, because a lot of the clubs, you had to stay at school
even longer than you had to, and I was always ready to
bounce out after my class, so maybe that's why I didn't join any. And then once you get a little closer to, I guess, the outsides, that's when I'm able to kind
of swoop it around like that. So now that the yellow is on, I'm gonna use this
pallette from ColourPop. Unfortunately, I don't know the name, but it's got this nice orange shade in it. And then with the flat brush, I'm just gonna put it
all over the under eyes. I can't forget about the inner corners, so I'm gonna use this
lighter shade over here. I'm gonna pop that on my brow bone and also the inner corners of my eyes. The power of a shimmer
in the inner corners, it just brightens everything up. There is one final
element to the eyeshadow. I'm using ColourPop's Flipper. It looks really orange, but it's actually just a
really nice warm shimmer. I'm gonna grab my ring finger,
swoop it around like that, and then I'm just going to
simply pat it all over the lid. And this is just gonna
make the yellow glittery, and I know some people don't like shimmer, but I'm all about that
shimmer, glitter life. So now that the eyeshadow's finished, I'm gonna move onto the eyeliner. I'm using Kat Von D's Tattoo Liner. I literally use this all the time. I have yet to find eyeliner
that is very similar to this. I just like the pen. I thought it was felt tip, but it's not. It's actually a brush, and the way it just goes on
is just so smooth for me. So now I'm gonna move on to the lashes. I'm gonna give it a nice little squeeze, and then I'm gonna go in
with my usual lash primer, which is Lancome's Cils Booster. This is from carleemats. "As a part of the college experience, "we all have to interact with new people. "It's easy to start a conversation
with a simple, 'hello,' "but how do you continue one? "By the way, I love you and your videos. "You're such an inspiration." Thank you Carlee. Making conversation with people, whether you're in college
or outside college is really tricky and nerveracking, but it's just something that you gotta do, you gotta put yourself out there. It is scary and terrifying, and there have definitely been
times where I've tried to, like, try to be friends with someone, and just be completely shut off, but you know what, that is
the nature of the world. You're gonna get hurt, but what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger. I would say, you should
try and find something that you're genuinely interested
in about the other person, so whether it's their
shirt that you noticed, or the book that they're reading, or what they did that weekend, just try and find some common ground. And then start tackling them with the who, what, where, why, and how's. If you wanna make friends, you have to genuinely
be interested in them. That's the only way you're
gonna be able to do it. Instead of selling yourself,
be interested in that person. It's like the Dale Carnegie quote. He said, "You can make
more friends in two months "by becoming interested in other people, "than you can in two years "by trying to get other
people interested in you." So ask where they're from,
what their hometown was like, what kind of friends they have, what they enjoy doing on the weekends, what kind of food they like, what kind of books they like to read, what they like about the outdoors. Just literally anything. And I know asking questions
seems like, so nerveracking, like, what do I even ask the other person? Just literally ask them anything. That's how you get started. People are like onions, and
the more questions you ask, the more that you peel them open. It's like the Shrek movie! People are like onions,
it's what Donkey said. (laughs) And that just
really resonated with me. And some people are harder
to peel than others, but once you have that outer layer down, then you've made a friend. There have been many times where I've tried to make conversation with just random people in the street, and it did not go very successfully. I was at the usual cafe
that I normally studied at, Delta of Venus, and I saw this girl just sitting on the table,
and she looked really cool and interesting, and I
really liked her outfit, and I went up to her, and I
tried to make a conversation. I forgot what I said, but literally after
like, the third question, she just stood up and walked away. And I remember feeling so freaking small, and so stupid. And that kind of made me not
want to talk to other people. I was like, you know what, (bleep) it. Like, if they don't wanna be my friend, like I don't wanna be other
people's friend either. But being alone only takes you so far, and obviously, the
loneliness just got to me, and I had to just put
myself out there again. And not everyone is gonna be like that. Not everyone is gonna be a dick. Not everyone is gonna
be super nice to you, but the point is you gotta keep on trying. Once you find a good egg,
once you find a good person, just stick with them and
treat them with respect, ask them everything about them, and I don't think it's weird, like looking at their social media. All the people in my life, I genuinely wanna know what they're up to, so I'm always stalking them
on their Insta Stories, their Instagram, their Facebook. I wanna know what they're up to. Use social media to kind
of prepare the questions. So if you saw, I don't
know, a classmate going to, I don't know, go on a hike or something, ask them, oh my gosh,
like how was that hike? How many miles did you walk? What kind of trail was it? Do you enjoy hiking? Do you like nature? Like (laughs) it all kind of flows. I think it's all about just
starting the questions, and then getting used to that, and just being genuinely
interested in other people. And then they'll be interested in you. Hey wow, that was a very
long-winded question. I've already put the primer on my lashes, and as they're drying, I'm
gonna move onto contour. This is Tarteist's Pro Glow. Pro Glow Palette. (laughs) and I'm gonna use this shade's sculpt, and I'm just gonna start
chiseling the cheeks. Just gonna warm this up. Then I'm gonna use the other side, and I'm just gonna start
contouring the nose a little bit. I've tried to use cream contours, but it's literally so difficult
for me to blend it all out, so I just like to stick with the powders. So now that the contour is
done, I'm gonna move onto blush. This is by Hourglass, it's
in Incandescent Electra. And we'll see how this goes,
it's my first time using it. Let's give it a whirl! "What's the most important
thing you learned "about yourself in college?" I would say that I learned
to multitask really well. Like, I was able to handle
four to five subjects in like a quarter or a semester. And if I was able to multitask that, then I can definitely juggle
all the projects I do now. I also learned how much
my parents do for me. Because when I had to move out, I, you know, you get that reality of like, whoa, I need to do all my dishes. I need to cook for myself,
I need to do laundry. It just made me appreciate
my parents so much more. They do a lot of things for
us that we don't even realize, and moving away from home
is sometimes the only way you can realize that. So blush is done. I'm gonna go back into
the Tarteist palette. I'm gonna use Strobe. And I'm just going to put that all over the tops of my cheeks. Oh my God, this smells so good. It smells like chocolate. This is how I get so carried
away with highlighter. This is actually good, because
it's not too pigmented. Because sometimes when it's too pigmented, I really just look like
a shiny mess. (laughs) So now that the face is done,
I'm gonna go back to the eyes. I'm using this mascara from Shiseido. This is their waterproof one, and I'm just gonna coat
the bottom of my lashes. Oh. I'm just gonna do a
light layer for the top. Nothing too crazy, because I'm just gonna pop
some falsies on anyway. For falsies, I'm using
these ones by Velour. This is probably my fourth
or fifth time wearing these, and I would say they're
still in good shape. So I think I finally nailed
the tools I need for falsies. I have this lash applicator from Velour, and then I also have been
loving Velour's new lash glue. This is so sticky. It's awesome. Like, I used to use Duo before. But this formula is just miles better. So let's finish this off with a lip color. I'm using Dohee by ColourPop,
which is my personal shade. Unfortunately, this is
not available anymore. So just find a nice coral shade
in your collection to apply. Okay, alright! I guess I could answer,
like one last question before I head out. This is from brittany.tran. She asks, "How do you deal
with homesickness in college, "and being away from home?" I remember after two or three
months of being in Davis, I was like, oh my God, I
have to stay here for like, another year and a half? And that was very de-motivating,
but after I don't know, I think after like a good
year, Davis felt like home. And I think it's all about
just staying connected to the people back at home,
whether it's, I don't know, like phone calls, emails, everything. Just make sure that you
always have a part of home inside you, and you'll just
be stronger after that. I think it's just all part of the process, because it makes you
appreciate where you're from so much more. And I was really lucky,
because a lot of my friends back at home would come visit me, like maybe two or three times of the year. Maybe two. But still, it was so nice
to see them in my world, and being able to share that
world with them was so cool. And I don't know, it's
just part of the process, and it makes you stronger. Alright guys, that is a wrap
on this makeup tutorial. I hope you enjoyed it. I feel like this is a really
great, like end of summer, last hurrah makeup look. Definitely rock this to just anywhere where you wanna have a little
bit of fun and experiment. If you would like me to
try another makeup look, please write it in the
comments down below. I would love to try and tackle that. And thank you so much for watching. I hope I've been helpful, or I've entertained you
in some way. (laughs) Thank you, and I'll see
you guys in the next one. Bye! Mwah. (upbeat music) 
(groovy music) - Hey everyone it's your girl Jenn and here I am in the
beautiful lovely Phuket. I am here through through Evolve. And I had a couple of
extra hours to get ready so I brought the camera down and filmed a Get Ready With Me. I'm gonna show you how
I did this really fresh glowy natural look that is
perfect for humid weather. I know it is winter in most places, but in case you are traveling or you live in South East Asia or any environment
where it's hot and humid I thought that this look would be perfect and without further ado let's get started. Hello everybody here is my bare face. Since it is quite sunny out here I'm gonna start with sunscreen first. This is by Murad, it is
their Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It's got SPF 30. And normally this is Ben's sunscreen, but we thought we would
consolidate, just bring one. No need to bring so many sunscreens. I can't forget my neck,
I always forget my neck. Alright so now that the sunscreen is on I'm gonna move on to foundation. I'm using this one by Nars and I've been seeing
this all over YouTube. Everyone is raving about
it, including myself. This has been incredible. I put maybe like a pump or
two on the back of my hand and I'm just going to dot it. I've been using this foundation all week and it's been great
because it is high coverage but it doesn't cake up. This foundation blends so well. I'm in the color Punjab and
it is a great color match, but we've been doing
so many different types of activities here all day and this foundation hasn't
been an issue at all. Okay so that looks blended to perfection. I'm just gonna skip concealer because I feel like the foundation's doing a pretty great job already. Also whenever I'm traveling
to like a humid country or climate I just want to
reduce the amount of product I put on my face because
whenever I do like a full beat in humidity it just doesn't
translate very well for me so I'm just gonna move
straight into powder. This is my favorite
one from Laura Mercier. I have a cute travel
sized one, it is adorable. So a few of you guys noticed that I am no longer Close Encounters on my YouTube channel anymore. It just says Jenn Im now. I just thought it was time for a change. I changed it last week and I just thought it would be smart for me to
just streamline everything because whenever you guys come up to me like 99% of you guys says I'm Jenn Im as opposed to Close Encounters. I feel like only the OG subscribers call me Close Encounters anymore and I feel like if you're OG then you would understand
why I changed it. Like also with the amount
of saturation in the space I just wanted to make my channel as easy to find as possible and since the rest of my
social media accounts, they're all I'm Jenn Im, I thought thatA it would just make sense
to call my channel Jenn Im, but luckily my URL is
still Close Encounters so that will always be a part of me. So now I'm gonna use this
mattifying powder by Catrice and this is kind of
like a insurance for me because I know I'm gonna get oily so I'm just gonna hit this on my key zone which is where I get the oiliest. And I've already tested
this for flash photography. It has no flash back, thank god. So now let's move on to the brows. I'm using Benefit's
Goof Proof Brow Pencil. And I'm just gonna start
drawing in my brows. Since it's the new year it is the time for new year's resolutions
and I am no exception. If you know me I am such a freak for self improvement and self growth and so for my goals for 2018 I would say I just want to focus on improving my mental health. So I want to continue working out maybe three to four times a week. I want to continue going to therapy. I want to meditate at
least four times a week. Before I was really gung ho about meditating every single day but then I started to notice if I was struggling to
find time to meditate I would kind of stress myself out which kind of defeats the purpose. So I'm gonna have, I'm just gonna try and meditate as often as I can. Maybe a goal would be four times a week, but if I miss a day I'm not gonna you know beat myself over it because it is not supposed
to make you feel that way. I also want to try my best
to eat as healthy as I can. So I'm trying, or I'm gonna try my best to have more of a plant based diet, but I'm never going to fully announce it because I think it's gonna
be like a slow transition. I'm gonna start cutting out red meat and then eventually white
meat and then all meat. Just know that I will be trying my best. Luckily in Thailand it's been quite easy to eat plant based meals here, or at least with no meat because the way they cook
their food is so incredible. The spices and the way
they saute their veggies. It just really makes you forget meat and also a lot of the
girls here are vegetarians so it's quite inspiring. So I'm gonna try and take the
habits that I'm getting here from food and bring that back to LA. So the brows are done and I'm gonna move straight into the eyes. I'm using Colourpop's Birthday Girl and this is like an ultra
shimmery champagne shade and I'm gonna just pop
that all over my lids. I love the way this looks on the eyes because it kind of makes your eyes look a little wet if you know what I mean? I think that really
works with this weather. Oh yeah. I wish you guys could just
see how glittery this is. And of course if you've never
used Colourpop eyeshadow I highly recommend you use your finger because you just get the
most color payoff that way. For the blending shade I'm gonna go in with this eyeshadow palette by Too Faced. I'm gonna use Fur Baby which is just like your standard brown and I'm gonna use that for
the outer corners of my eye. For my channel goals I want
to try and figure out a way to just kind of amp up my page. I want to make more fun content like my party for one look book. If you guys haven't seen that video please go check it out. I'll put it in the cards. Me and the LR creative
team worked so hard on it and I feel like fashion videos just don't do as well as they used to or maybe there needs to be like a new like format for them because
I feel like with YouTube it's a little scary to try out new stuff because if it's too different people don't like it, but if it's not different enough than you don't feel excited
about that if that makes sense. But I don't know, I'm
gonna try and continue to figure out how to make fashion videos more interesting and more clickable. But yeah I would love to
know what kind of videos you would like to see. If you guys can be as specific as possible that would be amazing. Do you guys want to
see more beauty videos, do you want to see more vlogs? Yeah just let me know in
the comments down below. Now I'm gonna use I Rough
You as my inner corner and brow bowl highlight. So now that the eyes are done I'm just gonna give my lashes a little squeeze with my lash curler. And then I'll be ready to be primed by the lovely Lancome Cils Booster. I am so loyal to this guy. I'm kind of running really low. I'm gonna have to make Sephora order soon. I packed so many false lashes on this trip but I haven't worn them at all because I just haven't
been in the mood really. I feel like because it's so hot I just don't want anything else on my face that is extra so I've just been working with my natural lashes and they're fine. So while I wait for my lashes to dry I'm gonna go in with this blush by Nars. It is called Intensely
and it looks intimidating in the package but I swear when it's on I think it looks quite natural. I feel like orange really
compliments my skin tone and I feel like it's gonna really work with this look that we've got here. So I just applied this blush
onto the apples of my cheeks and I feel like it
gives like a really soft innocent flush of color. You can skip highlighter,
but I am definitely not. I'm using this Tarte Pro Glow palette. I'm gonna go in with strobe and I'm going to dust this
onto the tops of my cheeks and then my nose and then
of course the cupid's bow. And as the day goes on this
is just gonna look dewier and dewier and it's gonna
look very fresh faced. So the lashes are dry so I'm gonna go in with this mascara by Lancome. This is their Definicils. A lot of you guys are asking about how the wedding planning is going and girls it is going, it is fun, but it's also very stressful as well. I think after our wedding I'll do kind of like a video on
where we got everything so it can give you guys
a good reference point on where to get started. We already got the venue of course. We got the cake, the
flowers, the videographer, the photographer, the linens, the tables. And yeah it's been a lot. I feel like wedding planning is all about tiny little decisions. It's kind of like when
you go to the optometrist and they have that machine and they go A or B, B or C and they all kind of look similar but you know you have to
make the correct decision. So it's kind of like that. And as for my wedding dress I'm getting it custom designed by Mika. We had a meeting earlier in December and that was just kind of like, you know, a get to know you meeting. I showed him my Pinterest board and so we're gonna collaborate together and create the perfect wedding dress. I am so excited for that. We're gonna meet again after
I come back from Thailand and so then he'll have some sketches. And obviously I will be showing
you guys the whole process. I think I'm gonna do like a wedding series of how we created our dress. So stay tuned for that. So I'm gonna finish off
the look with a lip. I'm using this one by
Hourglass, it is called Leader. And it's just like a really
fun vibrant magenta shade. I'm obsessed with this color. I love the way it looks
with a minimal eye. So now we're gonna seal-- (dramatic music) Oh my god, oh god. So now we're gonna seal in
everything with a setting spray. I'm using Too Faced
Hangover three in one spray and I really wish I brought my
Urban Decay Anti-Slick spray, but I forgot it so this will have to do. Mmm, mmm. Oh it feels so good. I just want it all over my body. Alright guys this is the finished face. I have been pretty much rocking this look my entire time in Thailand and I feel like it really suits
this beautiful environment. I have been having the
time of my life here. It's been so incredible seeing the sights, eating the delicious food. It's gonna be hard for me
and Ben to leave honestly, but we've been vlogging
our entire time here. Obviously gonna upload it to the channel so stay tuned for that vlog. I want to thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you guys the next one. Bye. (upbeat music) 
(saxophone music) - Hey everyone. It's your girl Jenn, and welcome back. I am here with an episode of Favorites. And I can't believe how fast the month of March went. Literally, in a blink
of an eye, it is gone. I think a lot of it had
to do with the amount of traveling I did. I traveled a lot last month. And I'm just glad I'm back home so I can sit down and give you the rundown of my favorites. And if you are a fan of Monthly Favorites make sure you're subscribed to my channel. The button is down below. So hit that to join the family. All right, so let's do this. So I've finally retired
my black leather backpack from Daily Look. I got that guy, maybe
three or four years ago and it's been so loyal to me. Or I guess I've been so loyal to it. Because it really fit
everything that I loved. Especially my vlogging set-up. I knew it was only a matter of time until the backpack broke. I mean, it's not broken yet, but it's on its dying breath. So luckily Nasty Gal is having their 70% off
sale, of everything. And I was able to get this
black velvet backpack. It looks so small, but it actually holds a lot of stuff. Like, look at that width. So inside this backpack I am able to fit my
entire vlogging set-up, which is key. It holds my Canon t3i. This is the camera that I vlog with. And, my tripod, this is the Manfrotto one. There's also a pouch in the front which is amazing. You can put your lip colors here. I've even got a photo
from the meet and greet I did in Jakarta. This is me and Xena. I need to put this in
my photo album actually. It goes with formal things because it's got the nice velvet texture. But it's casual, because in
the end it's still a backpack. In March, I got a pair of
new prescription glasses. These are my Copenax. And I just love them so much. I know they're identical
to my other frames from General Eyeware. But this one, has a gold wire frame instead of a tortoise shell frame. I really love the gold because I feel like it blends
in with my face better. I love my other glasses, but sometimes I feel
like, when I wear them, all you can see is glasses. I'm also trying to make more of an effort to wear glasses more often. Because my eyes are not too
happy with my contact lenses. I just wear normal
prescription contact lenses, but since I've been wearing them since I was 12 years old, my contacts, or my eyeballs,
are just a little strained. I'm actually going to go
in for a Lasik consultation later this month. So, I'm a little nervous, but it would be so nice
never to have to wear contact lenses or glasses again. I will let you guys know
how that procedure goes. But for now, gonna try and wear my glasses more often. I absolutely love these guys. Moving on to clothing favorites, here I have this graphic
tee by Suburban Riot. It's just a crisp white tee that says, Word Hard and Be Nice and I was wearing this
pretty much my entire Austin, or Jen goes to Austin/South
by Southwest vlog. I love this t-shirt and the way it looks with light denim. I love wearing this shirt because it spreads a great message. These are two actions that anyone can do. Working hard and being nice. As long as you do these two things you are on the road to success. And it's always something to keep in mind. Next up, I have these printed pants. I got these on my trip to Bali. And let me tell you these are
the most comfy pants ever. And these are my official
spring/summer lounge pants. They're easy, breezy, and perfect for the hot sweltering
summers we get in L.A. And also, all the girls
that went on the Bali trip got a pair of pants like this. So we pretty much all
having matching pants. We all got different colors,
but I really like that. I dunno, if we wanted to
we could all just match and go out together. For my book favorite I have Ham on Rye by Charles Bukowski. This is an author that I wanted to read since I was a teenager. But for some reason,
just, life got in the way. Got distracted. But I'm so happy that
I finally buckled down and read this book. This had me teleported to
a different time and era. I read this, pretty much, my
flight from Bali back to L.A. I smashed this out. So this book is pretty
much, like, an autobiography or a memoir of his life. But he says it through
the story of a little boy named Henry. Follow Henry from his
childhood to his teenage years to his adulthood. And he's lived a pretty rough life. He grew up through the Great Depression and those were some pretty dark times. His father was emotionally
and physically abusive to him and his mother. And that really took a toll
on the way he saw life. He was very detached and nihilistic. And there are so many parts of this book where literally, my jaw's just dropping. I'm just, like, turning the pages. It's a very graphic
novel, but I like that. I just love Bukowski's writing style. It's so blunt. He doesn't sugarcoat anything. He's clear, he's concise, and it's like cutting through a knife, it cuts deep. I wouldn't say there's a
real plot to this book, so if you're looking for like, a you know, climax and all that stuff, I mean maybe this book isn't for you. But if you're just looking
to get a peek of his life and the way he grew up, and the crazy shit that happened, highly recommend this book. I can't wait to read more of his work like Post Office and Woman. So yeah, check it out. If I'm going to be completely honest I didn't know if I was going to have a face of the month in March. But since I forgot it
completely last month I knew I had to put one in. Luckily, I did play around
with some new makeup products so I present to you The Face of the Month. Which I am rocking right now, so let's break it down. For foundation I've been using Clinique's Beyond Perfecting
Foundation and Concealer. This is a full coverage foundation. But I only use what I need. I love the applicator,
it reminds me of the Tarte Shape Tape Concealer. So I just use the wand and
I dab it across my face and blend it in. And for my problem areas,
like underneath my eyes, around my nose, I just go in a second time and really focus on those areas. Moving onto eyeshadow I have yet again another Colourpop eyeshadow. I just, I can't help it. I just love Colourpop products so much. But in March I really was loving Flipper. This is a gorgeous tangerine color with a ton of silver glitter. When I wear it on my eyes it's like, boom! Glitter. Glamor. I feel like the camera
doesn't capture the amount of sparkle it has, but I love it. And then to blend it
out I'll go in with my Too Faced Sweet Peach palette. I'll go into Candied Peach and I'll use it to kind of blur out the edges. And it just gives it a
nice fresh spring look. For my lip color I have
this baby lipstick bullet by 3 Concept Eyes. And I think this is a really nice rose, kind of like a bold rosey shade. Which I think looks great with the look. It just ties everything together. I guess that concludes
the Face of the Month. I know I didn't break
down every single product that I used on my face. But, I will use, or
leave, that information in the description box down below. So pop that open if you
are interested to know what is on this face. So that concludes my March Favorites. I am so happy to be back home. I love traveling and everything, but I just, you know,
nothing beats coming home to Cheeky and my fiance. I'm going to New york on Thursday. Oh, I'm also having a meet
and greet on Saturday. So if you live in New York. Hold on, let me get the information. Okay, so if you guys live in New York, I am having a meet and greet on April 1st. Oh, my gosh, April Fools Day. So I'm having a meet
and greet on April 1st, I swear this is not a
prank, I will be there. I will leave the
information right over here. So please come and join me if you can. It's going to be at the
Westfield Mall I believe. I would love, love, love to see you there. I will also leave the RSVP
link in description box down below. So, New Yorkers come at me. I would love to meet you guys. As usual, please let me
know what your favorites are in the comment section. I would love to read about them. I really love hearing from you guys. I hope you have a beautiful day, and I'll see you guys on the next one. Bye. Mwah! (saxophone music) 
So a couple of weeks ago on Thursday, 
December 29th, 2016, I proposed to Jenn. Jenn is the most incredible person
 I've ever met in my life Basically since the day I met her I knew
 I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her As this was only gonna happen once in my life,
I had to get it right. So on Christmas Day I'm surprised Jenn to a 2 night staycation at our favorite hotel Terranea Resort. I wanted the first day to be all about 
settling in and relaxing and then the second day is where I take her to
a nice lunch and then propose to her in the room afterwards. I wanted to document as much 
as this experience as I could because I wanted it to be something
 that we could both look back on and I wanted to share this with my friends,
family, and of course you guys So please join me on this journey where
I will show you exactly how I proposed to Jenn. - Hey guys!
- Hey guys! We are off to Terranea Resort Me and Jenn are having 
a romantic couple of nights. We stayed here maybe... 5 months ago?
- Yeah! We absolutely loved it! So this is gonna be nice and relaxing
and it's dog friendly which is very important. So Cheeki can have fun! Yeah it's amazing how I remember after...
It's only been 5 months. We swear like it's been so long! Well for me, it's a long time. So let me take you back a bit. Me and Jenn have both worked with our good friend, 
Vu, from LR Creative. He's a great videographer and once I told him what I wanted to do he was more than happy to be on board. So I told Jenn we have the room 
from the 28th and 29th of December but what she didn't know is I 
actually booked it from the 27th So me and Vu went down that morning 
and our plan was to get everything set up Know what cameras go where,
where I'm proposing, where she's going to watch the video and I also wanted to film an outro for the memory video of me wearing the same thing I'll be wearing
on the actual day just to kinda confuse her and throw her off a little bit . So me and Vu had a lot of work to do. Follow me and then we'll speak to them.
- Okay. Cool! Sounds good. Amazing! Let's do this! Any kind of Instagram Story or
 Snapchat today make sure it's.... Yeah, I realized that we have to be very careful. If I post anything it's gotta be staged where it's like,
"Oh, I'm shooting with Ben, but not for what you think it is." Even the outfit I'm gonna wear when I propose 
Even getting that out of the house was so hard this morning I had to wait until Jenn went into the shower She'd be like, "Why... you're just going to work, but you've 
got this smart shirt and jacket?" How'd your parents handle it when
you informed them? They were so excited. Mum has been saying for ages like,
"When are you gonna marry her?" because she knows that I never really spoke to her
about girls and relationships and stuff but the second I met Jenn I was like,
 "I really like this girl..." and she's like, "What? We're having this conversations?"
and she was stoked. So I'm just messaging Hilary. Hilary is the girl that's helping arrange everything here.
She's been amazing. She helped sort the rooms out, the restaurant, and now she's coming to meet us to help plan where we want to shoot the footage afterwards, going to the restaurant to try and put the camera down and even helping with the flowers and putting down the petals in the room So she is awesome and I haven't even met her yet. If you want I can walk you guys down after and we can check it out and talk about whatever else. So I'm gonna propose to the room after lunch so I wanted to capture us having lunch just to kinda lead up to the moment. Just plant the camera.
It can even be where these bushes are. The camera I'm gonna be using when
 I film over there is gonna be the GH4. Teresa is gonna be moving with the 
Mark 3 and the 7200 the whole time. So she's always gonna be with that. So thanks to the amazing Vu, Hilary, and all the staff at Terranea I was feeling ready. We got everything prepared down to the T and we even had our friend Teresa come 
the next day to help film as well so we felt great! The night before I told Jenn that while I 
was "working" with Vu that day, He wanted me to learn this new editing software and that I should get some content over the
next couple of days Y'know something to work on. Jenn believed it. 
She didn't get suspicious in any way. She thought it was a great idea so that way 
I could document some of the trip as well. The next morning, me and Jenn -
- Sorry, I didn't understand the question. Next morning, me, Jenn and Cheeki were 
off for what would be an unforgettable trip. Wow! I remember this... Enjoying your champagne? Oh yeah!
- It's way too hot for a beanie and a jacket, isn't it? Yeah, it's like 80 degrees right now. Trying to find our bungalow right now We are all far too warm
Cheeki included with her jumper. Wow! Ohh my god! I can't believe it. 
It's so nice. Yeah! This is much bigger than I thought it'd be.
- Yeah! This is insane! There's a kitchen! You can cook here! Look there's weights here! This is our little home.
We've got to get the fireplace going. It'll be so nice there with the firepit and we can have a nice glass of wine or something Jenn is outside working She has no idea that she'll be sitting there tomorrow watching the video and I'll be here about to propose! So it is Thursday morning (the big day!) Me and Jenn are about to have a lovely breakfast. We are very excited about this. This is probably our most exciting 
part of the day, isn't it? - Eating. Oh yeah, breakfast! Especially at a hotel. 
In room dining is a must. What is it, Thursday today? Yeah. Thursday. So we've got a nice day planned. Or is today Friday?
- No, it's Thursday. We're gonna have a little relax and have some breakfast 
and then go have a nice lunch and then we can have a little walk around Yeah, it's so nice! So it is Thursday morning.
Today is the big day. I can't believe it. Today I'm about to 
become the luckiest man in the world If she says yes! We just had breakfast. 
She still does not suspect a thing. We were talking about what we wanted to do today, 
do some hikes, things like that. Little does she know... Vu and Teresa are about to arrive, I think They're meeting with Hilary in a bit to 
go over all their plans and stuff. I have to be careful because Jenn is in the 
room over there. So now I'm just gonna help Jenn film a bit 
and then just get everything ready. I've got the camera set up. I've pretty much done everything I can on my side Now I just have to make sure everyone's in
 place and that there's no problems But I feel good. 
I feel so excited. I'm gonna pick up Teresa right now and 
we're gonna head to the resort. And I'm gonna show Teresa 
where her shooting spots are She's got three major places to shoot from
and then I gotta show her paths to take to avoid Ben and Jenn as they're walking So Ben and Jenn start eating at 1PM We'll have a GoPro set up at the restaurarant I'm gonna do some camera shots and then Teresa is gonna head back at 1 - 1:10 - 1:15 Ben is texting us right now It's funny because it's actually
 really warm over at the resort and Ben is gonna wear this really nice coat and Jenn is gonna be like,
"Why the hell are you wearing this coat?" So he's just gonna play it cool. So this is where it all kicks off All I can do this is keep my cool and hope
Jenn doesn't see Vu and Teresa in the bushes. Oh shit! I don't know if you can see Ben and Jenn just went for a walk and I'm showing Teresa where she'll be taking her second shot but Ben and Jenn actually came out for their walk, so we 
had to run and hide because they could've seen us. We're going to Catalina right now and set up the GoPro and I'm sweating. We're about to go for a nice lunch at
Catalina Kitchen now Oh really? Next to Boshi?
- Bashi So it's a lovely day. I might regret wearing this jacket.
- Yeah, I think you will. We'll see. So Ben and Jenn are about to get 
seated at the cafe for lunch. I'm hiding behind a set of stairs with my camera gear 
here and I'm gonna be shooting right over that ledge. Here's to an amazing marriage and life together. and we're glad we can be here to record it.
We'll see you in a little bit. Good luck! Alright! Here we go!
Moment of truth. On March 13, 2014, I met the girl I would
want to spend the rest of my life with. With the odds strongly against us 
living 5,000 miles apart we knew this was something worth
fighting for So we talked, we Skyped, 
we sent videos. We just felt so comfortable 
in each other's company. You just fell asleep. So we decided 
we had to make this work. I need to see you. And then you came to London. And that feeling when I'm 
waiting for you at the airport knowing that soon I'll have you back in my arms a moment I've imagined a 
million times in my head. This was one of the best days of my life 
you meeting and getting on so well with my friends. You made me see London in a whole new way. You made me laugh more than I ever have before. We got to experience our 
obsession with food together. And then it would just be a countdown 
until I see you again. We'd take a romantic trip to Napa Film our first video together. One roll or two? You came to see me play and convince me to go on a ride after
a few too many drinks. Nothing else matters when I'm with you. You make me a happier person 
and a better person. I'd even get sunburnt at the beach for you, which 
did last about two weeks. We went to Disneyland. and took our first flight together on our
one year anniversary. We hiked of course. I love each and every moment with you. The birthdays The not-so-manly night in's Just being silly with you We'd spend Christmas in London and Valentine's Day in Palm Springs Got a Bloody Mary. It's a good day! It's a very good day. Valentine's Day and I'm the
luckiest man in the world to be with this one. This has been the best Valentine's Day ever.
- Ever! I'd show you where I grew up and introduce to you, Digestive biscuits. We went on a camping trip we'd never forget. You took me to my first Coachella where we
danced pretty much the whole time. You have no idea how incredible you are How sweet you are How kind you are How brave you are You've given me a life here I can never
even dream of We get to watch our angel grow from dressing her up to making  friends I want to make memories with you for life. and take unforgettable trips with 
our amazing friends Every day with you is an adventure and I never want this journey to stop. So Jenn, if you could please turn
 to your right and enter the bedroom where I'll be waiting to ask you the 
most important question of my life.
