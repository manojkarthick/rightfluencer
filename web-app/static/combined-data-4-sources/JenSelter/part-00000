My workout programs -> www.fitplanapp.com/jenselter. 🛁. 🏈 Who went a little crazy on the Super Bowl snacks? • Wanted to take the time today to remind everyone that one cheat meal -- or cheat day -- is not going to hurt your progress.  It’s good to deviate from the norm for a special occasion  as long as you get right back on track the next day.  So today  I wanted to share some tips to cleanse and detox and help your body recover from all of the questionable things you ate yesterday.
▪️Drink a lot of water today! A helpful guideline is to drink half your bodyweight in ounces of water (so if you weigh 120lbs  drink 60oz of water) ▪️Eat lots of fruits and veggies today! Fruits and veggies are super cleansing and detoxing  so load up on all the good stuff today.  A fresh pressed green juice on an empty stomach is a great option ▪️You should stay away from refined sugars and carbohydrates today.  Refined sugars and carbohydrates are highly inflammatory - amongst many other things  so best to avoid altogether! ▪️If you’re bloated  you may want to try some apple cider vinegar mixed with warm water and cinnamon.  Pure green tea also works well. ▪️Exercise  exercise  exercise! No better way to cleanse the body and the soul than to get your body moving and work up a sweat to release all of the built up toxins from the weekend. ➡️Hope these tips help! Life is all about balance  and sometimes that means getting your drink on and eating pizza when game-day calls for it.  Check out my blog for more motivation and inspiration for getting back on track after a cheat meal.. Soooo. Patriots or Eagles?! 🏈 I’m excited for the commercials and JT🧚🏻‍♂️. 1 month down  11 to go. How is your 2018 going? Many of you have been DMing me that you are losing your New Years Motivation. Let’s change that! If you’ve been exercising daily and eating healthy regularly but not seeing any changes in your body  that’s okay! It can take weeks for you to notice change - and we’re talking very small changes - so don’t give up just yet!  Here’s some advice I shared on my blog: Start with small  manageable goals.  You’re going to reach your goal of “getting one push up” faster and sooner than you’re going to step on the scale or look in the mirror and like what you see. So start small  and build on each accomplishment.  Pretty soon that one push up will turn to two  five  ten  and you’ll be one step closer to the body of your dreams. Work hard  and don’t give up! 💪Trust the process. A bunch of you have been asking me to start posting more workout videos  I got you!! Some of my favorite moves with the sliders. What do you want to see more of??. Where are you from?. Don't waste energy caring what other people think about you. If you waste energy being so concerned with what everyone else thinks  you'll never be good enough  fit enough  smart enough  and the list goes on. What's beautiful to some is ugly to others. That's why it's so important to decide what YOU want & spend your energy getting there & feeling good about it. The only opinion that matters is your opinion of yourself. Spend your energy on working on your goals to get where you want to be. When you feel good you look good! You radiate positively and it's contagious. The more time you spend working on yourself (and less time on worrying about the opinions of others) the quicker you'll get to where you want to be and the better you'll feel when you see your progress. I believe that everyone has the power to look and feel the way they want to and it's in your control to make it happen. You can do it! 👊. Feels like all the New Yorkers left me with this snow 🙈 Whats everyone doing for NYE / who wants to invite me to their party?!. Shout out to The Perfect Sculpt and their sweat cream for helping me get that next level sweat during my workout! I’ve been eating like an animal over the holidays and a little more sweat never hurt nobody 💦#ad #fitfam #seltering

Happy Sunday babes! 🌼 I wanted to share some advice for those of you feeling frustrated from not seeing the progress you'd like to see. Self-appreciation and self-gratitude is so important and the mental and emotional component of loving and appreciating yourself is just as powerful as working your butt off in the gym. It's easy to feel defeated and angry if you skip a day at the gym or if you have an extra cheat meal. It happens to every. single. one. of us.  But that's OKAY! Don't get angry or too hard on yourself  you're human.  Instead  love  empower and applaud yourself for working as hard as you do  eating clean regularly and taking care of your body. Exercising  fueling your body with nutrient rich foods and taking mental health days is necessary for a healthy and happy life. And remember to love yourself! Because at the end of the day  why are you taking care of your body? To look and feel good! So remember that as the ultimate goal and always find time to love yourself. You're absolutely beautiful...the rest of the world sees it and you need to take the time to see it for yourself too! xoxo. Hi loves. 🎁 $2 500 GIVEAWAY IS HERE!
