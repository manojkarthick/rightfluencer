Growing up  she was my test audience for all my hobbies - magic tricks  photography  inventing  and my favorite: comedy. If I could make her laugh with a dirty joke she knew she wasn't supposed to laugh at  then I was doing a good job 😁
She encouraged creativity and supported all my endeavors  no matter how insane. I'm glad nothing's changed... except maybe our haircuts 😂

With great power comes great responsibility  which isn't really my thing  so I gave Mayor Ronny his job back.
This pic was taken during a fiery speech I was giving to my fine people of Ruston. Until next time... DEUCES! 😁. ELK CROSSING! Just hitchhiked the entire west coast of the United States & crossed two international borders along the way lololol 😆
No money  no phone (my ride took this pic)  no food or water... all I gotta say is:

SUCCESS.
Add them on lnstagram: @WhyDontWeMusic. THE. GRIND. DON'T. STOP. Just wrapped our music video shoot for my comedy song "Help Me Help You" Feat. Why Don't We & starring the irresistible caramel colored goddess Shay Mitchell 💥
This song/video is going to make you laugh. Hard. Like really hard  I'm talking Dwayne The Rock Johnson hard. Be on the lookout 👀
Add me on lnstagram: @LoganPaul. I'm a very hands-on director. I'm also a very pants-off director. From acting to producing to writing to directing  I LOVE all aspects of entertainment & it's important to me that I'm changing the game both behind AND in front of the camera 🎥
This music video I directed for Why Don't We's song "Something Different" is my favorite piece of work yet; I put my heart and soul into it  these cats are going to be massive & I'm honored to be along for the ride. TO THE TOP!
🔥 (ps  go watch the music video HERE: https://youtu.be/4QKreWPyPwc) 🔥. Wanted to share something cool... I did a campaign on my Instagram where  for every "LIKE" this picture got  10 meals were secured to help #FightHunger in America. 
We got over 1.1 Million likes and raised over $1.5M dollars. Y'all are amazing  thank you to everyone for contributing. MASSIVE SUCCESS!. Maverick: Someone who exhibits great independence in thought or action...
I encourage everyone to be different  break the rules  find your passion and GO. It's the Mavericks who change the world ;) #BeAMaverick 
Get your Maverick by Logan Paul merch HERE: https://shoploganpaul.com/. In the process of moving & realized that Maverick the Parrot has never seen Hollywood Boulevard! 😱
So I took that little choch out there  parked him next to two taxis that oddly resemble his colors  and posted up for a swaggy ass Instagram pic.
Now we here. Happy Easter y'all 🐇. Pumped to see that people are digging my new Maverick by Logan Paul merch 💥 I wanted to create something that inspires people to challenge society... if you have dreams  passions  goals  bring them to life!

Forget about the simple-minded haters  forget about what society considers "normal." WHO TF WANTS TO BE NORMAL?! Normal people don't change the world 😜

The word "Maverick" means: Someone who exhibits great independence in thought or action. Emphasis on GREAT and emphasis on ACTION. 

I encourage everyone to #BeAMaverick --- to be unique  find your passion  work hard  and break the rules. Let the takeover begin 🙌🏼 
Get your Maverick gear here: https://shoploganpaul.com/. I bought a school bus... yup 😂 I woke up one day and said "I need a school bus." So then I got one. Beyond that  I have no explanation 😂 BUT...

AAAAHHHHHH Or like I was on GoodMorningAmerica I am a good guy who made a bad decision I‘ve been dark, like Social Media blackout for a month now and it’s so weird going from vlogging literally every single day for like 460 days to nothing so I just wanted to clear up some stuff you may have seen um maverick actually my clothing line Okay, uh how do I say this we are being threatened to be sued for four million dollars? It's a lot of money a lot of money. I can’t really say to much about it right now My lawyer said I can't.. that's a vlog for another day But for the person who's threatning to sue us tell you what I'm not gonna give you four million dollars but I will sent you a free pair of maverick joggers. Lydia! Make it happen (Lydia) Got it (Logan) I almost f**king died sky diving... thats not its not a pr stunt litteraly my main paracute didnt open I'm gonna you know you're gonna hate me for this Logang I'm gonna save that vlog for another day too. (Crowd) boo! That is another thing though, I ju(sigh) regarding everything that happened. I took the blackout, guys. I met with suicide prevention experts, I made the suicide be here tomorrow video. Just like you guys know, I've pledged to donate $1 Million dollars to suicide prevention organisations. I'm sort of immersing myself in this world and its something obviously, like I'm not going to try to ignore it I can't ignore it. And so I'm not going to pretend like that didn't happen but yeah SKYDIVING ACCIDENT coming soon If you‘re not apart of the Logang like I said..subscribe (Sorry Brendan) Subscribe Also my dad got followed by Cardi B on Instagram. (What?) My brother turned 21. It was his birthday and I didn't even get to vlog it. I’ve been makeing music up I 'll be making hits and the haters are stronger than ever guys. LOGANG It's tough..There's a petition to get me removed from Youtube. So I think there’s only one thing to do. Lydia come hitha, yo check this out Delete Logan Paul's Youtube channel. Check this out. 533,029 have signed Well I'm gonna make sure this get to 533,030 right now, cos I'm signing it. Because, erm F**k Logan Paul, right? (You're Logan Paul.) Huh? I'd f**k me. Ha, Ha, Ha. I can't be saying stuff, right. Argh. Cos I'm caught in this weird balance where I feel like people don't expect me to like, be funny anymore. But like dog..one thing YO one thing I did learn outta all of this No matter how much hate, or comments from random strangers who I've never even seen or heard of in my life. "Logan, you're trash. Logan you're garbage. Rot in hell. Die. Hang yourself." Like, all these it's. It's noise to me I‘ll never ever ever forget who I am and no one can make me think I‘m something otherwise And as long as i‘m learning and approving and getting better as a person Then we good You know what else is crazy, the day that I moved into this house, I gave like a little speech, and part of it. I think this is ironic and important. It was about failure and failing. Check this out. Please, let me fail Let me lose. If you can take, a hit in the face And get back up and learn from it. That is a win. Consider that a win because you are now better and stronger than you were in the past. It’s just like working out, you work out and work out, you work out You deplete your muscles, take your protein shake, and your muscles heal and you're stronger than when you were before. It's the same exact thing. And that’s a fact That’s truth guys, that’s how life works So I'm coming out of this more knowledgeable, more compassionate. But, I, I can't just disappear. Youtube's been f**king wack. Kid's are eating Tide Pods now, what is that? When I was a kid, I ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, not poisonous f**king laundry things. Any way man, your boy is back. AND YO. I didn't realize how much support I had during this whole fiasco. I got message's from er, kids I went to High school with, friends, fellow social media stars, celebrities. Texting me saying like "Logan, we've got your back bro. Stay strong through this." Even you guys, the Logang Man, literally, I don't just say this. We are strongest family on Youtube, no one can stop us Like, ever. Even like, my boy Dr. Phil wrote. Dr. Phil's in the Logang. "Let's call time out here." "This is a 22 year old young man." "This is one thing," "one time," "one bad decision." Let's not judge this young mans whole life, his whole body of work and everything that he’s done over one bad decision.(Logan) Even though, I ****ed up like I'm an idiot. It doesn't feel good to have millons of people telling you to go die. So we also this gym equipment in the gym, bro. I‘ve been getting yolked Also got like 2.1 million likes on my last Instagram photo almost a million comments I will say half of them are telling you to go get run over by a car, but that's engagement, bro. I'll take it. I also realized I am Probably like the most sound bytable mother f***er on planet Earth I am a walking sound byte, there was a second video that went pretty viral about me just like it's causing trouble in Japan and one of the parts is I bought this Gameboy And then they cut it so it looks like I threw it on the ground then tried to return it Game Boy Color how much 95 Hundred? AAAHHHH!!! Excuse me sir? The game seems to be malfunctioning. Yo, you guys are sneaky. You sneaky son's of bitches. They cut out the part were the GameBoy was broken. Now, it's like, it's totally broken. My childhood. It's not funny! Stop laughing at me. ARGH! That was just for the vlog guys. we didn't actually end up returning the GameBoy. I'm not like, I'm an asshole for sure, but I would never do that It's just I realized. It was anyway super easy to paint me as a villain. I could I, watch i‘ll do it right now This just in folks breaking news popular vlogger Logan Paul admits to being an asshole I Am an asshole  for sure wow so many kids look up to him. What a shame what a shame? Back to you Steve But you see what I mean guys the media can twist things so easily. I will say however. This is another thing I want to address. I did go too hard in Japan. I had never been, that happy in my life. I was so excited erm, so I was unleashing that energy through the vlogs. And, er, for that. Japan I apologize. I needed to check myself a little bit. I was going too hard. I don't know why I get more annoying in foreign countries. But I actually have a proposal. I say we take me and Jake maybe too and you send us to North Korea We annoy everybody we find Kim Jong-Un We poke him in his little chubby little tummy until he giggles like a teddy bear and agrees to disarm all of his nuclear warheads Who's with me? ( others ) YEAH! So yeah, yo. It's good to be back. Logang, Youtube , hi, I missed you guys. How are ya? It's time to light this bitch up again! This week's gonna be crazy.

House Tour of the Mavericks house begins now so ironic cuz I started walking
towards the house we're gonna start on the outside okay so two gates for
security purposes we have one right here there's another right here but you can
see there's a truck in the way for all the guests coming through the house we
got this giant gate in case we wanna slam em out that come in sure I like you
I feel ridiculous with your hair yeah it looks ridiculous oh lets start here, okay so this is like a study room now, reminder guys we are
renting the furniture you see in here so I actually want your guy's opinion oh my
brother do this flips name copying the furniture that you're gonna see in here
we are we did not buy it we are renting it for now so we're gonna put our own
little uh chach flavor choch taste on it pretty soon but we actually asked them
to clear this room so this is like a study damn the acoustics with nope and
speaking of acoustics we want to transform this into a studio we are
gonna make so many bangers in here think of the bank row like I don't know mr.
boots gonna go this is the garage it's a cool thing is Raj mirrors to check out
the whips looking good in the garage here's an issue right hey the Yeti is
literally too big to fit in the garage we're working on it we'll figure that
out last base a lot of jurors thinking about getting like a four-wheeler or
maybe like a Polaris to fit back there no storage spot this might be a Evans
room down the line see look it's like which door do you go to there's so many
things let's go through this one cuz I think at least you're cool with houses
bro we decided to come to the front cuz I'm pretty sure I can get in here it's a
big door that's how we do it around here big doors big balls oh the grand foyer
for the first time you were seeing the beauty that it holds
we got like our own little private like meeting room over here million dollar
business deals will go down in this again not my furniture but foggy mirrors
are in apparently and look here it's like a garland of Life Wow that's hot no
yes I'm gonna go around yeah right here dining room I think it's the dining room
just a big old table I feel like we're really gonna eat there but you know just
in case we do we got wine options there's nothing in here now but this is
like a little wine cellar back here okay this okay so this is an
awesome piece of art like I fell in love with this piece of art so I wanted to

yesterday's vlog you guys remember I said the magic of this house lies in the
backyard Oh Mamma Mia take a look around oh don't look so good at night it's
beautiful solo game for me what makes this house
so special is is the look and rustic feel of it it doesn't feel like we're in
LA it doesn't that's what I liked about it like everything we've always been in
Hollywood everything is so big we've been congested and crazy and here it's
like our own nice little retreat our own nice little respite to just chill we
have a nice school we have a hot tub we have fireplaces on fireplace the house
itself has a wood finish that will not stain or rust or get damaged wood
doesn't rust or damaged for like 200 years and it's beautiful like it gives
you that that Lodge feeling that feeling when you go snowboarding with your
relatives or camping or hiking in the woods but at the same time it's still a
modern room the longer you guys watch these blocks

know we don't have the stairs no please but you gotta get used to it come on go
you good buddy come on yo you're gonna hurt poor Lydia she can barely hold onto
you yeah you got it Kong you got you know
what the problem is is that these holes here probably scary no I don't know you
wrestle the tiger yesterday you can't go downstairs is a good transition into a
deep speech I want to do about to get deep Loghain about to bless you all I
don't do this often so listen up okay uh I don't know what I'm gonna say I have
like a rough idea of what I want to say because I feel like the youth the
millenials kids my age heck even adults could possibly take some of the stuff I
say and implement it into their lives because although I'm young I have
experienced a lot of crazy wacky fun interesting things in my life and I've
learned a lot and I've failed a lot and I've been fortunate enough to succeed a
lot I talked to a lot of successful people I mean a lot of talented and
successful people and one thing that they tend to have in common they win
more than they lose to me that is about quality consistency it's not just you
win you get lucky one time and that happens through thousands of hours tens
of thousands of hours of hard work hmm and so many people say they want it and
they don't when I was a kid I've always been the funny guy the goofy guide the
ambitious one the one who stood out the Maverick hence the brand and everything
literally everything that I stand for in my vlog people would look at me funny
they laughed video why is he doing that why is he wearing orange camo jeans to
school as a fifth grader I did that I don't lied yeah I was just like oh I'm
different everyone else is wearing like denim your boy wanted to be different so
I did and I was never afraid or ashamed of that but at the same time I would
always push myself and work extremely hard so that I could be the best I have
this this competitive instinct in me that and that's what drives me that's
why when I get into drama with my brother or like wears clothes and
subscribers like you guys are seeing like the mild version of my
competitiveness I will always run faster if there's someone running next to me
that's just how I am that's how I function and I know that's what makes me
tick so I like to make myself uncomfortable I like to surround myself
with myself with people that are going to challenge me and push me and compete
with me that's how you grow you have to be calm
with being uncomfortable and if you lose     win because you are now better and
stronger than you were in the past it's just like working out you work out you
work out you work out you deplete your muscle you take your protein shake and
then your muscles heal and you're stronger than you were before it's the
same exact thing so what am I getting at when I was young I didn't know what I
wanted to do I knew what I liked I knew I loved creating video but in Ohio like
oh you want to be an actor Coster self that's not gonna happen that was a
mindset that was the bubble I lived in and everyone thought the same exactly
what they were what I like to call drones do not become a drunk I truly
believe that in today's day and age anyone listening can become anything
they want especially with the development of mobile phones and
technology where you can communicate with someone across the world
if you hold a piece of metal up to your phone what is that that's some magic
that's some Hogwarts fucking incredible piece of metal up to your phone I meant
there's nothing holding you back you don't have to go audition for a movie or
a TV show if you don't want why don't why don't you just create the world
yourself and that is what I did I refused to let people tell me what I
couldn't do I decided at 15 I was going to become the master of my own destiny I
had surgery my head I have a titanium plate in my
head I had surgery on both of my knees I cut up in my calf this is the scar you
see here bang bang I sprained both my hip flexors and this was all in a period
of two years at one point you can imagine I pretty much gave up like I was
like dang light with the world hates life hates me why why me why why does
all this negative stuff have to happen to me I was the fastest kid on the
football team and I get hurt and I'm out for the entire season I thought my life
was over I couldn't do leg lifts with the rest of the football team so I would
always stretch instead well guess well new gang I stretched for eight months
eight months straight and then before you know it you're born was able to do
the splits which I'm sure you've seen this video one of the many videos that made me who
I am that made me Logan Paul on the internet
today what everything happens for a reason you might not know what it is at
the time but trust in yourself and work hard and believe that you can get
through whatever struggle you're going through because when I got hurt I said
bullshit everybody I said I am going to be a winner I'm a champion I am NOT
gonna let what's happening outside of me what's happening to my body affect my
brain affect my mental so when I was fifteen I wrote on this piece of paper
literally got coffee stains on it the date is three eight ten over seven years
ago I got hurt and my mom told me to write these positive affirmations down
on a piece of paper I will work the hardest I will do extra work
I will go above and beyond Excel Excel win best Excel win win win I will be the
best I will excel win I will be stronger better faster and smarter than last year
I will be a champion I will be the greatest I will be the best I am the
best Excel Excel Excel Excel I put this in my brain I will gain strength beyond
what seems possible guys I was 15 I didn't even know what half this stuff
meant or how I was gonna do it but I put it in my brain
cuz I am I'm a winner and you are - everyone should believe that they can
win and do whatever they want in their life and if you don't believe that you
should not be a part of the logang because I use you a challenge to you
when you grow up if you want to buy a multi-million dollar house do it yo I
feel like Shia LaBeouf there's no reason you shouldn't or there's no reason
today is a beautiful day to be alive is a magical time to be a human on planet
Earth and I only got one life on this floating rock in the middle of space so
by the time I die I won't be sitting my bed to my deathbed and I won't be like
damn I did it right logang that is the vlog I cannot wait for you to see the
new roommate tomorrow the house in the daytime all the good stuff
copier maverick merge because that's the essence of today's vlog Logan Paul comm
/op it is not a movement it's a revolution of people who are going to
dent the universe low gang I love y'all and I will see you tomorrow take it easy
fare okay I'll take it from here I also bought that painting that was
cool like you'd like that 
yo its a giant kong! Dont film me, dont F*****g film me aye yo, good morning logang, what's poppin? I still feel sick but umm.... why the mood is kinda somber this morning all of us woke up this morning and we found out about the despicable incident that happened in Las Vegas if you did not know I'm sure you do at this point, but... the number right now is at 50 people have been shot and gun-down with over 500 injured this happening so close  to home guys... Las Vegas is an hour flight it like...rattles me the vlogs are usually light-hearted and usually fun but I think when stuff is this serious and people like me with a voice, with an audience. can somehow effect or change or mend the situation I think it's our responsibility to do something but I think it's our responsibility to do so so i just wanna say, if you live in Las Vegas or know anyone who lives in Vegas my heart is with you, the Logang's heart is with you stay strong, the world is rooting for you this happens so often, at this point, they are almost getting brushed off like oh that thing happened that shit is horrible That's f*****g horrible. This shouldn't be like a- daily thing Like that's disgusting Human beings need to change, I'm tired of seeing the hashtag Pray for Orlando, Pray for Paris Pray for Vegas Like thoughts and prayers aren't working anymore We need to f*****g do something so what I'm gonna ask you to do and ask you to ask other people around you to do is emanate kindness positivity spread light, laughter, humor, smiles like f**k man everyone is, people are so negative and you never know when someone's gonna need that little bit of that little bit of light in their life that maybe this guy his name is Steven Paddock maybe if Steven Paddock someone said something to him that was nice or something maybe he wouldn't have done this that's the first step I think you can find to reach in yourself start with kindness and positivity and eventually one day we won't have to worry about this bullsh*t anymore okay jake paul is bad k pals xD back to the regular vlog alright, it's a bit weird cause now we're in a little bit weird of a mode but we're gonna start light joke brendon is wearing different color socks u good bro ugh its weird to start the vlog like this what the okay  if your in vagas and your watching my vlog say fucking strong Longans with you.

It did not open there were plenty of articles about this Well now you get in the first-hand live Skydiving accident Logan Paul the day. I should have died. I need to adjust my goggles and put diese it doesn't matter I'm not gonna wear these when I'm in the ring with CSI oh (squeak) Ok addressing that really quickly CSI denied the fight with my dad And he if you actually want to fight me on down there. I am you can tell I it's me because I have the Mavericks on my on my I'm a beast and stuff, so this was the first time Let me go okay by myself, okay? *Dramatic Music* HERE WE GO, GUYS! THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC! Pause it one second you guys good. Maybe I need to flash back to this morning because there's a crucial piece of information I think you guys should know Spencer manager Jeff they were there on the day I did not brief them I'm just gonna have them speak Honestly, cuz this is what happened that morning when we were in class what conversation took place first off I got to start by saying you spoke this into existence literally. It was my fault There's a hard time at all at the beginning of a skydiving class we get into harnesses And they basically run you through some checks right, so we're doing the emergency procedures casually yeah, nothing, but air II gotta know This guy starts starts kind of like letting his imagination loose the wrong way I'm just like yo like what what are the chances Actually happens like why would I why would I cut away of my main treats that kind of open Logan says yo I? Feel like a lot of crazy stuffs been happened to me This could go wrong the teachers like basically just like no there's no way you're gonna be fine You got to know it, but you're fine. I'm like I'm like lady You don't understand weird things happen to me like you have no idea. She's like you're fine and Cuz when you skydive you could die the whole day I saw I brought my 360 Oh that Julie fence came up to us right before the jump Ian. He's like yo you guys gonna wear this 360 camera I was like uh I don't know no really He's like dude just do it I was like so our instructor put it on because we cannot wear cameras yet without the camera never caught it was your jumped Right after so I didn't see any of this happen. You've got to see me splat on the ground, bro Yeah, I know we plan if I am in my parachutes don't open as I'm falling to the ground It's gonna be a Dab and I'm gonna go BE A MAVERICK *Explosion Mouth sound* This is gonna be a sonic sonic boom across this yeah Yeah, guys this was my first time jumping alone. This is my seventh jump my instructor has jumped 2,000 times She's had to cut away twice. Okay, so anyways I go to the plane here. She pushes me out I do flips I send it like a boss or whatever. It's 360 camera looking beautiful during the free Falls I'm fine by the way also notice China that that suit is like trust me the suits are gonna be much cooler That's what we did this morning gotta spend it I'm gonna play this real time, and then I want to talk back and dive into exactly. What was happening Before what could have been the last moment? *Dramatic Music continues* WHAAAAAT? Whoa yeah dude. Oh dude my heart is even party. This is freaking me out for real No fucking idea cuz you literally look like you flipped like okay. Let me explain Let me explain your main parachute takes three to six seconds to open I go to pull the pull the ripcord But he was right as I pull it it gets stuck in this like little square shape so I'm like okay Cuz you're still going right, so I'm like I'm gonna give this a second like it could still open up It's happen before it takes like a second longer to open up, but I'm also spinning right the cord is wrapping around I'm getting a line twist they call it and about four seconds in I realized the pears are still nasty Opening so I started tugging on it. I'm like oh Okay, remember three to six seconds for this thing to be fully open real time I'm gonna play exactly how long it was when it wasn't open *Dramatic Music continues* It's like not it's like 9 seconds. I think I don't know, but we showed you a building Yeah, so eventually. I'm like um I am gonna die. I'm gonna die first up I can't believe this is happening cuz I talked about it this morning literally I had this conversation this morning verbatim.

For forty minutes   Crying like a baby. Bikers, joggers, tourists, runners, they went by me police officers searching for suicidal people went by me twice I'm standing at the ledge leaning over the rail with tears flowing down to the waters and I thought to myself; absolutely nobody cares! and then the voice in my head said ''jump now'', and I did And the millisecond that my hands cleared the rail my legs flew over it it was an instant regret the depression was wiped from my mind And all I wanted to do was live, and I thought it's too late Kevin Hines was 19 when he jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. He is one of the many incredible people that I've been grateful to meet over the past three weeks as I aim to further understand the complexities surrounding suicide. And I know I've made mistakes. I know I've let people down. But what happens when you're given an opportunity to help make a difference in the world. -The backlash against the social media star. -Very popular guy called Logan Paul is in some hot water... - I think he is complete and utter insensitive idiot. ..Taking a break from daily vlogging. Even he says his latest content was his biggest mistake. I want to apologize to the victim, and his family. It's time to learn from the past as I get better and grow as a human being. I'm here to have a hard conversation so that those who are suffering can have easier ones. So I've never been so humbled in my life by a single event. - Were you kind of shocked by it? I was shocked to discover just how big this is. You've never known anybody that killed themselves? -No-one   no one. That was that was that was part of the problem Just my ignorance on the subject. But in Ohio where you come from it's the second leading cause of death. And I know while I'm not able to solve the problem by myself. I want to be apart of the solution. And that solution began across the country in New York City We sat down with Dr. John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention lifeline. We have to change the conversation, publicly from just focusing on Suicide and how something bad is happening, and say "What do we do about it?" Help people understand that the first thing they need to do is reach out and talk to somebody when they're feeling in despair, because you're not alone with anymore they've done studies with people who are experiencing any kind of pain including hanging off a cliff. You could hold on a lot longer if somebody is right there with you. I think as a society, as human beings, we just have to be more compassionate and that includes me too. That's something I'm learning along this journey, and something else that Dr. Draper told me were the 5 Steps that anyone can take to help prevent suicide. Step 1 is simply just Ask. Ask yourself, ask others Are you thinking about suicide. And I know that sounds like a daunting question but literally that question can save lives. Step 2 accordingly would be to listen. Be present, don't make any judgments. And then Step 3 would be, be there for them even after you've already asked because dependability is key. Step 4 is then help them connect, ah whether it's with a friend, a family member or a local suicide hotline therapist. But help them reach out to someone so they don't have to deal with this alone. Lastly, Step 5 is just checking on them, show them that you care. Call them up say "hey "I want to make sure you're okay" "can I check in with you over the next few days?". So one of the things that is so important about reducing stigma is getting stories out there about people positively coping with suicide. Do you guys know anyone I could talk to with the lived experience of suicide Absolutely, we have quite a number of people that we could deliver over to you, yeah. That'd be great. - Yeah. And that's how we got introduced to Kevin Hines 17 years ago Kevin jumped off of the Golden Gate Bridge and survived. These are individuals whose stories when people hear them, they say "you know, maybe I can get through". As opposed to hearing the stories when people have it. an-an- and those... unfortunately, those the stories that we've heard before. Now we're hearing more and more stories of people being more open about it. As I was saying before, Logan, for every one person that dies by suicide, there's 287 other people that think seriously about it, but don't. Those are stories, again, that have not been told. If we told those stories of people who got through it as opposed to one who didn't, imagine what kind of influence that would have on people's behavior. When I found out that one in six high school kids seriously think about suicide. That's that's stunning yeah, this is such a common problem Logan all I want Was for one person to look me in my eyes Say "hey kid are you okay"? I am so grateful to be alive And I'm grateful today. For every millisecond I get to breathe Cuz it was almost all ripped from me by me. What's one thing you would have said to your younger self to the Kevin who was? 19 Sitting on the bus if you were next to you and instead of the guy who pointed and laughed What would you say I would just put my hand on the sh. I'll just put my hand on my shoulder and I would just say "I'm here for you, I got you" We need to be a society that comes together for every person in the community That's going to hell in order to do that every person that's going through hell. Whatever hell has to be honest about their pain and If they're gonna be honest about their pain We are going to collectively Answer the call and be there for that individual because if you don't see beauty and the next person you meet You're not looking hard enough You're incredible dude this is an honor for me. It's an honor for me too From this point on I want to make an effort to contribute and immerse myself in the conversation So I'm pledging to donate 1 million dollars to various suicide prevention! organizations with the first $250,000 going immediately to the National Suicide Prevention lifeline, so they can increase their capacity to help those in need For anyone watching I want you to know you are not alone and most of the time crisis passes So if you or anyone you know feels alone or trapped I encourage anyone to call or even text a suicide or crisis hotline both  of those numbers are below and although. This is a tough conversation. It's important because things can and will get better It's time to start a new chapter in my life as I continue to educate both myself and others on suicide I'm humbled and thankful to say This is just the beginning.... you're not alone. we're here with you forever. national suicide prevention lifeline call 1-800-273-8255 Remember! You're not alone!

 I've made a serious and serious mistake.   And I do not expect pardon.   I'm here to ask for forgiveness.   We were all unplanned on that day, and the reaction you saw was quite common and unhealthy.   We do not understand what to expect or how to feel guilty   I should not post the video, nor should my camera be removed.   And   Stop recording, should have gone.   There should be a lot of other things in me.   And for this, from the bottom of my mind, I'm sorry.   I apologize to the Internet, I apologize to those who watched the video.   I apologize to those who have been affected by mental illness or frustration or suicide.   But most importantly I apologize to the affected person and his family.   Who are my fans   Those who are responsible for my activity and are responding to the responses   Please do not do   They do not deserve it (telling to support LOGIN)   My goal is to give you entertainment through my content (video)   By pushing Simana, I share what I get from buses all over the world   Almost everything was my intention, heartless, cruel   Or malicious.   The way I said, I made a big mistake, I do not expect to be forgiven   I just apologize here   I'm ashamed of myself   I'm frustrated over myself, and I promise to be good   I'll be fine, thank you.

Why are we still here... Just to suffer Seriously though, just leave... Just... Youtube has your ads man... How will you stay relevant without them... Is there enough periods... so many questions left unsolved Stupid (Who?) Oh, okay. How do we start this vlog? Okay. The articles you may or may not have seen are indeed true I. We did a citizen's arrest last night in my house cause we got broken into. And actually I realized we're defenseless, bro, so I got machetes and knives just for shaking people! (But what if they have guns?) I'm gonna get into the story today. I will say if you're a part of the Logang make sure to unsubscribe, here's why... im trash why would you even subscribe do you want to get stabbed? Yesterday's vlog, I talked about how my main parachute did not open and I almost died cause that my reserve had to deploy. (How... HOW DOES ONE HAVE THIS MUCH HAPPEN TO ONES SELF!) *gta 6 leaked footage* And last night someone thought it was a good idea to walk into my house and take a nap on the couch that but like why would you continue filming things that are dead? (like your career) Subscribe and also a cop yourself some Maverick merch. It's the hottest merch in the game, but you say are there example. Thass Muh Boiii Y'all know where to get a merch link  in description (We remember) Or as I like to say merch link  in shop. Now i will say guys, now I will say guys It's dark We have actually spent the whole day talking about the incident last night without sounding like a bitch (debatable) It it did shake me up a little bit. It's very weird having someone invade your privacy and Their motive being unclear  (your famous) about it, right, so that's why that's why we got the weapons (Don't hurt yourself) I don't even know these this whole day has been crazy, but hey. How are you? (good, good) I hope you guys are having a good day I hope my vlogs can distract you from your busy life or with 10, 15, 20, minutes (Seven... But at least your not losing the extra ad in this situation) Whatever it is today's might be short though, but anyways let's talk hey man, how you doing jeff, Must be nice You're still shook about the robbery thing It's not like a robbery you didn't robbing things that I know you did the shaking this is yo I felt bad that this kid came across. He came here when Greg was here and honestly I think we just dive into this here follow me so last night. I'm standing right here around this area and this happened there's a kid on my couch in that room over there who I don't think I invited over I Do you know who it is? Have no idea who it is yo yo what the f*ck So it turns out there's a guy sleeping on my couch this couch  you walk over here? I'll just show you we made a tape figure. (wait where are the police)  So you could really understand what's going on here. There's a dude Just laying here on the couch, homie made himself at home I don't know if he has Knives or a weapon like under him and even scarier than that we came in and we are just from dinner We were here for about 10 minutes, and we didn't hear anything like we Evan was supposed to be here But there was no noise so at this point guys. We are assuming like the absolute worst. I didn't know what to do again, this is a scenario. I've never been in in my life. (You have a lot of those) What would you do? (not what comes next) I don't know, but here's what we did I should have said we're about to merch you uh, and sell them some merch at LoganPaul.com/shop link the description. (It's hella lit yo) (it's not lit) But I didn't I told him we were gonna murk him I don't know what happened guys. I-I got dead you remember when we were robbed when I was a young dog? (great times) I do. This scarred me for life. I actually cried. It was one of the few times I've cried in my life (Are we sure you aren't a psychopath?) the feeling of being like There's someone invading your house when you're out of there is like it's disgusting to me so I hit a point I was I lost it. I freaked out a little bit There's so many thoughts running through my brain mind you at this point guys I'm still screaming and Evan has still not come out of his room yet So wheat like the worst is going to remind? Why is he sleeping so many questions and? Just when I think this couldn't get any better Damn my boy Made himself at home my boy plugged it in yo, you got that full charge daug  compliments of the Maverick house hold  my boy He's charging his phone. Oh God. There was a point where I looked around and I was like What is this you in my house? Do I even live here because it might as well have been his hmm if you're not part of the logang make sure to subscribe also it don't break in to my f**king  house and.. laughs Turns out the cops are here (oh there they are) Sup officer Where is he?? He's in this room. I'll lead  you guys to him Okay, so the cops come in they escort this guy out I'm just still just as confused as anyone else and looks like I'm gonna be go for aggravated trespass And what does that mean? He wasn't and all do fairness? he wasn't like really aggravated Here's a conflict chill and just charging his phone well. Just the fact that he came in the house it a little f**ed up it really f**ked  yea its  f**ed (Mate... You absolute madlad) (Wait hes filming the police) Then we get outside obviously to like file paperwork and stuff, and they're like oh you want to press charges against this kid I feel like the kid made a mistake God knows for what fu***ing  
 reason how that happened but Seriously, if there's one thing I've learned in the past month its forgiveness, okay? So like I don't feel like pressing charges because I don't feel like he came in here with malicious intent. I make hella mistakes. It's part of life. I'm human. I'm just trying to do the right thing I feel. this is the right thing So yeah it turns out I'm a little bit of a hypocrite. I am gonna press charges Just because I thought about it a little more That's what I was thinking about like pretty much all today and the thought of someone coming in and harming one of us or because this conversation would be completely different if one of us was hurt We are going to press charges We're gonna beef up our security. We're getting armed security now, and we're increasing the cameras around our house We're doubling it basically so we have like 40 cameras or other property because this sh**t Ain't cool tape man or real man.

Take it easy 
[FLASHBACK] Good morning, Maverick! Mornin' buddy. Hi, young doggy! How you feeling puppy? That's a good boy! Kong, don't try this at home, buddy. Are you okay? No, that hurt bro! Okay, ayo, good morning Logang, WHAT'S POPPIN? Aw, man... The 2017 Year In Review Video, where do I begin? I guess I could start with...this: [♫] At 22 years old, I bought my first house for 6.5 million dollars and moved my two boys in with me! What's up? Ayy! But I wasn't quite satisfied so I had a koi pond put in [♫] Painted the walls of the guest house, [♫] Bought a giant truck known as the Yeti, [♫] Bought a school bus, then turned it into a Cool Bus [♫] Installed a home theater system, Blah, blah, blah, more material objects Guys the point is I bought a lot of things Including this Rolex, ayy Anyway guys, 2017 was the year of Logan Paul This was my rocket fuel year -- Hi, how ya doin? This was they year that the two names Logan and Paul became a household name Now, before you make your judgments let me stop you guys The legend Muhammad Alli once said: "It's not bragging, if you can back it up" Your boy put a DENT in the universe this year: Let's start with number one: Internet Domination Logang, we've became the fastest channel to hit 10 million subscribers in the history of YouTube EVER! [♫] It took us 333 days and I got my diamond plaque which is pretty cool! [♫] But the plaque was only a small representation of how strong the Logang truly is: We realize our true power after we make history by shutting down the Dubai Mall with the biggest meet and greet in the world. Yeah. [CROWD SHOUTING] Next level. Guys, 2.8 billion views on YouTube this year, even old people know who I am I also continued to break down the barriers of traditional Hollywood as internet star turned into actor! [♫] I played a character, even more chocted up than me named Ricky Bowin in a movie called "Valley Girl". This will be my first movie going into theaters Uhh..It's coming out June 29th, by the way! So, save the date. [♫] Yeah, it's produced by MGM, it's that lion that roars? Yeah, that's the one. I also in a movie called "The Thinning 2" It'll come out around the same time next year on YouTube Red, so save that date too. [♫] And then I also did a second season of my show "Logan Paul VS" I went on an episode of Top Chef, I did a Demolition Derby, I wrestled and alligator! I dressed up as an old person for the day and went to a retirement home, I hitchhiked for Canada to Mexico, And I was the mayor for a small town in Louisiana for a weekend. And lastly let's not forget about my movie "Airplane Mode" starring all of your favorite YouTube Red this January -- I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you that, oopsie. [♫] So, that's cute, that's pufu, but the biggest game changer for me, the thing that helped me build all of this was when I started the hottest clothing line on the market, Maverick by Logan Paul. [♫] We had our first Maverick pop-up shop in New York and we shut down SoHo for three days straight. It was insane seeing everyone joining the revolution and following the brand. It literally cost New York City police a quarter million dollars Because my planning wasn't the best, it's my bad New York... Oh yeah and I took off my shirt, what's new? But it's funny 'cause my second pop-up store was on a first-class flight to Dubai. [♫] And just another fair warning, I don't think I'm allowed to fly on that airline again, "You're gonna throw me off the plane?" But that's all good 'cause that was fire, baby Wow, life is amazing. Guys, I've learned a lot this year too. And I think even though I am a young choch everyone can take a piece of wisdom from my experiences, 'cause I've done a lot of sh*t Guys, I believe life is about a mindset it's about perspective, or how you look at things. For example: Check this out. Ayy... So for me guys, the grind is real like I'm barely sleeping But, I found what it is that I love So I started saying: I don't work, but I work hard Maybe start thinking like this: "I don't have to go to work, I get to go to work" I don't have to go to school, I get to go to school I get to learn, think, grow better Because not everyone has that luxury [♫] Needless to say, 2017 was absolutely crazy But let's go rapid-fire for a sec because here are so things I left out: I shipped my roommate Evan to Paris in the bag I crashed Francis's first Saturday Night Live I hung out with the Rock again I faked my death, and then got kicked out of my apartment again for that But then I moved and also got kicked out of my apartment for that too I officiated a wedding, I filled my brother's pool with slime, I presented a Billboard music award, I filled my bus with balls, I found a homeless guy try to steal my bus, I touched reptiles with my mom, [♫] Yeah, I also had the secret service arrest my brother Jake, I also made a diss track, against my brother that got 200 million total views after I released the second verse: ♫ I act in movies that your fans watch with their baby sitters ♫ But! That's only 'cause he made a diss track against me! ♫ The Logang is sh*t ♫ He didn't mean that, we both ended up apologizing but, I did perform the second verse live: [♫] ♫ UH-OH THAT'S ALISSA VIOLET, USED TO BE YO CHICK! ♫ Twice. *laughs awkwardly* Like I said guys, we made up with each other, I actually love the kid Jake, I love you. ♫ I love you, my bro. ♫ Sidenote: Don't use us as examples to handle with your family That's beef, that should've stayed offline, but we're both stubborn and our egos are too big I met a boy-band named "Why Don't We" I adopted them as my little brothers and directed a music video of their's that got 30 million views Then made a song with them that got 169 million views that you may have heard. ♫ Help me, help you ♫ ♫ Girl, what you tryna do?♫ ♫ 'cuz, I don't got a clue ♫ ♫ No, I ain't no Scooby Doo ♫ (♫ Help me, help you ♫)
♫ No, I ain't no Scooby Doo ♫ ♫ Help me, help you ♫ "Girl what ya tryna do" Guys I also made a song with Desiigner I flew a fan to Los Angeles to make a music video with him, I won 2 Teen Choice awards Then I flew to Tennessee to watch the solar eclipse, Then I made it on Jimmy Kimmel and then I broke the Maverick Bugatti, yes, I broke that Then I went to the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa I'm almost done, I got a dog named Kong I got tackled at VidCon Vacationed in Hawaii Saw paparazii in the beach in Hawaii That wasn't cool, by the way... I gave a Loganster a tattoo, Bought my roommate Evan a Rolex, then bought him diamond grills, bought myself diamond grills, Got crazy at Burning Man, flew to Italy to surprise my brother Got arrested by Italy police Bought the biggest pumpkin in California, dropped it Used the crane to take a ride down my new street, Dropped 3,000 pounds of dry ice into my pool, Made 40,000 pounds of snow on my front yard Surfed on the street on a Christmas tree, Put a million Christmas light on my Cool Bus! And if there's one thing I've learned: They say, life is short but this year, I realized life's not short You just gotta do more [♫] Here's some other stuff I learned from this year: Number one: Exceed expectations. It's not overacheiving but it's doing that little extra step to impress people Two: The theory of yes, but no. Where everything is possible until it's not and even then, it's still possible Number three: You're a team, your squad, the people who you surround yourself with. Make sure those people are willing to put their heart and soul into every project you undertake and find people who are just as crazy as you. [♫] And lastly: Be different Be a Maverick, don't be afraid to go right when they go left That's how you dent the universe, what is no one else doing? It's called "marketmaking" Personally, my goal isn't to be the biggest actor in the world or even the biggest businessman I'm gonna be the biggest entertainer on the planet, So I gotta do both of these things [♫] And it's so crazy 'cause the scary part is: [♫] The part that most people don't understand: I'm just getting warmed up. :) And at the end of every year, I hope I can stand on this planet and say: THIS HAS BEEN THE GREATEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!

Well hold up the Tesla's electric protons in the battery charged No, it's not because Andy forgot because you brother showed up last night No, no Jake apparently last night distracted Andy and he forgot to plug the Tesla in look at that it says 0 miles! Yo, so what happens if a Tesla dies like you can't have someone bring you gas because it's electric and there's no like chargers on The road we'd have to get it towed we would have to So, the car decided to turn off the AC and heating and every oh This is terrifying I know for a fact Elon did not design his battery to actually run out of battery He knows humans are dumbass and I feel like he accounted for this. We gotta tell Andy ANDY!!!! So, we have some bad news Andy, it says zero. We got no miles! No and a we got this I have no idea if we got this I feel like we definitely don't got this battery power very low oh boy It's all Jake's fault because I got distracted! Bro, that's what we said It's Jake's fault Jake oh my god, literally guys. I had one request when I saw him. I go please Stay up.

That's very unlike me Though look how much this plant slide. I moved it for ambience but look I know right here get back here for ambience Okay, anyways back to the topic at hand why I'm going to Italy to surprise my breath. Okay. Let's rewind a little bit Let's go back to the Lamborghini prank which happened on my birthday April first Shake you mother so then as you guys know I was like the only way I can get him back The only way I can win is if I actually go out and buy a Lamborghini well we went to the store I had you guys actually help me customize it like Logan comment below What color you want me to get since Jake and I decided both to get? 2018 Lamborghini, Huracan, Papa Mountain they were not available in the US just yet And they said we would have to fly to Italy to go and retrieve them. I was like damn. That's an experience That's cool Good to go with my brother pick up some Lambo And then it hit me after I had time to like think about it cuz yo You guys know this I'm a maverick once. I have time so like actually used my brain That's that's that's where things go south for me. Yeah, so I was like you know like Jake loves cars He loves spending his money on cars on vehicle We were even texting once about like how happy we are for each other and how this life were living is absolutely insane And he's like bro. I just want to drive fast cars. I was like That's I see that me. I'm not the same bro like I don't I like cars I don't love car the Lamborghinis a lot of money like that's no joke and I'm spending that much money on something I should I should freaking love so then I made the decision to not get a Lambo like for me I was getting a Lambo just to get a Lambo not to like actually like drive it and enjoy which is not a good reason Like super sunny or something Brendon follow me over here. Hi okay, and then I got the g-wagen the Yeti That is a vehicle I will drive every day and be that that is me so I got my cool vehicle It's getting absolutely decked out right now actually when we get back We are gonna go get the Yeti, and and the cool bus finally yeah big moves, bro So we have that to look forward to after Italy But anyways decided not to do the Lambo and I had to tell my brother Jake obviously I am NOT getting a Lamborghini with you So he thinks he's gonna go to Italy alone and pick up his Lamborghini little does he know older brothers gonna come in for the surprise and that moral support Moral support that doesn't look like moral moral support, Brendon, and maybe uh who knows after all I'm a prankster Maybe I am getting the Lambo Okay, I'm gonna stop causing a scene in the airport. Sorry everybody. I'm the Last wing of the trip, it is a verifiable fact that the plane has propellant I haven't seen this since the Vietnam War and those were just on the submarines anyway this plane reminds me of like a private jet Like look how small this is hi?

If he wants to fight me I'm totally on board. I'm officially done with the Paul Brothers! KSI VS LOGAN PAUL a boxing match is in the work *clap*x3 Yes Yes Yes, this is it guys, logang! This is the video YouTube has been waiting for. Yes, this is it guys, logang! This is the video YouTube has been waiting for. This is actually my second attempt at making this video because in the first one i went too hard... so I took a chill pill (uh) gonna take it easy on this one and keep it somewhat professional guys Okay, here's a little background. A British youtuber by the name of KSI. I think he's actually the UK's biggest youtuber He had a boxing match against this other youtuber and he wins the match and I'm sure you guys saw it for no reason at all he calls out my brother and I KSI: Jake Paul, Logan Paul any other Pauls i don't care Logan: Okay weird cuz I don't really know this kid. I've had one interaction with him about two years ago at the Super Bowl Uh we wanted to meet up. He texted me. He said try and find me I'm the black guy *Wut* Okay, and so we took this picture together. I barely talked to this guy and then he calls me out for the whole fu**ing internet honey no, honey no What's even worse he planned this out like he almost forgot to call me and Jake out we see him wait He's like the guy's like is there something  you want to somebody want to call out he's literally like Guy on the mic: is there anything you want to say to someone out *nothing* you said you wanted to call someone out. Logan: Huh he almost forgot, bro JJ. I hope you're writing the white DJ Kahled. Thank you letter. Cuz you owe him one bro out of all the YouTube drama honestly. I've never seen something sucked so dry. How many? Fu**ing People can make a video about this topic. Jesus mother of God I'm here to cut the shit, it's over with this video drama's done about to clear this up the question the que- hohohohoho Am I? Logan Paul going to fight KSI the real-life Scooby-doo of YouTube KSI: he's just run away from everything Logan: he's just run away from everything Hearing you laugh is worse than listening to your music More wishes. Making more wishes for all these bitches yeah. Y'all have seen the videos guys, there's the videos of me training at the Mayweather gym see me talking about the fight on the jet and the verdict is Yes, it looks like I am fighting KSI, this is going to be. THE biggest event in youtube history by far Nytho! Possibly the biggest event on the internet ever it's Mayweather versus Mcgregor but but even on top of that. It's the UK. versus the USA  like this Shit's got diplomatics. ITS GONNA BE LIITTTTT  *explosion* sorry bout that Couple things I want to clear up that one I know KSI I wants to fight in England his home Which is actually dope I love England. I love my English fans in fact. I may go far to say after the fight that England is my city, but honestly, bro I'm an American boy like I want to fight in the US. I'm also gonna suggest ksi listen closely to this a neutral place I'm also gonna suggest KSI listen closely to this a neutral place Maybe like Dubai absolutely my favorite city in the entire world. I don't know I think that could be cool, but honestly I want to leave it to you guys, so I'm gonna put a poll in one of these corners Where you think and want us to fight we got the USA obviously with the UK and neutral city like Dubai so yeah take the poll right here and to be honest while you guys are doing that I just want to say I'm down to take your made-up bedazzled random YouTube belt any in any city to be honest I'm cool with whatever you want. I am gonna respect that you won the last fight So that's this is my gift to you. Another thing guys. We know he doesn't want to do MMA Uh, yeah, probably a smart thing to avoid something like this yeah, that was me in my wrestling days. But f**ck it. Fine you want to box I'll box. Here's another one DJ Khaled on 'em. KSI bro. I'm not wearing headgear Dawg, I don't want to do that. That's the last thing. I want to do I think it's the silliest thing in the world I know you wore headgear in your last fight and to be honest man. If you if you insist on that I don't really have any interest in fighting you and also I want to know what you guys want the audience you guys are the Most important you're the ones we were doing this for Can you shut the fuck up bird? I'm vlogging just the bird we okay vote head gear, no headgear Uh if it's a rules and regulations thing and like we have to do it like okay fine But I want to do everything in my power to avoid that I know in one video You said KSI: you and I both know that we had to wear head guards for health and safety reasons, Logan: okay? One if you're worried about health and safety. I'm not really sure why you're getting in a boxing ring, two If you're worried about health and safety. I don't know why you're getting in a boxing ring WITH ME Another one guys weight classes right? I'm 210 pounds JJ's like 182 i am heavier than him so KSI, bro We got to meet somewhere in the middle I could probably get down to like 190 while still having energy and like being able to fight because I've already like kind of slim I would plan I would plan on You having to gain muscle weight Lastly, I want my brother Jake Paul to fight KSI's little brother uhh Deji? Think that would be great I also thought if your dad is down my dad is down to Box your dad Yo, that would be crazy your entire family versus mine it would be crazy, so yeah, ask your dad if he's down Also I'm aware all right look. I'm a fucking  beast, but this is not gonna. Be easy. I am very impressed By KSI's body transformation a little mounted boxing he was able to learn in four months And I'm not treating this like I'm the king from the champ. I'm gonna train hard. I'm gonna work hard We are not under estimating this kid I'm going in there with the mindset that someone's face is coming off And it can't be mine it can't cuz I need my face how u doin The goal is to make waves to provide you guys with the most entertaining fight You've ever seen to make history to globalize the Maverick Revolution show the world the power of the Maverick and show you guys that when you've been faced with a challenge when you've been called Out you feel like you've been wrong therefore it work hard work hard every single day face the challenge Overcome the adversity cuz that's what this is about son you called off the wrong This at maverick revolution part of the Maverick Enterprise guys This is no joke this is gonna be the biggest show in the world.

F* ck everybody! Hi neighbors, it's me Logan All neighbor jokes aside, one of the big reasons I got this house is like the sound is constricted. Like everything it stays within here so When ya boy is screaming, no one can hear me except Brendan; sorry Brendan. Logan, what's wrong with your hair? Brendan:That's a good question.- Yeah, uuhh. We just moved in, you guys know, you watch the vlogs Eeheh, I FORGOT MY COMB I don't- I can't locate it. When that it happens, this happens. Aye, It's me, vlog boy. What, turn left? Oh, sh!t, ass.

So Lily asked- or she told me two things. What did you say? Lily: Is that your Gucci ring?
Logan: This is the Gucci, yo, Lilly knows, she's in the Logang, she watches the vlogs. And what was the second thing? Lily: Can I have your hat? Normally I would, but today I can't cuz I'm a bit of a mess. But uh, thank- thanks for... living. Uh, uhh... Lily: Bye! Logan: Awww, we're talkin speakers! Ohhh my God, yo, so these are like the speakers you put throughout the house for the ultimate rage fest, bro! But I'm looking here, like what- how- since when did speakers become flat? Brenden: It's kinda sexy, right?
Logan: You could eat a meal off this. Brenden: You're going to, aren't you?
Logan: Probably. I don't know dude, there's so many options
and frickin decisions I have to make... *UHHHHHHH* I'm just a vlogger in this store. Don't mind me everybody, sorry! That's a box. Talkin to a box. How many employees does it take

The wallet... It's gonna be ok, baby. Hang in there, wallet! *Dry heaving* So much money. Brenden: The bangerz, bro. Logan: THE BANGERZ, BRO. So while she's doing this, uhooo,
I feel like it's a good time to plug the merch. I don't even need to say it,
it's the hottest merch in the game. It's the softest merch in the game. Y'all know where to get it: Brenden: I like how every time you buy something expensive, you plug the merch immediately after. Logan: Cause I- Cause I realize I'm running out of money. So... So Logang, just know I- I appreciate you But honestly, it's F*CKIN LIT BRO! I hope this goes through.
I just bought that like $12,000 with Gucci the other day. *whispers* What if they block my card, bro?? Ohhh, it's approved! This is my big day!
Brenden: That no-limit AmEx.
Logan: THAT NO-LIMIT AMEX! *SAD MUSIC* Yo, I f*cked up! What the heck?
I hate spending money bro. Ohhhh my God. *Logan's thought process*
Brenden: What? What? Logan: I actually f*cked up! Brenden: What? What did you do? Logan: I forgot Maverick. We forgot to get Maverick. He's still at the other place. Brenden: There's nothing else in the other place! Logan: NOOOO HONEYYY!!

 What do you think of Logan Paul ... Logan Ball?   (Logan Paul)   (Logan Paul)   The boy named (Logan Paul)   (Logan Paul Flugs) Season   Good morning, Loganj, how are you?   It's just a matter of time, before we jump on this and then slide into the pool!   Hello (Hong), I am delighted to see you, my friend!   Lose this, look at my face!   beautiful is not it?   I know I look like you (Freddy Kruger), but I'll explain it later, but first ...   We have men of blessing!   How are you, Jack? How is it, my friend?   How are you (Greg)?   DAP!   Have you come back? Yes, what do you think of my face?   That's what I'd ask you about!   It's crazy, because I know when you think: "(Logan), you're disgusting, you're ugly," right?   No, I wear the products, for this I still look good!   But really you guys, we've just released this red-blue cap!   It's new, to bring some of them but you guys ... you know where to find them: loganpaul.com/shop   When I say this, it's not a joke: it's the best and the best products in the arena!   Hey man, Logan, it's good to go back to filming!   In addition to these young people here for a special reason, you know that when they come, something important will happen!   We have to fix things, right?   We had a problem yesterday, there was some chlorine in the water!   Yes, my brother, you almost died a koi fish, you saw it, you guys!   yesterday   (Branden), no !!   No   It was tragic, but we are fine now, things are fine!   We brought you something to make up for some fish!   Fish worth $ 6 million!   More harsh!   The value of these fish is $ 6 million permission?   The value of these fish is the same as my home value!   We'll go into this, but I think you should see what we've done today!   This is why Badawi is so in fact!   I ... I did not talk about it? I can only show you that!   But first, if you are not part of Logan, make sure you subscribe to the channel!   We are the brightest family on (YouTube), and that's a fact!   I think we are again the fastest growing channel on YouTube! Who can stop us? no one !   By saying this, let me get back to this morning!   There is not a day in the house (Maverick), how are you?   So this is (Jake), hello (Jake)!   You do not have to mix it with my brother Jake, he's a special effects artist!   (Jake) with a double wave, I like it!   We will put a beard on (Logan) today!   Yeah !   If you guys as you know, I've been the center of controversy in the past few weeks!   A lot of people said things on Twitter, it's a superficial version of the Internet boom!   Which is another problem in itself, but what intrigues me is:   What will these people look like in real life? When they say the most miserable things on their phones!   But in real life, they will not say anything!   Sorry O (Branden), sorry Oh (Kong)!   So I got the idea, I wanted to deny the shape of someone who does not look like me, then go to a campus and put this question to people:   What do you think about Logan Ball?   Will this succeed?   Do you think so?   Yes printed ... well!   I think my way is talkative, cheerful and funny enough to say, "This is a stupid man!"   But, I think we'll find out!   Oh, my brother, I feel good!   I feel I hardly look like Logan Ball, who is Logan Ball?   Looks pretty yes!   Looks like an angel!   The last test, will he recognize (Siri), it will unlock the iPhone (10)?   What the hell is this, brother?   No, it seems like I'm about to kidnap children!   What is that ...?   Gosh! Well, you know what they say!   Do it differently! You know where to find this: loganpaul.com/shop   So, I think the conversation will look like this!   Hello, I'm not here to touch your penis, what do you think of Logan Ball?   Well, if an optional reason for the university is that they are always screwed up ....   Forget it! I photograph Flug!   Second, because they are very stubborn, right? Do not be afraid to express their opinion!   So in Twitter ...!   I am curious only if they say the same thing in real life!   In addition, university people are my experience, but as I said you guys, I'm very polarized!   I feel like you either love me or hate me!   So, this should be fun!   I just hope they do not call the university students at the police and say, "There is a child raider in the university!"   Remember, I'm not here to touch your penis ...   I have touched my penis! Well, I have touched some of them!   Channel 69 Clyde Daniels   (Clyde Daniels) here in a live broadcast from the University of (UCLA)   How do the media stand? Try 2   Channel 69 Clyde Daniels   (Clyde Daniels) here in a live broadcast from the University of (UCLA)   Channel 69 Clyde Daniels   (Clyde Daniels) here in a live broadcast from the University of (UCLA)   Channel 69 Clyde Daniels   Bring attention to the viewer, bring enthusiasm!   Well, here we are!   Channel 69 Clyde Daniels   Surrounded by university students who are sexually harassed, I am here today to discover what they think about the star of the websites ...   Sir, sir? Do you mind a quick interview?   Well, it's OK ... Do you use social networking sites?   Yes, what is your name, sir?   (Cream) (cream)! I like this!   (Northern Cream)? Exactly!   No, insensitive!   Channel 69 Clyde Daniels   Do you use social networking sites? Yes!   Well, no platform specifically?   (INTEGRAM) Where do you speak worse?   Specifically, who speak bad words? Are you aware of developments (Donald Trump)?   I am very familiar with the themes (Donald Trump)!   I respect this! Now, are you familiar with the topic (Logan Paul)?   No, who is this?   What ...?   Haha, is there any more fame?   Channel 69 Clyde Daniels   So, are you using social networking sites?   Yeah   Are you mad?   It's fun!   Do you use social networking sites? Yes!   And? Yes!   I respect this, okay!   How often do you use social networking sites?   On (Facebook) ... That's a lot, that's a lot!   Any application specifically?   Lots of them! Such as Twitter?   (Twitter), yes! Really? If, I'm sure you have an opinion about (Donald Trump)?   Yes and?   He is definitely there, he is physically there!   Yeah   Using social networking sites? Absolutely!   What ordered (Kylie Jenner) that?   I'm surprised how everyone did not know she was pregnant! I thought everyone knew this   I have the latest news ...   Do you have the latest news? what's the baby's name? what's the baby's name? what's the baby's name?   (Kyle)   So you're talking bad words (Snabshat)? Yes!   So when you do that, do you say to yourself, "Hey, it's so wonderful that there's a phone between me and this person I'm talking about bad words?"   I mean I never thought about this .... Yes   What would happen if I met him face to face and beat you up? What will happen?   I mean I will deserve it, I was talking about him bad words!   Well, I respect this!   (Clyde Daniels) is coming up with excitement!   Hello!   (Donald Trump), do you like him or do you hate him?   I do not want to say ... ok, there's no need to ...   Do not like me!   Well, I respect this!   Speaking of people who dislike people, what about that character (Logan Paul)?   No   Do you mean the video of Suicide Forest?   Too bad, right? Senseless?   Right !   From our perspective, we do not think that was a good idea personally!   The person who hates the internet or something like that?   This is a fact, a verifiable fact!   I think that was a bit stupid!   I did not watch the video at all, but I heard the talk of the actors about it!   Yes, it was a reduction of respect, but at the same time ...   I do not think that was really his intention!   It was too much!   So you do not think we have to throw it out on a building? No, of course not!   This is total hypocrisy!   Opinions about (Logan Paul)?   Do you have any opinions on that?   Do we throw it in the fire? No!   Let him throw it into the fire!   I agree with you, I would do the same thing if it was my own!   Opinions, comments or questions regarding the Logan Paul case?   Well, I think Logan Bull did not deal with the suicidal jungle well!   I think his first and second apologies were so ridiculous!   The way he came back was very modest!   Video (Suicide: Be here tomorrow)? Yes!   Modest? Modest?   Despite the donation of one million dollars?   This is not a large amount is not a large amount, but will the money help?   No, do not be stupid ... So what will help?   Well, what would help to forgive him this sin?   Only with the passage of people, prove to people that you are not Savola!   Then ...   Personally I agree with you, if he could stop being a Savola ...   We were to be okay!   Channel 69 Clyde Daniels   Give me all these flimsy wires, we'll have a surprise attack!   Hi, how are you? Not after we're here! How are you?   I just came to ask you questions about social networking sites!   With regard to the boy named (Logan Paul)   Do you have any opinion on this?   I do not like why?   It is disrespectful   I agree with you, do you think we should forgive his mistake or not?   Whatever he does, he publishes it anyway! I'm sure he has an emerging audience to follow!   Deploying such things makes it seem acceptable to do such things   Especially children who do not have much experience of life   Use your platform and think carefully about how to use it, before you start teaching other people to do certain things!   When someone makes a mistake, and is meant to hurt other people, it is worse than making a mistake and not realizing the seriousness of its consequences   I did not mean it in a malicious way, I do not think so!   I know that people have to be tolerant of others   We all make mistakes, and I think ...   But the mistake he made is not the kind that you can say is just a mistake   This is true but I have done things in my life I regret it   What ? Talk in detail, so your parents will hear you   To my parents   Scissor!   its enough   Just forgive everyone I understand my intention, I do not think he has .... - even if Harvey and Weinstein?   Personally, I think we should forgive people   So Harvey and Weinstein? Yes I think so - wow! What is your problem, yeh?   With my respect for you is ... is .. No!   Sports Games ! Focus!   I agree on that   You have arrived, what do you think of Paul?   I want to be alone   Well I thought so   What do you think about Paul? Logan Paul?!   What do you think about Paul? Logan Paul that guy?   Enter the library now   After 10 seconds   We were asked to leave the library   What do you think about Logan Paul's character?   Not an interesting person   I mean people give him too much attention and make his mistakes pass easily   I mean he apologized and that's OK   I have only one question: What do you think about Paul?   Well I mean that this is you now, I can see .... - No I clot let's start from there   Much like that man on social networking sites   I mean like ... when I watch it like ...   If you see something from that view it's like ...   You will not respond to it like ... you will not know how to give a reaction   Maybe just laugh because it's like ...   Do you know how he put Logan Paul?   You're Logan Paul - I'm Claude Daniles   He does this because he does not know how to react to it ... he tries to like - the bottom left is the number of times a word (like)   What do you think about Paul?   I mean I know you're Logan Paul   I'm Claude Daniels   It's like you do not know how to analyze all this, I learn   The total number of such words is 18 times   Have you ever experienced anything similar in your life?   No, I hope I do not but   I hope you will not do so, too, yell, thank you very much for your time   Are you aware of the status of Logan Paul?   He was walking in the forest and passed by someone who had committed suicide not long ago   So he was the man and then he ...   He posted it on social networking sites, and people were very upset with him because he posted a video of a body   Yup   Do you have ideas or comments?   It was often inappropriate, but I do not know whether he did it intentionally or not   If he did not do it on purpose   Can it be forgiven? In order to be forgiven, everyone can forgive them   So Harvey and Anastin?   There is always an exception   If there is something accidental, I do not know should not have been outcast as I understood   Well, but how can you accidentally shoot a video and then produce it and then upload it online   It was not attentive   I respect you ! Thank you for your time sir, well we'll see you later - that's fine   I see you asking some questions - yes   Maybe I can ask you some questions - but can your questions wait only a few seconds   Yes of course   Well if that's what we do ...   Well is it now a good time? - Both   Job canceled   Do you like flowers?   Yes - Cancel the task   Do you guys want to come out with me on time?   I will leave you at eight o'clock in the evening and we will go to Dilmancos   OK   Claude Daniels provides the report from here, after obtaining many opinions from college students   The only thing I can logically reach is that he is still there and will always remain sexually aroused   Get back to you, Steve   Clyde Daniels, what a man, it was fun I kind of liked college students   You guys have done a lot of things today, you have plants now, yaar   We have plants and fish, I mean, like Christmas trees   Hey, this is wonderful   Thickness Yes! - We also have many of them   Hi fish and dogs!

Yes, we do a lot of work recently as you guys know   This makes me happy, man   We have a whole family of fish, wow, I feel like I'm a father talking about it   I've been seriously thinking this is not a joke I'm OK to get a baby so I'm ready to get a baby   If that day came   You are not ready to have a child - I ... I am very willing to have a child   Oh yell, all of it is up   There's a raccoon about this place - what you're talking about is good what's wrong with it   You are a good boy, a good boy, a good boy Khan, so this is a good dog   Yes, well yelled, I love fish   You guys, as usual, the Andes cook us savory   I have to admit, it's nice to have an adult at home   Because these are very wonderful meals here I will go to train you guys - this is the video   If they were not for any reason from the Logan group   Are you fine ?   Make yourself known and break the sign up button and cover yourself by watching some of the most exciting things in the game   Because we are abroad, we do it differently   As no one else did Logan Paul / buy   Do not be afraid of yourself This is what makes you what you are What makes you unique   This is what makes you distinctive, okay, gang, I love you and see you tomorrow   0:15:49.

assistant would love that yo Abbi hold it he's kind of badass yeah yeah I'll take him are you kidding nope so we're looking at tanks for a snake it's not a snake how hard is it to take care of a snake it's not too difficult betting changes feeding you could do that easy yeah this just in from the legal team snakes will have to be caught and will not be purchased and must be caught out of scenes 42 through 46 in an effort to make continued content that is suitable for all you said where you going to say please disappoint it I feel like Lydia would have really liked a snake do you like snakes no okay it's such a boring day guys trust me when you're in school and you get out right it's Friday it's late you guys are fist bumping and doing crazy things I realize Friday ah but my Vlogs really

I have like Can you tell me what happened? Vitals were fine all throughout the surgery Everything is fine the anesthesia was perfect and then after surgery they went to give her x-rays they See how the surgery went then they came back and also and she Was pale so then they just said she went into cardiac arrest and died Cause of death they don't know.
Death was never discussed in this they don't say oh She has this much chance of living....
 Logan: whoa whoa you called me Even right now like you could be messing with me. Yeah like that's what it feels like it. Just doesn't make any sense Oh, she's having a surgery on her leg.

It's just the vibes I know I look really serious and sad I I don't Like seeing Evan sad, that's what makes me like uneasy about this situation He's my best friend, and it always sucks when you see people that you know or love in pain Whether emotional or physical so this is like like you guys know I try to keep the vlogs fun and exciting but sometimes they do get real And my goal with you is to share my life with you, so you guys can live it with me And that's what we've done.

Why you so quiet? Bro, you're making me Evan: I don't know what to say Is there anything you want to say? Have you learned anything if you have you taken away anything you're just kinda like absorbing Evan: It just feels weird, but make sure you don't take anything for granted That's what I was saying like

I have a question you guys have showers She hits me with the of course We do like like every day you go out you go on plans that don't have to go what am I a peasant?

Death wait at the shower So break my camera broke hitting here we go Yo guys, this is absolutely My Sydney oh my god.

Honey yes honey Do you have Receipts still No, it's not my brand to return stuff. Logan. We only wear the Maverick brand I know I know I know I know I know I know, but there's no handlebars music video we're shooting on the 24th You know about it. You're producing it. You set it up. I'm just trying to wear the Gucci bro. I'm growing up the stache It's all about having a look hence the mustache [hi how are ya], so that's a thing also one of the rings I bought yesterday. I lost as you guys know lost at the premiere for my movie, King Bach's movie uh
Where's the money.But I was combing through the footage cuz you know vlog life, hashtag vlog everything and I noticed at one point I was on the bus and if you zoom in here You can see I'm still wearing the ring on my pinky And then we shot outside the bus and if you look here you zoom into my pinky You'll see the ring is no longer on my pinky Which is good news for me cuz that means context clues right? It's on the bus somewhere it has to be or Right when you got off. It fell Just saying After this we're gonna go check on the bus for the ring.

If there's one thing I love about vlogging It's the fact that I record everything so I know like when I loose things that ie this ring GoPro like I really like this and lion cuz I got that light mentality time to go to West Coast Customs Here's why we discovered a little something on the bus not so good if you go over like 45 50 miles an hour the steering Detaches like literally you lose control of the bus This is bad because of death ha ha ha so I hit up West Coast Customs guys. Can you try to fix this? They're like not try Blogging And also I asked them um if you look at the the windows here remember they tint and unn tint Huh Thank You Brendon, however they're yellow And I wasn't sure if that's how the windows came or if they put a yellow tint on turns out the yellow tint was put on which I don't love because it makes us look yellow when we're inside the bus I'm already a Disgusting color like pale creamy white I don't want to be another disgusting color like a mustard yellow Oh, they have some work to do We're gonna drop the bus off there for a few days and my man Kenny's gonna take care of You know so here's the thing when the bus is over like 50 miles an hour The steering wheel like this connects, and you can't control it. I mean I hit a car, but I think that's It out from that wasn't because of the steering no that was just I just backed right up into that page Come to West Coast Customs the bus gets So anyways we were about to say goodbye to the cool bus for a couple days But yo you guys know my brother Jake sorry yeah He was in LA it's a hefty one, bro think he said he's gonna turn this into a merge truck Which is dope but like you know where to get the March, Logan Paul calm slash y'all But I was thinking I'm like yo this is here. I'm here. Why don't I urinate on it? Jimmy P Brendan Brendan I do this a lot the only reason I'm doing this is cuz I Actually don't have a reason Well my logic is this if my bus I got peed on like why should Jake's thing not get peed on in incidence awesome security Cameras Jake install security cameras just like we did and you can catch up here or just watch my vlogs just take it caddy Just a cake happy Treat her well she likes water in the mornings and long walks on the beach I am leaving I feel like I'm sending my child off to school for the first time and it's ironic cuz It used to be a school bus as you guys know we have another music video coming up on the 24th for my next song It's called no handlebars That's all why I'm going out with the montage And we want to tweak the song a little bit change some lyrics and make a true absolute bang This music video is gonna.

Let's do this Got the tesla ass This is huge we came to the house We are right next to my new house which like by the way I had been searching like I know we joked about being homeless a lot and we were but I found this house And I couldn't vlog about it because ago she ations all that stuff.

We're by gate number one Okay, here's a little teaser oh Yeah, that's it. That's it. That's it It's very surreal like signing the papers this McCool with Kong sign the papers this morning Kong yeah, you signed the papers I missed that Once we actually get inside the house and just find it like a new creative space my brain is gonna open up the vlogs are Gonna get better. I never thought in my life that I would be able to buy a house this nice I always believed in myself. I was not afraid to be different be unique be a maverick I worked really hard and I had big goals I haven't said this often, but like guys we all have struggles right when I was 15 I had knee surgery on both knees thought my life was over like III played sports And I couldn't anymore it was an 8 to 12 month recovery time I couldn't do leg lifts with the rest of the football team. That's why I have such skinny legs I mean they're kind of freaking dope now, but they use I've heard they used to be skinny And I'm gonna tell the story again, but I wrote down on a piece of paper like a hundred times I will be more successful than anyone. I know I was 15 in Ohio I didn't know what I want to do with my life I just knew I wanted to be quote unquote more successful than anyone. I know like but what does that? Even mean was it money was it a monetary thing was it happiness was it love who knows But I just I wanted it and I worked hard and I believed in myself and I kept pushing and pushing and pushing to make that happen and now I'm frickin ah Living a different day Living a life of my dreams No gag so the point is I don't often do these inspirational speeches But if you believe in yourself if you can expand your brain and think outside of the box and get out of the whatever Bubble it is that you live assuming you live in a bubble like I did you do whatever yo you?

No really though lot of testosterone Was telling them bro today's the big day so Jake knows I got, No wait we got to go farther Ok now we're safe. I got my dad a Ford Raptor A 2018 Ford Raptor, this is the best man truck in the world okay so I said this in yesterday's vlog We've lived this crazy life Jake and I and Jake bought dad a Harley I'm serious Like so He got so, like,emotional he was like no one's ever given me anything like life his whole life. He's worked for literally everything He's ever got he's a man That's how we do it And the fact that it's 20 year old son was able to buy him a Harley and now I'm gonna buy him a 2018 Ford Raptor I was like I have to do this. I have to share the wealth. He's family I love them and they're matching their matching so this journey begins when I picked up the truck about three days ago Turn the Lights on Man You found this Right? Huh, you might be the best Black rims black wheels I made sure of that just sexy vehicle guys. This is the Ford Raptor This is not a Brand deal Ford  you owe me money. It's just such a cool truck. It says Raptor, honey It's a man Truck This is like the Beast It's a man truck This is what Im sayin' There so much room (for smashin' in this vehicle This is what im sayin ther's so much room in this vehicle(for smashin) And the Giant sunroof on top cuz you know where we goin baby to the top! Imagine how many Girls you could fit in here What I chose this truck because when we were in Dubai This is the vehicle they drove us around in we had just a squad of Raptors And there's so spacious and roomy my dad's gonna lose his mind Greg Paul. I love you, dude Anyone know why I chose the blue. I do I use my brain. What because your dads new Harley is Blue Oh matching Harley and a brand-new pickup truck. They're gonna be so sick forgive me. I'm color blind but I can match I'm giving this to my dad I paid for It. How much did it cost. You want me to tell the Logang how much it cost? 76,000 dollars out the door. MMM okay All right, no this is good dad. You birthed me, and I'm thankful for you, and I had a revelation oh Yeah, oh, yeah, I said that wrong yeah, I'm his seed though anyways here's the revelation I was like yo this life I'm living is absolutely crazy And I owe pretty much everything I've done in my life to my parents after all I would not be here without them and if something happened where he God forbid passed away all right cuz he had a heart attack before drove himself to the hospital by the way savage But like I don't know like you never know what's gonna happen in life guys And if I hadn't done something nice for him I would hate myself so yeah, this is it man Truck Somethin about this feels right Like I hope I don't like this too much. Cuz then I might just end up keeping it. Sorry dad oh This is crazy cuz like y'all know I Drive the Yeti It's a huge truck, but this is like you can put things in the in the pickup ooh. You know what speaking of pickup oh? I cannot break this car before I get it to my dad or can I Content clickbait. I gotta tell you what man if you guys have not bought a new car. There is no feeling Like driving it off the lot And also it's kind of hurt because literally the moment I leave this lost car loses about 30 percent of its value Okay about to lose like 20k here. We go, and I am officially off the lot dad I don't think you're gonna want to return this, but now you did can't for as much So yes the truck is acquired. It's at my friend Max house right now the plan is every year We go tobogganing my dad pulls this on the four-wheeler I'm gonna take him to like the neighborhood down the street, and I want the truck to be just sitting there And I'm gonna be like yo, this truck is dope like you should be pulling us in this thing and hopefully he's like Oh, yeah, this is cool. I could be like in fact Why don't you do that just hand him the keys? Maximus slap the bow on the truck, and hopefully it goes great like knocking like that like that's an amazing moment Oh, we need to talk about something because I don't think that's the truck that my dad likes There's a slight issue with this plan okay, so I bought dad a Harley yeah for his birthday Yeah, I talked to him afterwards. I was like did you want a Harley? Or truck he said oh I mean you made the right decision by getting me a Harley what if I were to get like a? Tacoma that would have been like absolutely insane as well so he likes the Tacoma when it comes to pickup trucks, yeah To the Toyota Tacoma yeah, he has all Who wants an orange Tacoma My Dad doesn't know what he wants right? He like he has his desires, but sometimes this 22 year old chach son knows better This is one of those cases I will just say it's gonna be so awkward If I'm like you should pull us around in that he goes no way a Tacoma would have been better than that Here's the thing though. It's still a sick ass. Yeah. No. You know what if you make some smartass comment. I swear to god I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just gonna keep it He's not in the low game here here dog hits your big day now you're a maverick now. You're in the low gang You'll find a way low gang.

HEEYOO good morning Logang what's poppin'? Yee! The current location guys, is Venice, Italy. Current time is 6:40 a.m. YEEEE Today, today is a big day! Haha it's my big day! It's actually not, it's my brother Jake's big day. If you don't know what I mean, allow me bless y'all with some information. Most of you are in the Logang, so you've heard this before BUT! If you are not part of the Logang make sure to subscribe Yo! oh what the F*ck we just hit twelve million and I had no idea. You guys are growing too fast Logang freaking SLOW DOWN! I'm just kidding bro. Mavericks never stop. So yeah. Subscribe if you are not subscribed. But ok, story time... Good morning, brother Jake. How you doing, let's go! HEH Paul brothers in Italy don't know how we didn't get kicked out yet ITALIA!!   but okay We're still here, dog ooohh Ok, here's the background. I'm gonna make this short. Jake, asshole Lamborghini prank on my birthday NOOO! You did not, Jake, get me a Lamborghini! Admit it's a prank! Ooooh s*** Ooooooh! Haha! F*** you bro. Yeah, that was not cool at all. I'm not even kidding it literally went from the best day of my life, to the absolute worst. Asshole And then being the loco young man I am, I said this There's only one way that I can come back from this. If I say, "F*** you Jake Paul." and go out today and buy an actual Lambo BOOM! So I was like, yo f*** it dude I'm buying a Lambo today I found out that I can't do that because it is an expensive car and its kind of a big deal Jake was like yo, if you are doing it then I'm doing it too And then it was his idea to customize 2018 Lamborghini Huracán Performante I went to the Lamborghini dealership I had you guys actually choose the color and help me customize it Logang, y'all got my back. Waaah! And they  told us what about coming to Italy? They were like, "Yo, you're gonna come to Italy. You're gonna wait like six months." "It's gonna be amazing. You're gonna get a tour of the factory." Jake: The whole nine yards. Logan: Basically, youre gonna come and pick up your own Lamborghini that you customize. I was like, yo that's F*cking dope Jake: Well uh I've seen some dope s***, and that's dope Logan: Fact. Then I, yo, the time frame, and I got using my brain which i'm not good at and I was like, hold up, pause I'm about to drop $350,000 on a car. I just bought the Yeti. [music plays] And like, i'm not a huge car guy, right I like cars, I don't love cars like he does Jake: Mmmm I love 'em! It's a genuine concern, like It's a very dangerous car and me behind the wheel *skeptical hmmmmm* So I was like dog, I don't know if I want [whining] I don't know if I want this carrrr. I decided not to get it And then I had to tell brother Jake And then I cried like a b**** I...[exhales]...am not getting a Lamborghini with you [sad music plays] and then we get here the other day and Jake's starts murmuring in my ear *laughs* I'm persuasive! And because orginally I just flew here to surprise him and support him while he gets His Lambo So now that y'all have been blessed with some information I think you should know, uh, we're running late...again! [Speaking Italian] Brendan, get in the boat! Brendan: I'm getting in Logan: Brendan, get in the boat! C'mon guys! My brother needs a Lamborghini! Yaaaa! Lamborghini! Muy rapido Lamborghini! Why am I Iate to everything!? Ahhhh! It's so early right now It's so beautiful Venice, Italy baby, I'm gonna miss you [music plays] I just wanna say, according to my phone, our train left one minute ago Nice! Rapido, [speaking fake Italian] Ole, ole ole ole, ole Ti amo Italia Yo but at this point I gotta be honest I wasn't even sure if i'm still able to get the Lambo Cause I cancelled Like I put my $25,000 deposit down told them, like, I wasn't getting it so they don't know i'm even here [screams] No! Partito It's gone. Noooooooooo Lamborghiniiiiiiii! Mama miaaaa! I gotta be honest I've never, like, actually missed a flight or a train I've always, like, made them by the hair of my skin This is kinda f****** sad. Anyway... Called my business manager, [into megaphone] Andrew [megaphone replays Logan's recording] Andrew I asked him last in the middle of the streets of Italy if it was even possible for me to get the car. This was last night [Drake singing] Last night This is hypothetical If I go to the factory tomorrow and I see this and I...and I wanna buy it cause I put down the 25,000 do they still have it, could I still do that is it, that, is that even and option? Like my exact Lambo- the one that I customized is...at the factory, like I'm gonna see it tomorrow? (Andrew on Speaker) Oh what the f*** It's hypothetical, it's all hypothetical Oh what the f*** Bro, this could go down. Future Logan, take it away dog So I feel like, while we wait for our next train and a hopefully we don't miss that one. It's agood time to say um... It's going to be one of the most real vlogs probably ever like bro, Brendan, admit this is some real-life s*** Brendan: This Is some real life s*** Only on etime in my life-time am I gonna be presented with this opportunity To buy a super car with my brother

Bhagu bro up on the bus some interesting stuff has happened. I want to tell you guys about Wow would you say? Smells like what? The pooper strike the pooper struck bro, no go away the Cooper struck again, bro It's a guy as you know gang know who is pooping outside of our bus did you know this? human poops And he comes back big human poops right outside the door we had a like literally jump over the pool It was hot it was whore this has gone too far first. It was a joke actually no It was never a joke it was always to fuck skill pooper dude. Why does it smell like he took it on the bus? Got in the bus and there there's destroying This is what do you want me what the dividers it turns apart with poop? We can't let him divide us i'ma find this guy I didn't buy this drill bit for no reason I'm gonna stab him through the heart nobody my boss except We need cameras surveillance It's it's guys. This is an actual issue like the vlog today was kind of fine. I got my sashes. No This is a problem second problem. I want to address that I Sit down it's like any other normal day in my cool bus I turn it on I start driving right. It's casual Oh Okay It's one thing to jump off fanmail. It's another thing to drop off a safety hazard on my bus literally it blinds me oh My god, I'm gonna pull over. I have a couple words to say about this because I feel it's some type away right now This spot is normally for these kind of buses. I'm just gonna park here alright Let's see what we got okay - very sweet girls obviously the wrapping the merch there in the low gang Which you can get on Logan Paul calm slash. Oh my Logan Paul Keim slash out my ears I'm just like you huh, I'm a bus. I'm a little bit, but I'm just like you guys right right okay? Follow me in the cool bus names of the girls that were trying to kill us are riper and Miriam. Yes a couple things What yeah, okay? We'er all in the Logang, We're all cute as f*ck. You guys good. There's a phone number if you want to text them jeez why sit well I see them right now I'm about to get into why this is wrong Stay away from the bus honestly no gang yo, it's like let's go But like stay away from the bus for real. Yes. It's my toy look at it. Don't touch it I have a problem with them looking on this picture. They're standing on my bumper. That's that's very that's very disrespectful We had the same problem with the Yeti. This is Merriman Piper thank you for being the low game, but does not your property, so please a Stay away from the bus unless I invite you on it And be especially especially when I'm not around Don't touch your bus don't go on the bus and don't put objects in the way that can potentially harm That's the second thing think about where you place that like I could have died I couldn't vlog could be over right now and a local box between Grown-ass men possibly a woman pooping outside my bus and low gangsters trying to kill us it's been an interesting one looking for cameras Right now whether you're taking pictures on my bus or hopefully near my bus It's our big day the damn Wi-Fi security cam I would hate to be someone trying to poop outside my bus What do you think Lydia? Great we'll take five yo, okay, so I'm looking at this camera here look. It's pretty cool some stuff We found out that actually works in our favor hugely 24/7 video 130 degree view shows you everything in 1080p HD Day or night. Poop in the day, poop in the night, i will f*cking find you bro. Alerts you on your phone See who is there and talk back to get their attention Like I could be sleeping and I get a notification I swear to God I will get up out of my bed and sprint naked to the bus! Why naked? Make you sleep big fine this guy Our 24/7 continuous recording saves everything just in case so even if I don't catch this guy if I come back tomorrow There's an extra poop dunzo. Got caught last thing part of the puzzle. That's actually kind of confusing mmm That is an outlet we can't turn the generator Generator on cuz pooper will know that something's going down in the bus so we got over the extension cords over here and then we're gonna walk around here try to find an outlet like drape it put it on top of the bus and then just Hook up some cameras, and hopefully find this guy bro if we do, bro bEsT vLoG eVeRRR Bought a flashlight for this exact look at look at that poop look at it ah Disgusting I never thought my life would come to this Oh 100% Outlet the one thing I'm worried about are these spikes a little bit. You'll be fine. Okay cool And I'll live okay so right here, baby, you are my Savior I also feel like I'm sort of breaking the law right now, but like you would think that if there's security here They would catch the guy Pooping outside my bus he open so that security camera right there is watching us install a security camera Okay, so it's connected to the bus Wi-Fi, but obviously when we turn the bus off It's not going to be connected anymore, but in my mind and tell me if this makes sense Brenden, There's no reason that it shouldn't be able to still record. Correct? I dunno man. OH! Yo, it works! You can get your merch at LoganPaul.com/shop. This is so noticeable Look at this giant yellow extension cord. How's that? I see me you see you I see you.

I'm okay, I'm okay. Don't worry about me. wtf A oh good morning logang whats popin. Hey guys, so as you guys know, I'm a little sick, my voice is kinda gone But God bless it, tomatoe *throws it* ugh   I made a promise when I started vlogging. To deliver you guys the most entertaining, exhilarating, incredible content EVER! And goddammit, I'm gonna do that. So, today in Tokyo, I put on my Maverick sweatshirt. I put on my Gucci jacket. Because, as usual, it's gonna be an epic day. If for some reason, you find yourself unhappy or unfulfilled, It's definitely because you're not in the Logang. Now, I have good news. It can all end now, all you gotta do is subscribe. Join the strongest family on Youtube... [sigh] Because it's lit every single day, whether I'm sick or not. Now, I will say. I do feel a little better. Maybe that's because last night I used my brain for one second. Me and the squad decided to go to a Japanese doctor. [weird af noises] Brendan: Do you feel better yet? Logan: No, I feel like I'm dying still. Doctor: What you have is mainly a sinus infection and a throat infection. One tablet twice a day with a meal, and into each nostril 4 times a day Brendan: You're gonna get better! Logan: I hope so. Wow! Yeah... Enough drugs to kill Panda on a runaway train going 100mph Hopefully this stuff will heal me. Now, I will say... International travel. Not probably the smartest thing to be doing when you're this sick. But I made a conscious decision, that if I'm gonna be sick, I would rather be sick in Tokyo than at home, guys look at this view. Like, come on bro, how can I miss out on this? This is amazing! Okay, I'm gonna shower off and then meet up with the squad for some breakfast. Andy!!! Hey, Andy. Andy: Did you get some rest? Logan: I did, I did. I feel better. I took enough drugs to kill a horse. Andy: Oh! Logan: Can I just have you look around for a second? Oh my gosh, Tokyo! Andy: We're in Tokyo! Like what is going on? Logan: Brendan! Morning, mister. Brendan: How are you feeling, dude? You feeling better? Logan:  I'm not feeling worse. You know what I'm saying? I'm like on the fence. But to be honest with you, Brendan, ain't nobody got time to be sick, bro, we're in Tokyo! Let's go eat. Apparently, this isn't... Oh god, it's still so bad... Apparently this isn't that traditional of Japanese meal. Look they just got loaves of bread, I'll take the whole thing, thank you. I think I found something it's gonna cure you. That's so sick. Honey is good for the throat. I think I just need to take the whole thing You already took a whole loaf of bread Oh at all Thinking honor of being sick we're now gonna be selling fish. No, Logan Paul, Mass I'm Logan Paul that cops last shot get your own sick mass and prevent the bubonic plague from spreading in your town Good idea, what's the issue? Okay, that's my bad. No. It's fine. You can please they got my honey. You got me. We're gonna Tokyo Cheers. Yeah Talking about the color This is our security will you have a flashlight? Yolo gank don't attack us otherwise this shoe. She's gonna hit you with an iPad and blind you with a flashlight. Let's go slow, okay? Low gang let's talk Tokyo right now we are going to a district called the Asakusa district Specifically to the since OG temp that fun fact when I came to Japan like two years ago to do the splits this was one Of the locations that I did it a more fun fact. I almost got arrested by Japanese police for doing a split that's correct Hopefully, it's a little different this time this place is beautiful, so we're gonna explore some more. I just want to say So Japan is definitely not used to vloggers watch When I absolutely love this place because it's so beautiful, and he's talking about how beautiful it is can you get out? I just got to be careful to not like disrespect the culture cuz lo getting Japan is all about the worse I Know it'sit's true, so I got to take my choch levels and bring them down Dump Americans have arrived hi Everyone's so friendly listen the map emerges fire right what I think while we're in Japan we got a Can we take this you know how we do I'm in like the same spot that I came last time. It's full circle here anything. We can do I'm now realizing. Why they tried to arrest me last year What is this um you get the smoke next hour, and then your body your face a 12-8 clean up smoke, please I'm going in for the sake of my future It's the holy one this is for if you're a real piece of justin life You can come here and clean yourself from being a piece of shit So if you look behind me this is where you throw coins into the well we make a wish and they come true or even Wish for I wish for health happiness and hello bitches You know this is what I'm talking about it looks like Andy's being taken away, what happened.
