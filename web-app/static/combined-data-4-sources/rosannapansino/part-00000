I'm bringing my dog Cookie today 🐶🍪. ‪Got a lot of questions about how I eat so much yummy food & stay fit.‬

1) I am a big fan of portion control and I enjoy all foods in moderation.
2) I strength train 5 days a week. The new muscle mass boosted my metabolism. It is incredible‪.‬
3) I love food and have never been able to diet. Instead  I focus on eating diverse and healthy foods.
4) I still indulge my sweet tooth.
5) Ive been working on getting stronger for 12 months. I didn't rush it.
6) I do something active every day  even if its just walking my dog.

Being petite  its all about balance for me. In my life Ive been both overweight and also fit enough to do gymnastics

Through hard work  consistency  and a willingness to learn more about personal health  I have never felt better

As a result  I have naturally and gradually slimmed down.

9 months ago I was 20 pounds heavier and couldnt do 1 push-up. Now I can do 20+ weighted push-ups  pistol squats  and am working on a sixpack.

Some have been judging me for looking "too manly" and others because Im "too skinny". I dont care about being smaller or bigger  instead I want to be stronger and healthier.

Thanks to everyone who has been supportive. I havent been this fit since high school gymnastics💪🏻. Sweet as pie. Tough as nails.. Playing the Googly Eyes game was one of the silliest and most fun challenges yet 👀😂✍️

[whimsical orchestra music] ♪ [chimes] Hey guys, it's Ro. I am here at DisneyLand with the Nerdy Nummies team! You guys know I love Disney, and I live in California, so I like to visit often. I do like the rides, but I have to be honest, I really like the FOOD! So I wanted to make a video today to share some of my favorite DisneyLand treats that are here in the park. My first favorite treat that I'm gonna show you is over on Main Street at the Carnation Cafe: Mickey Mouse Waffles! They are adorable, and delicious. Let's go! The Mickey Waffle is located inside the Carnation Cafe on Main Street. And it is my first stop, because it is only served in the morning for breakfast. It comes with strawberry or apple topping. Today, I'm keeping it simple with some maple syrup. Yum! (x5) 
Bon appétit! Our next stop is the Coffee Cart on Main Street. This is insider information. This cart is one of the only places in all of DisneyLand to get doughnuts! They only come out a few times a day, and once they're gone, they're gone, so move quick! I'm enjoying a chocolate glazed donut, and since we're trying a lot of treats today, I'm sharing with friends! Right near this cart is the one treat that I get every single time I'm at DisneyLand: A Dole Whip Soft-Serve from the Tiki Juice Bar right at the entrance of AdventureLand. As the day heats up, it's the perfect place to get a chilled treat, and it's smooth like ice cream, but doesn't contain any dairy. There are often long lines for this sweet treat, but it is well worth the wait, which brings us to our fourth stop: I've got my eyes locked: Jolly Holiday. At the Jolly Holiday Bakery &amp; Cafe, they sell coconut macaroon cookies that look like the Matterhorn ride. If you like coconut, this is the DisneyLand treat for you! If you show up early enough, you can get them fresh out of the oven, when they're still warm. There's a sweet sugar icing on the top that looks like snow, and it goes perfectly with the coconut flavor. I like these so much, I bought three to share. Continuing with my favorite treats brings us over to a small store called the Mint Julep Bar, which is located in New Orleans Square. Here, they sell small Mickey Mouse shaped beignets. They're light, fluffy, and full of flavor. SO GOOD! Now, despite these being so good, I had to pace myself for one of the most iconic DisneyLand treats: Fresh-Baked Churros! You can find churro carts all over DisneyLand, and I know this sounds silly, but my favorite one is located in New Orleans Square, near the Haunted Mansion ride. And, fun fact: This churro cart was taste-tested as the best churro cart in DisneyLand. Fresh-Baked Churros are one of my all-time favorite treats at DisneyLand. I am so excited and I can't hide it! ['deet'ing a jig tune] The last stop for today is the Beauty And The Beast themed Red Rose Tavern in FantasyLand. It recently opened, so this is one of my new favorite treats: The Grey Stuff dessert! It looks just like the stuff from the movie. It's a small red velvet cake, with a raspberry center, topped with cookies and cream white chocolate mousse. If you're in the mood to try a new dessert to the park, try The Grey Stuff, it's delicious! Don't believe me? Ask the dishes! Alright, that does it for my favorite DisneyLand treats! Now, I'm gonna go jump on some rides. And tonight, I'm gonna check out the Main Street Electrical Parade! I'm gonna get some footage of it, so I can show you guys what it looks like. I love it, 'cause it's like glowing at night! Buh-bye! [charming, somber music: strings and bells] ♪ [music fades] 
Hey guys, it's Rey. Hehe, Just kidding. It's Ro. Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies. Today I am dressed as Rey because we are gonna be making something Star Wars themed. I got so many requests from you guys to make something Star Wars themed and when I was watching Force Awakens for the first time I noticed that Rey was eating these rationed portion bread, it looked green, and I thought; Hmm, let's make this into a recipe. What would be the most similar? And I thought *Gasp of enlightenment* Mug cakes! Because, in the movie, she just adds water and poof. She's got her little bread. Mug cakes are very similar. They cook very quickly, only a minute and a half in the microwave. If you guys remember, I made three of my favourite mug cake recipes a while back. We made an espresso, apple, and chocolate. So today we are gonna be making a matcha mug cake. Let's get started! The things you will need to make our portion mug cake will be: Five tablespoons of self-rising flour, One egg at room temperature, Two tablespoons of coconut oil, Three tablespoons of sugar, One tablespoon of matcha powder, Two tablespoons of milk, And a pinch of salt. You'll also need two ramekins, or one coffee mug. I absolutely love mug cake recipes because they only take about a minute to make in the microwave. They're super easy. Mix together in a medium bowl: Self-rising flour, sugar, matcha powder, and salt. If you love green tea, you may love this cake. If you don't like green tea... I really; I really don't know what to say. (Like, what??) Now, in a small bowl, mix together: Coconut oil, one egg, and milk. Whisk together until well combined. You guys, this is almost ready to cook in the microwave. I told you this was super easy. Now combine your wet ingredients with your dry ingredients. Our matcha cake batter is ready. Here's the part where you either pour it into a large coffee mug, or two small ramekins. Whatever you'd like. I'm gonna do 2 small ramekins because it kind of looks like the little bowl from the movie. And, I'm gonna share mine with my friend BB-8. *Cute little beeping sounds* These rise a lot in the microwave, so fill them about two-thirds full. Our little matcha cakes are ready to cook. Pop them in the microwave for one minute and 30 seconds. I'm gonna be cooking mine one at a time. Ta-Daaaa! And there you have it! Rey's portion bread; mug cake edition. I really hope you guys enjoyed this recipe, This was so fun and easy to make, and look how cute! It looks just like the portion bread from the movie. (More cute beeping sounds) Ah! I love it! I'll be posting the recipe and a bunch of pictures on RosannaPansino.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. So you can check it out there. And, if you guys make this recipe, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy. It makes my day. Especially when it's Star Wars related. I love Star Wars, and I'm super excited for the next movie. Also, if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know; leave me a comment down below. And I will do my best to make it happen. Alright, thanks again you guys. Bye-bye! And now I get to taste a bite for me! Mmmm! *Laughing* Matcha polystarch bread  For me! 
Hey guys, it's a Ro! I got so many requests from you guys to make a back-to-school video And I remember when I was going to school I loved doing arts and crafts So I thought it would be really fun to make a DIY art supply video! The three things that we're gonna be making today are cute little erasers, homemade chalk and crayons We'll be using two of the silicone molds from my baking line. You can use whatever molds You'd like but if you're interested in these, I'll put a link down below. In my right hand is the Nerdy Nummies mold It's got smart cookies, hearts and little dinosaurs And in my left hand I have the 8 and 16-bit hearts mold so without further ado Let's get started! The first thing that we're making is adorable homemade chalk. The things you'll need will be: Plaster of Paris, this is the same stuff you use to make paper mache tempera paint I'm using colors green, blue, orange and pink, some water, And then a cute mold First step to making your chalk is mixing everything together But you do this individually for each color in a small bowl combine For the cup of plaster of Paris then you'll want an even measurement of paint lastly add 1 tablespoon of water Now mix it up using a fork until it forms a paste make as many colors as you'd like Once you have all your colors mixed up pour into your mold if you're using my mold You don't need to prep it by greasing it You can just pour it directly into each cavity once all the cavities are filled Give it a little tap tap tap tap tap tap - tap tap tap tip this will help release all of the little air bubbles Let it sit out at room temperature for about 8 hours if you want to leave it overnight That's a really good idea as well the time varies depending on your climate whether you live in a very dry climate Or a humid climate, but as soon as these are completely dry they're ready. Just pop them out I like to pull on the mold to loosen all the pieces and then just gently from the bottom pop it out oh adorable I love it. Then pop out the rest of your chalk Do doo there you have it adorable homemade chalk making this chalk brings back so many good memories one of my favorite memories I was walking cookie around the neighborhood and I looked down at the sidewalk, and it said nerdy nummies And I went oh and I wish I had a little piece of chalk with me So I could write back and be like you're awesome heart Ro Next thing we'll be making are these cute and easy to make erasers the things you'll need to make these cute erasers will be a DIY Eraser kit and your favorite silicone mold the first step open up your DIY eraser kit I have made erasers from scratch before and I prefer to use the kits because it saves a lot of time And I think they just turn out better pick any color and pinch off about a quarter you just need enough to fill the cavities of the mold roll into a ball and Squish inside the cavities keep doing this you can pick as many colors as you'd like and fill up the entire mold for these you don't want to overfill the cavities if you have any excess just pinch it off and flatten down Our mold is completely full so colorful I love it now it is time to bake place on top of a baking sheet heat your oven to 210 degrees and bake for 30 minutes once your erasers have baked give them at least one hour to cool Then pop em out, and they're ready to use I love this this is such a cute idea if you want little custom erasers when you're going to school You could also make some for your friends I am in love. Do doo here are the cute and easy erasers that we made today This is super fun because you can make a bunch of them at once the last thing that we're gonna be making are these custom Shaped crayons the things you'll need to make these custom crayons will be an assortment of crayons you can choose whatever colors You'd like and a cute mold first step to making some custom crayons choose whatever colors you want to use and take off the wrappers break them apart and peel them off fill your bowl with A bunch of colors these ones are about a quarter inch big But you can break them To be any size depending on what size mold you have and what you want it to look like now Just fill each mold with a bunch of little pieces fill it up a good piece of advice is to Overfill them just a little bit because they're gonna melt down now our custom crayons are ready to bake heat your oven to 275 degrees and bake for about 12 minutes Once your crayons have baked give them plenty of time to cool before you pop them out This usually takes about 30 minutes after 30 minutes pull on your mold on the top and bottom and the sides Press on the bottom and pop em out Its beautiful look at the rainbow It's fun popping them out because you get to see what each one looks like and they're all different, I'm very curious I'm like what do you look like? Ta Da Here all the DIY school art supplies that we made today We made homemade chalk cute erasers. These are adorable and custom crayons I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the instructions on Rosanna Pansino Dot-com Facebook Twitter and Instagram you can check them out there, and if you make any of these crafts Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your creations I really like making these crafts because they're all super easy and some of them even bake in the oven So it's super similar to baking right up my alley And again if you want to use any of the molds you saw on the video. I'll put a link to them down below Thanks again. You guys bye-bye 
Hey guys, it's Ro, today I'm hanging out with my friend Justine, Hi! you guys know Justine We're just hanging out in my sunroom, and when she comes over I like to rope her into trying a bunch of yummies with me, and I thought this would be perfect for us Yes, because we love pumpkin spice lattes Are we basic? So I went to the store I picked up a bunch of different items that are pumpkin spice flavored, and I also want to note that I was a little extra because I got items that were not Pumpkin flavored they specifically had to be pumpkin spice flavor I wanted it say pumpkin spice, perfect! Alright, Justine cause you're the guest what do you want to try first? Okay, this is gonna sound crazy. I want to try the cereal Is that okay? Yes lets do it! okay. My dad used to always eat these but he would eat the ones like weren't frosted like the super like not good He wants the healthy ones Ooo! It smells like pumpkin spice and the thing also, you know what the thing with pumpkin spice is they put a lot orange dye in these things And look at it, it's frosted, it's orange. Oh, it's only on one side look it look it look uh I can't wait any longer, right? Mm-hmm Oh this is good. Can you marry in like a bowl of milk it needs milk, yeah, we're having the cereal dry. Its so dry! (Coughing) Oh try for pumpkin spice flavor, I'm gonna give this a thumbs up. Yes pretty good mmm the next thing I want to try and I'm so sorry cause I know you've already tried these but As soon as they came out. I really want to try one I haven't had one a pumpkin spice flavored Oreo And I will taste test these all day long because I'm just gonna spoiler alert. These are so good Okay, lets just try it I mean you see what you think Little pumpkin like a pie on the front of the box this makes sense so they little pumpkin pie and in the middle it looks like pumpkin filling Although when I smell this this smells like an electrical fire It doesn't smell like um pumpkin spice I like I've definitely plug things in and had some sparks fly out before and that's what the smells like okay, but let me taste Mmm Oh man, I love it so much. Thats so good Oh, but you got a little... on my nose? (Laughter) The filling is right on! I'm gonna give this a thumbs up. I'm gonna try this just the filling. Im gonna eat it, too That's very spicy. I got the filling is a perfect pumpkin spice flavor these are gonna disappear Very quickly in my house. I'll tell you that your turn, Justine. Oh, what do you want, try those are kind of sweet? Maybe let's try the chips They are spiced with pumpkin spice on top oh It smells like chips. I've never had a pumpkin chip. I don't even know what to expect now. What's about this What's different about this they're crafted with simple ingredients? pumpkin puree, pumpkin seeds, cinnamon, and nutmeg oh, wow But it's a tortilla chip, so let's try it It tastes like a naked Dorito They're really good but..they don't taste like pumpkin spice. Hey, I might cry oh, man You're gonna make fun of me. Why would I make fun of you? You're gonna make fun of me. I don't think I, I might... I don't know! I know at the store, and I saw these one of my favorite candies with a twist Aw these remind me of my grandma. That's why I fell in love with is my Nana always had these and then I loved them I saw these at Target, and I lit up you wouldn't even see my face. It went like this... Smell spicy oh it does it smells like pumpkin spice. Oh, it's very soft A little to soft. Mm-hmm I was concerned that it would rip out my fake teeth. I think I'm gonna be okay, my dentures!! Oh Give it a thumbs up it tastes like pumpkin spice. It does. I've been eyeing up these pretzels To be honest, okay, let's try em. Now are these coated? They are! Covered pretzels in anything like white chocolate And just chocolate or like a favorite. This is the best thing I've ever ever tasted How's it making you some good smell? Oh?

Very faint I think they're liars, are you a liar? the slightest hint a Cinnamon it's so light is very light. I think that my taste buds may have been burned off on those pretzels. I'm gonna keep Light I'm gonna give that a thumbs down for a spice flavor. Yeah could not taste it, but they tasted really good Ok lets do these ones, okay the chips so I feel like this is more something that you would be baking with pumpkin spice little chips it smells good.

The wrapper... they made a pumpkin spice color, so we've got the orange and the brown and even, look at the little tag It's brown. It says pumpkin spice on the tag Can you see this? It's very small but I can see it (Producer/someone behind camera). Ok cool! There are orange? Yes! Okay, I bet its probably just like a melted like the... you know these are kind of melted - this one's falling apart. Oh Hmm I can't eat this. Oh, it's very chewy. Very strong. Too much, yeah Its just to much pumpkin spice! But it does taste like pumpkin spice. It definitely tastes like pumpkin spice like a lot, yeah I think it's a little bit more over the top like the chocolate chips for sort of you could taste it but it wasn't overpowering yeah Alright, that does it for all of the pumpkin spice flavored food that I have good day. Justine, What were your favorites we had some good one so I think these three We've pretty much narrowed down as our favorites, but I think if I had to pick I would probably go with the cookies as way number one I agree these are my top three favorites as well my number.

Hey guys! It's Ro. It is the holiday season, and I wanted to make a themed treat. I was out shopping And I found the cutest little thing- I had been craving some hot cocoa and marshmallows and these are snowflake shaped marshmallows and they come in a little pack I found these at Sur La Table And I thought, "Hmm.. Not everyone has a Sur La Table by them," so I wanted to show you how to make these at home. I just thought these were a really cute treat idea- or they could make a really cute gift. I also found these mugs at the store [Gasp] Look at this! You could make the little marshmallow hot cocoa toppers, and then put them in a cute mug! [Amazed gasp] So today we are gonna be making holiday Marshmallow hot cocoa toppers. Yum yum yum. The things you'll need to make these holiday Marshmallow hot cocoa toppers will be: 1 and 1/4 cup of light corn syrup, 3/4 cup of water, 3 cups of sugar, 4 packets of powdered gelatin, an additional measurement of 3/4 cup of water, some powdered sugar for dusting, a pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Then, to decorate: a mini snowflake cookie cutter, a 3 inch circle cookie cutter, some extra powdered sugar for coating the marshmallows, mini chocolate chips, and some orange gummy candies. First step to making homemade marshmallows: pour one of the measurements of 3/4 cup of water and your powdered gelatin into a medium-sized bowl. Now, gently mix with a spoon to make sure it's all wet. [Stirring and singing "doo doo doo"]. Set it off to the side for About 5 minutes and allow it to bloom. Next in front of me I have: light corn syrup, the second measurement of water, and some sugar. Pour all of these into a Medium-sized sauce pot. Then using a spatula, mix together till there's no more dry sugar And then we'll take the pot over to the stove. Turn the stove heat to medium-high and place the candy thermometer Into the pot. Cook the sugar syrup until it reaches 238 degrees (Fahrenheit), then take the pot back to the baking station. Our sugar syrup is ready, It's fresh, hot off the stove, so be careful It's still very hot. Our gelatin mixture has bloomed, so pour this all into a mixing bowl- looks so funny- Whoops, then close this, lock it in place I'm gonna turn the stand mixer on a low speed and while it mixes, Slowly pour in the hot sugar mixture. Once It's mixed for a few minutes, add the salt, and crank it up to a high speed for a few more minutes This is gonna turn into a liquid to like a fluffy meringue. It's gonna be pretty cool I've mixed for about eight minutes now add your vanilla, and mix again on a low speed Just until combined. [Amazed] Oooh Look at that, hello marshmallow And once your marshmallow mixture is ready, Pour it into a cookie sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper and make sure you've sprayed it with a bunch of baking spray So that the marshmallows easily pop out. Once you've spread out your marshmallows, we're gonna Let it sit out at room temperature for three hours, so you can watch a couple holiday movies! (Singing) OOO Yes after you've let the marshmallows set, now's the fun part It's time to make it snow! Using some powdered sugar, Cover the whole work surface because you don't want the marshmallow to stick to the table And then it snow let it snow let it snow Take your pan of marshmallows and flip it over right on top of the powdered sugar It's gonna come out cuz I've greased the pan you just gotta, wait be a little patient Give it a little jiggle; let gravity do its thing (Humming) (Humming "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow") (Gasp) Hello fresh marshmallows! (Inhales) Mmm, yum. I just finished greasing my hands so that they won't stick. Now just cut out a bunch of shapes I'm gonna be cutting out a bunch of circles for the snowmen and then I'm gonna place it right over here on the surface That's covered with powdered sugar so won't stick and little mini snowflakes (Singing) Once you have all your snowflakes cut out, you want to make sure all sides are covered in powdered sugar, so that all of the Sticky marshmallow is covered. I put my little snowflakes over here off to the side then in front of me I want to show you how to decorate a couple little snowman Faces. The reason we're using a three inch cookie cutter is because it's the perfect size to fit on the top of the mug so Imagine you have some hot cocoa and then a cute little snowman marshmallow to go on top! (Gasp) Yes, and you curl, but you watch all of your holiday movies Yes. I did not put powdered sugar on the top of their faces yet because I wanted these little candies to stick easily. Take two mini chocolate chips (Hums while eating chocolate chips) Then five on the bottom for his mouth Oops. Then for the iconic snowman carrot nose, We have some orange gummies and cut them up like I did here then just stick one in the middle So cute and there you have it- we made holiday marshmallow hot cocoa toppers, we made homemade marshmallows and little snowflakes and snowmen. Ooo Hope you guys enjoyed this video and this recipe and a bunch of pictures will be on rosannapansino.com Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check it out there And if you guys make this recipe-please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations, especially when they're adorable little snowmen! Look at- (gasp) Look how cute! I can't! If you have any other ideas for any other video, let me in the comments below And now I'm gonna have one of these for me I filled my cup with a little hot cocoa, gonna put him right on top and let 'em melt. (Gasp) Yes It's melting it's melting, and it is the cutest thing in the world! Look at this: it fits perfectly on top. Alright, that's it for the video. I hope you enjoyed it. Buh bye! And Happy Holidays! &lt;3 
Hey guys, it's Ro Today, I'm hanging out with my friend, Justine and Hi! and I want to make a video because we just got back from Hawaii. Oh man, we did a FOUR mile kayak and then we hiked for two miles to a waterfall It was incredible! (it was beautiful) We ate a ton of fresh pineapple because when I was there visiting, I went to the Dole Plantation and tons of pineapple themed treats. And I bought them all, and I did not eat them This was so hard! I brought them back so we could make a cool video! And that is exactly what we are going to be doing today. We are going to be trying a bunch of pineapple themed treats from Hawaii. I have got my eyes on this. This is a chilli pineapple chunk! Oooh! So sweet and spicy? Possibly? Yeah! Ok, you open it up. Do you want a knife? Please? *Ro Laughs* There it is! I feel like you should take knife throwing classes. I will! It's kind of a ninja thing, I think Just get out of my way, don't worry Are you ready? Yeah, oh I'm ready! God, oh it's so sharp! Oh my mouth is watering now! It's a lot of saliva My mouth wants one (I know) Ohh!! Ohh!! It is hot! *whistle sounds* We need something not Spicy to counter act this!! ooh !! i have pineapple drink Let's do a jellybean Oh! It's called a "Crushed Pinneapple Jellybean" I'll hand it to you, you got it girl! Oh! Uhmm Uhmmm This is way better than then the bean boorzal challenge! The barf one is like flavored with barf. Ok Doesn't really taste like pineapple It basically taste like other jelly bean. 
Hey guys, it's Ro! I wanted to make an update video because I haven't made one in a while. And we've got some things going on! I wanted to keep you guys in the loop. The first update that I'm so excited to announce is: that I am coming to Chicago for a meetup! While on the Nerdy Nummies Cookbook Tour, I got to visit so many different states: New York, Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, Washington, Oregon, but one place I didn't get to visit on the tour was Illinois, and I got a lot of requests from you guys that said, "Come to a meetup in Illinois!" So, that is exactly what I'm going to do in two weeks. Saturday, March 18th! Wilton is making this meetup possible by hosting it at the Wilton School. It was so nice of them. I'm gonna put the address right here, and I'm also going to put the address down below in the description box. It's free! All you need to bring is yourself, and the meetup is from 2-6 PM. It's four hours, and it's first-come, first-serve, so I would recommend showing up a little bit early, just in case. So, if you're in the Chicago area, I hope to see you! It will be a lot of fun; we'll be doing hugs and selfies. I just love it! Next update is that I've been doing a lot of collabs lately. If you've missed any of them, I'm gonna put links down below, so you can go check them out there. Got to be in a workout Disney Princess video with a bunch of my girlfriends. I got to play Belle! It was so much fun! Made Percy Jackson lotus flower cookies with Meredith. Tried some Valentine's Day candy with Justine, and then, we made each other Valentine's Day cards on her channel. Tried pineapple candy and made some funny foods from a box on her channel. Made some marshmallow Lego pops on Nerdy Nummies. Justine: Okay. Made Batman pizza with my dad, Papa Pizza. Ro [as Batman]: Where's the Joker? Papa Pizza [as Batman]: Where's the Penguin? [Ro giggles] Last, but not least, I was in the YouTube Red series "Mind Field" with Michael Stevens. I was in episode 6 and we did the thermal grill illusion. It's when you mix science and hot dogs. I don't want to spoil it. It was so much fun! But whenever you mix science with hot dogs, count me in! Update number 3: I went to the red carpet premiere of Beauty and the Beast and... O M G I love Disney movies, and Beauty and the Beast is one of those classics that's always going to have a special place in my heart, so getting to see it in a live-action form was... amazing! Especially amazing when Belle is played by Emma Watson! [fangirls] Aaaaaa-- Yes! Fourth update: I've fallen in love... with a giraffe named Stanley. He lives at the Malibu Wine Safari and I've been there a lot to visit him. You may have seen this on my Snapchat, but I just thought I would make it official. I love giraffes! Especially ones named Stanley. Fifth update: I had so much fun at CookieCon! A big thank-you to all of you who came out! I hope you had a great time! I did. We did a panel with a Q&amp;A, and then, we got to do a meetup afterwards where I got to meet so many of you guys. That made my weekend! That was so much fun! Also, I got to meet a very inspirational girl named Kate from the Wish Network. Kate, I just wanted you to know that I think that you are so inspiring and I had so much fun hanging out and I'm sending you some more love! Love from California! And wanted to let you know that hanging out with you and your fam., was such a fun time! I loved it! Last update: As some of you know, I am back from Hawaii. I got to do so many fun things there! There was beautiful scenery. I got to kayak and hike to beautiful waterfalls with Justine. Also, my new favorite dessert right now is shaved ice. I fell in love with it while it was visiting and now... All right, that does it for all the updates. And again, just a reminder: the Chicago meetup is in two weeks, Saturday, March 18th, at The Wilton school. I'll put details down below. All right, that's it! I hope to see you there! Bye bye!

Hey guys, it's a Ro.(Hi Ro!)  Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies I got so many requests from you guys to make something else Mario themed and lately I've been playing a lot of the mobile game Super Mario Run if you play through the game you can unlock Princess Peach's cake and it is Adorable (ikr) I fell in love with it as soon as I unlocked it with my toads I thought HMMM We have to make this on Nerdy Nummies The cake in the game is almost as big as her castle so we won't be making it that big today (aww) But it will be a two tiered cake just like the one in the game I am super excited because this is the first time on Nerdy Nummies that we are making a peach cake recipe let's get started (Yay! I'm excited!) The things you'll need to make a peach cake will be three cups of all-purpose flour 1 and 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 a cup of butter 4 eggs 2 cups of frozen peaches quarter cup of oil 2 tablespoons of water 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of baking powder now Let's put it all together first step to making our cake pour your peaches and water into a microwave-safe container Then cover with some food safe plastic wrap pop it in the microwave for 3 minutes *Humming Mario Music* these are fresh out of the microwave they 're still hot and Do they smell good! Over here. I have a blender that we're gonna use to puree our peaches No! We need you. Blend them until they're nice and smooth and set them off to the side I poured the puree back into our Pyrex cup and let it cool now in a medium bowl Mix the puree eggs we're using the whole egg Yolk and white vanilla extract, and then whisk together until it's well combined. I set the peach mixture off to the side now It's time to combine our dry ingredients in a large bowl add your flour sugar baking powder and salt since we'll be using the electric mixer in just a second you can use it now to mix Together your dry ingredients now add your butter remember It is at room temperature and oil mix this together for a few minutes until it starts to look like little pebbles Now add your peach mixture a third at a time eyeball in a third mix it up add the second third Mix it up and the last third mix it up our cake batter is ready I have an 8 inch round cake pan and a 6 inch round cake pan divide the batter between the two cake pans our cakes are ready to bake I Am going to be doubling this recipe so we'll want to 8 inch round cakes and 2 6 inch round cakes and while these are baking I'm gonna be making another batch. Heat your oven to 350 degrees and bake for about 45 minutes our cakes have baked They've had plenty of time to cool and this time We don't level them because we want that extra height take your first 8 inch round cake Place it on top and ice you want this to be a thick layer of buttercream. For our second 8 inch round cake flip it upside down Looks like a cake sandwich (it does xD) I have a 6 inch round cake board place your cake down ice the top stack the second cake again Upside-down cakes are assembled now put them in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill this will make them easier to work with after both Of your cakes have chilled. It's time to frost over here in a piping bag I scooped in some buttercream and dyed it a peach color with yellow food coloring and a little bit of orange I'm gonna start icing the cake at the top pipe the icing onto the cake then use an offset Spatula to smooth it out Then pipe the icing all around the cake then again smooth it out with a spatula (YUMMY! I'm hungry now....) Once your large cake is iced do the same exact thing to the smaller cake both cakes are frosted I've moved the larger cake back onto the turntable Now we'll be switching to some white buttercream icing to add some more detail. At the end, I've got a number 12 tip. We're icing Scallops on the side of the cake, pipe nice large "U"s all the way around the cake then fill with icing and smooth them out with your spatula. Once the scallops are done ice the top of the cake and Smooth it out our first tier of cake is ready. Now it's time to put in our straws. We're giving it some structural support Place your straw all the way down Pull up just a little bit and cutting push It down you want to place your straws towards the center because our second cake is Smaller now we get to place the second tier on top now pipe Scallops on to the top tier just like we did the bottom tier. Ice the top with white Frosting and smooth it out. Our cake is iced, pop this in the fridge to chill while we're making some Decorations to decorate we're gonna make raspberries cherries and Mario Superstars Let's start by making our superstars in front of me I have a piece of wax paper that I've taped down to the surface I also have a little bit of powdered sugar lightly dust your workspace I'm using marshmallow fondant that I've dyed a yellow Gold color roll out your fondant About a half an inch thick we need three stars one large two smaller, but before we cut out our stars I have a really cool technique to give us those Rounded edges cover the top of the fondant and food-safe plastic wrap then use your cookie cutters How you normally would the plastic wrap is gonna pull down the edges of the star and? Round them we want one large star two small stars set the Stars off to the side to harden a little while we make some more decorations another decoration that they have on the cake our little raspberries pinch off about a thumb-sized of fondant roll into a ball Do-do-do-do-do-do-do shape it to be a little bit taller and using a fondant tool I'm making little indents all the way around now (shes too good at this...) This part is totally optional, but I'm gonna be painting the raspberry with a little bit of gold shimmer I think Peach would like it to be sparkly I feel like I know her and just gently painting it around we need 12 of these total last fondant decoration are these delicious-looking Cherries they have on the cake they aren't your average red cherry that you find at the grocery Store everywhere these ones are a light orange color kind of like a Rainier cherry for the cake We'll need to make four of these pinch a little bit of fondant off and roll into a ball every cherry needs a stem So we're gonna be using floral wire we're gonna need a piece about an inch and a half long give it a gentle Bend and place it into the center of the Fondant now make three more final Decoration for these cherries is I want to add a little bit of color on the bottom to make them look like a true Rainier cherry mixed together a drop of red food coloring dye yellow food coloring Dye and a drop of almond extract Tuck your brush underneath the cherry and brush up this gives the cherry a Natural blush now do this to the rest of your cherries And they're all set our stars had time to harden while we were making other decorations now We've got a pipe on those eyes, so it looks like that awe this kind of reminds me of the first episode of Nerdy Nummies when I made a big mario star cake oh here I Have a little bit of black royal icing that I put in a piping bag with a number 2 tip at the end like two Small ovals parallel to each other on each star then with the white royal icing and a little detail on top for a little eye reflection. Our fondant decorations are done. Now. It's time to assemble Everything onto our cake you'll need some more buttercream frosting in a piping bag with an open star tip We have star sprinkles yellow blue green and white and some small red Hearts will start by piping 12 dollops of frosting lightly squeeze the bag and pipe three circles on top of each other then pull away I've got dollops all the way around the first tier of the cake now each dollop gets a raspberry on top the top of the cake also gets 12 dollops But these ones will be a little bit smaller and shorter now for our Rainier cherries place them on top the top of the cake in between our Cherries gets one big dollop now place the three Superstar cake toppers on top of the cake the large one goes in the middle and the two smaller on the side our cake is Almost ready the final decoration step is Adding our sprinkles around the white icing all over the cake.

Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies I got so many requests from you guys to make another emoji themed treat And you guys know that I love the cute little poo emoji, and my baking line has a poo cookie cutter so I thought Oh, what would be yummy? I want to make something cool for the summer so today We are gonna be making poo emoji themed ice cream sandwiches Let's get started! The recipe that we're making today is a chocolate cookie, perfect for ice cream sandwiches. The things you'll need will be: flour, cocoa powder, sugar, eggs baking powder, salt, almond extract, vanilla extract, and butter. Now let's put it all together! The first step to making these chocolate cookies is measuring our dry ingredients and placing them in a large mixing bowl. Starting with flour, we need 2 and 3/4 cups, 3/4 cup of cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Now whisk this together 'till well combined and set off to the side. Next up in a large bowl, cream together your butter and sugar. Starting with sugar, measure one and a half cups, one cup of butter, which is two sticks, then using an electric hand mixer mix together until it's light and fluffy. Now add two eggs, mixing in between each addition. Pour our vanilla extract, add one teaspoon, and our almond extract, add half a teaspoon. Then mix together one more time. Our butter mixture is ready, our dry mixture is ready, Next step, pour all of the dry mixture into the butter mixture and mix together until well combined I like to start mixing at a low speed so you don't get a big poof dust cloud, then work your way up to a medium OH NO! Cookie dough is ready, It's time to chill in the fridge, now you can just pop a lid on this bowl and put it in the fridge, but because it's a larger batch I still want to divide it in two and wrap them up tight so that they'll chill faster We are chilling our dough for 1 hour But you can leave it in the fridge for up to 24 hours Our dough has chilled, it's time to roll it out Sprinkle some flour on top of your work surface so that the dough won't stick Now roll out your dough a quarter inch thick. I have two pink guide rings on the ends of my rolling pin this just ensures It will be perfectly a quarter inch tall Once your dough is rolled out, cut out your cookies and place them onto a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper so they won't stick. Our cookies are ready to bake, heat your oven to 325 degrees and bake for 12 minutes We want them to be nice and soft for our ice cream sandwiches. While the cookies are baking and cooling, we're gonna prepare Our ice cream. You can use whatever ice cream flavour you'd like, but I'm using chocolate because it looks like poo! First step, I have a cookie sheet in front of me, grease it lightly, you don't need a lot Just want the plastic wrap to stick on the top. One horizontal, and one vertical leaving overhang on each side. Next step is gonna get a little messy: scoop all of the ice cream into the baking sheet I got some food safe gloves, and I'm just gonna scoop it in there, just go for it That's okay. That's okay. That's okay. Depending on the size of your tray, just fill it up to the top I'm gonna need a couple cartons of ice cream. Smooth it flat. I'm using a big spatula. Just take your time It's okay if it melts, you want it to melt, because we're going to refreeze it. Now flip up the sides of the plastic wrap and put it in the freezer. While the ice cream is freezing in the fridge It's the perfect time to decorate. In front of me our cookies have baked They've had plenty of time to cool and remember you only need to decorate half of them because that will be the top I've scooped some white and black royal icing into piping bags with number two tips at the end Or if you're using my tip set it is the color blue. Start with the white royal icing and pipe two large ovals for the eyes and a smiley face on the top of each cookie. Then using the black royal icing pipe smaller ovals Inside each eyeball. Our cookies are decorated, and I've taken the ice cream out of the freezer. Now unwrap it I'm using a cutting board that I wrapped in saran wrap so that it won't stick, place it on top of the ice cream I'm using oven mitts because this cookie sheet is so cold, and flip it upside down Just like that. Take your poo cookie-cutter, dip it into some hot water, and cut out as many as you can Oh, perfect! Place it on top of the cookie, push it out, and boom! Look at that! ready to serve. Now make as many as you'd like and TADA! Here are the poo emoji ice cream sandwiches that we've made today a big Thank you to you guys for suggesting another thing emoji themed. I absolutely love the little poo emoji and these turned out so cute I'll be posting the recipe on rosannapansino.com and a bunch of pictures on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram If you guys make these ice cream sandwiches or any other cool treat with the little Poo cookie cutter Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy It makes my day, and if you have any other ideas for any other nerdy nummies Please let me know, leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen Alright, thanks again you guys, bye-bye! And now I get to have one for me. It looks like poop all the way around look at it Mmm. It's not too hard, not too soft mmm-mmm-mmm *outro* 
[Nerdy Nummies theme, link in description] Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! I got so many requests from you to make a unicorn cake, and not just any unicorn cake but a very specific cake that you have been sending me pictures of ideas on social media. It looks like a unicorn face. I'm so excited because I love unicorns. One, they are my sister's favorite animal. Two, they are magical. Three, they make everything better. A unicorn frappuccino. Better! A unicorn cookie. Better! A unicorn headband. Better! So today, we're gonna be making a magical unicorn cake! Let's get started! The recipe that we're making today is a Funfetti cake from scratch. The things you'll need will be: 2 cups of all-purpose flour; 1½ cups of sugar; 1 stick of salted butter, you'll want it at room temperature; 5 large egg whites; ¾ cup of whole milk; ¼ cup of shortening; ¼ teaspoon of almond extract; 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract; 2 teaspoons of baking powder; ⅛ teaspoon of salt; and ¼ cup of rainbow sprinkles! Now let's put it all together! First step is whisking together our dry ingredients in a medium bowl. Add your flour, baking powder, and salty salty. Then, whisk together till well combined, and set off to the side. Next, in a large mixing bowl, cream together your butter, shortening, and sugar. *clinks glass* Get off there! Okay. Then, using an electric hand mixer, mix together until it's light and fluffy. I like to start on the low speed and work my way up to a medium. Now, add in your egg whites, one at a time. I've combined them all in a bowl, so just eyeball it. Gloop! Then mix it up, add the next egg. Mix it up, next egg, mix it up, next egg, mix it up. And last egg, mix it up. And don't forget to scrape down the sides. Now, add in your extracts. Vanilla, and almond. And, once again, mix it up! This smells so good! Ohh! We have our wet mixture, dry mixture, and milk. Now, alternate adding your dry mixture, and your milk, to the wet. Add a third of the dry. Mix it up! Half the milk. Mix it up! Second third of the dry. Mix it up! Last of the milk. Mix it up! Last of the dry. Mix it up! Don't forget to scrape down the sides. Our batter is almost ready, but we haven't added the magic yet! We need some rainbow sprinkles to make this a TRUE Funfetti cake! We're adding the fun! *unicorn fairy noises* Then, fold with a spatula. You don't want to use the electric mixer, because it may break apart your sprinkles, they're a little bit delicate! It's a cake party, but we have to be gentle. Look at that cake batter! THAT is fun! That is some Funfetti. It smells delicious! Now, evenly divide the batter between 3 cake pans. I'm using 6" round circle cake pans, greased and lined with a piece of parchment paper at the bottom to make it easier to remove the cake. Cakes are ready to bake! Heat your oven to 350°F and bake for about 30-35 minutes. Just keep your eyes on the cake while they bake. As soon as the top turns a golden brown, might be a good idea to poke with a cake tester, or, if you don't have a cake tester, you can use a toothpick. Just place in the toothpick, or the cake tester, then when you pull it out, and there's no batter sticking to it, the cake's ready. Once your cakes have baked, give them plenty of time to cool. Over here, I have leveled them. You can use a cake leveler like me, or a sharp cutting knife. Now, it is time to assemble our cake! In front of me, I have a little cake plate, and a turntable... *table spins* ...to make frosting a little bit easier! Take the first layer. Place it down! In a piping bag, I scooped in some vanilla buttercream frosting. I like to pipe an outline all the way around. Then, fill it in! And, using an offset spatula, smooth it out. Now add the next layer, and cover with frosting, just like we did before. Ooo! Look at all that Funfetti cake! Now for our top layer, remember this super cool trick. You're gonna flip your cake upside down, so the bottom of the cake is actually on the top! Frost the entire cake, starting at the top, then working your way around the sides. Once you've piped icing from the bottom to the top of the cake, take your large offset spatula. Gently press against the cake as you spin the turntable. To get the icing very smooth, you may have to spin it around a few times. Once you've smoothed the sides, the last thing I like to do is take your spatula, and bring in the top. Work your way, all the way around. After icing the cake, I placed it onto a cake stand. If you don't have a cake stand, place your cake on whatever you'd like to serve it on. A serving tray, a cake plate, whatever you have handy. I like this one 'cause it was light blue. And I've placed it on top of a turntable again. Next step is adding some decorations. With a bunch of different colored buttercream icings that I have over here, we're gonna pipe a bunch of these, all over the top. And cascading down the side to look like a unicorn's mane. *lip flapping* I've dyed the icings light purple, pink, darker purple, and blue. Kind of a pastel blend. I just thought these colors would look good together, but you can use any colors you'd like. I'm gonna start by piping rosettes with my light purple, and light pink. Both of these have an open star tip. This a #824. A rosette kinda looks like a little rose. You start on the inside, and work your way up. I always am scared the frosting's gonna just jump out at my hair. Same thing with the pink. Around, and lift. Now, I'm using the light pink, and a darker pastel purple, french tips. These are #4B. Pipe little dollops inbetween the rosettes. Last but not least, with our dark pastel purple and blue, pipe some kisses. The tips at the end of these are round circles, a #2A. Squeeze down, apply pressure, and then pull up, so it looks like a little Hershey's Kiss. Boop! I don't know why the noise helps, but it does! Helps me. Got our magical unicorn mane piped on. Now, it's time to pipe on the eyes. Over here, in a little piping bag, I have some black icing, with a number 4 tip. I'm keeping my eye desing very simple, by piping 2 arches, with some little lashes, but you can pipe any design you'd like. Our unicorn cake is almost done, but it is no unicorn, without a horn! So pop the cake in the fridge while we work on making our final decorations, the unicorn horn, and ears. First step is making the ears. In front of me, I have taped down a piece of wax paper, so the fondant won't stick to the surface. And I've got a little bit of powdered sugar. I'm gonna sprinkle a little bit down, on top of the wax paper. Spread it around, break off a little bit of white marshmallow fondant, and roll it flat. I have a teardrop and a smaller teardrop cookie cutter. Cut out 2 of each. I'm also taking a little dab of water. The water helps the fondant stick together. It acts as an adhesive. Then, to shape the ears, allow them to dry on top of something rounded. I'm just gonna use my fondant rolling pin, but you could also use a whisk, or another rolling pin. To make our unicorn horn, I have rolled out a tapered rope of fondant. It's thinner at one end, thicker at the other. I like to use a long lollipop stick, but if you don't have one of these at home, you could also use a wooden skewer. Take a little paintbrush, get some water on the end, and paint your lollipop stick. This will help the fondant attach. Now, twirl the fondant around the lollipop stick, to create a little unicorn horn! It kinda looks like one of those unicorn lollipops that you see at Disneyland, and they're all rainbowed and delicious! This is what the horn looks like. I've left some space of the lollipop stick at the bottom, so you can stick it into the cake. Now just let it sit out for 10-30 minutes to harden. Final step to making our fondant decorations, we're gonna paint them gold! Over here, I have some gold edible highlighter dust. A little bit goes a long way. You don't need to use a lot. Pour a little bit, into a small bowl. *doot doots* Then I'm adding some almond extract, so that when we're painting, it won't be streaky. You can actually use any clear alcohol. Look how pretty that is! Move the gold around. I wanna paint a liner on with this! This is so pretty! Now, paint the inner ear, and the whole horn gold! Just took the cake out of the fridge, it's chilled. Now the final decoration step. Add our horn, and ears. Oh my gosh! Lookity! Ta~DAAA!! Here is the unicorn cake that we made today, with a homemade Funfetti cake recipe. I've been seeing so many pictures of these kind of cakes all over social media. And I absolutely LOVED making this one. I'll be posting lots of pictures, and the recipe on: RosannaPansino.com, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. You can check it out there. And if you guys make this cake, please take a picture, and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy, it makes my day! Especially when it's unicorn! It's my sister's favorite animal! Well, it's a toss up between unicorns and the narwhals, which are unicorns of the sea. Fiddy-fiddy. If you have any other ideas, for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen. Thanks again, you guys. Buh-bye!

So go check her out, subscribe, show her some love Today I invited her over because I did a little holiday shopping A little holiday shopping?! Maybe a little, and I was at the store And I could not believe how many holiday candy and treats there were so I thought let's have Justine over Let's try some holiday treats and candy so we're gonna try 'em So you guys don't have to we're gonna find the good ones Justine: Yes I'm so excited cuz I actually have tried a few of these because I am a holiday treats Uh... Extraordinaire Ooh, an expert over here, Can I can I get my favourite?! Which ones do you wanna do first?

Just making snacks, and I am just sitting there like MMMMMMMMMMMMM There's just like a conveyor belt yeah, and it's like BBBRRRRMMMMM INTO MY MOUTH. these are pretzel crisps they are white chocolate flavored covered in decadent peppermint flakes. oh my god, I'm so happy. It's a flat pretzel. I like these okay. These are delicious This is something that I am so into getting a tummy, ache for Wow Love I'm actually hungry because this is my breakfast so I was looking over here at these little cookies they are little gingerbread men cookies, and I found at the store, but I thought these are a little odd because it's Ginger family, so you don't just need gingerbread men you can eat the entire family You're eating mom, dad, and the twins here. the kid looks like they're joined Happy Holidays Justine Let's really just make some big decisions here I feel like, what's that fable? Where there's that candy house, and then she eats kids uuuuuuuhhhh...UUUUHHHHHH..Walking dead? there's a lot going on that happened this year on Walking Dead I think this is Dad. Oh, yeah a lot of the smells really delicious. Oh, here's the kids This reminds me I think it's on Delta they give you like that little biscotti You coffee's that good like that little round my god.

You know how they have like rule gingerbreads like decorating kids look. There was a gingerbread boy. Kid. I was like Fuck man like they had to be like this is a boy a gingerbread boy I can't I got it so if you want to come over and Find out which treat do you want to try next you know as much as I would love to try these Oreos I think that we should maybe dive into these triple gingerbread feet this Honestly looks like something that when I have a nightmare and I wake up like this is what I see now These are little Christmas tree. They should have called these tree But treatments missed opportunity, that's okay. They didn't hire me for their marketing They obviously didn't hire you to bake their marshmallow I'm very particular So I would have been like quality control the I bowels look terrifying this one only has one we got a cyclops gingerbread marshmallow over here Yeah, I want to try one I want to know if they're flavored or is it just a traditional it smells good, okay? Still delicious light and fluffy delicious and has some like holiday spice and sugar on it I actually really like that and then this one. Let me take a bite No tree That's a good Pete. Yeah, yeah, the next treat. We're gonna try are these a traditional candy cane But with a cool twist these are flavored like hot cocoa and I thought oh How cute it's like hot cocoa you said it was a cool twist yeah, hot twist Hot cocoa how do you open what are you now usually I go for the end and I bite off Like that and then I'll peel it down. I usually just go like that I Just break off the top, and then this one's like ready to go, and then I save this for later. Oh treat multiple dreams Treats for your dogs hold on Justine. I'm sorry okay this one, so cookie doesn't eat it. She's a little Hoover She's a little vacuum. She'll eat anything on the ground trying to love it. Is it good mm-hmm Oh Yeah, that's right on. This is a great flavor. Oh I think I may have crashed a thumbs up. Thanks. Just like hot cocoa no surprises delicious run Oh, and if you take a little nibble of it it takes even more like hot chocolate. I'm gonna try We got something else hot cocoa what are we oh yes, hot cocoa themed Oreos I'm violent oh Look at these And half of it's like a marshmallow and half of its like cocoa this is great Okay, I'm gonna do the full sandwich see what we got going on. We'll do science Move I love science Meet you there's so much candy. Hey Derek. Good morning. Hello Hi, Darrin, would never mean hi Papa pizza damn look what we look what I found at the store jellybeans Okay, so the one thing I really want to try But I don't have two of so we're gonna have to try it together these little candies Maybe would be like a cute stocking stuffer as a joke if you're naughty You know you get coal in your stocking But these are like supposed to be delicious coal candy have you ever got cool in your stocking? No. I'm always know I'm always nice If Santa's always watching he's like He's the CIA he's like watching us all the time yeah.

Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! Today I have a special guest you guys, look it's Justine!
[Justine] Hi! This is my friend, she's so cool. I'm gonna put her links down below, go check her out, go say hi, give her some love and I got so many requests from you guys to make something if you can tell by the outfit, Lego themed! Justine is the perfect guest to make something Lego, 'cause you were like a lego expert. [Justine] I'm obsessed. I have so many sets that I haven't even had time to build and even the lego movie, I bought every single mini figure. [Ro] She also made like a life size Justine lego figure. [Justine] We don't have to talk about that though. [Ro] I'm going to embarrass her and I'm gonna put a link,
[Justine] No, no. [Ro] it was so cool I love it [Justine] Its terrifying, you won't be able to sleep at night. [Ro] So, today we are gonna be making little Lego marshmallow pops.   [Ro] And the things you will need will be: Some marshmallows, mini marshmallows, yellow candy melts. [Justine] Lollipop sticks, edible marker pens, and we've got a candy melting pot! [Both] LET'S PUT IT ALL TOGETHER! [Ro] The first thing we're gonna do is pour your candy melts into your melting pot. Justine, pour 'em in there. [Justine] Alright! [Ro] And then we're gonna turn it on all the way. [Justine] And while it's heating, let's just stir these up so we can melt them all nice and even. [Justine] I just bought this on the internet. [Ro] Justine just... 
[Justine] This is the best purchase ever. [Ro] Did you Amazon it? [Justine] Oh yeah, it will be here tomorrow. [Ro I love amazon prime. 
[Justine] Oh me too, it's dangerous. [Ro] Domino's does drone pizza delivery in New Zealand. [Justine] Maybe, I have a future of being a drone pizza pilot. But what if it crashes in the middle of the street? [Ro] Free pizza.
[Justine] I'm tired. [Ro] I got all these new muscles [Justine] Yeah, I think I lost all mine [Ro] Sometimes when you're working with candy melts, the texture is very thick, so when you dip it, it's just very heavy little globs. To get it thinner, I like to use oil flakes Keep adding until it's the consistency you like. [Justine] Can you get these on Amazon? [Ro] I don't know if they dro-drone drop 'em though. [Justine] It says they're also known as paramount crystals, and I can get them by tomorrow. [Justine] Ordered.
[Ro] Yes! [Ro] Justine you're gonna be a baking machine!
[Justine] That's true. [Ro] Now we are going to [BOTH] *Singing Dip* [Ro] Oh! Oh, woah! Justine! Justine!
[Justine] Nope, uh. Sorry, took it too far. [Ro] Woahhh!!
[Justine] I don't know, it's all I could reach! [Ro] Okay grab a lollipop stick, lady. 
[Justine] Alright. [Ro] We're going to dip our little lollipop stick, just a little bit, and then we're going to stick it into our marshmallow. We're actually going to poke the lollipop stick all the way through the marshmallow, and now, we're gonna dip. [Ro] All the way down until the top of the lollipop stick, right there. Pull it up, let the excess drip off. *Repeatedly saying 'tap'* That already looks like their head a little bit! Now we're going to take the mini marshmallows and you're gonna cut them in half and I'm gonna have Justine do it cause she's good. She was ready.
[Justine] I like to cut. [Ro] Okay go! [Justine] Do we need to cut anything or... [Ro] Yeah, you can cut this little sticker off!
[Justine] Okay! Yep! [Ro] Aw, there's his little head! Put em' right on top. [Ro] Boop, boop, boop. And then we're gonna dip it one more time, just to cover the top. And tap again. *Repeatedly saying 'tap'* [Justine] So once they look like this, you can put them in your foam block to dry. [Ro] Then your gonna do this to the rest of your marshmallows! You can make as many as you'd like. [Justine] So we've got em' all here, [Justine] We've made a bunch of them and we let them dry for about 10 minutes.
[Ro] Yup! [Ro] And now we are going to use edible food pens. These are kinda cool, they're like food markers. You can just draw any little lego face that you want, there's very classic ones, there's newer ones, or you can make one up yourself. 'Cause we're in California, I'm-a do some shades. [Ro] Oh look at yours!
[Justine] Oh, he's getting there, he's- [Ro] That's like my face if someone tells me that there's no more coffee at home. [Both] *Gasps* [Ro] I just finished this cool guy with his shades. [Justine] It's good. 
[Ro] I think, I'm gonna do a Harry Potter one. [Justine] *Gasps* 
[Ro] Here we come, little lightning bolt! [Ro] Wow she gotta smokey!
[Justine] Woah, woah! [Ro] Okay, Justine paint me and then I'll paint you.
[Justine] Okay, okay. [Ro] Wait. Wait, wait. Lemme pick a pose. Oh, I've always wanted to model for like a live painting. Oh, okay, uh... [Justine] Okay. [Ro] This is very hard to model. [Justine] You-I mean, I- I have it. [Ro] You have to hold it like this for a really long time. [Justine] I've got it in my mind now, so you can-
[Ro] Really? [Justine] Yes, I've got it. I have photographic memory.
[Ro] Okay, okay just- Justine, you forget things though. [Ro] I wanna draw you!
[Justine] *Gasps* [Justine] Oh boy!
[Ro] Okay. [Jusitne] It's gonna be good.
[Ro] You've got some good brows. [Justine] Aw, thanks girl! [Ro] Okay, these brows do not do you justice. [Ro] *Gasps* Oh, it's beautiful! That's me!
[Justine] Yes, it is, isn't it? [Ro] This is you!
[Justine] Oh wow, that's good! [Ro] Looks just like her!
[Justine] It looks just like me! [Ro] Only it's brunette [Both] Ta-dah! [Ro] Here are the marshmallow Lego pops that we made today. These ones are our classics. These were our favourites, they made the cut. [Justine] Yeah, these ones, we're just gonna eat them. [Both] Cheers! [Ro] We're gonna eat- it's ourselves. [Justine] Do you- nah, that just sounds wrong. This is incredible. [Ro] They remind me of like, campfire. A big thank you to you guys for suggesting something Lego themed and a big thank you to Justine, my girlfriend, for helping me bake today. [Justine] These were great. [Ro] She's amazing, she knows a lot about Legos. [Justine] I love them. We're gonna have to do a time-lapsed Lego build. [Ro] *Gasps* I would love that. Can I come over for a Lego build and a glass of wine?
[Justine] It would be great. Please, it will be great!
[Ro] Yes! I'm gonna be putting her links down below, so go check her out, go say hello and I'm going to be taking pictures of the pops that we made today and posting the recipe on RosannaPansino.com Instagram, Facebook and Twitter so you can check it out there. And if you guys make pops, please take a picture and send it to us. You can tweet it to us, I love seeing your baking creations
[Justine] Please do. [Ro] It just makes my day. And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, let me know, leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen.

Hey guys, it's Ro welcome to my home, today i'm gonna take you on a tour of my new place. Some of you know that I moved in earlier in the year. I just got settled. But before we start, a big thank you to Amazon for sponsoring and collaborating with me to make this video possible. I don't know about you guys, but i'm always ordering stuff on amazon and some of the furniture and items you'll see in my house, I ordered from amazon So i'll put a link down below to all of those items so you can check them out if you want now without further ado Come on innn The first thing that you'll see in my house is the entryway. I always like to keep a console in the entryway Especially ones with drawers cause You can keep things that you grab right before you run out the door. For example, I like to take My dog cookie on walks everyday So I keep her little harness and leash and even her doggie seatbelt in this draw. This thing is so cool i'ma put a link down below but you just click it into your seat belt just like you would a human and it keeps them safe while you're driving! I also like to keep a bowl as a catch-all just to throw Your keys or phone in when you're coming or going so that you don't lose, them because I am notorious for losing My keys and my phone one more thing that I like to have in the entryway is a big mirror so you can Check yourself before you run out the door, and be like oh good i don't have any boogers in my Nose i could head out for the day then over here is the formal dining room where i just had thanksgiving Let's go check it out this is where a lot of eating goes down i like to host for the holidays we also use this Room for a meeting room and we fit? 17 of us in here so this room is also perfect for my family because i have a very large family the style of this House is cape cod it has a very clean fresh look, that i fell in love with, also another Style detail throughout the house as the whole house has a beautiful hardwood floors and i had to learn that you need area rugs because There's a ton of echo and dirt the rug that i found in this room is one of my? Favorite rug it is so soft when i put it in the room cookie My, little dog she went under here and was taking a Nap and i couldn't get her to come out so i had to crawl under there to get her and i was like? Oh, this is actually really cozy and i curl up in a ball and i like took a Nap, with her on this rug this room, also used to be a lot Darker when i moved in i took off the wallpaper i painted it a Brighter color and i picked this or but she and alire i love it because it's clean it's Bright, and even though it's big it's very See-through, so it doesn't feel like it's blocking off the room alright that's it for the dining room now Let's move on let's go to the kitchen one of my favorite rooms yeah i feel like this is the heart of my Home it's where i spend the most time i am always baking and cooking in this kitchen This kitchen with all the appliances and gadgets is a foodies dream come True one of the things that i love about this room, is that the kitchen is an open floor concept Leaving into the living room it's like, one big entertainment space Which is something i love because i love having people over just a layer this Year i had 50 people between the kitchen and the living room they were all over for a tv finale party Whenever i'm having get-togethers people tend to hang out in the kitchen it's Where all the yummy food is one of my favorite pieces of furniture that i found and the entire house are These chairs when i moved in i had really old director's chairs they were falling apart These screws were coming out the fabric had been completely stretched and they were really crickety like And i needed, some new chairs i love that they have a director chair vibe but they're, way more Comfortable so if the guest comes over to bake with Me their friends our family or manager can just sit here and watch as We film over here is usually my coffee station my

Here because it makes it easier for her to get on the bed and off the bed and i also love that there's more seating? In here when my friends come over we used to all Sit on the bed make popcorn watch movies and hang out there Was just not a lot of space and now there's a lot of seating on the bed The bench the couch and even the floor if you, guys know I like soft drugs i'm obsessed so i found another really soft rug for the Room it feels good on my, face some of you, may recognize the, big mir that i have on this Wall it's from, my last place i used to have it in the living room now It sits in the bedroom it's where i check, my outfits every, day, make sure like you know My shoes are on the right feet and my shirts not backwards because you know that's Never happened to me before i went to the airport Went through security we're on the plane i get home i was like, my pants are inside-out then over here the bedroom has a Fireplace and a tv above it i don't get a lot of time off but whenever i do i like to curl up on the Bed with, my little dog cookie and binge watch a show, with the fireplace on it basically feels like, cozy, cozy, cabin cozy And i love it that does it for the bedroom let's go down, to the other end of the hallway to the bathroom Welcome to my bathroom i actually, don't think i've filmed anything in here before just a few Like, bath, bombs snaps of my tub But this bathroom has two sinks ones on the side one is on the other side and behind me is a vanity Where i sit and do my? Makeup i have a bunch of makeup and these two drawers right here directly behind the vanity in the center of the room is a Bathtub i fell in love with, this room as soon as i saw the hardware on the tub this hardware reminded Me of my time in france i stayed in a very small cottage and it had this Hardware it also makes when you try to help, your sister bleach your hair and diet rainbow But then you leave it in too long, and some of her hair falls out and you have to emergency rinse it out This, also can come in handy but i don't know, who would ever do that that never would happen there's Also a fireplace on this wall in front of the tub very cozy, you can take a, bath by the fire Oh it couldn't be more romantic then if you added a beautiful chandelier which is what i did there was a light fixture here? When i moved in but i wanted one that felt more romantic and more french so i installed this one behind Me over here is a toilet pretty exciting stuff i know then here is the bigger Shower i've ever seen in my entire Life i could, probably do a handstand in there or something i don't know it has a little bench that could be my bed like look at 8 this my new bed This man you, miss my pillow, oh?

Ro - "Isn't that fun though? Swoozie - "This is so rewarding. Here we go." Ro - "There you go, there you go."
Swoozie - "Is that supposed to happen?"
Ro - "Yeah, just do circles." Swoozie - "This is all mixed up."
Ro - "Yeah, look at that."
Swoozie - "Now we have to add the eggs one at a time." Swoozie - "So, uh, I don't know how YOU do it. Do you do on the table, or do you do on the edge?" Ro - "You're supposed to do it on the table, but I do it on the edge because-"
Swoozie - "You're a professional." Ro - "I like to live on the wild side."
Swoozie - "You're in the fast lane."
Ro - "And I have to be honest with you, I don't always get a clean break." Swoozie - "Ahhh..."
Ro - "And sometimes, a little shell will get stuck in there."
Swoozie - "Yeah..." Swoozie - "For demonstration purposes, I will crack it on the table."
Ro - "Go for it Swoozie, let me see what you got."
Swoozie - "Are you ready?" Ro - "Yeah, crack the egg, whole thing in there." 
Swoozie - "Here we go. Boom."
Ro - "Yeahhh." Swoozie - "That's how I roll."
Ro - "Nice." Ro - "And mix it up."
Swoozie - "You're gonna do the number two?"
Ro - "Yeah."
Swoozie - "Alright, let's see." Ro - "Now, I'm gonna show you how to do the one handed egg crack, okay?"
Swoozie - "Ohhh!" Swoozie - *gasp* "You know about this?"
Ro - "So, you're gonna crack, and then with the top two fingers, pointer finger and thumb, twist, and then on the bottom, you twist the opposite way." Swoozie - "I'm ready.
Ro - "And you're gonna do it next time."
Swoozie - "One take. This is the only eggs we have here in the house, so you have to get this right." Ro - "Okay, here we go, crack crack, and twist!" Ro - "...See? See what happens sometimes?"
Swoozie - "Yeah... That's... yeah..." Ro - "Swoozie, can I have a towel for my hands? Because this is just really gross. I really messed it up."
Swoozie - "Yeah, you can borrow this, you just step on over here. Alright, I will begin." Ro - "Swoozie's doing great. I just think it was a warm egg. When they're colder, they do it better.
Swoozie - "Are you ready?"
Ro - "Yeah." Swoozie - "Don't say you're ready if you're not ready. Are YOU ready? Okay." 
Ro - "Oh, I'm ready. Let's just see what happens 'cause I've already messed it up so, we know how to fix it." Swoozie - "Ope."
Ro - "Oh-." Ro - "That worked. It was just slow-mo. And last mix."
Swoozie - "We could work at Cheesecake Factory, do you know that?
Ro - "Ohhhh..." Ro - "What's your favorite thing at Cheesecake Factory?"
Swoozie - "Oh, I know it's gonna sound a little basic, but their Linda Fudge Cake." Swoozie - *gasp* Swoozie - "Have you had it?"
Ro - "...no."
Swoozie - "Get some-" *laughs* Ro - "Next we are going to zest and juice the lemons, starting with zesting, you want to zest first. It's kind of like grating cheese."
Swoozie -  "That, I've done." Ro - "You know? Yeah."
Swoozie - "I love cheese." Ro - "And you just want to grate until the white part is showing. Once you see white, stop, you don't want to go any deeper than that." Swoozie - "That smells delicious."
Ro - "Oh, it smells so good. It smells like fresh lemonade."
Swoozie -  "Mhmm..." Ro - *orgasmic sigh* 
Swoozie - "Oh wow, it actually does."
Ro - "Lemon Jolly Ranchers!"
Swoozie - "Lemon drop." Ro - *inhale* "Oooh, lemon drops."
Swoozie - "You doing alright over there?"
Ro - "Yeah." Ro - "Okay, now to juice these, it's really easy. We're just gonna cut them in half."
Swoozie - "Okay there we go hi-yah. 
Ro - "Yeah, you can use a little hand juicer, or this little guy." Swoozie - "Heyyy! You have-? Wow..."
Ro - "Look'it. And it's kind of messy, it's kind of messy, but that's okay." Swoozie - "Wait, hold on, actually."
Ro - "Wait, how's that doing-? Oh yeah, better roll up your sleves. Yeah, gotta use the muscles." Swoozie - "Oh, I think I got some juices on me. I gotta burn this outfit now."
Ro - "That's okay. Nice. Nice! Nice!"
Swoozie - "Yeah, I gotta get in there and get all the juices! Are you getting all the juices?" Ro - "Muscles!" (x5)
Swoozie - "You know, this needs to be your thumbnail, right here. I'll give you some options for your thumbnail."
Ro - "Okay." "My mom. She came to check it out, Swoozie."
Swoozie - "I thought that was your security guard."
Ro - "No, that's my mom!" Ro - "Hi mom!" *laughs*
Swoozie - "Oh, 'cause she was walking around out there, touching her ear, like she was touching her earpiece." Ro - "That was probably her hearing aid.
Both - *laugh* Ro - "I'm just kidding, mom. You're probably messing with your hair or something. I don't know." Ro - "Okay, look at this: fresh lemon juice, fresh zest."
Swoozie - "I love it."
Ro - "Now, let's add it to our butter mixture." Ro - "We'll need two tablespoons of lemon zest, and three tablespoons of lemon juice."
Swoozie - "Now, at this point, you have to let this know who's boss." Swoozie - "So get in there. Before, you can flirt a little bit. You know, be nice, and dainty, but now you-" *growls* "get in there!" Both - "Get in there!"
Ro - Just tell him what- whose the boss of this- the bowl!"
Swoozie - "I am your daddy! Grrrrr!" Ro - "Here are the last two ingredients to add, our flour and buttermilk. Add a little flour, mix it up, buttermilk, mix it up, flour, mix it up, buttermilk, mix it up, and then flour, mix it up." Swoozie - "Can I hold this for one second?"
Ro - "This is a really nice, made with love batter- Swoozie! What-?" Ro - "Swoozie!" (x7)
Swoozie - "Wha-? Aw, I can't? Oh, sorry." Swoozie - "I can't-? Oh, I wasn't doing anything!"
Ro - "Oh my gosh." Swoozie - "I was just- I was just looking. I was just looking at it. Just looking, that's it!"
Ro - "Yeah, that's all you were doing." Ro - "Batter is ready, time to scoop some cupcakes. In front of me, I have a cupcake tray, lined with a bunch of these little liners. Again, they are aluminum lined so that when they bake, the outside color won't change. And I'm just using an ice cream scoop. You want a full scoop, and fill it two-thirds full. All right, all right. Go ahead Swoozie." Swoozie - "Just gonna get a nice little scoop, and then you want to-?"
Ro - "Yeah."
Both - "Alright."
Swoozie - "Boom." Ro - "You're just gonna do that to the rest of the cupcake trays, fill them all up."
Swoozie -  "Once you guys are all done, Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and then toss these bad boys in for 14 to 16 minutes. So our cupcakes are all baked, they've had plenty of time to cool. Ro, what happens next?" Ro - "Now, we frost, and decorate."
Swoozie - "Mmmm..."
Ro - "Super simple this time. Again, we've got some buttercream icing in these piping bags." Ro - "To decorate, this is very easy, we're just doing a little dome of frosting."
Swoozie - "Just a dab." Ro - "Hover, and then squeeze. Boom! *gasp* Swoozie's got skills!"
Swoozie - "Alright, I'm just gonna go ahead and start doing the rest of these, 'cause I need this." Swoozie - "I'm ready to eat."
Ro - "And then if you want it to spread a little bit more evenly, you just tap your cupcake. Tap-tap-tap.
Swoozie - "Ohhh!" Swoozie - "Look at you with this secret. Oh- and it works!"
Ro - "Tap-tap-tap, boop-boop-boop."
Swoozie - "Oh, who's gonna eat all this?" Ro - "Oh no..."
Swoozie - "Me." Ro - "Final decoration step- Will you help me open up the little icing decorations?"
Swoozie - "Yes. Okay, that'd be awesome if I just like, popped-" Swoozie - "Op-"
Ro - "Dibs!"
Swoozie - "These are actually pretty good." Swoozie - "Okay, so, we're gonna put these anywhere?"
Ro - "They're just sweet and crunchy.
Swoozie - "I love sweet, so..."
Ro - "Then you just place them on the top, boop!" Swoozie - "Mhhh. You make that sound effect, too?"
Ro - "Boop!" Ro - "Swoozie, look at these, look how cute they are!"
Swoozie - "And this is so, Flash." Swoozie - "I don't know how much longer I can look at this before just eating it, so you better show the camera."
Ro - "Okay, let's show 'em." Both - "TA~DAAA!" Ro - "Here are the lemon lightning bolt cupcakes that we've made today. A big THANK YOU to Swoozie." Ro - "Thank you so much for helping me make these."
Swoozie - "Thanks for having me."
Ro - "I had so much fun.
Swoozie -  "Oh my goodness." Ro - "I always love making baked goods with fresh fruit inside. This recipe is so good, It's simple and, if you like lemon, two thumbs up. I'll be posting Swoozie's links down below, Again, don't forget, show him some love go subscribe. He's amazing. I love his content. I'll be posting the recipe and a bunch of pictures on RosannaPansino.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter So you can check it out there, and if you guys have any other ideas for any other ~NeRdY NumMIES~ Let me know, leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen." Ro - "Alright, are you ready? Okay. Swoozie!"
Swoozie - *exasperated* Oh, we get to eat 'em now!" Swoozie - "Mmm, ohhh..."
Ro - "Mm, the lemon is so good. It is so good, this lemon is right on." Swoozie - "So we got it, right? We're good?"
Ro - "M-hm! Yeah, we're good."
Swoozie - "Okay... okay, thank you."
Ro - "Okay." Swoozie - "THANKS, RO!"
Ro - "Bye, Swoozie." *laughs* 
- Hey guys! It's Ro. Today, I'm hanging out with
my friend, Justine. - Hi!
- She's super awesome. I'm gonna put her links down below. We just made a video
over on her channel where we're trying out
coffee technology. - [Justine] Yeah.
- [Ro] It's a new gadget. We're doing an unboxing video. - [Justine] I love doing
unboxing with Ro! It's like the best thing ever! - I'll put a link down below to that. Anyways, I had to invite
her over because she is my partner-in-crime. We have been trying
so many treats together and I got so many requests
from you guys to try some Mexican candies. So that is exactly what
we're gonna be doing today. I have never had Mexican candy before. - I mean I might have accidentally and I didn't know it. But I've never had anything
that is on this table before. - I've never tried this.
We had our friends go out and pick out a bunch
of different Mexican candy and we are gonna try
all of them today. Alright, so these are made in Mexico. They're Enchilokas! Chili covered gummies?! - Oh, my go-- I don't even know what to say. - There's some mango on the front. So I really don't know
what's going on here. But they just look amazing! - I'm just wondering what's
your definition of "amazing"? Because this looks like
rabbit turd droppings to me. - I may be an old lady at heart, and that's just who I am
but don't these kinda look like individual prunes? Do you like prunes?
- Oh god, yeah! - I like prunes. (laughs)
- Ahhh, not really That's not on my, like, you
know, it's not on my diet list. Let's cut 'em open! - I don't know--
(slices) Whoa!
- Whoa! Oh.
- Oh, it does look like a prune. - It looks bloody. (both giggle) - Okay, let's do a smell test. - Hohh! Ho, boy! (sniffs) - Oh. (coughs) (laughs) Are you ready, girl? (laughs) (both laughing) - Okay, are we eating
the whole thing? - Yeah.
- Really?! - Yeah! One, two, three. (giggles) oh thats hot.. (laughs) - Oh, God.. - Whoa!
- Oh! - Ohhh! (coughs, choking) - What?! What is this?! I hate it!! (choking)
(laughing) - I'm drooling. I'm drooling.
- Me too. I'm disgusted with myself right now. - So much sodium.
(coughing) (inaudible) - I'm sorry. - It looks like maybe there is,
like, a mango candy in the middle but whatever it's coated in is a lot of sugar, a lot of sodium and a lot of spice. - It's covered in death. I don't want have
anything to deal with this. (squishing) This was nuts! - [Ro] That face right there was our face. - This looks like cheese. Should we do that? - Yeah. It's by De La Rosa. And it says it's a peanut candy. Ooh! Look at these! - [Justine] This looks like a refreshing treat. - Oh, it's really flakey.
- Yeah. - Oka-- Oh, oh!
- Oh! Oops.
- Uh-oh! That went down my shorts.. - It's like powdered
peanut butter in my mouth. I'm taking one of these
for the road home. - Oh, these are good. Mm! - The ingredients are basically
sugar and peanut butter. Like, that's it!
- Count me in. - [Justine] Me too! Oh, this is right up on my speed alley. - Mm-hmm. Right up the alley. It's-- and that is the speed. Now I wanna try these candies 'cause they look friendly and
the candies look like little flags. The kids look so happy. So I'm hoping, Justine,
this is what we look like. Yeah, these are great! (laughs) Let's give it a chomp!
(slices) (gasps) Oh!
- Here you go. - These are so cute.
- And it smells just like coconut too. (Ro sniffs) - Oh, my gosh. I love coconut!
- [Justine] Oh! (giggles) - [Ro] How is it? - It doesn't taste--, like,
I didn't taste some plastic. There's no taste. - Oh, yeah! It's little
coconut shaving. - I'm afraid every time I take
a bite of something now! (both giggling) - That first candy was, like, traumatizing! - Honestly. (choking)
(laughing) - Okay, next candy. Justine,
you pick the candy. - We should probably move on to
one of these little things, maybe. - Okay, which one do you want to do? - Umm, this one looks really fun. - Oh, my gosh.
- It's like a Lucas Gustano? It looks like a little squeeze tube. - Uh-oh! Hot liquid candy. When I was growing up,
there was basically these tubes. It's like gel candy. You just squeeze it in your mouth. I was not allowed to have these but once in a while, I go to 7-Eleven, save my allowance and sneak one
and I would buy one and not tell my Mom and Dad.
- You're such a rebel! - And I'll just be like, "Ow, yeah!" (both laugh) - So...
- I'm so scared. I feel like I cannot do this to myself. Okay, Justine.
I'm gonna give this to you. - No, you are not! - Yeah! And you do me. Oh, my God!
- Yeah. It's just a little bit, not a lot.
(Justine screaming) Okay, just keep your mouth open,
Justine, and don't move. Otherwise it might get
in your eye or something. I don't wanna do that. (muffled) One, two, three, go! (yelling in pain) - You didn't give me any! You didn't give me any. (continues yelling in pain) (both yelling in pain, Justine coughing) (without tongue)
Oh, this is not okay! I might as well just swallow it at this point. It doesn't (inaudible). (coughing) Sorry. (inaudible) (muffled coughing) - It got in my hair! (giggling and laughing)
(Justine coughing) I don't know my name anymore! (both laughing) - That was really sour. - Okay, what's this?
- Okay, whoo! - This is like some sort of a little dip? - [Ro] We've got a happy
little kid on the front. Strawberry, vanilla.
Looks like a little pudding candy. - Ew, it smells like-- - Ooh, it looks very odd. - Oh.
- Ooh. - Is there an expiration date? - Um, let's check.
- This looks spoiled. - Well, let's just do a very small one. I'm a little nervous here. - [both] Oh! - A little chef taste. - Oh, yeah! This is nice. I'll eat all of this. But I feel like
I need an item to go with it. - [Ro] Yeah, I feel like you should be,
like, putting it on a little cookie. Some of these have been hit or miss, but the next candy, I'm feeling
pretty confident about. because again, there's these cute
little happy kids on the front and these are another
coconut based candy. So, I love coconut. Give it a slice! (slices) - Oh, I hit a roll.
- Ah-hah! Uh-oh. (gasps) I just see a lot of coconut
so I'm kinda happy about this. - Mm-mm!
- These kids.. get me. Mmm! - Yeah, I mean if you like coconut and you'll like this. - What fruit do you like?
- Pineapple. - Pineapple?
- Mm-hmm. This is the best thing
I've ever, ever tasted! - [Ro] How did they make these?
- (muffled) Oh my god! - I will eat anything
if it is a coconut. (inaudible singing) - This looks like a coconut
Enchilokas. (laughs) - I don't know. Okay, that
maybe drawing the line. Do you want to try these? - We might as well just do it. - Okay, wait, hold on I want one more bite of this. 'Cause this is, like, sweet,
sweet heaven for me. - Take your sweet, sweet heaven 'cause it's not gonna last long. (laughing) Watermelon Enchilokas!
- This was so spicy. I'm not even gonna get
to the watermelon part. If you cut it in half, you may
be able to taste the gummy. - Here you go. I don't know. Should we not?
- Ooh! - I don't know. It hurt my teeth. - The middle of the last one was mango and this gummy is
supposed to be watermelon which I love watermelon,
but the outside is just so sour and spicy. Maybe I'll taste the gummy first. - This is so-- I can't do it. I can't do it! I hate it! I hate it so-- Like, it makes me so upset! - I can't. I can't even
get to the gummy. I'm doing one more of these. Mm-hmm! Let's try some powder. Look! - ♫ I got maracas, I got you maraca-- - What a fun instrument! ♫ Tiki-tiki-tiki-tik-tik! ♫ Okay, so these are Lucas Mango. And Lucas-- What's the flavor? - Uhh, chamoy? - What's chamoy?
- (muffled) I don't know. - "Snap off tip." - What? (snap)
Okay. This is like a pixie stick. (snaps, screeches)
- Right?!! Candy is supposed
to be enjoyable and fun I just got injured. - You just eat it like a pixie stick. - Ugh, oh! Why?! What is this?!
This is inevitable torture! - Justine, you want
to taste mine? (laughing) - No!! (choking) - But it's mango! (laughs hysterically) - Mine's chamoy!
What is chamoy?! (muffled) I don't know. Gosh, I put so much
of it in my mouth! - Me too. It's really tart. (giggles) - I'm crying.
- Oh, girl. (laughing) - This is honestly, this is the devil. - Now I'm interested what yours is 'cause
mine was a really strong mango. - Take a taste. - This is what we should have done.
- Yeah!! - (giggles) Whoo-hoo-hoo!! Really spicy.
- I dumped it on my tongue like, no regard. - Look at this, Justine,
so while in Mexico, stay away from this little duck. What else we got?
- We have a crayon. - I need some water. Let's have a water break. I'm twisting the bottom, 'cause it looks like it's like a push-pop. - The only way is to
just cut it open. - Maybe just give it a cut.
- Okay. What the heck is this?! - It's pretty weird.
- This is disgusting. - What is this?
- Look, it's looks like a flower not a crayon. Okay, I'm just gonna do
a teeny little-- teeny. - This is so gross. - You know, when I was little
I used to like weird stuff like this and I don't
even like it anymore. Ow, yeah! I have one more candy for us to try and maybe it's gonna be great. - Where? Okay. - These little guys!
- Okay, good. I was hoping it will be
some sort of surprise thing that you had
'cause I was like, I'm gone! (laughs) - I can't!
- I'm done! - [Ro] Okay, so these
are really cute. They have little frogs on them. - Is it wearing something? - [Ro] Is it sausages
coming out of his head?! Uh-oh! - [Justine] It's another weird thing! What?! - Oh, my gosh. Yes, it's his hair. Look, looks like little weird things.
- Oh, my gosh! You're right! - You eat his hair. I wanna see this! Look at it when you press down, his hair comes out! (laughs)
- [Justine] Look at it! This is like ground beef.
- Oh, my gosh! Justine, that's so creepy! Okay, let's do the little
chef finger taste. (coughs) Mmm! - This is weird. (laughs) Like, it's starting to form. It's like it's taking over
this entire container now. It's not one piece of hair anymore it's, like, becoming a blob. Alright, that does it for all the Mexican
candy that we have to try today. A big thank you to my friend Justine
for helping me try out all of these. - Oh my god. I don't know. - What are the ones
that you like today? - This one. The peanut butter. Like, this was delicious. So good. And I love
the coconut candies. Obviously, we didn't try
all of the candy in Mexico so if you guys have any suggestions
of any more mild candies, let me know in the comments below because I would love to try them. We just tried a few intense ones. - It was super intense. (inaudible) But I definitely prefer
this little peanut treat. - Also we did a video over on her
channel like I mentioned before. I'll put a link down below, go check it out. We're unboxing kind of coffee gadgets. - So..
- Speaking of things that are hot. - Mmm-hmm!!
- Mmm! - You guys have to go check it now! Okay, you guys so we gotta go if you wanna check out some more
fun videos, you can click up here. - Or up here.
- Yeah. Alright, bye, you guys! {Subtitles made by:

Hey, guys!  It's Ro. I just got this box in the mail, and I'm so excited because I know exactly what it is. Inside this box are all of the items from my baking line in their final packaging, And I just want to take a few minutes and film a video and share this moment with you guys. Please bear with me-- this is my first unboxing. Also, all of the items that I'm showing you today are not out yet, But they are available for pre-order on Amazon and Walmart; I'll put a link down below. Ooooh!   *Ro giggles* This feels like Christmas!  And look at Cookie. *Pretends to tickle Cookie, Ro giggles again* She amuses me! Oh, yes! Ahhhh!!! Look at all the goodies!  I don't know where to start-- I'm just grabbing something. *Gasp* First up, are some baking basics.  We have measuring cups and measuring spoons. I love these because they are both stainless steel, And I color-coded the handles with silicone grippies, because you can memorize the handle color-- --Like the yellow is the tablespoon, so you don't have to look and go, "Oh, which one's the right measurement?" Hee hee   *Ro giggles* Okay, let's see what else we got in here.  *Gasp*  Yes!  Nerdy Nummies spatula set. The large spatula has the Smart Cookie, and then the small spatula are little 16-bit hearts. They also have a hidden message underneath.  *Gasp* Nom nom nom nom nom. Oh, and this one says, "Ta-daaa!" You see? We've got cake testers!  This one comes in a 2-pack-- --There's the Smart Cookie and the 16-bit heart. I prefer using cake testers versus toothpicks, because they're longer, So it keeps me further away from the heat in the oven. Next are the color-coordinated tip sets. I use a variety of size decorating tips on the show, and I thought, to make it even easier for beginner bakers Is to color-code them, so I can say, "Grab a number 2 tip or the blue tip." Also on the packaging, it shows which design each tip makes with frosting, Because I thought that would be really helpful. I included a coupler into each tip set, because when I first started baking, It wasn't always easy to find them. Yes, yes, yes, yes-- oh! This is another baking basic: these are decorating bags, But I've designed them for beginner bakers. Whenever I was baking, I would fill my piping bag way too full, and then when I was piping a cupcake, The frosting would just explode out the end, And I always wish that there was a line or a guide to tell you when to stop filling your bag, So I designed these bags to do exactly that. Ooooh! I see some edible royal icing decorations in here. There's lightning bolts, 16-bit hearts, and the Smart Cookie. Look how cute! Most commonly, you put these on top of cupcakes to decorate them, But you can also place them on the top of cakes, Or, because it's royal icing, you can even stick these on little cookies. Hi, Cookie!  Are you going to help me? Or are you taking a nap? I wanna get these sprinkles out of here. Where's all the sprinkles? Oh, yes! We've got sprinkles-- they have the little Smart Cookie on the cap of all three of these, And these are each geeky-themed sprinkles. The blue and yellow are stars and lightning bolts. This bottle is the Nerdy Nummies sprinkle mix. It's all the images from all the chapters in the Nerdy Nummies cookbook. There's a Smart Cookie, a crown, a video game controller, a planet, and a little chemistry beaker. And here are 8-bit hearts. I have wanted these to exist for years and years and years, and now, they do! I'm not even gonna wait.  I'm just going to have one right now. Look how cute!   *Gasp* Okay, I'm going to save these for later.  Little place over here. Also have these little sugar gems-- they're kind of like rock candy. I thought it'd be really cool if you were going to make like a geode cupcake or cookie. Oh, yes!  We've got the cookie stamp! These are really fun, easy to use.  You roll out cookie dough and stamp them. Boop boop boop boop boop boop! And then when they bake, it's kind of like filling in a coloring book-- --It gives you a guided line to trace with royal icing and decorate. This should also just be my letterhead, how I approve things. Approved! Approved. Approved, approved-- boop!  You're approved, Cookie. Onto the molds! We've got some pretzel molds and lollipop molds. These ones look like little wizard or fairy wands. And these ones are 8-bit and 16-bit heart lollipop molds. Molds, molds, molds!  And we have more molds; I saw 'em in here. Yes! We have the Nerdy Nummies gummy mold. This one has the Smart Cookie, an 8-bit heart, and a little dinosaur, Because dinosaurs have been a part of our show since the very beginning. We've got a dark pink one, with 8 and 16-bit heart molds. I also have some footage of the process to make this mold. It was super fascinating, and I wanted to share that with you guys. And we've got a blue gem mold. I love these gem designs. I have so many different gem molds, but they didn't have these ones. These are the shapes I really wanted. Last, but not least: the poo silicone mold. I may be the most excited about this mold. They're poo cavities! I'm going to be making a ton of treats in here.  You can make little brownies, cakes, poo candles! *Enamored giggling* I love you. I got so many requests to make the apron that was on the cover of the Nerdy Nummies cookbook, And that apron was actually made by my mom. And I love you, Mom, but we made them a little better, because we put pockets on them. And we made matching oven mitts-- it's a set. *More giggling* I love these! I made a bunch of cookie cutters.  All of them are comfort-grip. I absolutely love Comfort Grip Cookie cutters-- they are my favorite, Because when you're cutting all of them out into the dough, it doesn't hurt your fingers. Little lollipop sticks. They're simple lollipop sticks, but they have cute little heart designs on them. Can't forget a whisk!  Every kitchen needs one. It's got a grippy handle, and it's the perfect size. Let's get started!  Let's get it started! Some of you guys have seen these before, but not in its final packaging. They are foil lined baking cups. There are foil lined cupcake liners out there, but they have designs all over the sides-- --They come with sprinkle designs, rainbow designs, tie-dye designs, And they're super cute, But if you just want a solid color, they didn't exist, until now! And these ones have cute little sayings on the bottom, like, "Cheers!" "Treat yourself!" "Ta-da!" Oooh, we got something big here at the bottom! It's a candy melting pot! This is one of my favorite items in the whole world; I use it all the time whenever I am melting candy or chocolate. It is so easy to use-- and look!  It's got Nerdy Nummies on it! Let's open it!  Let's open it! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! It's got safety instructions. You may remember that I used one of these on the fondue challenge. They are so fun.  I love them! Oh, yes! Now, this is a rolling pin that I designed with two silicone guide rings. One is a quarter inch, and one is half an inch. The quarter inch is pink, and then the half an inch is a teal color. I completely wish that I had these when I started baking, Because when I first started, I was rolling my cookie dough too thick or too thin, And the cooking weren't turning out correctly. This is a great way for your cookies to come out perfect every time. We've only got three items left in this box, and the next one is my three-bowl-set. I am so excited about this. I have wanted to design my dream bowl set for quite some time. The three bowls are stack-a-bowl! *Wink* How ador-a-bowl! *Another wink* Haha!  I'm just on a roll. *Please stop* I designed a pour-spigot on each of the bowls, So when you're pouring cake batter, it doesn't run down the sides and get all over. It also has a little handle in the back, And on the inside of the bowl: measuring lines! On one side of the bowl, there's the U.S. measurement, And on the other side of the bowl, the metric system measurements. Last, but not least, an airtight lid. *Gasp* Look at this cute little ball pan! I really wanted to make a sphere ball pan, because I've made so many recipes using this shape. We've made an Earth cake, a death star cake, and there are so many more adorable possibilities. The pan is two parts top and bottom and comes with two silicone stabilizers for baking. Think of all the planets we can make! Even Pluto... He isn't a planet, But he thought he was, but he's not. We've got something in here. It is a wooden tablet cookbook stand. You can place a whole iPad on here or a cookbook. It's so cute! And look, I can turn it off. Boop Oh, those are the games I'm playing. One last thing in the box. Three different colors and flavored candy melts. These are the "One in a Melon" watermelon candy melts. Next is "La La Lemon" candy melts. I've been making a lot of lemon-themed treats and recipes, And I wanted a candy melt to go along with them. Last, but not least, "Oh My Berry" strawberry candy melts. Ha! Alright, that does it for all the items in my baking line. Again, the items are not out yet, But you can pre-order all of them on Amazon and Walmart right now. I'm going to put a link down below. Go check it out if you're interested in anything. All of the items will officially be out Friday, August 18 online. It will be on Amazon and wilton.com and in stores Michaels and Joanne's.

I'm gonna put all of her links down below, So go check her out, she's got a lot going on [Teala] I'm producing some stuff now, and I'm just daily vlogging and keeping up with all that stuff, so. [Ro] And she's in a bunch of different, really cool things, So I'll put some links down below to those as well. If you can't tell who am I dressed as... Pop quiz, I'm from the movie Zootopia! Nick, the fox character, because we got So many requests from you guys to make Something from Zootopia So we are gonna be making pawpsicles. [Teala] Oh yes! [Ro] So cherry popsicles from the movie. And if you guys aren't familliar, Nick, the character buys these jumbo popsicles From the elephants And then he melts them down And he sells them to the little gerbils. He's quite a business man. [Teala] He really is. [Ro] So that's what we're going to be making today Let's get started! The things you will need will be: 4 cups of frozen organic cherries, 1 cup of water, 3/4 cup of sugar, [Teala] 1 lemon, a citrus reamer A zester, paw shaped popsicle molds, And popsicle sticks. [Ro + Teala] Now let's put it all together! [Ro] The first thing we're gonna do is We're gonna put all of these ingredients into the blender. I'm gonna take this top off. So then you want to put in the cherries. I'll be your guard rail. It's okay, we got it. We got it. Then we're gonna pour in our water. [Teala] Oh yes, look at that go! [Ro] Then our sugar. [Teala] What are we doing with the lemon? [Ro] So the first thing were gonna do is zest the lemon. You want to zest first. You just put it down like this, And you go like that. Have you ever tried this? [Teala] No. [Ro] I'm gonna have you try it. So put some pressure on it And you gotta use your muscles, push down. Just like that! You guys, first zest. [Teala] First zest ever! [Ro] First zesting. [Teala] It smells so good. [Ro] *growling/some weird noise :D* Into our blender. [Teala] And now, it's time to cut the lemon in half. [Ro + Teala] Oh, look how beautiful! [Ro] Okay, we got lucky there's not a lot of seeds. If there are a lot of seeds, you want to take those out before you use this. Give it a squeeze And then you take one of these, And go like this. [Teala] Oh yes! You're strong. [Ro] I'm trying to be. These are called baking arms. I see those...drizzled with a little bit of lemon juice. With all of our ingredients in there, And now you are gonna puree until you can't puree anymore! [Teala] Yes! Oh, look at that color! [Ro] There it goes. [Ro +Teala] Mix it up [Ro] Woah Woah Woah, sorry! Thought the off was on this side. Teala's got a little Pyrex measuring cup over here with a strainer on top. We're gonna strain it all through so that It catches all the big chunks. Then I'm just taking a spatula, and then I'm gonna mix it around. Helping it move through the seeds. Now we are going to make our popsicles. This is my favorite part, you guys! I found these little guys online so if you are interested in using this one, I'll put a link down below. [Teala] So in the movie, they use their paws in the snow but since we're in LA, we don't have snow. [Ro] We don't have paws. [Teala] We really don't. [Ro] We're gonna put in our little popsicle sticks So just stick them in. Time to pour. Okay, here we go. Can you hold the tray? Just so I don't bump it. [Teala] Woah [Ro] We're gonna fill it right up to the top. [Teala] How cool is this! Yay! These look so yummy! [Ro] I know, I'm so excited to eat these. Also, this recipe makes 6 popsicles using this mold, but if you're using a different mold, it may vary. Now, we are going to pop these into the freezer. That is the last and final step And you're gonna want to freeze it anywhere from 4 to 24 hours It depends completely on your freezer. I have a really cold freezer. [Teala] Really? It's like a supercharged freezer. [Teala] Oh, that's the best! [Ro] So 4 hours, and we can eat these. Our popsicles are frozen. I put these ones in the night before So you guys can see how to pop these out. Pop out the popsicles first, And then I'm gonna just have to pick it out of there. [Teala] Okay, this looks amazing!! [Ro] You guys, we did it! [Teala] We did it! This looks so good. [Harmonized] Taaa daaa! [Ro] Here are the Zootopia 'Paw'psicles that we made today, and they are cherry flavor. They are so simple and yummy. We gotta taste them, are you ready? [Teala] Okay, I'm ready. [Ro] Okay. They're so good! [Teala] This is delicious! [Ro] Mmmm! I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe.

Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! I got so many more requests from you guys to make something Unicorn themed so that's exactly what we're gonna be doing today! The recipe will be an easy sugar cookie recipe But it will be multicolored and totally look like a unicorn poop if you're interested in this cookie cutter I'll put a link down below now. Let's get started! Today we're making a citrus sugar cookie; the things you'll need will be flour, sugar eggs, honey salt, butter, baking powder, vanilla extract, orange extract, lemon extract and for a decoration a little rainbow disco dust. And whatever rainbow food colorings you want to use Now let's put it all together first up to making our cookies is measuring out our dry ingredients and pouring them into a medium-sized bowl starting with our flour measure 2 and 3/4 cup 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of baking powder Whisk together and set off to the side next in a large bowl cream together your butter sugar and honey add your butter 2/3 cup half a cup of sugar and a quarter cup of honey. Oh Oh Oh, no. Oh, no oh You want to pour slowly so that you don't spill. Now using a hand mixer cream together until light and fluffy After you've creamed together your butter sugar and honey and 1 egg and mix together We've got our butter mixture and dry ingredients now pour all of the dry ingredients Into the butter oh, I'm just gonna blame it on my muscles because like I've been working out lately And I just I overshot it and mix together until well incorporated What's your cookie dough is ready divide evenly into bowls based on how many colors you're gonna Dye your cookie before I add color. I'm gonna add a little flavor I thought this would be really neat when you bite into the cookie each color will have a different flavor I'm flavouring two colors orange two colors lemon and two colors Then dye your dough's whatever colors You'd like I'm using my hands in this case because I don't want to overwork the dough Just keep kneading until the colors even Once all the dough's are dyed wrap them up tight in some food safe plastic wrap and then pop them in the refrigerator To chill for 30 minutes once your cookie dough has chilled Cut each color into four parts and roll into a ball Keep doing this until you've done it to all of your dough look at all these little dough balls now Take one of each color roll into a dough rope and place on top of a piece of parchment paper into a rainbow Design you want to make each rope about the same length now take a pinch of flour Sprinkle it on top of your rolling pin and roll out your rainbow gently We don't want the dough to spread too far otherwise you won't get every color in your cookie now pop this in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes and while it's chilling make your Other three rainbows once your dough has chilled time to cut out your cookies press down and one more over here peel away the excess dough and Transfer your cookies over to a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper do this to the rest of your cookies hate your oven to 350 degrees and bake for 8 minutes You can either bake these or just get one of these and let her poop all over the house Our cookies have baked and had plenty of time to cool now It's time to decorate this part is totally optional, but right now. These are just rainbow cookies in the shape of a poop But I think what really makes them a unicorn poop is a little bit of rainbow disco Dust we need a little bit of magic a little glitter also side note This is edible take a small brush dip into the rainbow disco dust and paint it all over your face Because we're going to Coachella hold it over a cookie and go tap tap tap tap tap tap tap *ting* TA-DA!!! Here are the rainbow unicorn poop cookies that we've made today with a citrus sugar cookie recipe I love it because wherever you bite into the cookie will taste a little different, but they all complement each other a big Thank you to you guys for such ding something else unicorn theme these were so much fun to make and super easy mode I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the recipe on Rosanna pansino Comm Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter you can check it out there, and if you guys make these cookies Please take a picture and send it to me.

[electronic theme music] Hey guys, It's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! Today, I have a very special guest. It's my actress friend, Olivia! Olivia: Hi, guys!
Ro: I am so excited you are here. Olivia: I'm so excited to be here.
Ro: I can't tell you- I am a huge fan of this one. Please go show her some love. This is the first time she's on Nerdy Nummies. I'm gonna be putting all of her links down below. Check it out: follow, like, subscribe! Olivia was the perfect guest for today because I got so many requests to make something from Just Add Magic. And if you guys aren't familiar with Just Add Magic, it is an amazing Amazon Original Series I fell in love with. Olivia: Thank you!
Ro: I love this series! Ro: Olivia plays the character, Kelly-
Olivia: Yup. -and, she's got two best gal friends and they find a magical cookbook. And the show has friendship, and magic, and baking, and all the things that I love. Olivia: Me too.
Ro: Mhmm. Olivia: And today we're going to be making the last ditch layer cake. Ro: I am so excited. It's three layers of delicious-ness― ―blueberry, strawberry, and pistachio. Both: Let's get started! Ro: The first cake is going to be the pistachio cake. The things you'll need will be: 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of pistachios without the shells, roasted, 2 tablespoons of pistachio paste, ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 4 drops of mint green color. Olivia: ½ cup of unsalted butter, 3 large eggs, ½ cup of whole milk, ¼ teaspoon of salt, and 2 teaspoons of baking powder. Ro: And now...
Both: Let's put it all together! Ro: The first step to making our pistachio cake is grinding our pistachios. Olivia, will you pour 'em in here? Ro: Nice.
Olivia: Thank you! Ro: See, she's got baking skills.
Olivia: Thanks, I'm a good pourer. Ro: I know you've already made this cake on the show, but you're gonna know all the details. Olivia: Yeah.
Ro: Because you made it with magic. Olivia: I did!
Ro: And we're doing the unmagical way. Olivia: Mhmm.
Ro: But it's still cool. Ro: Now just pulse the button―we want fine crumbs, but not a paste. Once these are ground, add the rest of your dry ingredients and continue to pulse. Now in a large bowl, cream together your butter, sugar, and pistachio paste. Olivia: Ooh, I like that mixer.
Ro: It's watermelon colored. Olivia: I like watermelon color.
Ro: Girl, I fell in love with this. They're coming up with so many cool colors. Olivia: I know! Have you seen the mint one?
Ro: [gasps] No! Olivia: Oh my gosh, they are beautiful.
Ro: Mint?! Olivia: Oh, they're beautiful.
Ro: Do they have these on Just Add Magic? Olivia: Yeah, we have a yellow one.
Ro: [gasps] I have a yellow one! Olivia: No way!
Ro: We need to use it today! Ro: Yes, oh my gosh! Where did I put it? Ro: We have to use it, girl. I got one of these as a backup because I bake a lot, and I have blown a motor before. Oliva: No way. It's perfect!
Ro: That's why I have one on re- on the ready. Olivia: Now we're ready to add our butter, sugar, and pistachio paste. Ro: And just mix together until light and fluffy. Ro: This is what it should look like. Now add the eggs one at a time. Olivia gets first! Add the first egg, please. Olivia: Okay, what an honor!
Ro: [giggles] Ro: You got it, girl! Then mix it up, add the second egg, mix it up, and the third egg, and mix it up. Don't forget to scrape down the sides in between. Olivia: Now, add the vanilla and mix it up one more time. Ro: This part is super easy―just alternate adding your dry ingredients and milk to the butter mixture. Add a third of the "dry", mix it up. Half of the milk, mix it up. Second third of the "dry", mix it up. Second half of the milk, mix it up. And last of the "dry", mix it up. Olivia: Last but not least, add four drops of the mint green food color. Ro: Next, we pour it in the pan and bake. In front of me, I have a greased and lined 10-inch round pan. Pour all of the batter in the pan. Ro: I feel like you need three hands when you do this. Olivia: You need to have a friend with you. Ro: Then, pop it in the oven at 350 degrees and bake for about 40 minutes. Ro: [gasps] Also, we're the color of the cake right now. Olivia: Oh my gosh!
Ro: I just noticed that. Ro: Look at that, I'm the strawberry layer!
Olivia: I'm the blueberry! Ro: We didn't plan that.
Olivia: Nope. Ro: That just happened.
Olivia: Yup. Olivia: It was magic! We told them there wasn't gonna be any magic but- Both: But then there was. Ro: Our pistachio cake is baking, so the next layer is a strawberry cake. The ingredients are: 1½ cups of all-purpose flour, ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons of sugar, ½ teaspoon of salt, 2 tablespoons of oil, ¼ cup of butter at room temperature, Olivia: 1 cup of fresh strawberries, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon of strawberry extract, ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1½ teaspoons of baking powder. Ro: First step is to puree our strawberries―and the first thing we're gonna do is cut off the greens, throw 'em in the blender, and mix 'em up. Now, whisk together your puree, eggs, and extracts into a medium-sized bowl. I'm pouring in the strawberry and vanilla extracts. Ro: You just pour and I'm gonna just keep smelling.
Olivia: Me t- I'm gonna smell it and pour. Ro: Smells like a smoothie, ahh! And then we have two eggs whisked together to well-combine. Olivia: And now it's time to combine the dry ingredients. Ro: Mm-mm, we got a large bowl here. I'm gonna be adding the salt and the powder. And then, Olivia, will you add the flour and sugar? Then whisk together 'till well-combined. I'm using an electric mixer because we're gonna be adding some butter and other ingredients right away. And add our butter and oil, then mix together until the mixture becomes pebbly. This is called a reverse creaming method. Now add in half of your strawberry mixture, mix together until smooth, then we'll add the second half. Then mix it up one more time. Ro: And again, I have a 10-inch round greased pan, and I put a piece of parchment paper at the bottom so that the cake won't stick. And we're just gonna pour in all the batter. And pop this in the oven at 350 degrees for about 35-40 minutes. Ro: The third layer is gonna be our blueberry cake, which matches your shirt! Olivia: [laughs]
Ro: The things you'll need will be: ½ cup of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of sugar, ½ cup of unsalted butter, ¼ cup of shortening, an additional ¼ cup of sugar, and 1 cup of frozen blueberries. Olivia: 2 eggs, ¼ cup of milk, ¼ cup of buttermilk, a little bit of electric purple food coloring, ¼ teaspoon of blueberry extract, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Olivia: The first step is―we have to make a quick blueberry jam. Ro: Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a delicious cake! 
It's really, really simple. In a medium-sized sauce pot, pour in the blueberries and the smaller measurement―the ¼ cup of sugar. Mix it together and take it over to the stove. Set the pot on the stove and turn your heat to medium. Let your blueberries cook for about 30 minutes, making sure to stir occasionally. When the jam is thick and there is very little liquid left, carefully remove from the stove and set off to the side to cool. Olivia: Now while that's off to the side cooling, we'll mix together some of our dry ingredients. Ro: Flour, salt, and baking powder. Then whisk together until well-combined. Ro: I'm just excited you're here.
Olivia: [gasps] I'm excited to be here! Ro: I watch you cook on TV and now I get to watch you cook in person. Olivia: I watch you cook on YouTube [Ro laughs] and now I get to watch you cook in person. This is so exciting! Ro: Now in another large bowl, cream together your butter, sugar, and shortening. Then, whisk together 'till light and fluffy. Olivia: After you creamed it all together, you're going to add the eggs one at a time. Ro: Add an egg, mix it up, and scrape down the sides. Add the second egg, mix it up, and scrape down the sides. Olivia: And then we're going to add the blueberry extract. 
Ro: [whispering] Yum! Olivia: [laughs]
Ro: Oooooooh! Then mix one more time. Ro: Everything is ready to combine. We've got our wet ingredients, our dry ingredients, our butter ingredients. Add a third of your dry ingredients, mix it up, add your buttermilk and milk, then mix it up, add the second third of the "dry", mix it up, then add your fresh blueberry jam, mix it up. And lastly, add the remaining third of the "dry," and mix it up. Olivia: So we just finished the mixing and, as you can tell, it's already pretty purple, but to keep it purple while baking, we're going to add a drop of food coloring. The last step is to, once again, put it into our pan. Ro: Cake is ready to bake now. Pop it into the oven at 350 degrees and bake for about 30-40 minutes. Olivia: All of our cakes are done baking, we've given them enough time to cool, and now we are ready to assemble our cake! Ro: I popped all of the cakes out of their cake pans and leveled the top just to make them flat and smooth. To assemble our cake, we're gonna start with the bottom layer as pistachio. Olivia: Yup!
Ro: This is a good time to pick what you're gonna serve your cake on. It can be a cake stand, a cake plate―whatever you'd like. Olivia: And over here, we have buttercream frostings that we've dyed the color of the cakes. So we have green, pink, and blue.
Ro: And we're gonna start with green. Just pipe a thin layer on top. Using an offset spatula, smooth it out. Now for the strawberry layer, ice on top of the strawberry cake with the pink frosting. Ro: Oh my gosh, I have a funny story! Basically, instead of photobombing Olivia, I basically set-bombed Olivia. I was filming on set for Bizaardvark―a Disney TV show― and then I found out that the sound stage that we were on was right across from the sound stage that Olivia was on when you were filming Season 2. Olivia: Yes, it was the best!
Ro: I got so...excited! I was like [gasps]. Ro: You were doing rehearsals with a bunch of other cast members and I was like, "Oh my god. Hey Olivia!" Olivia: We were so excited to have you there. Everybody... Production stopped―Rosanna has entered the building. It was the best! Olivia, offscreen: We all got a bunch of pictures and right after we were like, "We need to stop filming―we have to go post these pictures with Rosanna!" It was the best! Ro: Okay, now for the third layer. We're gonna flip the cake upside-down so the bottom of the cake is actually gonna be the top. Olivia: Before we finish icing our cake, we're going to pop it in the fridge and let it cool for about 30 minutes. Ro: Decoration is super easy. All you need is icing and a little sprinkles. Start with your green buttercream frosting. I put it in a piping bag and just cut off the end. Pipe two rows of green icing. Now do the same thing with the pink icing right above the green. Now for our third―and final―color, blue icing. Now Olivia, with the same icing, ice the top and we'll smooth it with a spatula. I'm gonna line it up on the side of the cake, slowly spin it around, smooth out our piping all the way around. And again for the top, we're gonna use an offset spatula, making it as smooth as you can. Olivia: This is looking amazing, but we get to add a little bit of texture on the top and sides. Ro: Mhmm, I noticed on the show that it had those little texture lines. So Olivia, will you slowly turn the cake? And, I'm gonna be using this big offset spatula and starting at the bottom, and holding it, and just lightly letting it drag all the way around. We're gonna go around twice. Also, a good tip is to wipe your spatula between colors. And now, we're gonna move up one more layer. Give it a spin! Wipe off the excess, and do it one more time. Olivia: Now we've done all the sides, but we still have to do the same texture on the top. Ro: While you're spinning the turntable, I'm gonna work my way in towards the middle like a spiral. Final decoration step is sprinkling on a few sugar pearls. I have a few silver sugar pearls; they look like the ones from the show. And sprinkle them towards the middle of the cake. Both: Ta-da! Ro: Here is the last ditch layer cake that we made today from the series, Just Add Magic. A big thank you to Olivia! Oh my gosh, thank you for helping me bake today! Olivia: Aww, thanks so much for having me. I had such an amazing time! Olivia: This is a like dream to be in your kitchen.
Ro, simultaneously: This was so much fun. Ro: You know that I am a huge fan of this show, Just Add Magic. I'm gonna put the links down below to Season 1 and 2. You can watch it on Amazon. And Olivia, there's more episodes coming, right? Olivia: Yup, we have some more for you guys and I'm so excited to show you what we have in store for you guys. Ro: In the meantime, I'll just be posting pretty pictures of this cake from the show and the recipe on RosannaPansino.com, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. You can check it out there. And if you guys make this cake, please take a picture and send it to me. Ro: Send it to us!

Leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen! Ro: Alright, thanks again you guys. Bye-bye!
Olivia: Bye! Ro: And now, we give a slice for us!
Olivia: [gasps] I've been waiting all day for this! [Ro squeals] Ro: These look delicious. Which layer are you the most excited to try? Olivia: I'm the most excited to try the pistachio because I love them just as...a plain nut, but...I've never tried them in a cake before. Both: Mmmm.
Oliva: Mhmm. Ro: [muffled] Okay, I'm gonna try the next one now.
Olivia: Me too. Ro: That one's good. Okay then-
Both: Last but not least- Ro: Blueberry. Both: Mmmm. Oliva: I think my favorite's the blueberry.
Ro: I think it is mine, too! Ro: They're all good, but-
Olivia: That was so good. Ro: Mmm, that's my layer!
Olivia: I know, I'm gonna keep going! Olivia: Bye!
Ro: [giggles] 
Hey guys, it's Ro welcome to another Nerdy Nummies I got so many requests to make something Coco themed in celebration of the movie So that's exactly what we're gonna be doing today if you aren't familiar with the movie Coco without giving you too many spoilers the main character of Miguel is Transported into the land of the dead. I'm super excited because I thought it's the perfect time to make a traditional treat That's made for the celebration day of the dead today. We're gonna be making pan de muerto thaw Which is a sweet roll called bread of the Dead or dead bread because it's a little roll and you decorate the top with Dough to look like bones when I was in Texas our tour We swung by a Mexican bakery And I basically ate everything from the bakery and sweetbreads were one of my favorite things all right So let's get started to make this sweet bread the things you'll need will be a quarter cup of warm water quarter cup of warm milk 4 eggs We're gonna be using two whole eggs and two yolks 3 cups of all-purpose flour half a cup of butter melted quarter cup of sugar quarter teaspoon of salt 1 package of active dry yeast and the zest of one orange Then to top our bread will use 3 tablespoons of butter in a quarter cup of sugar now Let's put it all together first up to making the bread is activating our yeast in a large bowl or in Yeast sugar and water whisk together till well combined and set off to the side for 10 minutes and allow the yeast to activate Once the yeast is activated This is what it should look like it's all foamy at the top and in your warm milk and the butter which I've melted in The microwave 2 whole eggs and 2 just the yolks then zest your orange right into the bowl And if you've never zested something before it's very easy This is basically like a very small cheese grater, and you're just gonna grate your fruit Just like you would cheese work your way around the orange as soon as you reach the white part stop Then mix together to well combined. I'm using a wooden spoon now We're gonna end the flour and salt but start with your flour if you add your salt first It's gonna kill the yeast so it's add about a third mix together Then it's safe to add your salt Mix together and the second third we're adding in the flour slowly in part So it evenly absorbs then add in the rest of your flour you mix together oh? That's ok, this is what our dough looks like it's time to knead it with our hands Sprinkle a little bit of flour on your work surface Place the dough on top shape the dough together in a ball then start using the heel of your hand push down and forward and pull back and turn and just Keep repeating this finish kneading the dough, and this is what it should look like you want it to be tacky But not sticky the next step is letting it rest and to let it rest We're gonna be using a large bowl pour in a little oil then using a paper towel spread it around the bottom and the sides Place right in the middle then cover with a clean kitchen towel We're gonna tuck in our dough and let it rest there you go Goodnight, dough wait for it to double in size this usually takes an hour to an hour and a half So it's a bit about an hour. Let's check in on our dough oh It has rested Perfectly sprinkle a little flour on the surface in front of you flip the whole bowl Upside down and let the dough flop out right in the middle sprinkle a little flour on top So it's not so sticky then divide your dough into ten equal pieces. You can use a sharp cutting knife I'm using a bench knife after you've divided your dough cut off the end of the Triangle to a smaller piece for our larger piece to make our ball keep tucking in the side once you've got the shape We're just gonna roll using the inside of our hand and move it around I'm gonna do the same thing with our little piece of dough fold fold fold fold And roll keep doing this to every piece of dough transfer them over to a baking sheet each baking sheet fits five rolls So you'll need two baking sheets. We've shaped all of our rolls now We have to put them to rest again, but this time not as long. I just gonna be taking a nap again Take a clean kitchen towel cover the tray and let them rest for about 30 minutes our sweet rolls have taken their nap now. Let's wake him up The next step is to shape the little dough balls to look like bones and place them on the top of our rolls Take one of the little dough balls flatten out just a little bit mending some baking scissors and make six cuts Don't cut all the way through Gently pull them and shape them a little bit longer So they look like bones brush a little bit of water over the top of the roll this is gonna Act as an adhesive and place on top and again continue to stretch them out. Just a little bit oh
My goodness looks so cute now do this for the rest of your rolls brush the top with a little bit of egg wash this helps make a Beautiful color and creates a shiny finish our bread is ready to bake We're gonna heat the oven to 350 degrees and bake for about 18 minutes after the bread has baked and it's still warm Final step is to brush some melted butter over the top and sprinkle some sugar tada Here are the bread of the Dead that we've made today a delicious sweet roll recipe Traditionally made during the celebration of Day of the Dead a big Thank you to you guys for suggesting something Cocoa themed I thought these would be the perfect treat to celebrate the new movie And I'm excited because I've never made a sweet bread like this before I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the recipe On rosannapansino.com, Instagram Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check it out there And if you guys make these please take a picture and send it to me.

I have to make a confession Justine You okay, I gotta be honest this recipe that we're making today is pasta Puttanesca minus the anchovies (GASP) And I know what you're saying. Ro if you make pasta puttanesca without the anchovies It's not pasta puttanesca, and you are correct, and I'm going to be putting the recipe down below with anchovies But we're going to be leaving out the anchovies because I just don't like them I don't like anything that's looking back at me Like hey! let's get started! The things you'll need for a homemade pasta dough will be two cups of all-Purpose Flour 3 eggs 2 to 4 tablespoons of water half a teaspoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil and for our red sauce 1/3 cup Cherry tomatoes quarter cup sliced black olives 2/3 cup strained tomatoes or tomato Puree 2 tablespoons of Capers Drained 1 tablespoon of olive Oil fresh garlic and we're using 1 clove and a bunch of salt for our pasta water Now let's Put it all together First step is making our pasta dough we're using a food processor But if you don't have a food processor, that's ok you can still use your hands We're just making things a little bit easier for us today start by adding our flour and then we need to make three little holes With our hands justine this is fun.

Here we go (BOOM) nice Let's put this lid on and make some dough ready. Yeah, good for it. Oh God we have a bowl in your area keep pulsing until your dough becomes crumbly then slowly pour the oil Last thing we're adding is water. This is where we just need to eyeball it and see if our dough becomes sticky enough We just don't want to be too dry. Oh, this is good Go, that's how you know Sticks together into one big ball even when you're making pasta with a machine you still gotta use your hands you need to need it. Awe so good Sprinkle some flour so the dough doesn't stick put a little bit of flour on your hands You're gonna push it forward pull back and turn keep kneading with your hands until the dough isn't Sticking to you anymore. You know the dough is ready when you poke it And it's tacky not sticky wrap it up tight now Let them sit out at room temperature for a half hour to rest. Take a moon you take a little man.

Hey guys, it's Ro. Today I wanted to make a craft project. So we will make a do-it-yourself "DIY" bath bomb. I absolutely love bath bombs and I realize that I've never made a bath bomb video before we're going to change that. To do so-- Aha get it, do, doo-doo. I'm using the poo swirled mold from my baking line some of my favorite bath bombs have come in cute little shapes like robots, and they've been different colors, so that is exactly what I wanted to do today. Today we are making Unicorn Poo bath bombs. Let's get started! The things you'll need to make these unicorn poop bath bombs will be: baking soda, cornstarch, citric acid, water in a spray bottle, coconut oil, essential oil, This will be our fragrance, I'm using rose scent. Some food coloring, I'm using electric pink, yellow, purple, and blue. Some biodegradable glitter, a paintbrush, and a silicone mold. First step to making our bath bombs is measuring out our baking soda, citric acid, cornstarch, and coconut oil. Starting with our baking soda. You'll need one cup, and if you're using the Ro Measuring Cups you'll need one of the green. Then we'll need half a cup of citric acid, or the pink measuring cup. For our cornstarch we'll need a quarter cup/blue handle. Then add 3 tablespoons of coconut oil. And lastly, your fragrance. This is whatever essential oil you want to add to your bath bomb. I'm using Rose. Depending on how fragrant you want this to be, add between 10 to 20 drops. The next step is to mix all of our ingredients together you can do this with a spoon or you can use your hands. I put on some gloves, now dig in and mix together until it's thoroughly combined. You'll know it's ready when you can hold it in your hand, squeeze together, and it should hold a shape. After the bath bomb mixture is ready divide it evenly between four bowls, and it's time to dye 'em different colors. I'll start with blue. I'm adding a couple drops of each color. You can either mix it in with a spoon or your hands. Just keep mixing until the color's even. Once all of your colors are ready it's time to pack them into the mold to make our bath bombs. Time is of the essence. Because these mixtures dry out. So that's why I have a little bottle of water to spray on top of them to keep them from drying out. Give it a quick mix and then take a scoop, loose it over here and with the back end pack it in there. Wipe off your measure spoon in between colors. Take a scoop, and put in there and again pack it down. And then it's on to our pink. I also have my mold rested at an angle just on top of a rolling pin to give my bath bomb a diagonal layered look. Now a little yellow, and start repeating some colors. I might add a little bit more purple and blue. Alright our first bath bomb is done now fill up the rest. Once you filled your molds the bath bombs are almost ready, there's one more step. I placed our mold on the baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper so if it spills it won't get your oven messy. Heat your oven to 170 degrees, place your tray inside the oven, and turn the heat off. Leave your tray inside the oven for 45 minutes. This is going to help dry out your bath bomb but not cook them. After your bath bombs have completely dried out, take them out of the oven and gently pop them out of the molds. I put a few in front of me on a little plate and they are ready to use right now. You could pop these in the bath. They'll smell good, they'll fizz. But to make them a true unicorn poo bath bomb, we need a little glitter. Take a small paintbrush, dip it in the glitter, and lightly brush all over. This is biodegradable glitter you don't want to use regular glitter. It's not good for the drains. It's not good for the water. So make sure to use biodegradable glitter. And tah-da~! There you have it! Here are our "DIY" do-it-yourself unicorn bath bombs. They're rainbow, they're magical, they smell like roses. They're really fun and sweet and customizable. Remember you can make them any shape, any color, and any fragrance. I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the instructions on: rosannapansino.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. If you guys make these please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your creations. Especially when they're unicorn themed. Please let me know in the comments below. Thanks again you guys. I hope you enjoyed the video. Bye. Bye. ^.^ [Awesome outro music plays] 
Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies, I got so many requests from you guys to make something space-related. So that is exactly what we're gonna be doing today. I dressed up as like a little galaxy picture I'm so fascinated by space I love stories and series and movies about space travel. Firefly, Star Trek, Star Wars Interstellar, The Expanse, (I'm on season 2) Guardians of the Galaxy,  Passengers, anything Neil Degrasse Tyson's ever made. The list goes on there are so many. Not only fictionally, but in real life. I follow NASA and that little Mars rover on Twitter, and I can't get enough of that little Mars rover I just love him! So today, we'll be making... Galaxy Cupcakes! This is in the Space chapter of the Nerdy Nummies cookbook and as you can see they're decorated to look like the colors of the universe. Let's get started! the chocolate cake recipe From the Nerdy Nummies cookbook makes two dozen cupcakes We're cutting that recipe in half to make one dozen cupcakes. The things you'll need will be 2 eggs. 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, 2/3 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 2/3 cup of all-purpose flour, 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 3 tablespoons of water, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, and half a cup of sour cream. Now Let's put it all together! First step to make our chocolate cupcakes: In a large bowl add your flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon Mmmmmmm salt (salty salty) Baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk together until well combined. Pour in your granulated sugar and brown sugar. Whisk together one more time. Now in a medium sized bowl whisk together two eggs, ,yolk and egg white, sour cream, -scoop it in there- oil, This is not an ingredient. Water, and vanilla extract. Whisk together until well combined. Break up those yolks! So we've got our wet ingredients and our dry. Now pour all of the wet into the dry. Mix together until no dry ingredients remain. Chocolate cake batter is ready, I have a cupcake tray lined with a bunch of black paper liners. Fill each cavity about two-thirds full. I'm using an ice cream scoop Cupcakes are ready to bake. Heat your oven to 325° and bake for about 18 to 20 minutes. Cupcakes have baked and had plenty of time to cool. I really like this recipe because the decorations are very simple and beautiful. To pipe these cupcakes, you'll need a large piping bag with a star tip at the end ah~ Which is quite fitting 'cause it's for galaxy cupcakes! The star tip, the galaxy, star, gala- Okay You also need buttercream frosting: royal blue, regal purple, electric purple, Electric pink, and black. Place two of the bright colors at the bottom of the bag, only about halfway in, leave some room to wiggle, Then place the black icing on top, then add the other two colors on top, press them all Towards the tip of the bag. They won't go all the way down And that's okay. That icing's coming out one way or another. To frost the cupcakes, start piping in the middle, work your way out, and then up. Do this to the rest of your cupcakes. This is what the cupcakes look like, they almost blend in with my shirt, looking like the galaxy. Now for the final decoration step: Sprinkle a little light blue sanding sugar, make it drizzle drizzle drizzle drizzle, and silver edible stars on the top of the cupcakes. I love these little stars. Look like something you could wear on your face if you were going to Coachella in space. Ta-Da~ Here are the galaxy cupcakes that we made today using the chocolate cake recipe from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook. This is a really fun idea if you ever have a space themed birthday party or a viewing party for any new fun Sci-fi space movies. You can also invite me. I'm pretty much- I'd come I really love this recipe because they look so beautiful But I would say they are easy-mode to decorate. Another cool thing is you can choose any color you want I just chose some of my favorite. A big thank you to you guys for suggesting something space-related! I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the recipe on RosannaPansino.com, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. You can check it out there, and if you guys make these cupcakes, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy. It makes my day. Especially when they're space themed. That's pretty neat. And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright, thanks again. Bye Bye! Now I get to have one for me. Which is perfect because I've been craving chocolate lately. Couldn't have made these at a better time! Mmm Chocolate Mmmm.

["Game Theory: How Much is Minecraft Diamond Armor Worth?" by The Game Theorists] You know? (Clearly $88,188,750,000) - No, I don't. - Well, apparently, you're not a big enough fan of the content- - Wait, wait!
- ..to have seen it. - You calculated all of this?
- See- I'm done! - I'm done- Yes, I've- - Okay, Mat, I haven't seen EVERY one of the video- 
- And I thought you said you liked my videos. - I haven't s-
- I see how it ends. - I love your videos, but I haven't seen EVERY one of Deh VeeDeeOuhs. - Well, okay then. Full disclosure: I haven't seen every single one of yours either.
- Yeah. I got SO many requests from you guys,
to make something "Nintendo Switch"-themed, so that is exactly what we're gonna be doing today. Today, we're gonna be making "Nintendo Switch Console" Cookies. - Let's get started! The recipe that we're making today is a dark chocolate cookie recipe. The things you'll need will be: Two and three-fours cup (2 &amp; 3/4 cups, approx. 935g)
of all-purpose flour, One and a half cups (1 1/2 cups, approx. 510g) of sugar, Half a cup plus two tablespoons (1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp, approx. 200g) of dark cocoa powder, One cup (1 cup, approx. 340g) of unsalted butter, Half a teaspoon (1/2 tsp, approx. 2.5g)
of almond extract, One teaspoon (1 tsp, approx. 5g) of vanilla extract, Eight of a teaspoon (1/8 tsp, approx. 0.6g) of salt, One teaspoon (1 tsp, approx. 5g) of baking powder, And two (2) eggs. - Then, for the decorations, you'll need: Black candy pearls, Crows licorice candy And royal icing Dyed grey, black, blue, and of course, red. - Now, let's put it all together [*prepare for extreme dancing*] *try not to cringe challenge* - First step to making our cookies is whisking together our dry ingredients: over here at a medium bowl, pour in your flour, Dark Cocoa Powder and then, Mat, you've got to pour in the salt, and the baking powder. - I don't know if you can trust me with that - there we go.
- You got it! You got it! - Boom!
- Ba da boom. - Now whisk together until well combined. Because you're the guest, I'm gonna put you to work. - See how I was already ready to do it. I already had my whisk in hand. Sprinkling it all over... 
- It's okay. It's okay. - So the next step is creaming together our butter and our sugar. Ro's gonna teach me to do that since... Again, noob in the kitchen... - All right, you take the spatula-
- Got it! - and the butter: scoop it into the bowl.
- Scoopin' it in. - And I'm going to pour in the sugar. Now, using an electric hand mixer, we mix together till things are light and fluffy.
- Yeah, they- don't.. don't use it, uh we're done. We're done with that.
- Oh yeah. Just do little circles like this
- Yes. - and just keep mixing together.
- I'm going to try and get that guy up there. - Uh oh, uh oh!
- See, I broke it! This newfangled technology! - Now, do you know how to crack an egg? - Uhh, yes, but I'm sure that there's probably a more efficient way to do it. - This is what I've seen fancy chefs do and I just practiced it a bunch, and most the time it works. - Okay. - So you just crack and then twist and then with the bottom fingers- - This is a recipe for disaster. - I go the- - Oooooooh!
- A recipe for disaster! Hey yo! - That was really funny.
- Right? - That was a good one!
- Quality YouTube humor. *Ro giggling* If you've never heard of my channel, that's the level of humor you can expect, but enough talk, let's get cracking. *laughing at the terrible puns* The yolks on us... please stop. - And twist.
- Wow! - And hopefully we don't get any shells. - (whispers) That was so good. That's the right way to do it.
- That's deleted. - Let me show you the wrong way to do it. Okay, here we go. Crack, (together) twist! Twist, just do it! Just.. -Oooh! I almost did it! There was.. there was a little shell That was corre- That was close. Little baby shell. -Just take it out, or you know.. if you mix them up a lot Someone gets a little crunchy cookie. Can you hold the bowl? -I'm here for you. I'm here for your support. -Thank you... Yeah, we can wash hands. You can come over here.. Um you know we can talk about things that bother me in Sci-fi (Science fiction) Tell me what bothers you and I will answer those questions That is my job. -I just feel like so many people love Yoda. When you love something you naturally want to know more about it I feel like. -More yoda backstory? -Yeah! What sort of species is he? He's a.. frog crossed with a.. imp. I don't know. *laughter ensues* I have no idea Alright, I think this is looking good I'm going to give this a scrape down along the sides. Ro taught me that there are two techniques The do, do, do, do, do, do, do technique, or the scrape. I'm going do, do, do, do, do, do, do. We're gonna double pour. I'm giving you vanilla, and I've got almond. -Legitimately just washed my hands, and I'm already messy again. Here you go. -It's alright. -Here, I got a little towel here -It's alright, I'm okay being messy. Whooooo Pour it in.. whoop... and mix together one more time. It looks like we have all our wet ingredients We have our dry ingredients ready so now it's time (whispers) To put 'em together. Yeah! Pour all of your dry ingredients into the wet *sniffs the air and exhales* Today's a good day. -I love the smell of chocolate in the morning. -Me too -And in the afternoon. And before bed.. CHOCOLATE IN MY FACE! *don't know what Ro is doing.. but that thing* I don't know what you're doing to the chocolate in that.. with that. -With that one? -But that, that's cool. (No one does..) *attempting to do what Ro did* -I don't know what I'm doing, I just know how to make cookies. *laughter haha* Come 'ere chocolate, lemme give you a big kiss on the lip! Keep it down with your pucket! Because we poured in all of the dry ingredients.. You want to mix together on a low speed because there's a lot of flour here. Right. -It might make a big *poof* dust cloud. You know how tempting that is? -It's very tempting You tell me that and it's like.. Oh, I want to just make a big cocoa cloud. -Okay, I'm trusting you because I want to eat these cookies! Okay, fine. Make sure that you mix responsibly. If I'm able to handle it, you can too. It's like delicious mud. The most tasty of mud pies. -I heard some kids eat mud. I never ate mud. I didn't either. -I ate a lot of wierd things as a kid. I've tried various insects. So our dough is ready. So we're going to take it out, put it in the fridge, but first you gotta put it on... Food safe plastic wrap. Indeed we do. -We're gonna wrap it up. Alright, so Mat, we need two pieces. This is the fanciest plastic wrap dispenser I've ever seen. -Yeah, it's like  -It's got, like, a paper cutter on it. -Here, I'll hold this.. Wow! -Yeah, right? -This is so simple! It's the simple things in life that impress me. And I'm going to give you half.. -Thank you. -And you kind of shape it into a disk shape.. It's like a- a chunky frisbee. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap... *Tapping continues..* Tap, tap tap. A little light spanking. -Good job! Then you wrap up the sides... That's it That is very satisfying, and so now I'll put in fridge, hour to overnight. Plenty of time to talk about what species Yoda is. *le gasp* Yes! Let the debate begin.. There's a lot of weird alien species, and he's the ONLY ONE! Right? -Ya! Why would he be the only one? He's the last one.. Chewy's a wookie Right. (both) Yoda is a.. *tries to come up with species* Dagobian? He lives on Dagobah. -That's a good name. -Dagobian? -Just do that. Our dough has chilled, now it's time for some baking flair. And for anyone who's (whose?) not familiar with baking flair... -I'm not I used to see bartenders always doing this really cool bar flair.. -Okay Where they're, like, juggling, or like, throwing drinks behind their back. Yeah! -And I thought there's no baking flair? So I created.. one move! -Okay. So what you do, you just pull up. One.. Two.. THREE! BAKING FLAIR! What! -Yes! Yes, yes, yes yes, yes yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.. *MatPat dabs cringely in the background* Yes, yes, yes.. *MatPat does a jig* Yes, yes! BOOM CAMERA! Usually when you're making sugar and cookies, I like to sprinkle down a little bit of flour on top of the work surface... So that the dough doesn't stick But, because we're making chocolate cookies, and our dough is darker.. We're going to be using a little bit of dark Cocoa Powder Because otherwise you can get little streaks.. (whispers) That's such a good idea Spread it out.. -Caught brown handed. -Boop, boop, boop. No, officer! *sirens in the background* -I didn't.. I didn't do it -We didn't eat all the chocolate cookies!! Now, grab your rolling pin! Roll out your dough a little bigger than a quarter inch, boop, boop, boop, boop. Just keep working.. OH NO! Uh.. oh you're pushing too hard. Did I- did I roll too aggressively? Oh, oh yeah. So if you're do-   -They're not gonna reach three eighths of an inch on their own! Uh oh! Actually, you're too.. with your muscles and this, I think you're actually too strong for this *MatPat laughing because he's not at all strong* *poses* That is the first time anyone has ever said that phrase to me. -It's a little bit.. So, do a 'lil gentle. -Gentle.. -Gentle, gentle. -Gentle rolls.. I like to put a lot of pressure on my dough. Alright, so now that our dough is all rolled out.. We gotta cut out our Switch shapes using our rounded rectangle cookie cutters. -That was a tongue twister.. It was, it was multiple.. tongue twisters I was really proud of you. -Thank you. I try to deliver quality.. *forgets English for a bit* Sentences. Sentenc- see? That's the quality that I deliver! So here, you just press it down into the dough Just keep cutting out as many as you can. Don't worry if you have.. excess dough. You can re-roll it out and cut more cookies. Or you can just freeze the extra dough, and then whenever you want take a spoonful of frozen cookie dough. It is amazing, it's better than ice cream. I won't get sick or anything, right? No! Okay, I don't know.. Oh, that's really good and chocolatey. That's really good. Actually I'm, I approve of this dough. -So much chocolate. We can just stop here and be like *noises I can't describe, but are like eating noises to him I guess..* Oh yeah, 'kay bye! 'scuse me, I'm just eatin' my dough. Thanks for watching, I'm going to put a description down below how to finish... these cookies. TOTALLY THE END, CLICK OFF NOW, IT'S IN THE DESCRIPTION SO CHECK IT OUT!! vvvv Now gently pick up your cookies and transfer them over onto a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper. So our cookies are all cut out, they are on our sheet They are almost.. -Almost. -Ready to bake. First, we have to put them in the freezer. After they've chilled for ten minutes, pop them in the oven at 350 degrees and bake for twelve minutes. ANOTHER TWENTY TWO MINUTES OF WAITING BEFORE I EAT MY COOKIE! *bad old man impression* Back in my day, *Rosanna also doing a bad old person impression* We never knew what species Yoda was.. *voice back to normal (thankfully)* I like that we have specifically dove into what species Yoda is *through laughter* I'm sorry MAKE IT HAPPEN, GEORGE LUCAS!! So we've taken our cookies out of the oven, they've had plenty of time to cool so now it's time for what I'm most excited about.. (whispers) decorating.. To decorate we're going to be starting with three Royal icing colors, black, blue and red, starting with black. Start piping on the outline. Pipe a line about 3 inches long, leaving about an inch on each end. Gotta leave room for your joycon. Yeah, and then we pipe straight down. This is a 'lil bit of freehand. (whispering) Your lines are so straight and impressive! (Mine? Jk, these are my best shot here, Rosanna's lines are really awesome!) I shake too much.. Lemme see. Yeah, it's a.. Huh.. *laughing* That is the sign of disapproval, ladies and gentlemen. Now pipe an inner rectangle, again, using the black royal icing. This will be the outline of the screen. Pro tip, don't do what I'm doing, do what she's doing. Yours look WAY better than the first cookies I ever decorated.. What was the first decoration that you ever did for a cookie? It was a Hello Kitty cookie, and it looked like hello Kitty got in a car accident. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?! *laughing* My screen, no, my screen is like slanted in I'm like the defect that Nintendo threw out. We're moving on to the joycons, blue, and then red. Pipe the outline of your joycon, small rectangles. I'm piping blue on the left, red on the right. SWITCHING! *aw snizzity snap* Oooohhhh! *duck noises: whaa wha wha wha* What was that? Sounds like a.. duck. Like a, a duck that's falling down a hill. Whenever my dad tells a dad joke, or, like, a corny joke, it my wha wha wha (I don't know how you'd even begin to put that noise in words so wha is my best effort) *duck laugh continues* Okay, so we finished our outlines that we want to sit for a couple minutes Then selected the best looking ones. Surprise, surprise, (whispers) all six of them are from Ro. Now it's time to fill them in. We're gonna be filling in using colors black, and gray royal icing.. to fill in the center screen. Let me switch *snizzity snaps again* my color Oooohhh! *duck laugh, more like Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh this time* It's, it's okay.. you don't need to- *laughs* Now you're an owl. (Pretty much) -I just love it! So the cookies are finally starting to look like Switches, but, we gotta work on the joycons. Over here we have Crows.. so take a couple of these. -Okay These are gonna be the thumbsticks. The Crows are a little bit too tall so we're going to cut them in half. I'm gonna eat the other half that we don't need *Ro doing a 'lil dance while humming* Oooh, ooh, I like you jamming out. Left, right and back step. Left, right and a back step. Left, right and a back step. Back to decorating cookies.. For this next part, we need to work at a good pace Not too quickly, you don't need to rush but immediately after you finish filling in one of the sides, you need to add your candies. And make sure that your Switch is facing the right way, too. You don't want your Red joycon on the right side of the.. -On the wrong.. -On the left side of the cookie? -On the.. on the  op.. The up and down? -And then the down. -The down.. Please. -Please. That's not where the buttons are. Mhm.. Do you even joycon, bro? (Nope, but you clearly don't either.) (whispers) We should make the.. we should make the cookies (whispers back) Yeah.. Before you're finished, you have to add those little details. The plus, the minus, the home button, using black royal icing, and a number one tip. WE ARE NUMBER ONE, HEY! I just want to keep dancing when I'm hanging out with you. *singing* TA-DA! Here are the Nintendo Switch console cookies that we made today using a chocolate sugar cookie recipe. Yum, yum, yum. A big thank you to you guys for suggesting this and a big thank you to MatPat for helping me bake today! Aw shucks, thanks for putting up with me for the past couple hours! (And thank you for dealing with my bad subtitles) I had so much fun! -This was a blast! -This was amazing. We need to, like, do something else again. Yes, PLEASE! I would love that. I'm gonna (don't you know it's GOING TO?) be putting all his links down below. Go like, subscribe, show him some love. &lt;3 He's amazing. Aw, thank you. You're amazing. AW! These COOKIES, also amazing. Yeah, they are. *takes bite of cookie* Should we take a bite? Oh, YOU ALREADY DID! I like that you're asking me. *Ro takes a bite* It's really good Mmm.. -Right? It's really good. There's something that's a little unique about having a chocolate sugar cookie. -A chocolate cookie! It's true! It adds a lot to it! (Just like these subtitles! Jk, but really though) I'll be posting pictures and the recipe on rosannapansino.com, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. You can check it out there, and if you guys make these cookies Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy. It makes my day. -You can also just send the cookies.. And, if you guys have any other ideas for any other.. (both) Nerdy Nummies Let me know. Leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright, thanks again. You guys bye-bye  -Buh Bye!! These were fun to do 
Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another nerdy Nummies! We have a special guest today. It's my friend, Justine.
Justine: Hi! We did a bunch of videos this year and it's summertime. I had to have you on because we are gonna be making something that we've never made before. We're gonna be trying out a new gadget. This is an ice maker. So today, I got a lot of requests for you guys to make something from Monsters, Inc. because we've never made something from
Monsters, Inc. So, we are going to be making the snow cones that the Abominable Snowman offers Mike and Sulley in Monsters, Inc. But don't worry, they're lemon! Let's get started! The things you will need will be: 1/4 cup of water, 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, 2 cups of sugar, 2 tablespoons of corn syrup, Lemon yellow food coloring, and a shave ice maker. Let's put it all together! This recipe is super simple. We're just going to add all of the ingredients to this pot. I'm gonna pour in the lemon juice, you pour in the sugar. J: Okay, should we do it together? Okay, ready? Yup
Ro: Yeah, let's do a double pour! Ready? Go! OOOOOOOH This smells so good. Smell it! That's like sweet lemonade. Like, it's a little too sweet, but it is sweet lemonade. Oh! Then, the water and corn syrup, and you might need to use a spoon because it's a little sticky. Ro: Whisk together until well combined. 
J: This is a huge whisk! Ro: It's heavy duty! J: This is industrial.
Ro: Stainless steel! Place your sauce pot on the burner, turn the heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once boiling, turn off the heat, remove from the stove, and bring it back to your baking station. J: So we took our lemon syrup off the stove and here it is. Now, it's a little bit yellow, but I feel like it's not yellow enough. Ro: Mm-hmm That's why you want to add a few drops of food coloring. It's totally optional. It is a light yellow, but I want it to be a bright yellow like the movie. You mix and I'm gonna add two drops. One! J: Ooh! Two! Ro: There you go, there you go.
J: That's super yellow. We are gonna funnel our syrup into these squeeze bottles to make things a little bit easier. J: Oh, that's a good idea and you can save it for later! Ro: Yeah
J: *gasps* Just be careful. I don't want you to burn yourself. Ro: Oh, wow, it's stuck to there.
J: We had some things happen, Ro: Yeah, she spilled a little bit.
J: that's because she invited me here and so.. Well, we turn the burner on, and then we were just catching up. *flashback*
Justine, this makes me so happy that is our day, you know? J: Yay! Oh goodness gracious!
Ro: It's like... AAAHHHH OH GOD, OH NO! J: This is what happens when you let me in your kitchen! Ro: Okay, can you peel it down there? I'll hold it up here steady.

There's no doodoo so the game that I found is called Reindeer games, just like the song like "join in any reindeer games, do doo". And this is an inflatable antler toss! Is it this big, like is this life-sized, is this actual size? How big? Look how huge this looks on this woman's head. So that is pretty big. We'll see but apparently you just place the antlers on the head and then it's ring toss. Are you good at ring toss? I don't know. I don't know. I mean is that something like you know you're good at. Are You good at horseshoes? Have you ever played horseshoes? Yeah, like a very long time ago. It's a minute.

It's the time of year to laugh and sing lets play a game and toss some rings Inflatable antlers upon your head while real reindeer are busy guiding Santa's sled Somebody sat down and wrote this poem. They were like we need a great poem and apparently this is for people ages 12 plus. Ooh is more adult game apparently. Maybe it's because we're throwing stuff at each other. I don't know maybe because there's a plastic bag. Oh It's all in one. Oh we gotta inflate it. Oh wow. Do you want to inflate the reindeer or the rings, you want to do the rings? I can do the rings!

Hey guys, it's Ro welcome to another nerdy nummies today, we have a very special guest it's Justine. Hi. I'm so excited you're here! I had to invite a resident expert when I heard what you were doing I was like basically Inviting myself over and like checking your calendar. I'm like okay. She's filming today. I'll be there. I'll have all of my things I brought my own I brought my Nintendo switch. Okay so show me all your gadgets because I got a lot of requests from you guys to make something in honor of Super Mario Odyssey so that is exactly what we're gonna be doing today, so what did you bring over here? So I brought this romário Odyssey themed amiibo. We have Bowser in his beautiful little wedding attire very handsome We've got peach in her beautiful wedding dress. Beautiful we've got Mario who's you know always trying to get peach? He's looking very suave He's got his little top hat on. Yeah, but like who's marrying peach is the question no spoilers. So they're gonna watch us bake, and what are we making today? Okay, so today. We're gonna be making Mario's hat because it's super iconic in this new game. Yeah, his name is Cappy and basically you can throw the hat, and you can become almost anything in the game So we cuz Mario's hat is such a big part of the new game. We are gonna be making a cake to look like Mario's hat oh Are you maybe yes, okay? Oh you're a spell. I'm already so my gosh Let's get started the recipe is very fitting for today today. We are reading a red velvet recipe. Alright, so the things you'll need will be 1 cup of sugar 2 eggs 1 cup of flour 1/2 a cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup of milk 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of red gel coloring 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract quarter teaspoon of baking soda quarter teaspoon of salt 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder And a quarter cup of butter at room temperature, and now let's put it all together. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, oh, yeah Oh, yeah First step to making our red velvet cake is mixing together our dry ingredients in a large bowl mix in your flour cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda well ficient We are super efficient. Uh-oh that's not so good Well you got my favorite Bowl. Until well combined mix it up mix it up now We're gonna mix together our milk and sour cream we want our dairies together, so this is it a smaller Bowl alright Justine you scooped in the sour cream, okay? I don't think I told you this but my mom has really been getting into Spanish soap operas Yeah, what does that have to do the sour cream? Probably nothing you know sometimes when we hang out I just get thoughts our next step is we're gonna cream together the butter and the sugar and it only works with a spatula Bhairo so you cannot scoop with any other spatula yes because me works if you have a nerdy nummies spatula Sorry I blew a link down below to where you can find one then using an electric mixer mix together for about two to three Minutes on a medium speed you want your make sure to get light and fluffy y'all just go under here Oh, no me. I should come back. Yeah, I think So after a few minutes of mixing this is what it should look like They are nice and fluffy now looks like snow. It does kind of look like snow That's your good reference next add your eggs one at a time mixing in between each addition Then we're gonna pour in Extract here we go Hello friend, so we've got our wet ingredients from butter mixture. Yeah, and our dry ingredients that's right now We're going to combine them. Oh wow now What do we do well let me tell you girl add a third of the dry mix it up half the wet mix it up Second third of the dry mix it up Second half of the wet mix it up feels on my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard like I get it but like at the same time a Bunch of boys in their yard and the last of the dry and mixed in it So this is looking really chocolaty like I actually forgot. We're making your red velvet cake yeah We've got to make this cake red so it's almost ready We've just gotta add a little bit of red color, so I'm gonna scoop it in Well now it's red velvet. Oh my gosh yeah, this is cool Our red velvet cake batter is complete and now we have to put it into the pan That's right And we've got two pans to make on Mario hat cake in front of Justine this one is an eight inch Round cake and we've sprayed it We've greased it and put a piece of parchment paper at the bottom So it's really easy to pop out and then in front of me This is the second pan that we're gonna be using this one is from my baking line But it's basically like half a ball cake. This is the tricky part We've got a eyeballing okay two-thirds of the batter Go in here one-third of the batter Over there. I think it's like We'd be like There and then we'll bring this pan over teamwork teamwork this you're doing a great job Look at this player one player to me all cakes We got our cake batter in the pans and now they're ready to bake mm-hmm Yeah, your oven to 350 degrees and we're gonna bake this fear pan for 55 minutes in this pan This one's only for 25 Yeah, 25 minutes our cakes have baked and they are all cooled off now So now what do we do now this is it tada? You just stack your cake like so and just even put this on your head And there it doesn't it look like it looks like a little Mario hack. It's perfect after they've baked. We've got to shape it and Assemble it to shape it. I've cut the shape into some cake board I'll be making a template and put a link down below So if you want to download it and use it to trace and cut out the same shape you can so you're gonna place it On top of the cake just cut around the side my goodness Okay, you got this like this goes straight up and down go, dupa, dupa, dupa. This is like racing Oh jeez now a star won't stay up. Okay. I caught it you got it Yeah, okay, then I'm gonna give this to you Okay, place it on top of a turntable now the turntable is totally optional It just makes icing a little easier pipe a little outline, okay And then fill it in and I'll use a spatula to smooth it over then place the second cake on top Justine Will you do the honors place it towards the okay back to the cake all the way to the back? Yeah, all the way the back. I'm about to drop it like it's hot okay drop it drop it drop it well It's starting to finally look like a hat, so now we're gonna add just a thin layer pump coat amazing yeah Yeah, just pipe a thin layer all the way around the cake and remember it doesn't need to look perfect Okay Because we are gonna cover the cake with London pop the cake in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to chill and while it's chilling. We're gonna make some fondant decoration Specifically the M on Mario's hat cuz we need it to be very icon I need to look like this hat over here I made the M logo into a template in Photoshop And I'll put a link down below if you want to download that you want to cut out the M I did this by using an exacto knife, so just be really careful first roll out our white fondant In front of us we have a piece of wax paper that I've taped down, so it won't stick to the surface all right I'm gonna give you a little exacto knife - be careful. Don't get your fingers and just cut around The oval now let's cut out our M And we want to do this using the red - fondant place the template on the top and again using a small exacto knife cut out the M Looking good. All right. I'm gonna peel this up. Be really careful. Do they do they do it Yes, so we've got our two pieces and now we're gonna pick up the end and put it on top of the white is Yes Now we're gonna. Let it sit for about ten minutes to harden while we put some fondant over our cake oh boy We took our cake out of the fridge, and it is a nice and chilled mm-hmm. We got fondant right here Yeah, and it's on top of this really fancy. Have a very large fondant mat to roll it out, so it won't stick That is a pinata stick Rolling it. I mean this is insane. You ready. Yeah, okay, you grab and I'll grab okay. Okay? Oh? Oh, oh, sorry wait which way are we going which way so handle me off. Okay go and then back back Yeah, yeah front and then back Me too this has been a workout. Are you ready for this? Yes, now. Let's put it on top of the cake. This is gonna be a little tricky. I'm using the rolling pin I'm gonna kind of like roll gently roll the fondant onto the rolling pin And then Justine can you bring the cake towards me and I'm gonna lift it ready one two three here We go up up up, and they can't kind of catch it on that side cuz I can't really see over there What a good idea There we go there we go Yeah, just let it fall once you place it over the cake. We're just gonna gently pull like this and press Against the cake and look I'm gonna like might do this like do it double like Oh poop Look at that whoa Is that Mario happy made then Justine you want to gently press in the back just use your hand and just press it against the cake trust first press press press Justine I'm gonna let you do this, but just at the bottom of the cake at the base just cut Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo all the way around for sure, okay, okay? I'm too nervous because I don't want to make you nervous time, and then you can peel it off So you do the first peel, and we'll see what we're working with Wow, it looks so good our final Step is adding on the Mario logo to the Hat mm-hmm then just team just put a little bit of royal icing Right in the middle where we want to add it and it's gonna act as an adhesive Yeah, I'm gonna put it on this one Tim you should put on this science Yeah, and then we place it in the center tada Here is Memorial hat cake that we made today using a delicious a red velvet cake Recipe and this was all in honor of Super Mario Odyssey Justine you are amazing.

just Who I am as a person but I would say ro is such an intelligent businesswoman that's the first thing when I met her I was like she may look very like I'm little and I bake but she's just an absolutely incredibly intelligent businesswoman and probably the only person I would ever feel 100% confident taking advice from I get a bro gave me advice about something I'd like that is 100% what

Hey guys, it's Ro. Today I am hanging out with Miranda! I am so excited! And this is the first time that we've done a video together, and we also did a video over on her channel. We are celebrating because season two of Haters Back Off comes out October 20 on Netflix. Whoo hoo! Partying! I binged your first show. -Yes, as you should.- in one day. Thank you. As you should. One day. Today, I want to do something fun because I love Halloween, it is my favorite holiday, and I know that it's not your favorite. No Halloween is a horrible day for sinners. It's a day where people kill cats! Satan is around and hanging out, People put razors in candies! I'm gonna try to change your mind. They're Halloween makeup kits. AAH! They're terrifying! These were $5. I'm gonna try a witch and a monster and then Miranda. Oh you've got a vampire and a zombie. I'm gonna turn into that? I do not approve of this message However, this guy is really cute, so yeah, I can turn into him. I'm game and I'm gonna become a witch. My goal is to look just like her. I thought that was you. Yeah, that's me. I modeled for this many years ago. Okay, so why did it give me this? What's this for? That's a necklace. It's like a vampire like a *Spooky voice* Dracula pendant! Didn't even come with a cape? Not recommended for children under 8. Oh, so you can't do it. Yeah. I need help with my kit because- Okay. Here's my man. Yeah. As you can see he has black around his eyes. Yeah. And he is brown here and the colors I have received are purple and green. Where do I make this on my face? I'm not sure but they also gave you grey. What's this for? I think you put that all over your face to look pale like a vampire because vampires, They can't go in the Sun. So they have really pale skin. So, cream makeup. Apply with fingers or a sponge. Apply evenly with your fingers or a sponge. I just said that Ro. Oh, sorry. I just said that. I'm sorry. Is this makeup or paint? It's supposed to be face paint. You know like for Halloween the paint's like- UGH! Oh, wow. Do I look like him yet? You almost look like a vampire. Oops! Oh no! Ro, you're a mess. You're supposed to tape -Is that the tape?- this on. Can't even tell the difference. So, what the heck am I supposed to do with this? Ummm... We have to contour your... We got a contour -That looks nice!-
your cheeks. Thank you. Yeah, you need to make your eyes look a little sunken because... Vampires are; they're dead, but they're living. These are actually pretty good! Did you use your hand? No, you used the beauty blender. I used the sponge, I followed the instructions. Okay. Oh yes, that's the ticket. This looks really good. Do I look like him? Well, he's like...he's got a real good smoky eye. He's got the smoky eye on the top and bottom. How come I can't get it? You have a lot of work to do. Yeah, okay, well let me just... I still have my necklace And my teeth to put on still. And my blood. Ooh, yes! Unless you're a vegetarian -This is pretty!- vampire then they don't eat people. Mmm. These are really fun. I have never had long nails before! They look really good on you! Look at this! They look like little cockroaches! *Ro giggles* I've never done anything like this because I don't believe in Halloween. This is gonna change your mind. I know it. No I hate it. I don't look anything like him. The whole point of this was so I could look like my new bae! What's your name? Where do you live? You could have a Halloween night in. You could have trick-or--treaters come over to your house and give them candy. No, I'm not giving them candy. You could dress up and you could scare 'em. You could open the door... Ro! It's not gonna happen. There's so many fun activities you could do, like there's: pumpkin carving -No, I'm not doing it!-, what about bobbing for apples? I hate fruit. Oh. Well...well what about Candy? I like candy. Free candy. I like free candy. Okay. What about... costumes? Only if it's of me. Do I look like him now? You look like a vampire. How do people do this? Do you want this on your lips? Yeah, lets. Here, I'll do it for you. Oh wow! So pigmented! Look at this! It doesn't do anything. Wow. It just fell off into your lap. What? Yeah, try the pencil.  Do you put your lips together or apart? There you go! Apart? There you go. Now rubbie rubbie dubbie. There you go! Now you did it. Do I look like a witch? Boom, I think we *nailed* it! *Ro laughs* Did you get it? That was a nail joke. Cuz the nails? I don't get it. I don't look anything like my bae. Aw. Maybe I'll look like the next one. Yeah, we have round 2. I'm gonna pop these off. There we go. Zombie? What's a zombie? I approve of every race, every color, every ethnicity, so. I thought it was illegal to make your face look like another race though. Zombies are the Living Dead. So, everyone can become a zombie. Living dead?! You can't be alive and dead. it's kind of like if a... Virus caused everyone's bodies -Like a computer virus?- Yeah. And then you wanna eat other people like cannibals. Oh, you're talking a lot. Yeah. And this guy is really attractive as well. He looks like he's singing. He's a singer like me. Aahh, it's Halloween it's the best holidayyyy. That's probably what he's singing. Yeah, don't do that again. I have to look like this guys. I have to paint my entire face green! My guys green too so I gotta do that too. And I've got to stick these little things on my neck so I look like... Frankenstein's creation. I got creepy skin. What is that? We're gonna see. *Ro gasps* Ooooooohh! What is it? What does it feel like? Ew! Ew, Ew, it's like soggy. What do I do with this? I don't know. I think you put it all over your face. This looks like gum. It looks hairy I've always wanted to  put gum on my face. Just stick it on! We're just gonna build on what we've started here. We don't need to wipe it off. No cuz we've got a good -Ooh, I've got a mustache!- It's almost like primer. Alright, I'm just applying this all over my face, To look like a little Frankenstein's monster. This is like a beauty guru. Right now I'm using the green color from the... Zombie makeup and accessories palette. Mm-hmm. So pigmented! I'll swatch it. Ooh! Look at that. Very nice swatch. That's what they call it. Like a watch but with a s. Oh, my skin just fell off. This is not working! I just want to look like this handsome man I look like Shrek! More blood? Cuz for Halloween you wanna look a little creepy. Oh, there's skin in my nose. You might wanna be a little creepy, you might wanna scare someone. Cuz it's ... Trick or treat. So, if someone doesn't give you a treat you gotta trick em or scare em! See, that's not nice. It isn't the most nice... holiday. You still need a scar on your head. Yeah. See I messed up. I should have painted this on first. She's always messing up. Can I borrow some of your pallette. Do whatever you need to do girl. I Think I'm done, and I think I look exactly why can't we put the X's on them then I think I'm good Look really good. Hey, baby Okay, so this stuff is Gum paste you're supposed to stick this on your teeth kind of like what you wear when you have maybe dentures There's something like it.

Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! I got so many requests from you guys to make something emoji themed, in honor of the new Emoji Movie! One of my favorite emojis is the little poo emoji I'm always texting it to my girlfriends. I even designed a poo treat mold in my baking line I'll put a link down below if you're interested in getting it. I absolutely love these silicone molds because they are super versatile you can make so many different kinds of treats you can do Brownies, cakes, cookies, you can even make DIY crafts! So without further ado today We are going to be making some poo emoji themed brownies Let's get started! The brownie recipe that we're using today is the one from the Nerdy Nummies Cookbook the only thing that we're changing Is the bake time and method because we're baking in a deeper silicone mold. The things you'll need will be, Vegetable oil, flour, cocoa powder, sugar, milk, eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract. Now let's put it allll together! *adorable poop sound* That means poop. 1st Step: In a large mixing bowl measure out your dry ingredients One cup and 2 tablespoons of sugar, Half a cup of flour, One third cup of cocoa powder And inhale. ohhh yeahhhh ( Lucky ) Next add a quarter teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Whisk together until everything is evenly combined and get your wet ingredients I really love making brownies because it's a super easy process you mix together all your dry ingredients And then add your wet. Boom Measure half a cup of vegetable oil and pour it in. Now measure a third a cup of milk and pour it in. Add one teaspoon of vanilla extract and lastly one egg. Now whisk together until you can't see any more dry ingredients as soon as the dry ingredients are incorporated stop. You just don't want to over mix our brownie batter is ready now it's time to get our poo together. We are going to prep our little poo mold. I'm using a little bit of baking spray, but you can use whatever you have in your kitchen. boop boop boop boop boop boop Now fill each cavity with your brownie batter leaving half an inch at the top. I love these bowls because they have a little pour spicket  it you can just pour the batter right here. If you drip any batter on the top of the mold usually I say that's fine, just leave it. but in this case just wipe it off with a little paper towel because we'll be placing a piece of foil on top like so. Then crimp the edges all the way around to make a little seal heat your oven to. 325 degrees and bake for 60 minutes 30 minutes with the aluminum foil on and thirty minutes with the aluminum foil off. Once your brownies are done baking allow them plenty of time to cool you want to wait at least 30 minutes after you remove them from the oven before you pop them out of the mold so that they will hold their shape. You could serve them to friends and family right now. They already look like little poos. It's so funny, but we're going to pipe them in their little faces. I have white and black royal icing in piping bags with number two tips if you're using my set those are the blue ones. And remember if you're using my piping bags don't fill them above this pattern line. starting with the white Royal icing pipe two oval eyeballs and a smile. Do that to all of your little poo brownies and give it ten minutes to set. Then using the black royal icing pipe pupils in the center of the eyeball and tada! Here are the poo emoji themed brownies that we made today. I absolutely love them a big Thank you to you guys for suggesting something emoji themed in honor of the new emoji movie I'll be posting the recipe on Rosanna Pansino dot com and a bunch of pictures on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. If you guys make these treats, Please take a picture and send them to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy! It makes my day. If you're interested in the mold that we used today I'll put a link into the description so you can find it and if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies Please let me know leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen. If you liked this video, give it a big thumbs up and subscribe to my YouTube channel. Thanks again, you guys. Bye-bye! And now one for me. I hate to eat him cause he's so cute and he's thinking what da poo's going on!?!?!1?11 and I'm like i'm sorry but mmmmmmmmmm *lol* This is so good Fudgey in the middle and crispy on the outside. If you like fudgey brownies, now you can eat them in lil' poo shapes! *gasps* 
Hey guys, it's Ro. Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies. I got so many requests from you to make something unicorn themed! So that is exactly what we're going to be doing today. I haven't had Macarons in a while and I love those cookies, so I thought "Let's combine these things!" Today we're going to be making Unicorn Macarons! Let's get started! The things you will need will be: 3 eggs, we're only going to be using the egg whites, 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 cup of almond meal, 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and a little bit of white food coloring. Now let's put it all together! First step: Sift together your dry ingredients into a large bowl. This is very important because you want your batter to be nice and smooth. I'm using a little hand sifter. Hold it over the bowl. Pour in our almond meal. And it has a little hand crank! And you just *Starts saying "Wee Wee" a bunch of times* *Giggles* Powdered sugar... "Oh Yeah!" ...And salt. We're making "Sweets Mountain" over here. Look how tall it's getting! I wish this is how mountains were made. Now it's time to make our meringue. In a large bowl, add 3 of our eggs. Remember we're just using the egg whites. We don't want the yolks when making a meringue. Then with an electric hand mixer, I'm going to start mixing together my egg whites until they're frothy. Then I will slowly start adding our sugar. And keep mixing until stiff peaks start to form. Now add 1/3 of your meringue to the dry ingredients. Fold together gently. Then add another 1/3; fold together gently. And then the last 1/3 with a little bit of white food coloring. And fold together gently. I have 2 different piping bags. One has a #2A tip, we're going to use this for the unicorn's face. And then this has a #4 tip, which we're going to use for the unicorn ears and horn. Open up your piping bags, place them inside of a glass. Scoop the majority of your batter into the bag with the 2A tip, And a little bit of the batter into the bag with the #4 tip. Time to pipe our macarons! I made a template and I'll put a link down below if you want to use the template that I'm using. I traced the template onto a piece of parchment paper. Whatever side you traced on, put that side down. Start by piping the batter on top of the outlined circles using the 2A tip. Put the tip in the middle, apply pressure. As soon as it hits the line *makes weird sound*, give it a twist. On to our details! Grab your second piping bag, fitted with a #4 tip, and pipe the 2 ears and a horn. Also remember we're only piping details on half of the cookies on this sheet because macarons have a top and a bottom, and we don't need to pipe it on the bottom. All of our cookies are piped, Now let them sit out for anywhere from a half hour to an hour Until a skin forms over the top. It's like a light shell. This is crucial to making a macaron, you must do this before it bakes. I'm gonna bake the cookies like this with a double cookie sheet because it will help form the feet on the cookies that give those French macarons their distinct look. Heat your oven to 300 degrees and bake for about 15 minutes. In this case because I'm making a white macaron, I will also be placing this tray on the rack above them to protect them from direct heat, which will keep them nice and white. Once your cookies have baked, give them plenty of time to cool and now it's time to decorate! This is my favorite part. Over here I have edible gold metallic paint, some pink luster dust, Some baking brushes, edible food pens. We have black, green, and pink. I'll start by drawing on the eyes using the black food safe pen. Drawing 2 little smiley faces and little unicorn eyelashes. This part's totally optional, but I wanted my unicorns to have a little flower crown. Maybe they just came back from a festival. Maybe they just came back from Coachella, who knows?! Time to paint! Dip one of the brushes into the gold and paint a thin layer on the horn and ears. Ahh! This is so cute! Last but not least, add some edible blush! Use another small brush, and then dab on both sides. *says "dab" a lot* Ahh! So cute! Then do this to the rest of your cookies. Now let's assemble these cookies! I put some vanilla buttercream frosting into a piping bag with a #2A tip at the end for a little bit more control. All you have to do is pipe some right on top *Weeooo* Place the top on. Final step is rolling this little macaron in some rainbow confetti. Then do this to the rest of your macarons and they're ready to serve! Tadaaaaaa! Here are the Unicorn macarons that we made today. They are adorable. A big thank you to you guys for suggesting something unicorn themed! I loved making these and they turned out super cute. I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the recipe on: rosannapansino.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter You can check it out there. And if you guys make these cookies, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations, it just makes me happy; it makes my day. And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright, thanks again you guys.

Macarons are seriously the best! 
[Nerdy Nummies Theme Song] ♪ Hey guys, it's Ro. Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! National Donut Day is coming up soon. It is the first Friday of every June, so every year it's a little bit different. But this year, it is June 2nd. And, I got SO many requests from you guys to make the Big Donut from Zootopia. So I thought, "Mmmm, perfect!" That is exactly what we're gonna be doing today. We're gonna be making a homemade donut like we've done before, but we're gonna be making it the size of a cake. This is a huge donut, and we're gonna make it look just like the one from the movie. Let's get started! The things you'll need will be: 2½ cups of all-purpose flour, ¾ cup of milk, 2 eggs―we're only gonna be using the yolks, 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons of butter, ¼ teaspoon of salt, ¼ teaspoon of almond extract, and 1 packet of active dry yeast. Then for the ganache glaze, you'll need: 1 cup of cream, 2 cups of chocolate, and 1 tablespoon of corn syrup. Then, to decorate: some hot pink royal icing and some rainbow sprinkles. Now, let's put it all together! The first thing that we're gonna do is activate our yeast. I've heated up our milk to 100 degrees. I just did this by popping it into the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. It will depend on your microwave. Pour in our yeast and our sugar, mix together, and then we're just gonna let this sit out for anywhere between 2-10 minutes until it starts to form a bunch of bubbles. Pour the yeast mixture into our large mixing bowl, followed by our two eggs― remember we're just adding the yolk― butter, and almond extract. Then, we're going to whisk it up until it's well-combined. This is what it should look like when it's all mixed up. Now add half our flour in the bowl, mix it in before I add my salt 'cause if you add the salt, it's gonna kill the yeast. Then, I'm gonna slowly add the rest of our flour, mixing it up as we go until it's all incorporated. And now, it is time to knead with your hands. I love this part. It's kinda fun for me. Sprinkle a little flour on top of our work surface so that it won't stick. What I like to do: Heel, up, over, turn. Heel, up, over, turn. I like to think of it like a dance move. Our dough is nice and smooth. It is ready for a nap. So, over here in a medium bowl, grease it with a little bit of baking spray, place the dough inside, and lightly spray the top. Then, with a clean kitchen towel, place over the top of the bowl. Oh, here you go! Here's a bedtime story. Let our dough rest until it doubles in size, This usually takes about one hour. Alright. It's been about an hour. Let's take a look. Oh, yeah! It's time to wake up! Sprinkle a little bit of flour on top of our surface. You don't want to go crazy here―very light. Yeah! Oh, beautiful! Put a little flour in the hand. I rub 'em together, [clap] Give 'em a clap. Gently press down until the dough is about an inch thick and try to keep it in a round shape. We want to look like a big donut. I got a 9-inch cookie cutter and that is the size that I want my donut to be. So I'm placing this down. No twisting, just straight down. Alright. We did pretty good. There's only a little bit of excess. And then, take a much smaller cookie cutter― this one is 3 inches―in the middle, go straight down. No twisting, then pull up. Pull the center piece out. Oh, yeah! That's a jumbo donut hole! I'm going to make this a little donut just for me. Our donut is almost ready to fry, but our dough's gonna take one more nap. And this one's just gonna be a little catnap. It's only gonna be 10 minutes. Head over to the stove and bring a large pot of oil to 350 degrees. Carefully, place in the donut and fry for 1-2 minutes on the first side. When it's golden brown, carefully flip the donut over―I'm using two spatulas― and fry for another minute. Then, remove the donut from the oil and place onto a paper towel to dry. Once dry, place the donut on a baking rack. My baking rack is placed on top of a cooking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper. Take the sheet over to the oven, and we're gonna bake our donut for 5 minutes at 350 degrees. Our donut is off to the side cooling. It's time to make our ganache. It's gonna be the glaze for our donut. Take the chocolate, cream, and corn syrup over to the stove. In a medium-sized sauce pot, bring the cream and corn syrup to a scald. You'll know it's scalding when little bubbles start to form all around the sides of the pot. Turn off the heat and carefully pour the mixture over the chocolate. Shake the bowl gently so that the cream completely covers all of the chocolate. Allow the mixture to set for 3 minutes. Whisk together until it's smooth and shiny. The donut is cooled and ready, and the ganache is warm and ready. Time to combine! I just poured the ganache into a container with a spout to make pouring a little bit easier. Coat as much of the donut as you can, but if you don't get every spot, that's okay. Give it a few taps to smooth it out. This big donut is really starting to look good! We're gonna let it sit for about 20 minutes, and then we're gonna add some decorations. Time for my favorite part! It is time to decorate. Our glaze has set. Now, we're gonna add our sprinkles. You can just take a pinch and sprinkle them all over the top if you'd like, but I am gonna be very precise. I'm going to be some tweezers and placing them on to try to look just like the donut from the movie. Give me a purple sprinkle. I've got all the sprinkles placed where I want them. And now for the final decoration step, I am going to pipe "The Big Donut" using some pink royal icing I put into a plastic baggie with a #1 tip at the end so I have a lot of control. Ta-da! Here is The Big Donut we made today from the movie, Zootopia. A big thank you to you guys for suggesting something Zootopia-themed. This was so much fun to make! I have never made a donut this big before. Just for reference, we made a regular-sized donut so you could see what it looks like in comparison. And look! We named it "The Little Donut" next to The Big Donut! I'll be posting the recipe and pictures on: RosannaPansino.com, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can go check them out there. And if you guys make The Big Donut, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy; it makes my day. And, if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know. Leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen. Thanks again you guys! Buh-bye! Now I can have a bite for me! Mmmmmm... Mmm! [muffled] I love this recipe. ♪ 
Hey guys, it's Ro. I got so many requests to make some DIY apple treats, so that is exactly what we're going to be doing today. The recipes that we're making today are easy mode and they'll use three different kinds of delicious apples. You got your Honeycrisp, you got your Gala, and you got your Fuji. Some of you may not know this, but I am originally from Washington and Washington is known for its apples. We got tons of orchards. I even had an apple tree in my backyard growing up. The first treat that we're going to be making are individual apple crisps, which are very similar to a crumble. They are so good and perfect for summer. The things you'll need to make these apple crisp will be 4 large Gala apples, 1 cup of packed light brown sugar, 1 cup of old-fashioned oats, 1/2 a cup of unsalted cold butter, 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, and an additional 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour (we're going to be using these measurements at different times), 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. First thing to make an apple crisp: using a peeler, peel all of your apples and chop them up. Just be careful, don't get your fingers. Once your apples are peeled, cut them into tiny cubes. Cut on the side of the core, turn the core towards you, and cut around it. Remove the core, then cut the apple pieces into strips, then cubes. Once you have your apples chopped, add the first measurement 1/4 cup of flour to your chopped apples. Now, in a medium bowl, mix together your dry ingredients. Old-fashioned oats, flour, brown sugar, salt,  ♫salty, salty ♫ nutmeg, and cinnamon. Give it a light mix, I'm using a spatula. Once mixed together, add your butter. Now, using an electric hand mixer, mix in your butter, until the mixture is crumbly--usually takes a minute or two. All of our ingredients are ready. Now, it's time to assemble our apple crisp. In front of me, I have little bowls on top of a baking sheet. I always bake these on a baking sheet because if anything oozes out, you won't get your oven messy. The bowls that I'm using are shaped like little apples, so cute. I found these at Crate and Barrel. I'll put a link down below if they're still available. Scoop in your fresh apples. Fill it to the top of the bowl. I'm overfilling the bowl because while they bake, they will sink down a little bit into the dish. Every single one I'm doing is falling out of here! Then, cover the top with our crumble mixture. Ohh! This is so great! Our apple crisps are assembled and ready to bake. Heat your oven to 375 and bake for 30 minutes. Do-doo! Homemade apple crisps Still warm, perfect time for a bite. Mmm, mm-mm-mmm! The next treat we're making are these chocolate caramel apple slice pops. The things you'll need to make these chocolate caramel apple slice pops will be 3 large Honeycrisp apples, use the tallest ones you can find to get the longest strips, 1 cup of white candy melts, 1 1/2 cups of dark coating chocolate, 12 caramels (unwrapped), 2 tablespoons of water, 1 teaspoon of citric acid, and some popsicle sticks. First step to making these apple pops is cutting some large apple slices. Cut the very edge of the apple off. Second cut, you want to stay outside the core right up to it. Then, cut this piece in half. Oooooh! Those are going to be some apples pops! Once you have your apple slices, sprinkle a little citric acid on both sides. Citric acid kind of looks like salt. You can find this at any health food store, vitamin store. This helps prevent browning of the apples and helps pull the liquid out of the apple so that our chocolate will stick. Now, take your slices and place them on top of a baking sheet lined with a paper towel. You can probably get 4 apple pops per apple, and with the excess apples... Once you have all of your apple slices cut, let them sit out for 10 minutes to dry, and while they're drying, we're going to get some of our decorations ready. Time to heat up all of these toppings! Over here, I have a heat-safe glass measuring cup. Pour in your caramel candies. *clink*
Oh! Oh jeez. And add 2 tablespoons of water. Then, take it over to the microwave and heat until it's smooth. Microwave and heat for about a minute. I'm sweating. Oh, that was nice. That's nice. And then stir. You want a smooth creamy texture. *gasp* This smells so good! *sniff* *sigh* I just want to put this in my coffee. And heat up your chocolate and candy melts. Chocolate's in there right now. And I'm waiting for it. ♫Waiting for it, waiting for the chocolate♫ Um... To assemble these apple pops, take a popsicle stick and slide them into the bottom of the apple about 2/3 of the way in. Spoon the chocolate over the apple to coat. Do this to both sides. Once your apple pop is covered, give it a little jiggle, allow the excess chocolate to drip off back into the bowl, and then place onto a piece of wax paper to set. Then, do this to the rest of your apple pops. Apple pops are dipped. I've given them a few minutes to set. Now, final step, drizzle with a little bit of caramel and white chocolate. It's okay to get a little bit messy because the wax paper is underneath. ♫Get in my face, you yummy little pops♫ So good. Are you kidding me? Why do they even do caramel apples? Those are so hard to eat. They should just sell them like this! Do-Doo! And there you have it, chocolate caramel apple slice pops. If you like chocolate-dipped fruit or caramel apples, this is the treat for you. I'm gonna have some now. Mmm, mm-mm-mmm! This is delicious. The last treat that we're making are these homemade apple fries. They're just like French fries, only they're made out of apples. The things you'll need to make these apple fries will be 2 large Fuji apples--again, you'll want the tallest ones so you can get the longest fries. Some vegetable oil for frying, 1 cup of sugar, and 2 tablespoons of ground cinnamon. Making apple fries is super easy. I first saw these when I was at a fair, and I thought *gasp*  "We've gotta make those!" First step, peel your apples. Again, I'm using Fujis. Now, we're going to cut our fries. We're going to be cutting the apples into large pieces. Like a large steak fries. Cut right on the edge of the core on both sides of the apple. Now, cut off the smaller sides. We're not going to let any piece of apple go to waste. For me! Finish cutting up your apples, make as many as you'd like, and then take them over to the stove. Fill a large pan halfway with oil. Turn your temperature to medium high. Let the oil heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm using a candy thermometer. Add your apples and fry for 3 minutes. Then, remove your apple fries from the oil, onto a baking sheet lined with some paper towels. Our apple fries are hot off the stove. I have them on a cookie sheet on top of a paper towel to absorb the extra oil. And here, I've got a large bowl. Add the sugar and cinnamon. Mix your sugar and cinnamon until evenly combined. Yum! This is everything that I love, all together. We've got apples, French fries, and like, you know, churros. You know. It's basically like every dessert together that I love. Now toss in all of your apple fries and mix them around. ♫Heaven must be missing an apple♫ Now, pick up your apple fries, and place 'em on a plate or in a bowl. I've got this cute little- Look at, it looks like you're at the fair. I'm using tongs to allow the excess sugar and cinnamon to drip off. Do-doo! Here's the homemade apple fries. You can serve them in a little boat, or I found these little fry boxes online. *gasp* But you could just stick 'em in here and share! I gotta do that. I gotta put some in there. I can touch all these ones 'cause I'm going to eat 'em. Oh. My. Gosh. Look. At. That. *smuck* Eee! After all that, gotta have one. Mmm, mm-mm-mmm! It's like a baked apple pie. Mm! Ta~Daaa! Here are the 3 DIY apple treats that we made today. Individual homemade apple crisps, chocolate caramel apple slice pops, and apple fries. These cute little containers, it's just too much. All of these recipes are delicious, and they're really easy to make. I'm gonna be taking pictures and posting the recipes on RosannaPansino.com, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check them out there and if you guys make these, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations! It just makes me happy! It makes my day! I hope you guys enjoyed the video and you're having a good summer. Alright, thanks again. Bye-bye!

[spooky intro music] Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdie Nummies! I got so many requests from you guys 
to make something Halloween-themed, so that is exactly what we're gonna be doing today. I've recently been playing a lot of Sims 4,
and I got the Spooky Stuff expansion so that my little character who loves to cook
can host Halloween parties. And one of the treats that you can make 
in the Sims is a zombie cake. And I thought, "That is perfect! We've got to make that!" So today, we are gonna be making: The Zombie Cake from Sims 4.
Let's get started! The cake that we're making today is a very large cake. I wanted it to be a cake that you could
 bring to a party and share with friends. It is going to be a four-layer fuchsia velvet cake,
 just like the one from the game. The things you will need will be: 6 cups of all-purpose flour, 3 cups of sugar, 2 cups of buttermilk, 3 cups of oil, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons of white vinegar, 3 teaspoons of cocoa powder, 2 ½ teaspoons of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of salt, 3 eggs, and 1 teaspoon of fuchsia food color. Now let's put it all together! In a large cauldron -- or mixing bowl -- mix together your flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder. Whisk together until well combined, 
and set this off to the side. Make sure you don't get your witchy sleeves in here. These are pretty long -- look at these! Oh my... Before the next step, I have a witch joke! Why do witches wear name tags? So they know which witch is which! [ Ro giggling, witch cackling simultaneously ] Alright, now in a large bowl 
combine your wet ingredients. Pour in the oil, buttermilk, 3 eggs [ Ro makes surprised noise ] vinegar, and vanilla extract. Oooh~ I feel like a witch, 
like I'm making a little brew right now! If I was a witch, my favorite thing to do
would be to make potions. What else do you DO...? Fly around on a broom? Pfft, forget it...! And fuchsia food color. Mix it up until well combined. Oh yeah~ It'll look a little funny, but that's okay. Both of our mixtures are ready. Now pour the wet mixture into the dry. You'll want to mix slowly and carefully 
because the bowl is gonna be very full. This is a VERY large cake; this is a party cake. [ in witch-like voice]
My cake mixture is starting to bubble!
[ witchy giggle ] Once your batter is ready and well-mixed, 
I have four quarter sheet trays in front of me which are about 12 x 9 inches; 
they're a little bit more shallow Pour the batter evenly between the four of them,
 using a spatula to smooth it out. I'm not the most graceful, but that's okay. 
(Oh, no...) Normally, I use a spell to do this, but I told myself: "Not gonna use the magic on Halloween;
 gonna take a day off". Now our cakes are ready to bake. Heat your oven to 350 degrees,
 and bake for about 25 minutes. These cakes will each double in size. Once your cakes have baked, 
give them plenty of time to cool. Now time to assemble! I've separated the cakes 
with a little cake plate between them, and here I've dyed my buttercream frosting 
to be the same color as the cake. Pipe some icing on the top of your first layer, spread smooth with a spatula, and add the second cake. Keep stacking until you've got all four lined up. Once your cake is assembled -- I've got the top layer on --
pop it in the freezer for about a ½ hour to chill. This will make it a lot easier for the next step,
which is carving. I'm gonna be carving this cake
to look like the zombie head from the game. To help guide me, I'm using a circular cake pan. Don't forget to save these corners; I'm gonna re-position them over on the cake to be the little ears. Now, care a little bite out of the zombie's head.
But this time, only carve about 1 layer down. I made this little template. I'll put a link down below. I feel like I'm doing zombie brain surgery right now! Playing that game Operation, where it's like 
"*BZZT!* AAH!" Now it's time to frost our cake. I've dyed this buttercream frosting fluorescent green
to look like the cake from the video game. Put it into a piping bag and cut off the end. Make an outline all the way around the
edges and then fill it in. Then just smooth it out. 
I finished frosting the cake and set it off to the side. Now, we're gonna make some zombie face decorations. Over here, I have marshmallow fondant
that I've dyed green, yellow, and pink. Again, I made a template. I'll put a link down below. I'm using an X-ACTO knife. I cut it out, like this. [ in zombie-like voice] BRAAAINS...! Roll out the green fondant
and cut out the eyes and mouth. Cut out two yellow circles -- I'm using a
 small cookie cutter -- and three squares. THAT'S what we want: those... beautiful
yellow and green zombie eyes. [ Ro laughs ] Now we need some zombie teeth. Cut one of these in half; these will be the bottom teeth. Then for the top piece, curve the top just a little bit.
Cut the side and bottom. Then we'll do the same thing on the other side. And you don't have to worry about looking perfect because... they're *zombie* teeth! Zombies definitely are not worried about having braces.. Now onto the pink fondant. 
We're gonna make some brains! Roll out the marshmallow fondant into a long tube. And now it's time to decorate! This is my favorite part! Again, I've piped some fuchsia frosting into a little bag. To get our fondant to stick to the cake,
 just pipe a little fuchsia icing to the top, and just start folding it over each other within this little cavity that we made to make it look like brains. Now place the decorative pieces on the top. [ deep spooky laughter ] Final step is to cut zigzags at the bottom of the cake. This will make it look like the zombie head 
has been RIPPED from its body! Ta-da! Here is the zombie cake from The Sims 4 
Spooky Stuff expansion that we made today! This is the perfect treat for a Halloween party
-- lots to share with friends. And it is the first time that I've ever made 
a fuchsia velvet cake before. I'll be taking pictures and
posting them with the recipe on rosannapansino.com, Facebook,
 Twitter, and Instagram so you can check them out there. And if you guys make a zombie cake, 
please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations!
It just makes me happy, it makes my day. And if you have any other suggestions for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know. Leave me a comment down below,
 and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright, thanks again you guys!
And Happy Halloween! Bye-bye!

[Intro Music] Hey guys, it's Ro welcome to another episode of Nerdy Nummies I got so many requests from you guys to make something from the animated show We Bare Bears So that is exactly what we're gonna be doing today We're gonna be making adorable cupcakes to look like the three bears For those of you who aren't familiar the cartoon is about three adorable bears we've got a panda a polar bear and a grizzly They're all friends that live in a cave together in the North West and they have a adventures Let's get started The recipe that we're making today is a honey cupcake recipe I thought that would be perfect because they're little bears *Giggling* The things you'll need will be: 1 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour 3/4 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of butter at room temperature 1/2 a cup of milk 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1/2 a tablespoon of baking powder 2 eggs and 1/2 a cup of honey then for the decorations brown sanding sugar white sanding sugar white and black buttercream black jellybeans black, white, and milk chocolate candy melts Now let's put it all together first step to making our cupcakes,  in a medium bowl whisk together flour, salt, and baking powder whisk together until well combined and then set off to the side Next in a large bowl cream together your butter and sugar. I'm using an electric hand mixer Just keep mixing until it's flat and fluffy Now add in your eggs one at a time Mixing between each egg then add your vanilla extract and mix it up one more time Once that's all mixed up we get to add the ingredient that makes it perfect for bears honey *Humming* And once again give it a good mix Our mixtures are ready Let's combine them To do so alternate adding your dry ingredients and the milk to our wet mixture here in the middle three parts dry, two parts milk Now that our honey batter is ready *Smelling batter* Hold on I just had to take a smell break. It smells so gooooood We need to scoop them into the tray In front of me I've got a cupcake tray lined with a bunch of paper cupcake liners You'll want to fill each cavity 2/3 full This recipe makes about 18 cupcakes Cupcakes are ready to bake pop these in the oven at 350 degrees and bake for about 18 minutes Once your cupcakes have baked and had plenty of time to cool it's time to decorate I scooped some buttercream frosting into a piping bag with a number 809 tip at the end It's just a large circle tip for a little bit more control Pipe a dollop on the middle on top of each of them just gonna apply pressure Mmm flip your cupcake upside down And you dunk them in the sugar for polar bear and panda cupcakes we'll be dunking them in the white sanding sugar And for our grizzly cupcakes we'll be dunking them in the brown sanding sugar Our cupcakes are coming together something that I love about this recipe is the decoration is very simple place one jelly bean a little below center of the cupcake Every bear has a nose now for the candy melts The first row our pandas get four black candy melts For the polar bear he gets two white candy melts for ears Lastly our grizzly bear gets two milk chocolate candy melts final decoration step Take your black buttercream icing I've scooped it into a piping bag and have a number 3 tip at the end for a little bit more control Pipe the eyes and mouths onto the bears This is where you can have a little fun with it You can pipe different types of smiles gives the bears each a different personality Tadaaaaa Here are the We Bare Bear cupcakes that we made today We have Griz, Panda, and Ice Bear I can BEARly stand how cute they are  (XD  ❤) A big thank you to you guys for suggesting something We Bare Bears I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the honey cupcake recipe on rosannapansino.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

Hey guys, it's Ro! Look who I'm hanging out with. Ro: My friend Justine!
Justine: Hey! I love this gal. I'm gonna put her links down below. Go give her some love. Go subscribe. And today, I had to invite her over because, well one, we're twinsing. I was like, "Wear a wine striped shirt and I'll wear a tangerine striped shirt." And we're just going to have a day of it this weekend. J: Twins!
Ro: *giggles* You guys suggested that I try Japanese gadgets last time and we had so much fun doing it that I thought we got to make a round 2 of this. I got online, I ordered a bunch of other things. Food things, tech things. And so the first gadget that I want to try today. This is a tech thing. It looks like a Roomba, but like for an iPad. This little chap is a robotic cleanser so it can scrub your smartphone screen all by itself. J: It takes the chore out of it because you don't just go *doot* clean. Ro: Let's see if it work 'cause I gotta be honest: I love Roombas. *laughs* Here, let's get this really dirty. J: Oh! Ro: I'm gonna lick it! J: Who are you?! That's actually disgusting!
Ro: *giggles* I'm gonna touch it a lot. J: It's like one of those things at the ice rink. Ro: A Zamboni!
J: Yes!! Ro: Turn it on! Let's see, let's see! Oh, my God! I'm in love with him! He's so smart! He knows where to go! This is gonna take a while. J: So I guess I'll get a drink of coffee while this happens.
Ro: Yeah, we'll just wait a little bit. (fast-forward music) I will say that one, it stays on your tech device. It has sensors. It would just take a really long time to clean because the little cleaning strips are really small. I just feel like it would be faster maybe if you went like this. J: Oh don't do- Oh God Ro: No that's not right.
J: You're gonna scratch it. The next gadget that we're going to try is food-related. You know how they have like apple corers? J: Yeah!
Ro: This is a banana corer. I have never seen this in a US store. Ro: I like to eat peanut butter with my banana.
J: Me too! So you can core 'em and then fill 'em with peanut butter. Ro: Okay.
J: Alright. Look at this, it has a little banana at the end. Step one, you don't even need a knife, you guys. It comes with this, it's a banana knife! J: (supremely disappointed) We don't need a knife? Ro: Here, I'll let you do it 'cause you're good with the knives. Ro: Maybe this will be just as good and just cut off the ends. J: Alright... J: Let's- oh, oh, oh! Ooooh!
Ro: Might be-oh! Might be fun, might be fun. J: Look at this!
Ro: That's pretty cute. J: I thoroughly enjoyed that. Ro: Alright, now, put this banana up here. *giggles* J: See, the problem is bananas aren't straight. Ro: You hold it.
J: I'm holding it. Ro: I'm going to core it now. J: Okay, but I think...
Ro: Uh-oh. Oh, it's ruining the banana. Ro: Two, put it down. Ro: Three, I think put this thing.
J: Yeah... Oops! J: Wait, wait!
Ro: The knife again. Ro: With-no
J: No, this. Ro: Banana on banana.
J: Should we get another banana? Ro: Banana on banana. J: I think you gotta just... get that tip up there.
Ro: No, that's messed up. J: There, that's nice. J: Oh, banana on banana.
Ro: Banana on banana. Ro: We've got a hole! We did it! J: Okay, cool! Now, we fill it up with whatever we want. Ro: I don't have any peanut butter... Ro: I've got some chocolate here...
J: Alright! Ro: that we can fill it up with. I love peanut butter, so let's fill some chocolate. J: Maybe... I think you gotta stick it in there further. Ro: Oh, shoot.
J: Huh. J: Can we just use this? Ro: Feel it out, feel it out. Ro: Yep, you got it. Ro: Gentle. Gentle. Just a little.
J: Oh gentle? J: Oh, NO!! Oh, no! Oh, gosh!
Ro: Oh, no! Oh, no! Ro: Oh, Justine! Oh, no, no!
J: I'm so sorry! Ro: *giggles* Yours looks a little crazy, but you got chocolate everywhere. J: It's on my body.
Ro: *giggles* Ro: Cheers.
J: Okay J: It tastes really good.
Ro: That's really good. Ro: You have chocolate everywhere over there. *giggles* J: That chocolate is really good. Ro: Fondue is REALLY good! J: So, our next Japanese gadget is a foam pen. J: I have never seen this ever. Ro: So, you fill it with dish soap and then, apparently you can make these little characters, and it comes with stickers and you put the stickers on top of the foam J: That's really cute! Ro: Here's a picture of someone using it. J: It's like a child hand. 
Ro: Yeah, see, so maybe we can do it. J: I hope so.
Ro: If kids are doing it, we can do it. J: Um, I'm sorry. That child hand must be an adult- J: This is huge! Ro: So, let's fill it up. (fart sound) J: I guess I'm just gonna stick this in there. Ro: Whats happening? It's a nice smelling toy. Ro: Uh-oh. Oh, it's coming out! 
J: Oh my gosh, it's working! J: Ro... and a heart.
Ro: Aww! Ro: I love it!
J: Okay, this is cool. Ro: Okay, let's make the little chicken. J: That seems to be working. Ro: Yeah, it's a little liquidy, but let's see if we can make a big ball. Ro: Get it on there. Beautiful!
J: Yeah! Ro: I'll keep building the head.
J: Okay, I'll stick this on. Ro: Okay, go!
J: It's okay! Ro: *giggles* Oh, no! It's like melting.
J: Here we go. Wait, oh, I forgot his eyes, I forgot his eyes! Ro: Stick 'em on. *giggles*
J: How does he look? J: Oh... Here, I'm gonna make him a real thin chick. Oh, look at him, he looks so good. Ro: I'm not very good at it. Ro: But look! Look at this!
J: It's really cute. Aww! Ro: Do you want to do a paw with me.
J: Oh, yeah, that's cute. Ro: We can get matching paws. Ro: Is it doing it?
J: Yeah, you should probably lift up. Hmm. Ro: (dejected) Oh. Ro: I'm determined. These don't look like paws. *imitating gadget sound* *giggles* J: That's like something that I see in a nightmare. Ro: The next Japanese gadget that I have is a toilet noise blocker. J: Uh, I'm sorry. That looks like a cute little key chain.
Ro: Have you heard of these? Ro: It is a cute little heart, but apparently, if you're ever going to the bathroom, whether it's a number one or a number two, and you're embarrassed and don't want to have other people hear you, apparently, you push a button on here and it's supposed to make it sound like a toilet flushing. J: What!?
Ro: So, it's supposed to like cancel out the noise that you're making. Ro: When it's the time for sound disguise... (fart sound) just switch on. You'll let it fill the room with the sound of flushing water and then whatever happened in the toilet, (both) stayed in the toilet, so to speak. Ro: We'll just have to pretend that I walked into a bathroom.
J: Yes. Okay. Ro: I've sat down and I'm so embarrassed. I don't want someone to hear me pee. Let me push this button on my key chain. (loud rushing water sound) J: Oh, what?! This is more embarrassing than a poo sound! Ro: Is the bathroom flooding?
J: Are you okay in there ma'am? J: They're gonna think this is coming out of your body. Ro: This sounds like you have some major stomach issues. J: Your intestines are not well if that's coming out of you. (sounds of gastrointestinal distress and flooding) Ro: Maybe you have a little toot, but it's gonna embarrass you if you put this on. It will sound like a flash-flood. (sounds of the gadget and a fart) J: Oh, you can still hear it.
Ro: I can still hear you. Ro: Now, it just sounds like a flood and a fart. *sounds of the gadget, mouth farts and giggling* J: I would have to like knock on the stall next to me like, "Excuse me? Do you need me to call someone?" Ro: Yeah! The next gadget that we are going to try, Justine, if you will, is a 3D latte art maker. It's got a little bunny and a little bear, frog, little kitties. (sounds of the toilet gadget) *giggles* J: Already confused about this one though. Ro: Okay J: (whispering) I think this goes here... J: Oh, jeez Ro: Okay, then the power. Ro: What's this little nub about? You know what? The only thing I like to assemble really is Legos 'cause those are fun. J: Ooooh, buddy! Ro: You did it. You did it!
J: What?! J: Don't do too much. Wait, hold on.
Ro: Okay, it's like... J: I think there's a little-oh! Sorry!
Ro: That's okay. That's okay. Ro: I used to be a barista. I'm really good at this. I can pour at anytime, anywhere. Ro: NOOOO! J: It's fine. 
Ro: I'm not very good at pouring. Ro: Yes! J: Ahhh!
Ro: That's it. That's it! That's it. We did it. We did it. We did it. Coffee's comin'. Ro: Hold it over your cup. Ro: Here, I'll get your little cup ready.
J: Okay Ro: And then you pump. This is the part that a lot of people in line had trouble with and I... haven't seen it work quite right. Ro: OOOOH!
J: *gasps* Ro: OOOOH!
J: *hyperventilates* J: I have coffee in my eyes. Ro: This is not your fault.
J: I'm sorry! Ro: There was not good instructions. This is not easy to use. I'm so sorry. I promise I have one more gadget for us to try and it's fun. You don't put it together. Ro: It's fashion.
J: (sadly) I love fashion. Ro: And you and Matty can have it-use it together. J: (sadly) That's good. Ro: So in Japan, they have these hoodies with a front pouch that's really big, kind of like a kangaroo. J: Yeah. Ro: And then you put your pets in them.
J: Oh my Ro: It's supposed to be for cats and small dog. I'm gonna try it with me and Cookie, but Cookie's like a bowling ball. *gasps* Has little pompoms. J: Oh, he's gonna love that.
Ro: Has little pompoms. Look! Ro: If I'm like this, do you think I'm like you? (baby talk) Ro: And you guys, look at the little hoodie. It has little ears! J: Oh, my goodness. There we go! Ro: And you can tighten it and then, he can stay in there snug as a bug. Oh, that's fashion. J: Here, Matty. I'm gonna let to have that treat anyway 'cause you're being a very good boy. There you go! Nice! Ro: Good boy Matty! Watch out runway, here comes Justine and Matty. J: (in an bad British/Australian accent)
Hello. Today, I'm wearing my dog in my pouch. His name's Matty. Ro: Alright, Cookie. We're going to try to go in here. Ro: I don't think she can fit. J: She's like a little bowling ball. Ro: She's so heavy. *giggles* J: Legs are in. J: Yeah, I don't think that's gonna work out. Ro: Oh, you're just a sturdy girl. (baby talk) Alright, that does it for all of the Japanese gadgets, and a little bit of wearable fashion, that I have today. A big thank you to my friend, Justine for trying all of these crazy things with me. J: Thanks for having me. Sorry for ruining our coffee latte art. J: It just did not work out.
Ro: No... Ro: It was not your fault and this was an adventure. I had so much fun. Please check out the video we did over on Justine's channel. I'm gonna put a link down below and I'm gonna put a link to all of her links. All the social media links. If you guys have any other ideas for any other fun videos that you'd like to see us do together, please let me know, leave me a comment down there.

Yeah, that sweet stache His stache is so epic that I even made it into a cookie cutter This is available in the Ro baking line at a bunch of places. I'll put all the links down below to where you can find it Let's get started!!! The recipe that we're using today is the vanilla almond sugar cookie recipe from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook The things that you'll need will be: Flour, Almond meal, Sugar, Eggs, Butter, Vanilla extract, Almond extract, Baking powder, Salt, and Nutmeg Let's put it all together!!! First thing that we're doing is mixing together our dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl starting with our flour We'll need 3 cups Next add in your Almond meal you need 3/4 cup Baking powder we need 1 teaspoon 1/2 a teaspoon of salt And 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg Whisk together until well combined and set off to the side Using another large bowl Cream together one cup of butter And 1 and 1/2 cups and a table spoon of sugar Mix together until light and fluffy Now add your eggs one at a time Mixing between each addition Once your eggs are mixed in add 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract And for our vanilla extract we want 1 1/2 teaspoons And again using the handmixer mix together until well combined All of our ingredients are ready We've got our wet and dry Now pour all of the dry into the wet I can smell the nutmeg Mix together starting on a low speed Until they're incorporated The cookie dough is ready It's now time to chill The cookie dough can chill in the fridge for up to 24 hours You can just pop on this lid and through it in the fridge But because I want these to chill very quickly I'm gonna divide it into two disk shapes Wrap em up tight And chill em for 1 hour Our dough has chilled let's open it up And roll it out Sprinkle a little flour on your worksurface so that the dough won't stick Roll out the dough a 1/4 inch thick And if you're using the rolling pin from the Ro line they come with these little pink guides They help you to roll the dough a perfect 1/4 inch Now take your mustache cookie cutter And cut out as many cookies as you can And transfer them over to a cookie sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper Our cookies are ready to bake Heat your oven to 350 degrees and bake for about 12 - 13 minutes Once your cookies have baked and had plenty of time to cool It's time to decorate this is my favorite part It's very simple because we're just gonna be using black royal icing and we're using a number 5 tip First up to decorate, outline your cookie work your way all the way around Once your cookies are outlined give them 10 minutes to set then fill em in this is called flooding Then take a toothpick and smooth it out Time for our final decoration step I've switched the tip to a number 2 We're gonna pipe some squiggly lines in the middle Tada!!!

Hey guys, it's Ro. it's the holiday season and I'm hanging out with Cookie So you may see a little nugget over here. She probably will fall asleep We just got back from doing a little bit of holiday shopping And I wanted to make a video to share some of the cool things that I found 'cause I thought they would make pretty good Holiday gift ideas.
The first gift that I found were these binge-watching Survival kits I thought these were so neat because one of my favorite things to do over the holidays is to curl up on the couch get Really cozy and binge watch a ton of corny holiday movies I found both his and hers versions of these kits. They're made by Pinch Provisions. I really love this company They have a mini survival kit, which I keep in my purse has a little bit of needle thread band-aid It's like everyday little mini survival kit. The kit says it comes with eighteen marathoning essentials It has a sofa yoga guide, stain remover, facial tissues, a folding spork for you to snack, some cozy socks Breath drop, a snack clip, dental floss. This is what's really cute There's little coasters in here, and they say yes. I'm still watching I don't know if you guys watch a lot of Netflix, but I do and I always have to click yes I'm still watching this show I'm going! The girl version is very similar The only difference is I think the girl one has toe separators, lip balm, and a face mask But if you're a guy you could do that too I mean you could do a little grooming while you binge watch and keep your lips moisturized and do a face mask There's nothing wrong with that. The next gift is a funny and fun gift if you have anyone who loves slime This is kind of holiday themed slime. It's a little slime kit. This one is by Blue Sky Studios The original miracle melting snowman's it say's melts again and again And I thought that this was so cool It comes with white Slime and these little plastic pieces you can build your snowman place in your little plastic pieces And then it melts like slime does this would keep me entertained All day the third gift was a 4 in 1 pen tool so the end comes off and it's a screwdriver it has the Phillips head and Flathead screwdrivers in the middle there's a leveller so if you're like hanging art or hanging a little picture You can make sure it's straight on the side. There's a ruler and at the end. It's a pen I found this at the store And I thought it was the coolest pen that I'd ever seen The other functional gives that I found is actually something that I have been using for years These are screen cleansing towelettes by well-kept. I use a lot of screens during the day I have a phone and iPad a computer TV now I'm thinking about it these would actually make really good stocking stuffers keeping your screens clean sometimes You got to wipe them down the next gift idea is an adorable idea of any of your friends love Legos and celebrate Christmas It is a Lego advent calendar every day in December leading up to Christmas you get to open a little cubby And it builds this little winter Lego wonderland. This guy is skiing over here. This is me when I'm 86. She's making little chocolate chip cookies That's a look in into my future when I first saw this I thought of my friend Justine I thought it is perfect for her, but then I found something better. it's a Lego Star Wars Advent calendar! I am not kidding. It has a little BB 8 and a Santa hat This is the back of the box it's a little sneak peek into the holiday Star Wars world that you're building and then the front of the box shows a few more things that are in there ah Millennium Falcon, I don't know everything that's gonna be in here because you know it's a surprise But I have a feeling that my favorite is bb-8 with a Santa hat it is just too cute. Oh there. He is again The next gift idea is a holiday essential at my house a pine scented candle I personally am very picky about candles. Especially ones that are supposed to smell like pine I grew up in Seattle in the northwest tons of evergreen pine trees So I know a good pine tree smell when I smell it this one is by the soap and paper Factory and is called Rowland pine it is one of the best pine smells that I have smelled. I am in love with it you Can even smell it in the box? Let's take a look? Let's just peek, but just just a little who's gonna know Oh my gosh. It's so pretty. It smells so good I Would definitely agree with this description it says that it is a fresh clean scent of a pine forest on a dewy morning Agreed so there's no surprise that the next gift idea are also candle there at Bath &amp; Body Works I'll start with this one this one smells like coffee so if you have any friends who love coffee this would be a really fun Candle the candle also looks very beautiful It's white and clean, and it has this gold copper font on the front, and it says but first coffee Mmm The coffee fragrance is strong then these three are more festive candles the one I thought was the most Durable as a little tree a whisk in a present, and it says we whisk you of Merry Christmas at dorms I love this one so much because it smells like Christmas morning at my house. It smells like maple syrup and pancakes With a little bit of cinnamon it is so good. I just want to eat this one. Oh, it's really messing with me Okay, then this one is my sister's favorite as a little bear on the front He's wearing flannel, and it's called flannel the lid is beautiful as well. It's like a piece of art. It's copper It has all these little snowflakes and evergreen trees I actually don't know what the scent is but my sister was smelling it. She was like I look it smells like the northwest So let's check the bottom orange peel and notes of soft musk Smells like a pine cabin last candle, I promise I know I went a little crazy with the candles, but this one smells like peppermint. It's called. Let it snow Let it snow let it snow I really like this scent because it's a very light and fresh peppermint smell and the candle is so Cute the next gift is really good for anybody who enjoys a bath I went to lush they have amazing bath bombs and soaps these two are bath bombs we have the Christmas sweater, it's so cute It's red, and it's got white little reindeer, and it looks like a classic Christmas sweater design, and this one is called Golden Wonder It's another bath bomb and it looks like a present with a white ribbon on the top then oh The cutest holiday bath melt it's a little tree - Christmas tree The next one called a plum snow. It's so beautiful. It's purple It has a white snowflake in the middle and this is a bubble bar You'll crumble it into the water when your baths going, but last one is my favorite because it's so cute It is also a bubble bar What a great gift look at it looks like the little snowman Oh, here's melty crumble it into the bath, but I don't know if I can because it's so cute The last smelly good gift idea that I found were these very large soaps They're both soaps that look like holiday pies They also are about the size of a holiday pie so you could cut it up and use this probably for a very long time both of the soaps are from mojo spa Cosmetics. They're handmade body soaps and this one is pumpkin pie Let's take a look It looks and smells like a pumpkin pie you can break it into pieces and use this so for a very long time Just imagine this sitting in your bathroom. I've always wanted to bring pumpkin pie into the shower and now I can This one is a sugar plum pie, ahh? Smells like Berries and plum and I love it like I know this is so but it looks so good like I can eat it Oh, it's tricking me this looks like whipped cream the last two things that I found our food related gifts I found these cute little mug hugger cookie cutters, so these are side of the cup cookie cutters But their holidays Eve. They have all different holiday shapes. I thought this was adorable. It was only ten dollars We have gingerbread men snowmen a little star one of my favorite things to do over the holidays is make homemade cookies and that's why I love this gift because it's an activity you could give it to someone and make cookies together make Memories the very last thing that I picked up it is something that I've been using for years And I'm actually giving this to my friend Jordan so Jordan CaptainSparklez, don't watch this video stop the video don't look at this video Every year, I give him something food-related for his kitchen so slowly But surely his kitchen is good to fill up with useful gadgets And this is one of my all-time favorite kitchen gadgets It is to cut apples you press down right on top it cuts so easy and it takes out the core it cuts your apples Into slices you flip the little plastic underneath press down again And they pop out the reason that this one is still my favorite is because the other Apple cutters that I find at the stores only have this part step one they don't have the little plastic Flip and that makes all the difference makes it even easier easy to clean. I love this thing. I love you all right That's all the holiday shopping that I've done I hope you enjoyed the video and it gave you some holiday gift ideas you can see little cookies ear over here look at this Thanks again, hope you're having happy holidays bye-bye cookie come on you gotta say bye.

This is his password to his office in order of the Phoenix I don't know if anyone had tried these in the stories. I really can't remember It's been a long time since I've read so let's try it Apparently when you eat these you hover like you float a little bit off the ground I don't think that'll happened to us because we're not wizards Maybe we are Just be of sherbert balls so maybe it will taste a little bit like sherbert let's see oh They have little crunchies in there no, I like this a lot mmm. Oh these are yummy. I'm floating! We're definitely getting a sugar high, but it is not the kind that lifts you off the ground But in your head, it does ooo next treat jelly slugs This is a very popular Treat in the Wizarding World They are sold both on the Hogwarts Express on the little trolley and honeydukes it Harry Potter Overhears that they're sold out is he sad I'm very lucky totally happens cuz these are very popular all right Are they shaped like slugs? I think so ooh? I wonder what flavor. They are -I hope they're not slug flavored Are you ready? I I've never had one of these. I'm getting really excited Do you want to do the honors? I do, but I okay? I'm really excited about this. Okay, oh That looks so gross these are really gross they look like little banana slug they do and I'm Like my dad when we were younger like we used to go out and help him in the garden And we like this they look exactly like that I wonder if there's different flavors It feels like I'm eating a real bug Very chewy, and the sweet is is subtle Yeah, I would have expected more like a like a starburst or something yeah Very subtle okay, yeah, I'll have to say I'm surprised I thought these were gonna be my favorite next to the chocolate frog they're not all right So these are Ron loves these no no surprise there He loves sweets, and when you eat them smoke comes out of your nose and like your ears well. Let's see what happens. Okay cool You know this Ron guy, I'm just not so sure about it I think he likes all the sweets, so I'm not really sure like what's a bad sweet And then oh wait there supposed to be cinnamon flavored hard candy like super cinnamon.

We go around their heads around what I think may I go back the other way I don't think you just keep turning okay Here Justine. We've got a chocolate cauldron filled with fire whiskey. I'm gonna have you cut it open, and this is something that was given to Harry Potter had a little love potion in there, but Ron ate it. Oh, No Ron Backfired the love the fire whiskey backfired. We know what's gonna be in here for it. This is pretty neat I Am so disappointed It's empty there's nothing in it. It's hollow. There's no whiskey. There's no magical toads There's no love potion. There's no Ron. There's no fire whiskey. Let's just take a bite of it. Yeah, I'm gonna taste it. Oh yeah. Ha ha I wanna get a marshmallow Crunchy. Yeah there's little sprinkles on there not bad I But I was hoping for more Ooh these are sold at honeydukes and in the story, they are Ron's pets Scabbers Favorite snack what's his pet? It's a rat Oh, I don't know if rats can eat chocolate, but it seems like Ron loves sweets, and then all of it Even is animals love sweet. It's clearly not a true story, okay In a magical world so in this world like rats could eat chocolate They're shaped like flies so like I mean look a little old. They're little flies.  Is this a vintage chocolate? It's just solid chocolate Yeah, and it's more fudgy, er you were really soft? Oh, he's not into it He's a full belly He probably wants to eat Scabbers Let's try some more chocolate. We just had the flies so let's do the little peppermint toads I saw these when I was there and I almost bought that so I'm going to tell me that yes But I had just had butter beer and I was like oh I don't need to have peppermint toads to go with the butter beer now is this from the movie - or is this just Yes So on the first day of the holiday Harry Potter sees Ron and Ron have just had these these kinda like rubbing his belly So I don't know if they're like jumping around in his belly or maybe he had too many cause you know Ron? He's got that sweet tooth. You know. I don't know Ron at all, but you guys know him But are you starting to feel like you know him I do I do. He's got a little bit These look like a darker chocolate whereas the Flies are like a softer kind of like a fudge. I love dark chocolate oh This is good so good It was like lightly pepperment and dark chocolate This is good. Yeah. We'll save those. I love these I think I like Ron mm-hmm He grows on you. Okay, you got to pick whatever one you want though. These are the dark mark lolly pop. Which one you want to try I can do this one in the dark mark? You don't know this I don't know this but the bad guys They got a mark like on their arm like a tattoo like this like if I roll up my sleeve And I had the dark mark oh I've got pink mark from the previous So they make a lolly pop version of it, and if you eat it you get sick That's so entrepreneurial Oh, you can find these at Weasleys Wizard wheezes that's their own little candy store. I'm impressed mm-hmm all Right let's open these up. This should be my first tattoo.

Hey guys, it's Ro welcome to another nerdy Nummies I got so many requests from you guys to make something else emoji themed, and I thought hmMm What's circular and should be an emoji? a doughnut! I love donuts, so today we're going to be making emoji doughnut filled with vanilla cream with my favorite homemade donut recipe Let's get started! The things you'll need will be two eggs just the yolk 3/4 cup milk 1 package of active dry Yeast 2 and 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a vanilla Bean quarter teaspoon of Almond extract Half a teaspoon of Salt 3 tablespoons of Sugar 2 tablespoons of butter and a circle cookie cutter. Then for the filling two cups of cold milk and 1 package of vanilla Pudding mix. for the frosting you'll need powdered sugar and lemon juice and lastly Vegetable oil to fry our doughnuts in. now let's put it all together! first step to making these donuts pour the yeast into your warm milk then add your sugar and Mix it up. once mixed, wait 10 minutes to allow it to bloom once its bloom pour our yeast mixture Two egg yolks butter almond extract and fresh vanilla Beans mix everything together Next we're going to add our flour and salt But don't start with the salt because the salt will kill our yeast so to protect it we start with flour mix the flour in a third at a time. *deup deup deup* Now it's safe to add the salt and the other third of our flour oh Add the last third of your flour and mix it together When you can't mix together anymore with your spatula it's time to knead with your hands This is one of my favorite parts of baking I love it But but kind of messy and I like that hey Sprinkle a little flour so the dough doesn't stick Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh place the dough down and push with the heel of your hand And then pull it back and turn it keep doing this super relaxing Like playing with slime or something. dough's done! You'll know it's ready when it's still firm but Springy and tacky But not sticky. In a large greased Bowl place the dough inside Then cover with food safe plastic wrap set it off to the side to rest Until it doubles in size. while our dough is resting we get to make our filling Pour the entire package of pudding mix into the bowl then pour in two cups of cold milk whisk together until well combined and then pop in the Refrigerator for five minutes to set. we're minutes away from frying these doughnuts behind me I've got my oil heating up on the stove as you can see the dough has risen Let's get out of here look at this It's so fluffy! my favorite part about making donuts is kneading the dough But this may be my second favorite part, cause you get to squish the fluffy dough all right ready, okay? Sprinkle the flour down on the surface This is the moment I've been waiting for ready *boop* *pat pat pet pat pat a pet pet pat pat pet pat pat a pet pet* you want your dough to be about an inch thick take your circle cookie cutter and cut out some Donuts, *boop* cut out as many as you'd like with your donut scrap You can reroll this one more time to make a few extra heh, it's my special donut. It has little giraffe buns There's my self-portrait donut with the scraps. brush off the excess flour I'm just using a little pastry brush Take a clean kitchen towel and cover them up let 'em rest for about five to ten minutes night night Once your donuts have rested wake them up like this RABUBUBUBUBUB I woke Molly up like this one and I got an alarm clock thrown at me now move your doughnuts over to this cookie sheet Let's head over to the stove turn your burner to medium high then heat your oil to 350 degrees I'm using a candy thermometer when the oil is ready Carefully add your donuts fry the donuts on one side for about one to two minutes or until Golden Brown Then flip the donuts over and fry the other side for an additional 1 to 2 minutes Remove the Donuts from the oil and place them onto a cookie sheet lined with Paper towels Do this for the rest of your donut and then Bring them back to the baking station our doughnuts are hot off the stove. while they're cooling, Let's make our donut Icing. mix together powdered sugar and Drizzle in a little bit of lemon juice at a time and mix it up until you get the right consistency We want it to be a thick frosting that will coat the back of a spoon I'm going to be using yellow food coloring to Dye my icing yellow. now to fill our donut. Take wooden skewer, place it right here and go back and Forth like a teeter-totter That's going to create a cavity inside Then dig your vanilla pudding mix I just scooped it into a piping bag with a circular tip at the end Line up the two holes, you gently squeeze. Oh there you go now Now do this for the rest of your donuts Our donuts are filled and ready to dip this is a super easy way to frost dip them straight down to cover the top turn Just a little bit tickle jiggle jiggle and pull up letting the excess icing Drip to the Bottom when the dripping starts to slow down pick up your donut and place it back on the baking sheet Then do this so the rest of your doughnuts, being careful not to drop them in your icing *whisper* Sombody's done that time my favorite part, it's time to decorate we have red and black royal icing which we put into a piping bag with Number two tips at the end some pink luster Dust small baking brushes and some toothpicks in case you need them you can decorate your donuts to look like any Emoji face that you want. I'm gonna start with this one right here, okay, girl mister with his little kitty lips and over here We need a circle and eyebrows and a winky eye and perfect *boop* Next I'm going to make the blushing face because this is one of my favorite emojis I use it all the time.

R: The things you'll need to make this cake will be 2 cups and 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of cake flour, 2 and a half cups of whole milk, M: 3/4 cup of oil, 3 eggs, and we'll just be using the egg whites, 1 teaspoon of almond extract, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 2 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, 1 and a quarter teaspoons of salt. All: Now let's put it all together! R: That was, that was, I brought that L: I learned that from Mark R: First step to making your cake, mix together our dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl Lindsey I'ma have you pour in the flour, cake flour, perfect perfect. Mark, will you pour in the sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk together until well combined. L: Okay, whisking is this whisking? R: Yeah, just big circles, big circles, and try to keep the ingredients in the bowl. It's a good tip. I make messes all the time All right that looks pretty good!

R: One two three four five six seven eight! M: Oh there you go, yeah, wow Okay our next step is gonna be mixing up our wet ingredients, and we're gonna be starting with the egg whites. R: So what I like to do is the jiggle method. I'm gonna give each of you an egg. L: Oh this is precious. R: We got this Crack the egg, they're gonna let the egg white drop into the bowl and just jiggle the yolk back and forth and then bring the yolk over here. Go for it, just go for it. You got it. If the yolk falls in you can always fish it out. That's okay! We got a spoon! L: No I got it I got it! M: She got it she got it! R: Oh okay you got it Okay L: Very precise yes. R: Yes. I'm very proud you guys yes, okay, let's go wash our hands Now, add your oil and your milk. Nice pour That was a good one and your extracts we have vanilla and almond ooh. This the double poor guys You want to whisk again? Yes so much control you guys that is you're a Talented violin years of practice is this it right you hold on all right. That's beautiful positioning is this too much Cause you're reeling up never enough for the maturation Give me you gotta make that violin face, which is kind of like Your violin face leave mark has a guitar. I have a horrible guitar face. What's your guitar piano? Violin bass guitar bass. I need a baking face Right so we have our dry ingredients and our wet ingredients Yes pour all of the wet ingredients into the dry mix together one more time Lindsay you're gonna. Just mix it up. You were the official mixing it up all the day well. Thanks muscles yeah Use these muscles mark where you got him for what dance moves should I do to get a six-pack you know? There's a move in the Samba called Lewis no way You should do it. You just step side and bounce back and bounce it's called a Samba whisk That's it dad done. So you're whisking while whisking Here I have a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper with the pans on top, so if there's any spillage in the Oven it's okay This is our ball pan from the row baking line, and you place them on top of these little silicone liners So if you leave Eliza's it so take it away, just eyeball it. That's the technique. I like to use just pour in the back You got it lady. You got it pink recipe was perfectly developed to fit for this pan So just make it as even as possible Wow Lindsey that effort look at that every dry cavity look at that That's called flexibility good well Before we bake these we should make sure they're completely flat So they don't spill out while we bake just on just a little bit We're gonna put them in the oven now at 325 degrees for an hour and a half so our cakes have baked and they've had plenty of time to cool So what's next? I leveled them so any excess off the top and on one of the cakes whatever one you want to be the bottom Just cut a little off so the cake will sit flat in front of mark. We got a Turntable which makes icing a little bit easier, and I've got a little cake plate. I've cut it to be small I'm gonna stick this right in the middle, and this is to make it easier to move your cake Lindsey I'm gonna hand this to you. All right And then just place it right on top of our little circle cake plate boom in a piping bag I have some buttercream icing with a number 1 a - so just ice the top ok I'm gonna trust you. Just put a little icing and then we'll smooth it out with a spatula When the I love her so much Marks you're gonna hold it flat like this and then just spin away oh I'm so tense right now look how smooth. This is this is great. Don't worry about marks mistakes Yeah easy peasy worrying about your mistakes We have dancers laughing I'm gonna pay for that comment boom That and now I'm about to frost the outside of the cake and we're help it out. This is hopefully teamwork It doesn't need to look perfect because we give them and cover the cake with Square so it looks like a disco ball I Just might look so terrible doesn't look bad. Yeah, that's really sweet ro I Have to take a picture My debauchery you know it's good So once you get all the icing on the cake use your spatula to smooth it out And you can keep doing this and go around a bunch of times until you get it nice and smooth This is calming to watch you do that This is therapeutic you guys ever fall down a rabbit hole on Instagram watching food videos my wife can just watch Food Network That's all we really shit at home like Love in front of Lindsay. There is a piece of rolled out white fondant I place down a little piece of wax paper so that it won't stick to your work surface And we are going to spray it with silver color mist and we got to shake it first okay. Now. We can use our damp Thank you go for it Cover it all over then while it's still wet we're gonna add a little bit of edible disco Dust when you guys came out of that little cocoon your butterfly costume. I was like oh Nice job mark you were working hard you were weird, and yeah, you did a great job And now we are going to cut out these little half-inch cookie cutter squares These are like the smallest square cookie cutters that they think I own and if you don't have these you can use a sharp cutting knife these will be the Mirrored tiles all the way around the disco ball we transferred our cake onto our cake display to look like a mirror ball trophy Now this is really neat you can display the cake on many different things You can just leave it on a plate or a cake tray But I took a candle pillar and painted it so it would look like the trophy So do we get to use these little squares now? Oh yeah, now it's time for my favorite part It is time to decorate take some fondant squares And I like to start in the middle and place them all over the cake for the final decoration step This is totally optional because you can just leave it as a disco ball It will still look like a mirror ball trophy But I've cut out of white fondant the letters Dancing with the Stars You can cut these letters out using simple letter cookie cutters And I'm painting them gold with some edible gold dust mixed with a couple drops of almond extract Once your gold letters are done use a little bit of icing and place them on the cake to say Dancing with the Stars Here is the disco ball mirror ball trophy cake that we made today in honor of Dancing with the Stars a big Thank you to Lindsey and Mark. Thank you guys for being here and helping me bake this. This is so special.

Hey guys, it's Ro. Look who I'm hanging out with today, it's Connor What up it's me I am so excited. I'm a huge fan of yours And this is the first time that we're hanging out making a video {I know!} and I'm, I'm up here I can't believe it's the first time I mean we've hung out before we were on YouTube rewind together. We go way back But this is our first colab video! I know, and people have been demanding it so This is a very special place in my heart today you guys. I'm going to put all of your links down below So go check him out do some heart emojis go say hi, {love it, love it, love it} And you guys I bought Connor's first book and you have a second one. I wrote a second one. She's cute, but my second book is cuter. It comes out April eighteenth So, if you want to go preorder it link will be below. So today We're gonna be trying ten different chocolate flavors a lot of them are weird So get ready you pick the first chocolate flavor Okay, um {what's it gonna be?} Let's start off with something light like a strawberry champagne {oooooh} an afternoon chocolate strawberry champagne Afternoon delight they could of just put the emojis the strawberry the champagne and the chocolate bar Should we smell it? Smells like chocolate. Smells like chocolate, I was hoping to smell some champagne. What does champagne even smell like? Oh it has a smell oh my god (pop) ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Beauty, ooh. When you break the chocolate you can see the strawberry Honestly amazing light fruity delicious wow chocolate strawberry, I give it a thumbs up, me too That's a solid 9.5 out of 10 You pick the next one. Ooh, big decisions. There are several ones that are really fun that I hope you pick but we'll wait Oh no now I feel like I'm going to disappoint you. Yeah well, you know. These ones. Ok, that was one of the ones (gasp) ok chocolate potato chip flavored Which I understand the whole crunchiness within the chocolate and the salty with the sweet {I love that} This is also the meal that I would probably eat after a breakup to be honest {Ohhh} throw a pizza, and a tub of ice cream in there, and that's a wrap. That should be the whole chocolate bar. Pizza, ice cream, potato chip, chocolate. That's the name of my next book. {ooohhhh} look  it says chew and wow. oh my God it has all different words on it. Tickle? Tickle Oh it's tingle, it's not tickle it says tingle
{"Lick, savor, joy." Oh, okay.} Wait mine says tickle. It does? You can really taste the potato. {Yeah} I don't  i don't I like it. It's not for you? I'm not a potato chip connoisseur 123 lamb chops/octopus? I'm gonna this one a 6 out of 10 {6 out of 10?} yep. I'm being critical. I give this... (long silence, crickets chirping) [distant voice overlay] You know what I would pair these with, barbecue sauce Oh we're waiting This is why I'm not a very good critic. This next flavor is chocolate Jalapeño peanut, and you're not allergic to peanut. No, I'm not, but that would have been a great video title. "rushed to the hospital" "Rushed to the hospital" "Chocolate challenge" am I going to taste the jalapeño, are we going to taste the peanut? Find out now. I don't taste the jalepeño Hmm *slide whistle down*
*tink* It's like what I assume a subtle allergic reaction is, you know, just like tingling in the back of your throat. Yeah. I like that though I like it too. Nice, subtle, smooth 8.5 out of 10. WHOA We just had a little spice, but now I want all of the spice. I want to try this one next Spicy sriracha, I want to see if this is stronger than the last one we tried Well, I mean, it's gonna be even spicier after we just had a spicy one too Ooh, it looks kind of red. It's cute look at that shade, but it's kind of terrifying at the same time. Live life on the edge. Get wild here ready. Yeah, okay Wait so, it taste's like beef jerky ew, as a vegetarian, I'm offended. It's just a lot of hot yeah, I can feel it now too Whatever one we eat next is like, tainted with this. We should cleanse our palates with some ginger chocolates. Oooh [They] Have a William Shakespeare quote on the inside. Oh, this is deep. "When most I wink then do mine eyes Best see", I can barely read, so I feel like I shouldn't read this. Oh aw each one's a little heart Ok ready? Whoa, You can taste that right away. Oh, I like that one 9 out of 10, I know look at me go I'm gonna pick the next one and I think I want to do this one because it's sweet and Savory these one's are chocolate pretzel flavored. This is like a standard one that we should do oh my God, there's a lot of- I thought I was gonna be a little bit more of a different approach than that. They just like chopped up a bunch of pretzels and just threw it in the bar, look at that We're probably going to love it to be honest I already went for it. Great, yum fantastic. A different way to eat chocolate covered pretzels. Revolutionary. Look at him I know Should we do something a little bit more adventurous? Yeah, what should we do? red velvet, ooh. This is a double dessert you guys ooh marshmallow. What? I'm beyond ready. This is a tri-dessert Oh Lemme try Oh please taste like cake. {This is amazing} Oh it does taste like cake. I wish you could taste the Marshmallow more though This is chocolate cake right here Yeah needs more marshmallow. Good thing we have one that has marshmallow So this is s'mores flavored chocolate. Do you like your s'mores burnt or lightly browned? I'm so embarrassed. If I tell you are, are you going to so judge me? No, because I have, mine are specific. Burnt. To a crisp! Golden brown all the way around, boring! Yeah and it's easier too {because you just burn it} I like when it catches fire too, and then you blow it out. Oh, oh Wow, that's what we wanted to see that is some marshmallow look at that. So you need to get a piece that obviously has a marshmallow in it I'm gonna cheat it. I'm gonna get a couple. I just stick them on there. They put them here. And look, and there's graham cracker, too We're going for the whole thing. Yep, it's really good. That's it. Yum. That's it. Mmh, That's it, MMH. Dare I say, 10 out of 10? (gasp) What what what? Honestly that's so good We have two more left, and we're forced to choose the orange chocolate one because we're saving the best for last yeah It's in Dark chocolate very contrast-y. also non-gmo. Thank God verified. On Twitter? *laughs* I like that it's citrus with the dark chocolate I'm ready It reminds me of the holidays cause citrus trees like you know tangerine trees. They ripen during December. I'm from Minnesota So we don't have citrus. You're from Minnesota? {yeah} I did not know that. Really? My mom. No way! Born and raised. Oh, my gash. Oh don't'cha know now? They've got lakes, they've got Mall of America, They had a cool train station I went to.Yep that's about it Oh fall there is nice, but it's cold In the winter there? Freezing (various "hmms") A little bit... Bathroom-y if that make sense. I'mma be really honest here. I feel like the orange rind is in here too. It's not bad. It's just... A little bit much. Oh, what should we give this one? I'm gonna be nice 7.5 out of 10 I love how I just made up my own ranking for this unintentionally. You just like got it going thank you oh my gosh I'm excited. I love fruit loops. Chocolate Fruity cereal, and you can really see those froot loops I know and I suppose I can't call it fruit loops yeah Maybe like a knockoff brand of fruit loops, yeah fruit-os, and this is the first that we're trying white chocolate. Yeah, you're right I'm not the biggest fan of white chocolate. My favorite is dark chocolate. {Yes} I really like dark chocolate {Me too} I have a hard time eating anything over eighty percent. It is really bitter. I've tried so many times I just can't Ready? I think they just put fruit loops on white chocolate What a letdown oh, {All my hopes} I thought it was going to taste like cereal {All my dreams}. Like milk and cereal I know, that's what I thought so too It looks like that, but it doesn't taste like that. Misleading. Now you guys know we tried it so you guys wouldn't have to. Now you know what's good We did the dirty work for you. It's been a tough day. It was a rough one. That does it we tried 10 different flavors of chocolate I hope you guys enjoyed the video a big Thank you to Connor for hanging out with me and eating a bunch of sweets today. {It was a hard day} We made another video over on Connor's channel. {We did} We're gonna try a bunch of different donuts, but we're going to try and guess them blindfolded this time. The x factor element Yes, trying to guess the flavors I'll put a  link down below so go check it out. Thanks for watching I hope you guys enjoyed it. Buh-bye! Bye! 
Upbeat music Hey guys, it's Ro welcome to another nerdy nummies today, we have a very special guest it's Zach, Zach King you guys. I'm so excited We met a couple years ago, and I'm just so happy that we're baking together, finally. We're baking I'm kind of scared. Don't worry I'll guide you through it will be easy I  barely bake at home at all, but he makes awesome Videos so I think that's even cooler. I'm gonna put links down below to everything all his social medias. Go show him some love Subscribe and follow and all of those things. Today we are gonna be making a penguin cake for the holidays. Which is incredible because I've actually made a video about a penguin before I turn my tuxedo into a penguin and *Poof* I Gotta and put a link down to that too. It is so cool and speaking of magic, Zach came out with this book I'm gonna brag about him and embarrass him just a little bit because it is the coolest book I have ever got it's Zach King my magical life And you download this little app and you look at the images throughout the book and they come to life I have never seen this ever in my life, and you blew me away. It looks coolest thing I spent way too many hours looking at all the photos, so you did a good job so today We're gonna be making a peppermint cake cuz I thought that, that was a very Holiday themed flavor and we're gonna make it look like a cute little penguin, ooh fun! Yeah Let's get started the things you will need will be 2 cups of sugar, 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of cake flour, 2 and 1/2 cups of whole milk, 3/4 cup of oil, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of peppermint extract 1 in a quarter teaspoon of salt, 2 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 3 eggs. But we'll only be using the whites, and now let's put it all together! Nice job. Thank you. That's pretty good. That was that was good, first step to making this cake is whisking together The dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl Zach. I'm gonna have you do this. You can't mess this up This is easy-peasy alright So add your flours doesn't matter which order the sugar, salt and baking powder is there a wrong way to whisk? well why don't you have a KitchenAid here? Zach I didn't need a KitchenAid today Cause I got you here, so you are the KitchenAid today step two whisk together all of your wet ingredients But remember we just want the egg whites. oh the egg whites. Yes, so I get a little nervous cracking eggs because the last time I cracked an egg a little baby chick popped out. jiggle the Yolk back and forth letting the egg white drip to the bottom You're making that way easier than it looks, so on this side. Oh oh oh, it's yay cool, so There you go jiggle jiggle jiggle, Zach perfect love it. Nice, he can bake. There's the oil going in. Hey beautiful pour boom and I'm gonna have you add the extracts as well But let me just take a sniff first Okay, it smells so good together. They should be best friends Then and in your whole milk, this is heavy. Zach, You got a whisk it up again Cuz you're the guest you've been a great KitchenAid nice nice nice nice nice, so how do I know when this is done? Yeah? You just mix her a little under a minute. That's all so we've got our wet ingredients We've got our dry ingredients and are we just mixing them together now? Yep, step Three is Combine, so just pour all of the wet into the dry cause it's the bigger bowl. There you go there You go, nice Zach *Bloop* Great, yes, yes *ding* whisk again, but be careful Zach cuz this is a full bowl, it's like right to the rim This is a lot of cake batter work it in there Zach. You didn't know that this was gonna be a workout did you? I don't know it was just your whisker today. Oh wow he's gonna be the biggest whisk taker today....Oh I'm trying to make a pun out it, I got you huh ,so we've got our batter here ,and what are those ball pans? Yeah
That's a sphere ball Pan, they come with a little Silicone liner that goes at the end and that will hold your pan in place Zach. You can do this. pour this in here. Yeah, just pour about half in here and half in here. Oh, that's good. Zach That's good. Okay, okay here Zach That was really good. Thank you Thats a great pour. That is the first time I've ever done them Just make sure before you put them in the oven that they are very level So we gotta look down here make sure that they're flat because we don't want em to tip That looks pretty good. So pre-heat your oven to 325 and they'll sit in there for about an hour and a half Yes, we're gonna slow bake these cakes so the cakes are baked and we've let them cool for plenty of time And you know how do we assemble them? It's really easy the first thing that you want to do is just cut a little bit off the bottom of one of them So it will sit like this Ooh that  looks great, and also level off the top so its nice and flat and then in front of you, You've got a turntable have you ever used one of these with baking? Yeah, just like that All right, so now. Just pipe a little bit of icing on the top And I'm gonna show you how you do it so pipe a little layer all the way around Oh, that's good doo-doo-doo-doo boom! and then fill it in like this I have a little offset spatula, and we're just gonna spin it to flat all right now Zach. I'm gonna Have you place on the top of the cake alright? Just try to line it up the best you Can you can always wiggle it around so don't be afraid if you off set it a little bit Yeah press it down a little bit oh Wow, okay or a lot of it. That's okay next thing we do is frost the entire thing I like to start at the bottom and just slowly work your way up to the top Let me see how you're doing it baking is a skill huh this is tough. Oh yeah, squeeze out just a little bit more. Oh well I messed it up. Don't look at that Have you ever made a Death Star before? *gasp* Yes! I have used this ball cake to make so many cool things the Death Star was one of my favorite So now I'm guessing we're spinning this thing to make it all smooth? It doesn't need to look perfect because we just want the entire cake frosted we're gonna put fondant over it It's gonna act as the glue for our fondant, so we're gonna put this in the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes Yeah, so our cake is chill and it's sitting on a plate over here. We've got our fondant ready to be rolled out Yes, I put a baking mat down so our fondant won't stick to the surface all right. I'm gonna push This little guy out of the way, and then Zach. I'm gonna have you use a fondant rolling pin Just gently roll it out about a quarter-inch thick. I'll show you how to transfer fondant So you take your rolling pin, and you just put it here at the end, and then you start to roll it *bloop* up I think you can do this. Okay. You just go for it. Just go for it. Just gently you can over-roll  it Just gentle gentle. I'll bring in this one, and then start to flop it on top That's genius there you go. There you go That's magic right there. All right, then we smooth it out. This is kind of silly and just gently Press it down to the end so right now. It kind of looks like it ghost. Yeah, it does this could be a snapchat Gently pull it down and then press in because if you pull too fast. It's gonna tear. I'm definitely did that That's okay. We can fix tears. Once you've got it wrapped cut off the excess the closest you can get to the base. Cut cut cut cut cut and then peel off the excess so this is covered and trimmed now We're rolling out the black fondant and going to about a quarter inch thick yes. That is looking good Once you've rolled out the black fondant. You're gonna be using one of these Looks like a genie bottle doesn't it okay Zach hold It, I'll hold it here, and then you got to do some type of like ,if I go like this Okay, you know what? I wish what a peppermint wait for it Penguin cake ,cool. Well. We're making one so that works out okay great. I leave this silly looking template in Photoshop I will put a link down below You just print out two of them tape them together overlay it like so and cut it out So then we pull up the excess yeah take off the excess oh Did you hear that guys this is great before we transfer the fondant to the cake. I'm gonna put a little bit of royal icing this is gonna act like glue Hi Zach, okay, and then I'll let you write something. I'm gonna draw a little penguin oh Just to ,Penguins have wings right?

[Ro singing the Game of Thrones theme song passionately] Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! I got so many requests from you guys to make something else Game of Thrones themed, and you know me, I love Game of Thrones, so I definitely wanted to make another themed treat I have read four of the books and watched all of the TV series. I love to host viewing parties with my friends and make themed treats, and I thought, let's make another one. The series' theme is A Song of Ice and Fire and I even wore a shirt that kind of represents this. We've got Daenerys with her dragons --the fire-- and then, we've got John Snow with his little direwolf -- the ice. Today, we're going to be making two different cupcakes;
one for fire and one for ice. Let's get started! The first cupcake recipe that we're going to be making is a vanilla mint for our ice cupcakes. The things you'll need will be 1-1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of milk, 1 stick of butter, 2 eggs, 1 vanilla bean, 1-1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract. Then, for our fire-themed cupcakes, we are going to be making a Red Hot cupcake recipe. The things you'll need will be 2 cups of cake flour, 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of milk, 1 stick of butter, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup of Red Hots candy, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon extract. Now, let's put it all together!!! [Ro singing the Game of Thrones theme song] The first cupcake that we're going to be making is the icy cupcake. Combine our dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, and salt. Then, whisk together until it's well combined and set it off to the side. Now, cream together sugar and butter. Mix together until it becomes light and fluffy. Add our eggs, one at a time. Mix it up. Add our vanilla bean. Make a slit down the middle. Open it up so you can see all the seeds. Start at the top. Press all the way down, scraping out those seeds. [Ro smells the vanilla bean] Oh, you guys. You can't smell this, but if you could- if you could smell this through your screen... [Ro smells the vanilla bean again] It would make you smile! Got our vanilla seeds in there. Add our peppermint extract. Mix it in. Pour in about 1/3 of the "dry". Mix it up, then half of our milk. Mix it up, third of our "dry". Mix it up, the other half of our milk. Mix it up, end with our "dry". Mix it up! Our batter is ready. It's time to scoop our cupcakes. Fill each cupcake tray about 2/3 full. The cupcakes are ready to bake. We're going to put these in the oven at 350 degrees and bake for about 12 to 15 minutes. To make our Red Hot cupcakes, it's very similar process to our vanilla peppermint. Flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk it together and set it off to the side. Once again, we're gonna cream together sugar and butter until it's light and fluffy. Add an egg. Mix it up. Add the second egg. Mix it up and then, cinnamon extract! This smells so good, you guys! [Ro smells the cinnamon extract] Mmm! Smells like the Holidays! All of our ingredients are ready. You guys know the drill. Alternate adding our "dry" and milk into our big mixing bowl, starting with our "dry" and ending with our "dry". BOOM! Batter! Last but not least, mix the Red Hot candies into the batter. Just mix till they're all covered. Scoop the batter into each cupcake tray about 2/3 full. Cupcakes are ready to bake. We're going to bake these at 350 degrees for about 12 to 15 minutes. While our cupcakes are baking and cooling, we're going to get our decorations ready. We've got some different color rock candy. We have light blue and clear. Looks kinda icy. Some light blue frosting, orange, and red. We've also got two different color cupcake wrappers. We've got a sparkly red and a sparkly blue to look like fire and ice. Ooh, I have a hair on me. Oh, it's connected. That was my hair. I've also got two piping bags with two different tips at the end: a 2D and an 809. We want our fire frosting to have little accents of orange. So, I'm just putting a streak of orange into the bag. This is the bag with the closed star on the end. Now, I'm gonna fill up the rest of our bag with our red frosting. Oooh Starting to look like a flame. Now, we're going to scoop all of our blue frosting into the other piping bag. Frostings are ready and I've assembled all of our little paper wrappers. They're very easy. They just attach in the back. Last but not least, we got to get our rock candy ready. Take the light blue, place them into a Ziploc baggie. Take our clear rock candy, place that into another baggie. Then, using a rolling pin or whatever you have around the kitchen, give them a whack. Crush 'em up. Get those candy crystals off the stick! This is also good training for fighting against White Walkers, just sayin'. I didn't even need any Valyrian steel! Just my woody rolling pin. It's wooden. [Ro violently singing the Game of Thrones theme] I'm like Arya trying to learn how to sword fight. It's not pretty, at first, but then... I get the hang of it. Both of our cupcakes have baked and had plenty of time to cool and now, it is time for my favorite part. It is time to decorate! I have vanilla mint wrapped in blue for the ice cupcakes. Then, I have our Red Hot cupcakes wrapped in the red for our fire. To frost our ice cupcakes, hold it in the center of the cupcake, not touching the cupcake, hovering, just like that, little hover. Press gently. It's gonna make a little frosting ball. BOOP! Then, you're going to do this to all of your ice cupcakes. Now, using a small offset spatula, create a little home for our rock candies on the top so it looks like ice. Add light blue and the clear rock candies on the top. Our ice cupcakes are looking good. And now, we're going to decorate our fire cupcakes. Put a little bit of pressure at the base of the cupcake and then, pull up and release. Then, we're gonna do this to the rest of our fire cupcakes. TA-DA!! Here are the fire and ice themed cupcakes that we made today. A big thank you to you guys for suggesting something Game of Thrones themed. I personally love Game of Thrones and I love making themed treats because I make them at viewing parties or if you have a Game of Thrones birthday party, these would make a good themed treat as well. For our fire cupcakes, we made a Red Hot recipe, and for our ice cupcakes, we made a vanilla mint. I'll be posting the recipe and the pictures on RosannaPansino.com, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. And if you guys make these treats or any other Game of Thrones themed treats, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes my day. It makes me happy. And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen. All right, thanks again, you guys! Buh-bye! Winter's here in cupcake form. Mm-mm-mm! Mmm mmm. It's minty, it's refreshing, it has some vanilla.
I just want to eat it. 
[Nerdy Nummies intro song] Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! Look who's right here! It's my friend Jordan! Jordan: Yeah! Excited to be here! Jordan: I love Harry Potter. I know! You guys know Jordan, We have baked together before - but! If you are new to the channel, I'm gonna be putting all those links down below, go subscribe! I got so many requests from you guys to make something Harry Potter themed... Today, we are gonna be making a Butterbeer cake, and the recipe that we're making is a butterscotch cake recipe, frosted with cream soda Eeee! *claps* Let's get started! The things you will need to make our butterscotch cake will be: 2 and 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 and 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup of unsalted butter, 1 cup of buttermilk, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of butterscotch extract, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of salt, 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda, 3/4 teaspoon of baking powder, and 3 eggs. Jordan: And then, for the cream soda frosting, you'll need: 1 pound of butter at room temperature, 5 eggs - we'll only be using the whites - 1 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cream soda flavor. Now, let's put it all together! First step to making your cake is whisking together the dry ingredients! Pour in the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk together until well combined and set off to the side. Before we cream together our butter and sugar, I have a really good Harry Potter joke. Jordan: Okay Why did Professor Snape stand in the middle of the road? [drumroll] 'Cuz you never know what side he's on. [cymbal crash] Jordan: Ahhhhhh (Ro's inner thoughts) I guess it wasn't that great of a joke (Ro's inner thoughts) I really liked it, in my head, but then when I said out loud it wasn't the best delivery. Jordan: It was good. Okay, thanks. 'Cuz I feel like I delivered it worse than that owl that can't see good in the movie. Jordan: And now we'll cream together our butter and brown sugar. Jordan: Wait how do we do... Oh, you push up this part like that, (Jordan: Oh ok) and - oh, is it plugged in - ? No. It's not plugged in. That's the wrong way. Oops! Start mixing on the lowest speed and mix together until it's light and fluffy. It smells just like a Harry Potter butterbeer would smell like Jordan: You can get 'em at the grocery store, too. [Suspenseful music for a second] Jordan: You can. what oh, I didn't that's called flying Auburn. Um not the grocery store. I go to they don't have a flying culture So sorry to hear that Uh-oh Next we're gonna add our eggs one at a time mixing in between each one ( Sound of water running) I'm very impressed. Three eggs, no shells (Jordan- All right!) I don't even do that! It's looking pretty good so far, we're gonna add our vanilla extract and butterscotch extract mix it up one more time Alright, so our butter mixture is done. Now, i'll be adding our dry ingredients and our buttermilk. Alternate adding the two - three parts dry, two parts butter milk. so our batter is ready but, Before we can add to our pans we got to taste test it that's like the most important part. Just a little one I'm just doing a little pinky, gonna taste it Is pinky the proper etiquette? You could do a finger too cuz I'm definitely getting more than that there. We go already Mmm. I want to freeze this that's real good. I mean and then eat it like ice cream We have three six inch round greased cake pans. Oh my have you old of all German works out a lot? He's got muscles. Oh yeah, Bob Jordan. Oh You're gonna lose - baby. Here's nerve-wracking. This is a slippery glass. It's very messy. Yeah. Oh, sorry Okay, okay here here. Oh Oh, sorry. I'm sorry now using a spatula Celestin the batter Jordans taste testing today Yeah, I gotta keep testing. It is a very important part of baking mm-hmm What would your Patronus look like, what animal? It would be definitely. Oh, it's probably be a wombat Someone who launches out like a tiger a majestic stallion you just a wombat appears Aspecto patronum Is that a spell our cakes are ready to make you preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit Celsius would be a little bit toasty there and then bake them for 45 minutes We're making a Swiss buttercream-style frosting that is going to taste like cream soda Awesome, I love This icing is a little fancy Jordan. I thought you were ready. We've baked together. and now time to level up you thought I was ready, but you decide yeah, crack all of the eggs into the big bowl, but no yolks jiggle-jiggle Yeah, this is the jiggle method where you jiggle the yolk back and forth Oh fancy? It was just a little bit, it's be okay, this is high risk here What if I what if I try my own jiggle method with my palm of my hand a meringue? Really, you can't have any yolks in there. It won't whip right. This is a technique You have it really is so we did an absolutely perfect flawless job And I think in the egg whites no yolks whatsoever not even an atom in front of them Yeah, and now we're gonna add our sugar already whisked together And then we're gonna take it over to the stove place a pot of water on the stove and turn the heat to medium Place your mixing bowl on the pot and whisk the egg whites and sugar until the sugar is dissolved You'll know it's ready when it's smooth to the touch I usually whisk for about five minutes once the sugar has fully dissolved. Take your bowl back to your baking station Here's the mixing bowl. We just took it off the stove We'd put it on our mixing stand and now we're gonna mix things up a little bit yeah on a high speed Mix your egg whites until it's bright white nice and fluffy careful Are you Jordan check this out That's really cool from a liquid to a solid. Thank you protein strands All right, let's make this a buttercream Jordan's gonna be adding the butter slowly Chunk by chunk one time while this is mixing at a medium speed You'll know when to stop mixing when your bowl is room temperature It will be just barely warm to the touch because you don't want to melt your butter Beautiful, that's what you want like fluffy It smells like butter so now we're gonna add our salt our vanilla and our cream soda This is gonna make it nice and flavor II mix together til well Combined and a you know it would take a little taste for me. Yeah, this is just straight-up frosting This is gonna go on the cake mmm This is the fanciest frosting I've ever made. I'm honored to have been a part of it I'm Jordan before we eat all of this. We've got to divide it in half half of it We'll just scoop into piping bags, and then the other half I'm gonna dye it a light mustard color few few drops of yellow and a drop of brown Okay, one more when were then taking it away And now we're gonna make the handle for our mug out of fondant This is because the cake we're making is gonna look like a mug of butter beer just roll the fondant Into a log then shape it into a C or a U shape this is a buffer if you don't have one of these you could just Take two wooden skewers and place them into each end of the handle you want the sharp end to be sticking out. We are now ready for the big moment Assembling our cake. I popped them out of the pans. I leveled them between each cake there's a little cake plate to keep them separate So they won't stick together this is where you'll want to pick your final serving tray. I'm gonna be using look at this That's like a coaster. It's supposed to look like a coaster. Take your first layer with the cake plate I like to leave the cake plate at the bottom Just in Case you need to move it so this is the color that we dyed half of the frosting pipe a circle all the way around outlining the cake gonna draw a circle fill in the middle Oh Jordan using an offset spatula Smooth it out put the next one on top mhm next layer when you're stacking the last layer of cake flip the cake upside Down so the bottom is the top now we're gonna pop this in the fridge We're gonna let chill for about 30 minutes while I DJ turntable Here we go after your cake has chilled in the fridge frost the entire thing Jordan's gonna slowly In the turntable and I'm gonna pipe icing on the side of the cake Starting at the bottom and work my way up the cake once you've got the frosting on the side of the cake smooth it out Using a larger offset spatula once you get the side Smooth go back to the top and see this little lip pull it towards you now that our Frosting is all nice and smoothed out. We have to add the swipes to make it look like a mug It's just a super light drag all the way up Yes We've got our texture all the way around now quickly smooth The top doesn't need to look perfect because we're gonna cover the top with white icing so now we have the other half of our frosting that we didn't die in piping bags with tips at the end 809 and 2a and then Jordan what tip do you have a 12 start with the largest tip which is the 809 pipe large shells on the top of your cake there's also a reason. I'm not doing this now switch to your smaller tip the to a Filling in all the cracks and holes piping smaller shelves and then for the final step I'll use the 12 to do little tiny circles because that's the only thing I'm good at its gonna look like bubbles our butterbeer cake Is just about done We just have one more step place the fondant handle on the side of the mug final decoration step final decoration step. Don't mess up, Jordan, don't mess up. There we go a nice handle in there tada Here is the butterbeer cake that we made today inspired by Harry Potter I am so excited because this is the first time on nerdy nummies that we've ever made a Butterscotch cake recipe with a cream soda icing the combination will taste exactly like butter bear you don't remember A big thank you to you guys for suggesting something Harry Potter themed and a big Thank you to my friend Jordan. Probably bake today, and helping especially with all the shells You did really good with everything else, but the shells were a little iffy though I'll be posting the recipe and a bunch of pictures along Rosina pansino comm Facebook Instagram and Twitter you can check it out there And if you guys make this cake please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations It just makes me happy. It makes my day if you guys have any other ideas for any other nerdy nummies, please Let me know leave a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen alright. Thanks again you guys bye-bye Now we get to try a slice. I'm gonna get a big big helping of icing 
Hey guys, it's Ro. It's the weekend and look who I'm hanging out with. [gasps] It's Doug the Pug! Good boy, Doug! You're so handsome. Come sit here. [Doug pants] I am so excited, Doug. You probably don't remember this, but we met a couple years ago in New York at StreamCon. You were dressed as Harry Potter. You were so adorable. I waited in line. We took a picture. It was pretty much the best day ever. So today, I wanted to make a themed treat in your honor. So today, we are going to be making Pug Cupcakes! I also got a lot of requests from you guys to make some Pug Cupcakes, so that is exactly what we're gonna be doing today. Let's get started! [Doug pants]
[Ro giggles] The things you'll need for these Peanut Butter Pug Cupcakes will be: ½ cup of creamy peanut butter, ½ cup of butter at room temperature, ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons of honey, ¾ cup of sugar, 2 large eggs at room temperature, 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract, ¼ teaspoon of salt, 1½ teaspoon of baking powder, 1¾ cup of all-purpose flour, and ½ cup of whole milk. Then, the things you'll need to decorate will be: vanilla buttercream frosting that I've dyed tan, fitted with a #2A tip; black fondant; pink fondant; white fondant; a fondant tool, a small rolling pin. You'll also need different cookie cutters: There's a little teardrop, a small square, an extra small square, a small oval, and an extra small oval. You'll also need a #12 tip. We're going to be using the top. And a #5 tip. We're going to be using the top. Doug, have you ever baked a cupcake before? That's okay. We're also twins-ing today. Did you guys notice? We called each other. I texted him and I was like, "Hey Doug, can we wear matching shirts?" And he was like, "Cool." The first thing that we're going to do to make our peanut butter cupcakes is whisk together our dry ingredients. Our flour. I'll pour it, 'cause you have paws. Baking powder. Yeah, smells kind of funny doesn't it? Yeah, we have to mix it in first. And salt. Oh, wait Doug, not yet! Wait till it's a cupcake! Then whisk together until well combined. Before we cream our butter and sugar, Doug, I had to tell you that you are my first animal guest on the show, and I am so excited it's you! Now in a larger bowl, we are going to cream together our butter, peanut butter, sugar, and honey, until it's light and fluffy. I'm going to be using an electric hand mixer, but you can also do it by hand with a whisk. Now we are going to add our eggs, one at a time; So I'm going to add an egg, mix it up, scrape down the sides, add the second egg. Mix it up and scrape down the sides. Then pour in the vanilla extract, and mix it up. Doug, have you ever cracked an egg before let's see what you can do? I'm trusting that you're not gonna eat the batter before we bake these. Our butter mixture is ready, and now, we are going to alternate adding our dry ingredients and milk to our butter mixture, starting and ending with dry. Add a third of our dry ingredients. Mix it up, and half of the milk, mix it up another third of the dry. Mix it up, the other half of the milk. Mix it up, and ending with the last third of the dry, and mix it up. I know, Doug. This part takes longer than I'd like, but it's baking science. You got to do it for the science, Doug. Trust me. [electric mixer noise in background] [softly] Oh my gosh, his biscuit tail! Ahh! It's time to scoop the batter into the cupcake tray. Over here, I've got a cupcake tray, lined with a bunch of paper liners. And I'm gonna be using an ice cream scoop. This is a pretty cool trick. Doug, I don't know if you've ever seen one of these. Yeah, isn't that a pretty neat? Scoop the batter, and you're going to fill each cupcake tray about two-thirds full. Oh, this smells good huh? This is the hard part, Doug. You can't eat them yet! [Doug licks] Yeah. Me, too. Cupcakes are ready to bake. Now, we're gonna pop these in the oven, at 350 degrees, and bake them for 18 to 20 minutes- Doug! Not yet! We gotta wait! While the cupcakes are baking, we are gonna make our decorations out of fondant. Over here, I have marshmallow fondant that I have dyed pink, black, and a little bit regular, just white. And I have a bunch of different cutters over here, that I'm going to be using to make the little pug shapes. Doug, you just stay there. You're gonna be my model. I'm gonna make all the shapes look just like you. So you just relax. I'm rolling the fondant out on top of a piece of parchment paper, so it won't stick to the work surface. Now we're going to be cutting out all of the different shapes on a pug's face. We have a small oval, a small square, a teardrop, and a little bit larger square. Just cut out a bunch of them. Doot doot doot, like this. A-woo-woo-woo! Then lastly, using a #12 tip, I'm gonna be using the smaller end and these will be the pug's eyes. Now let's get into the details. These larger little squares, we're gonna be cutting in half the diagonal way. These are gonna be your ears. Then take the teardrop, little puppy jowls―or puppy lips―and we're gonna poke a few holes in them, because they have a few pores there for their whiskers. Then, for the little pug nose, cut your ovals in half. Once you have all of your black fondant designs ready, you can set them off to the side and we're gonna roll out our white and pink fondant. For our pink fondant, we're gonna be using the larger small oval. Cut these out. These are going to be the pug's tongue. For a little extra detail, take a toothpick and press it down the middle. For the white fondant, place the top end of a #5 tip down, to cut out little circles. This will be the pug's eye reflection. Our cupcakes have baked, they've had plenty of time to cool, and now it is time for my favorite part, Doug. It's time to frost and decorate! In this piping bag, I have a little bit of vanilla buttercream frosting with a #2A tip. I'm gonna start on the outside, and work my way in, and boom! These are the little wrinkles; they kind of look like your face. What do you think? Yeah. Time to assemble! Now I'm gonna assemble all of our little fondant decorations to look like a pug. Doug, you stay there. I need you to model. We're gonna start with the tongue. I'm gonna place it here, about halfway onto the cupcake, then take a small square, place it on top, and two little jowls. Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm [repeated]
Yeah. Boom. Then place the half oval on top, for a little puggy nose! Now, the two triangles for the pug ears. Last, but not least, we need two cute little eyeballs. And, there we have it. A Pug Cupcake! Ahh! Ta-daa! Here are the Peanut Butter Pug Cupcakes that we made today. They are adorable. They look like cute little pugs. And Doug, I think this looks pretty similar to you. What do you think? Do you think like you're looking into a mirror? A big thank you to you guys for suggesting something pug-themed, and a HUGE thank you, to Doug the Pug, for hanging out with me today. This was a dream come true. I'm gonna put all of his links down below, so go follow him, go subscribe. Show him some love. Also, I'll be taking pictures of these cupcakes and posting the recipe on RosannaPansino.com, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. So you can check them out there, and if you guys make these treats, please take a picture and send them to me. I love seeing your baking creations. Also, send them to Doug! Thanks again you guys for watching, buh-bye! You're the best baking assistant I've ever had! 
*Intro music* Hey guys! It's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! I got so many requests from you guys to make another geode themed treat. The last geode treat that I made was with Joey, we made cupcakes. So today we're going to be doing something a little bit different, We are going to be making geode cake pops! Using for decoration the sugar gems from my baking line! In the past, whenever I'm making rock or geode themed desserts I used crushed Jolly Ranchers or hard candy... So I got the idea, I wish you could buy them already crushed up. If you're interested I'll put the link down below to where you can find 'em. Alright, so let's get started! To make our cake pops the recipe that we are using is the chocolate cake recipe from the Nerdy Nummies cook book The things you will need will be - Flour, sugar, brown sugar, cocoa powder, water, vegetable oil, eggs, baking soda, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and sour cream! Then for the ganache you'll need - chocolate and cream. Now let's put it all together! The first step is to make our cake batter. Measure out and combine all your dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Starting with our flour measure 1 1/3 cup, 2/3 cup of cocoa powder, (At this moment Ro knew she screwed up.) (HIDE THE EVIDENCE!) 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon! Whisk this together until well combined then we'll add our sugar. 1 1/3 cup of regular sugar and 2/3 cup of packed brown sugar. Whisk this together again until it's well combined then set it off to the side! [Laugh] This smells so good! Next, measure out your wet ingredients and pour them into a medium bowl. Starting with your water, you're gonna need 1/3 CUP. ... 1/4 CUP of Oil. This will be a minute... [Humming] [Laughing] Oooooh! One cup of sour cream. Next add four eggs. We're gonna be using the whole egg; the yolk and the white. Last but not least, two teaspoons of vanilla extract! Mix together until well combined! Our mixtures are ready. We have our wet ingredients and our dry ingredients. Now, pour all of the wet ingredients into the dry. Mix together until all of the dry ingredients are incorporated into the wet. Oh yeah!! Now pour the batter into the pan, I'm using a 9 x 13 Inch pan. It's greased and I've lined it with a piece of parchment paper at the bottom so it won't stick. Use your spatula to get all the batter, 'Cause the more batter the better! [Cheesy wink] [Laughing] Cake is ready to bake!
Heat your oven to 325 degrees and bake for about 35 to 40 minutes. Or until your cake tester inserted comes out clean. Once your cake has baked give it plenty of time to cool, and now we're gonna make some cake balls! I'm really excited because we're using a new technique that we've never used before, This technique makes cake balls that are very moldable It's great for if your making a little cake pop that may have an untraditional shape. First step, cut your cake into 4 to 6 sections And place 'em in your stand mixer. Make sure your stand mixer has got a paddle attachment. And a little bite for me! (Ro humming while chewing cake) One more! Ok (While chewing) Mix together on a low speed Let it mix for about 3 minutes. We want a really crumbly cake. (Ro singing) And mix it up and mix it up and mix it up! Now is where you usually add frosting, or in the past we've used cream cheese But today, we're going to be adding ganache. And the ganache that I'm making today is super easy and quick You actually make it in the microwave Just measure half a cup of cream into a heat safe measuring cup Because we're gonna put it in the microwave for 1 minute. Take your cream out of the microwave and while it's still hot add enough chopped chocolate till it reaches one cup. If any fall on the counter, little snacks for you. And let this sit for one minute. Then, mix together. Continue to stir untill it looks like beautiful, shiny chocolate. Now pour into the mixing bowl. Mix together again on a low speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Our cake ball dough is now ready and you have to check it out Look at this consistency. Oh ooh ooh ooh It's a little wily that's ok I'm using a little ice cream scoop so that all of the balls are the same size Using your hand, roll into a ball and pack tight. Once you've got a cake ball, take your thumb, press down in the center, and then pinch all around the edges Pinch pinch pinch Just like this geode right here they have these deep cavities So the deeper you want to make your cake ball the better Keep doing this and make as many as you'd like. Cake balls are shaped, it's time to chill Pop these in the refrigerator for 1 hour Once the cake balls have chilled, Its time to attach our lollipop sticks over here, I have some lollipop sticks, a piece of foam, and some melted chocolate. Take a cake ball, and a stick, gonna dip just the end into the melted chocolate, and then stick in towards the bottom Try to press the lollipop stick about 2/3 of the way in. Now place it back on the tray upside down. Do this to the rest of the cake balls, and we'll let them chill, one more time in the fridge. Our cake pops have chilled, now it's time to dip them. Because they're shaped like a bowl, scoop a little bit of chocolate in there, mix it around, then pour it back out so that it coats the inside, and now, dip the whole thing Gently tap the lollipop stick on top of the bowl letting the excess chocolate drip off. Then, place your dipped cake pop upright, into a styrofoam block. All of our cake pops are dipped, give them about ten minutes to completely set and dry, before... ...we decorate!!! To get our gems to stick, I am using brown royal icing, I just put into a piping bag, with a number 2 tip at the end. Pipe a thin layer in the center. Place some bigger sugar gems in the middle of the pop, then work your way up the side, placing smaller gems toward the top. There you have it! Now do this to the rest of your cake pops. You can use any color of sugar gem that you'd like These are already starting to look like geodes, but I wanted to add this inner white layer. To achieve this look we're using white sparkling sugar and a little bit of gold sugar. Pour in all of the white sparkling sugar, and one tablespoon of our gold sugar. Your cake pops will be on fleck. [giggles] Take a cake pop, pipe a thin layer using the white royal icing, all around the outside of your sugar gems. Now turn the cake pop upside down And...Faceplant But gently, you can kinda roll gently all the way around, picking up the sugar. [gasp] I love it! Tadaaaaa! Here are the geode cake pops that we made today, Using the nerdy nummies chocolate cake recipe They turned out so cute! I made a bunch of pops today, but these were my favorites of each individual color. I love decorating these because they're all a little different and unique, they have different crevices, they have different sparkles, I just love geodes I hope you guys do too. I'm gonna be taking pictures and posting the recipe on, rosannapansino.com, facebook, instagram, and twitter. So you can check it out there, and if you guys make these cake pops, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations! It just makes me happy! It makes my day! If you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below, And ill do my best to make it happen. All right, thanks again you guys! Buh-bye. And now i get to eat one for me! [Bites down, clearly enjoying] Mm Mm [smacks table with hand] Its so good. This ganache takes the cake ball to a new level. This is SO GOOD! [Nerdy Nummies theme song plays.] 
Hey guys, it's Ro I want to make an update video because I have a bunch of things going on I wanted to keep you in the loop and I have a big announcement for those of you Who follow me on Snapchat,  Instagram stories and Twitter you may have already seen this but I really want to make a video I just got back from Chicago and I was in Chicago because I was attending the international home and housewares show if you guys aren't familiar with this convention. It is a foodie's dream It has every kitchen gadget and appliance that you could ever think of I was basically in Heaven. Ro: Look at this cake! I got to give a cooking demo on the main stage. I taught how to make fudgy brownies from the nerdy Nummies cookbook. Ro: hope you guys enjoyed it now thanks for coming out!I had so much fun! And I was also hanging out at the Wilson booth to make the big announcement! Many of you know that I love Wilton. I am a huge fan of them I have been using their baking products since I was a little kid and a couple years ago We partnered together and made over 23 videos on YouTube and now we are partnering together in a bigger way for my very first baking line! Woo! Yay, yay, yay, yay, I am so excited. This is like a dream come true over the years I've gotten so many requests from you to make baking merchandise And that's something that I really wanted to do but I wanted to wait until I could do it, right It's really important to me to make Quality things that I trust and there was no better partner to do that with than with Wilton. Even in my very first episode of Nerdy Nummies I was using Wilson icing! the products aren't out yet but they are going to come out at the end of summer and august so as soon as they're out I'll let you know if You want more details you can go to Wilton.com/RosannaPansino so soon as the lines online or in-store You'll know they're first, but I'm also going to tell you I'm going to tell you on every social Media platform And I'll make a video on YouTube I'm just so glad that this is out here because I'm not good at keeping secrets And I have been working on this for over a year or so. I can like relax now now. I want to give you guys a little sneak peek now remember This is only a few of the products. I made a ton So, the products that I made are ones that didn't exist that I wanted to exist But I was like why don't these exist?
This should be something! And then the other ones are ones that did exist, But like I made them better. The first sneak peak are of these custom silicone Molds, you guys know I love silicone molds We have Nerdy Nummies gummies, 8 and 16-bit heart and of there's also one with a bunch of little gems. I really love these molds because they're so versatile you can make so many yummy treats in here You can make little mini brownies cakes Candy chocolates hard candies But you can also make non-food items you can make Crayons or custom little fauss bombs How cute I also made a bunch of edible candies and sprinkles They're so cute or 8-bit hearts, and they are delicious their little icing candies The next week peak are these custom? Oh! Solid Color aluminum Line Cupcake liners I really wanted a solid color Cupcake liner that had some aluminum in there so that when your cupcakes are baking the oils from the case or whatever treat You're making won't bleed through and distort the outside color and you're the only aluminum lined cupcake liners I could find have really cool prints and designs on them Rainbow and Sprinkles, which we're super cute And if I just wanted to make a basic color lined cupcake it didn't exist And I added these cute little phrases and hidden little messages on the bottom like life is what you bake it Cheers! Treat yourself. Har har har. I also made some baking tools I made a cookie stamp [in] the end some spatulas. This is the mini spatula It has a little 16 bit pixelated hearts on it. Aw! And when you pull off the top to clean there's a hidden message I can't show you, it's hidden. And I also can't get this off. Ta daaa! The different Spatulas have different hidden messages underneath And I really love this cookie stamp because I wanted to make making smart cookies easier And I love these because all you do is go out the dough Sting a bit and then bake them and fill in the details with frosting it's super easy It's like filling in a coloring book, [but] then you can eat it so it's better now laughing The last thing I'm going to show you are these little cake testers. I made a smart cookie And a little pixelated heart they are to check if your cake is done All you need with you is poke it into your cake in the oven and pull it out and if nothing sticks It's ready! I really love cake testers because they're longer than a toothpick so your hand isn't getting so close to the cake and if you have A deeper cake these will do the trick. Alright that does it for a quick sneak peek of a few of the items I'll make another video when all of the items are out I hope you enjoyed it now for the next update.

Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy dummies! Today, we have a very special guest, it's leen! You guys! Hi! I'm so exited to be here! Oh my gosh! I am so excited that you are here.  She is super talented.  I'm gonna put her links all down below. I am a huge fan! [Colleen] I'm a huge fan!
[Ro] I have been watching your videos for years. She can sing. "By the way, by the way, you do things to my body..." She's got comedy skills [Miranda] "And I don't wha- tinkles and dingl-" Wait, ok...what are you...? What are you doing? [Ro] You have a Netflix series now...
[Colleen] Oh, stop Stop, stop! Oh, oh! If you guys haven't seen the Netflix series, it came out last year It's called "Haters Back Off". That's the name of the series. And we're celebrating today because I heard you're getting season two.
[Colleen] I'm so excited! Yes, we're already writing season two, I'm so exited!! Now, today I wanted to make something from the Netflix series. Yes! I feel like the most iconic food was that really cool foot popsicle. Yes! The Froze Toes! I ate so many of these on set and they made me so sick and they tasted horrible. So I'm so excited to make one that tastes good! [Miranda] "Real good!" Today we are making one, it's not gonna be an actual popsicle, but it is gonna be a Froze Toes cookie pop. Let's get started! The recipe that we are making today is a vanilla almond sugar cookie recipe. And the things you will need will be: 3 cups of all purpose flour, 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 3/4 cup of almond  meal, 2 eggs, 2 sticks of salted butter at room temperature, 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and an eighth teaspoon of salt. Then to decorate, you will need: Some pink gum balls, a foot shaped cookie cutter, popsicle sticks, light blue royal icing with a number 3 tip. Now let's put it all together! The first step to making these cookies is: in a medium bowl, we're gonna whisk together our dry ingredients. I'm gonna pour in nutmeg, boom. [Colleen] Oh, you left some in.
[Ro] Oh, uh-oh. Uh-oh. Baking powder, salt. Colleen, will you pour in the flour, and almond meal? I can do it. Oh my gosh. Success! [Ro] I just noticed your purple nails match your purple sweater!
[Colleen] I know I need- Oh, they do kind of, huh? [Colleen] Oh, look! And your, like the pink on the-
[Ro] (mouthing) Me too!
*I love fangirl Ro You have like the pinky on the kitties. We're all matching. We match! [Colleen] I'm dumping this in!
[Ro] Pretty cool. [Ro] Then whisk together 'til well combined and then we're gonna set it off to the side The next step is creaming together the butter and the sugar [Ro] Yeah! Just put 'em in a medium bowl
[Colleen] Plop! [Ro] And we left the butter out at room temperature so it's soft. It's a little sticky, but it makes it easier to cream. Then, using a hand mixer mix together until it's light and fluffy So, now we're going to add the eggs, one at a time But Ro, I want you to go first and I want you to teach me how to do this correctly. Ok, this is the one-handed egg crack So you go, "crack, and then twist" [Colleen] Ok, ready?
[Ro] You got this, you got this Crack, twist! Ah! I did it! Add "baker" to the list of things of talents you've got: One-handed egg-crack! [Colleen] I'm so impressed with myself!
[Ro] I'm like- I'm, like, really proud of you! [Ro] Here, we can rinse this off...
[Colleen] I know, I'm like covered in eggs [water running] [Ro] I found this cookie jar, I'm in love with this, at Target [Colleen] So cool! [Ro] They had a little hippo...I was in love with him If hippos were nice, I would have one as a pet. [Ro] Mix it up, mix, mix, mix, mix!
[Colleen] Mix! And add our extracts Colleen, you wanna grab those? Oh, I have never wanted to do anything more in my life. Give me a double pour, pour it in there Ready, three, two, one! Ro : Oh, yeah!
Colleen: We got some splashes on happening here! Alright girl, you can mix this up one more time! We're doing great! This is the fun part because we're going to put together our dry ingredients and our wet ingredients. I'm going to be mixing on a low speed and you're gonna just slowly keep pouring in. So it's like a little, constant waterfall [Colleen] Mmm...
[Ro] Yeah [Ro] Keep going! Oh, this is great! This is great!
[Colleen] What a beautiful waterfall! Now that our doughs ready, we're going to chop it in half and then form it into little discs! [Colleen] Uhhg!
[Ro] Just eyeball it, doesn't have to be perfect. [Colleen] Kinda looks like a brain [Ro] I'll pick up one of the sides of our dough brain And then we're just gonna shape it into a disc *Ro makes cute boop noises while slapping the dough* and then we wrap it up tight! [Ro] And I'll come this way And you do the top, and I'll do the other one. Now pop these in the fridge for one hour minimum. Our dough is ready to be rolled out but first, I'm gonna teach you to do a little baking flare. [Colleen] Okay.
[Ro] So I like to just pull this, and just pull it up! An-and the dough will flip and the goal is to get it to land right here. Mine's gonna hit that camera That's okay! One.. two, three! I did it! 
Hey guys, it's Ro! Today, I'm hanging out with my friend MatPat! Mat: Hey! Ro: You guys know him, but if you are new to the channel, I'll be putting his links down below. Ro: So go check out his channel show him some love and subscribe. Mat: Thank you! I'm glad to be back for another Ro: Mhmm. Mat: Seven course meal this time. Yeah, yummy food vs.. Real food.  Ro: Yes! It's gonna be round two. I hope you brought your appetite. Mat: I hear that this one's slightly more extreme than last time. Ro: And again Ro: I had my friends go out and they got a gummy food and a real food and one of us will get a gummy food and one of us will get the real food. but I don't know what they got I apologize in advance if This wasn't the seven course meal that you were hoping I well I came Hungry either way so whatever you put in front of me. I'll probably just dig in alright ready for the first dish I am and I'm noticing that I have a stick outside of my plate again last time that happened in gummy food versus real food Part. You know it was that like nasty corn going gummy. You got a corn gun. That was not good You think this is it the cornet note would be an amazing lack of creativity on the part of your friend alright Are you ready for the first dish first course one two three? Oh, that's so fun. This is adorable. Oh wow Like a multi pound gummy, and I got the real one. Okay? Oh? This is great No, this is amazing like watermelon. It has a little bit of a watermelon flavor. Yeah, but I need a bite It was really ready, okay. Yeah slice into it hold it just Go don't have to take a bite. I just can't I don't have time for this right just do it, okay, man This is an enormous gummy So you can't even what it's slowly yet slowly bending my question is why is it even on a stick because everyone likes to eat Their watermelon slices on sticks Roe come on. I like that you did like the tiniest buy it possible Is it good this thick we were out of ten they're gonna be ten out of ten more food more food? Number two there we go I have to apologize Matt. I didn't polish my silver It's not it's it's not your fault. It's the help around here. It's so hard to get good help around here 303 oh I got green beans and you've got it says Cassius Oh it's kept wait this cowboy cactus really I'm your canvas cubbies. I've never had cactus, and I actually want to try it I I'm really excited about those green beans right I thought who okay? You have to try one of these - is it flavored like captain. Let's see, okay I mean they're adorable look at how cute these are oh Sweet doesn't really have a flavor actually here wait hold up it has it has a description on the back the box Okay, where do you think ride off into the sunset with these cute little cat died full prickly pear flavor Hmm so prickly pear is not super flavorful huh no full of it I have never had cactus in my entire life you guys and this is a person That's happening right now, and I'm sneaking a bite. Okay, of course, please I want to know what cactuses like why do you taste like? Like it it's good. Yeah. I really like it's really good. Yeah, even two winners now. I know I'm There being nice to me because I'm the guest yeah that only means that at some point during these courses my side just goes downhill In a hurry course number three here. We go what Joe oh? You're the side dogs I can't believe they have a gummy ha, that's surely this which ones go which one's coming I Was gonna say the neon orange, but doesn't tip it off at all, okay. Do you think it's sweet or anything? It's a friend gummy. I would say with ninety percent certainty that it's gonna be sweet I have yet to really cross a savory gummy. Okay. Let me try oh It's me take me out to the ball game Yeah, it's like maybe mango or cherry or something a cohort area or something Yeah, I had one of those but oh No, I love me some hot dogs So I will say I used to be grossed out by mustard Uh-huh cuz I don't know I was I was a ketchup man. Well. Don't up. Yeah I was gonna catch up on the hot dog man like what's this, but recently I'd become a mustard guy So they say that when you start liking mustard on your hot dogs. That's when you've truly grown up Apparently I grew up like earlier this year gummi versus real. Let's go look Pete pasta pasta. No wait. What do you got? Salsa salsa getti this little duck Justine and I tried candy from Mexico Yeah, this little duck would often appear on the spicy candies that we did not like So I have a feeling that this is gonna Be pretty spicy So is salsa spaghetti a real dish or just something that like the candy manufacturer made up I know. I don't think this is actually a real food either. Gummy food and made-up food made based on the gummies New theory coming up. That's a food Thanks for munching. Oh this. Also says. It's a watermelon oh yeah cuz when I think salsa and things that I want to eat salsa with I totally think spaghetti and Watermelon makes perfect sense. Oh I get it. It's watermelon noodles, and then look. I have a little sauce here. Oh, oh Great weird zombie candy. Where wow this is okay here. We go. Just team taught me how to do this. Oh? Girls, it's brown dope I don't understand this. This is so bizarre and weird and gross Yours looks like your best teriyaki sauce or soy sauce on I know that look it looks like it's brown Mmm does it look like spaghetti to you. I totally see the resemblance 100% you know Here I am making fun of it, maybe it's gonna be delicious It's gonna be great there You go look at the taste over the gums look out stomach here comes yo, yum, yum I wasn't expecting you Mind if I dip in its sour and savory it's like a sour watermelon, but gumming with my savory Sauce on top. Yeah. Oh I Don't even know what's else you're making. That's what it makes me deal Here, would you like some salsa spaghetti okay? I'm going to try one little bite. Maybe I help my taste Why is the spaghetti so small? Is someone chopped up their spaghetti? Mister states like salt office right it really does The the thing that doesn't work about this is that the spaghetti is so soft. I just I take a salsa soup well You know what that means? vibe Preach it girl sing it big girl. Yeah, yes I Like that you also are your own backup course oh, yeah What's going on is it back to normal now Okay, we are at round five. We were told to keep our eyes closed because apparently whatever's under the trays couldn't fit So we'll just have to open up Ready yeah one two three look And actually if you do look it the bottles might not be the same size But the actual like amount of stuff to consume. Is that the exact same height that's impressive it also stands up on its own This is cubby. It's like rock hard take a grip in that's solid oh They're like similar and wait Please continue shaking them though, so that way when you open up your coat Let's crack open do I do it do it hmm. Okay? You go. I want to try it Is this like toffee a gummy this is like half top I do Mississippi York oh yeah, please do oh Yeah, no super sticky yeah, I might have to watch this do you have to drink the regular coconut?

I Can do it oh my gosh You rock you rock that well done Yeah, let's coke why still prefer this second right.

Kronk loves to cook. He's always making something, and in the movie, he makes Spinach Puffs, so I thought, "Today, let's make Kronk's Spinach Puffs!" Let's get started! The things you will need will be: 2 Cups of Frozen Chopped Spinach; 1 Small Onion, Diced; 1/2 Cup of Feta Cheese; 1/2 Cup of Ricotta Cheese Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum! 1 Egg Yolk; 1 Tablespoon of Vegetable Oil; 2 Cloves of Garlic, Chopped; And 1/2 a Teaspoon of Salt. Those are the ingredients for the Filling, and then, for the outside puff, we're gonna be using Puff Pastry Sheets. Our tool will be One Square Cookie Cutter. Now let's put it all together! *sitar music* The first thing that we're gonna do to prepare our filling, is take our Spinach, Onions, Garlic, and Oil over to the Stove. Turn your flame to Medium-High heat. Add the Oil to your pan, and wait for it to shimmer. That means it's hot. Then add your Onions and let them sweat for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are translucent. You don't want them to brown. Add your chopped Garlic, cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Then add your frozen chopped Spinach, and cook until the liquid is gone. Turn off the heat, and remove from the stove! We've got our Spinach Mixture right off the stove, over here in a bowl, and now we are gonna combine our cheeses and egg yolk. I'm gonna put in the Ricotta, and our Feta cheese, and our Egg Yolk. I'm just using the Jiggle Method. Then bring over the Yolk! Then using a spatula, I'm just gonna mix everything together. Once mixed, now I'm gonna add my Spinach Mixture. And it's the perfect time. By the time you have the cheeses mixed up, the Spinach has cooled down just a little bit. It doesn't need to be cold, but you don't want it right off the stove. Mix together until Well-Combined! Oh my gosh, I LOVE doing food. Our mixture is complete, and now we're gonna make our Pastry Squares, so I'm gonna set this off to the side. I've got these Puff Pastry Sheets over here, and these come frozen, so you're gonna wanna let it defrost in your fridge for a few hours before you work with it. And over here, I've got a Cutting Board, a little bit of Flour, I'm gonna sprinkle it down first. And then... *claps* we're gonna open these up! Oh, I got a coupon! COUPON!!! Oh my gosh, I'm a real winner. Just gonna give it a gentle roll with my Rolling Pin, to smooth out the fold lines, to make it look like one sheet. Take your square Cookie Cutter, and now we're gonna cut out 9 Squares. Each of these sheets makes 9, so you can make 18 of these today! Remove the excess dough, and place your little squares onto a Baking Sheet lined with a piece of Parchment Paper. We've got our Spinach Mixture over here. Little bit of Egg Wash, which is 1 Egg, mixed with a little bit of Salt. And our Pastries over here. Time to assemble our Spinach Puffs! The first thing that you're gonna do is take your little square, turn it like this so it looks like a diamond, and I'm gonna take a little Baking Brush and just brush off any excess Flour. Take a small spoonful of Spinach Filling, placing it in the middle, towards the top. Take a little bit of Egg Wash, and I'm gonna brush it on the bottom, like a V. Now, take the corners, and you're gonna bring 'em to the middle, around the filling, and pinch 'em together! And you're gonna wanna pinch 'em hard, because while these are baking, Pastry Puffs like to *pfffsh*! Now you're gonna do this to the rest of your Spinach Puffs. Here are all of our Spinach Puffs. I popped these into the Freezer for about 10 Minutes to chill, because Puff Pastry cooks the best, when it's really cold! We are gonna bake these at 400°F for 15 Minutes, and, if you are baking 2 Trays of these, you are gonna switch them halfway through. If it's on a Top-Rack, and a Bottom-Rack, halfway through, SWITCH! Ta-Daaaaaa!!! Here are "Kronk's Spinach Puffs" that we made today! From the movie "Emperor's New Groove," I absolutely love that movie! These smell so good! If you like Spinach Dip, you may love Spinach Puffs. Yum! Yom-yom-yom-yom-yom! I'll be taking lots of pictures of these and posting them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr. And if you guys make these, please take a picture and send it to me, I love seeing your Baking Creations! I get a big kick out of it, makes my day! And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know! Leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen! Thanks again you guys, Buh Bye! Okay, it's time to eat one of these! *crunch* So good and flaky, and I love it! [Nerdy Nummies Theme, link in description]

Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! I got so many requests from you to make something Spider-Man-themed, in honor of the new Spider-Man movie coming out: Spider-Man Homecoming. I am really excited because I love all the Marvel characters, especially Spider-Man. In the comic series, the dessert that Peter Parker really loves is his Aunt May's cherry pie. So, I wanted to make a cake that was themed around that. So today, we are going to be making a Spider-Man cherry pie cake. Let's get started! The things you'll need will be: 2 cups of sugar, 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sour cream, 1 cup of oil, 3 eggs, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons of sweet dough flavor, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Then, between the cake layers, we're going to use 1 1/2 cups of cherry pie filling. Now, let's put it all together! *Shoots fake spiderwebs all over the place* First step, in a large bowl, add oil, sugar, sour cream, sweet dough flavor, vanilla extract, and 3 eggs. Then, whisk together until well combined. Now, in another large bowl, add your flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Then, give a quick whisk until well combined. *sings "do do" a few times* Both my wet and dry ingredients are ready. Pour your wet ingredients into the dry and mix together. A lot people ask me: "Hey Ro, how'd you get these muscles?" Oh Yeah That's my arm workout right there. Our cake batter is ready and now, I have a round 10-inch pan. It's greased and lined with a piece of parchment paper at the bottom so that the cake won't stick. Pour your batter into the pan. If you'd like a two layer cake, you can just stop here because after this cake bakes I'm going to cut it in half to make two layers. But if you'd like to make a four layer cake, make this cake recipe one more time. Now heat your oven to 350 degrees and bake this for about 1 hour. My two cakes have baked and have had plenty of time to cool. I cut each of them in half, giving me four cakes and leveled off the top. Now, it's time to assemble! I was hoping The Avengers would show up, but guess not this time. Okay! I have some vanilla buttercream frosting. Just cut the end, you don't need a tip. Frost a thin layer on top because our cake is very porous and we don't want it to absorb the cherry filling. Then, smooth and even out with a spatula. After you have a smooth, thin layer on top of the cake, pipe a dam all the way around and a dam is basically like a frosting fence. We're ready for cherry pie filling. Scoop in about 1/3. Come on, move around little cherries. This looks good enough to eat right now, but we have to finish it by adding our other layers. Pick up the next layer of the cake line it up, place on top, then very gently press it down to seal the edges. Repeat this process two more times. Frost, fence, and cherries. *Sings "Cherry glaze, cherry glaze"* Final assembly step: adding the top layer. Use the bottom side of the cake. Now, flip it right on top, gently press down. Now, pop your cake in the fridge for about 15-20 minutes to chill. Oh man, good thing I worked with the medicine balls. Oh yeah. And one, and two. After your cake has chilled, it is time to frost. In a little piping bag, I have some red buttercream frosting that we will use to frost the entire cake. I like to start at the top. I've also got my cake on a spinner. Whooooo! So it makes frosting a little bit easier. *Singing "do do" again* I'm all done frosting the cake. I just kept smoothing it till it was nice and even. Pop it in the refrigerator while we make some fondant decorations. The decorations are super easy. I made this Spider-Man logo in Photoshop. I put a link down below if you want to download that template or if you want to make your own, that is totally fine. I also printed it out onto a piece of cardstock paper, so it would be a little bit more durable. This is a Spider-Man logo from the new movie and we just need to cut it out. Once you've made your stencil, roll out your fondant. To prevent sticking, I've got a little bit of powdered sugar. Roll out your fondant large enough to fit the stencil shapes. Place your stencil on top and cut out the shapes. *Creepily sings "The Itsy Bitsy Spider*
Okay, I'll stop now. Time to pipe! We're going to pipe some spider web details to look like Spider-Man's suit. In this little piping bag, I've got some black royal icing fitted with a number 4 tip. First step: pipe a straight line up and down. Then, turn your cake and pipe a second line again, making an X. Then, pipe two more lines diagonally between. We have our base lines on top, now follow them down the side of the cake. It's looking good! We've got all of our little base lines. I'm gonna give it a spin, so you guys can check it out. I've also piped little dots all over the cake for the inner webbings, just kind of eyeballing where I want them to be, and now, all you need to do is connect the dots with a little bit of a bend, that kind of looks like a happy face like a *hmm*. On the top, we're gonna have two rows of inner webbing and on the sides, we're going to have three. Time for the final decoration! We're going to place our spider fondant logo on top. *boop* Our fondant has had plenty of time to harden. Listen! *taps legs together to show how hard they are* And the big legs... *giggles* Ta-da! Here is the Spider-Man-themed cherry pie cake that we made today. Let's take it for a spin! *Sings "do do" one last time* A big thank-you to you guys for suggesting something Spider-Man in honor of the new film,
Spider-Man: Homecoming. I am so excited because we have never made a cherry pie cake before. The cake tastes like the crust and it's just so amazing! And I also love that the decorations on this cake are very easy. I would say a beginner baker could achieve this look. Oh, we could just made the cake and then been like this: *Shoots webs onto the cake* And then, it would've been done, but I'm not Spider-Man. I'll be posting a bunch of pictures of the cake and the recipe on RosannaPansino.com, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. So you can check it out there, and if you guys make this cake, please take a picture and send it to me! I just love seeing your baking creations, it just makes me happy! It makes my day! If you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen. All right! Thank you guys! Buh-bye! Let's cut this open and have a piece. I'm just gonna have one piece. *gasps* It's beautiful! Okay, I'm gonna put it here. OH! OH! OH! Mmm, mmm, MMM, YES! Peter Parker, he likes cherry pies. That's his favorite dessert, but if he had this cake. He'd be like, "wait a minute!" Aunt May, she'd be proud! 
Hey guys, it's Rome today, I'm hanging out with my friend, Justine, Hi,  you guys know Justine I'm gonna be putting her links down below Go check them out show her some love subscribe where making a bunch of videos together lately. I'm so happy She's back from travel, and I thought let's celebrate by making something that we both love. This is a hint pumpkin spice Lattes are in season. It. Just isn't fall without them. We both love coffee, I am so happy right now , and and you really like pumpkin spice Oh my goodness. I love pumpkin spice any pumpkin Nobody more ready than us we got pumpkins everywhere so I thought we've got to make a themed baked treat I've made a pumpkin cupcake, but never a pumpkin spice latte Cupcake with you know caffeine did we just dump this in yeah, we just pour this in a baking tray, okay? and  see what happens the things you'll need to make these cupcakes will be 1 and 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup unsalted butter 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup hot milk 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup pumpkin puree 1/4 cup sweetened condensed milk 1 large egg 2 teaspoons instant espresso 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground clove 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger 1/2 TSP ground nutmeg a teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract And 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder then for the whipped cream frosting you'll need 2 cups of heavy cream Quarter cup of sugar and a decorate you'll need a decorating bag fitted with the number 2 D tip some pumpkin pie Spice and some green straws we need those classic Starbucks green straws first step to making these cupcakes Mixing together our wet ingredients in a bowl over here, so Justine you were in the hot milk. Oh watch out It's a little hot super hot the heat helps the instant espresso dissolve faster. Oh that smells good. This is like breakfast Should we just drink this and stop for the video? Oh, yeah, don't just? You know what we should do what not part of the recipe, but I feel like it couldn't hurt Just put a little bit of our pumpkin spice in there. Just like a little I'm doing you're gonna Do just be more delicious all right now whisk together until all of the espresso is dissolved This is the best morning ever. I'm having a lovely time this needs to be a perfume I would take a little bit of this and be like Alright now scoop in our pumpkin puree and all pour in the condensed milk Oh, yeah, that's good We set our wet ingredients off to the side And now we've got all of our dry ones right here in front of us and this right Here's the magic I went to the official Starbucks website And I looked at the ingredients for their PSL and we're gonna incorporate those ingredients into this recipe so it's gonna be very true to nature gosh It's just I need to take a little more charge just to think about it. Yeah, Oh Are we basic Ok I'm gonna start with the flour and you pour in the spice paste Ok don't spill them Justine because when you need it to taste right Whisk it up. Let's go Baking flare I like getting juggling knives and is not going well Now it's time to cream our butter and sugars our regular granulated sugar and brown sugar Which is so good remember you want your butter to be at room? Temperature because it'll be softer and just easier to cream all right here. We go Justine I just back up cuz I know what happens in my kitchen This is looking pretty good. We screen down the sides and now we're gonna put in an egg and some vanilla extract. That's right You're gonna add the whole egg here we go It's so good it does not taste good to just eat plain though. This is very strong I wouldn't suggest drinking it but smelling it and adding it to a batter Yo, now just mix together till well combined I think you can do this, but remember low speed low to medium oh I just get so nervous so we have our dry ingredients our butter mixture and our wet ingredients Now what do we do we are gonna combine these together? So you add a third of the dry? Mix it up half of the wet mix it up second third of the drive mix it up second half of the wet mix it Up and last of the dry mix it up and don't forget to scrape down the sides between each addition. Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, look at that Look at that Beautiful our batter is looking and smelling so good. You know yeah Now we scoop it into the cupcake tray yes in front of me I have a cupcake tray lined with a bunch of little paper liners And this recipe makes 12 cupcakes so it's perfect for a dozen And I'm using a little ice cream scoop fill each tray about two-thirds full I need maybe a spatula because I can't let this batter. Go to waste you guys just put love into this Okay, okay. Help me out here. Can you just like a little bit in there so we can taste it. Yeah, that's We need a HEPA that's that's he but oh that's a big bully yeah Never just a little furnace This is really good. I know this is my new favorite cupcake. How do we bake them, and then eat them? Oh, yeah, we gotta bake them. It's a preheat your oven to 375 and then bake these for 16 minutes That is 16 long minutes that we're gonna have to wait. That's too long, but it's okay I Guess we put them in the oven now Where's the oven? Oh? It's right while the cupcakes are baking Justine. We are gonna make homemade whipped cream to top these cupcakes with because I'm so good a lot of times when you order a PSL it comes with little whipped cream on top just pour in the heavy cream and sugar into a big mixing bowl We're gonna be using an electric hand mixer start on a low speed work your way up to a high medium You'll whip for about three to five minutes, but you want to whip until you get a medium peak We've got our cupcakes, which have had plenty of time to cool We've got our icing our pumpkin spice and little straws that we cut down This is my favorite part time to decorate the decoration is super simple so just grab your little piping bag And then we're gonna make two little swirls and pull away, then do this to the rest of your cupcakes I also want to note that we are using pumpkin pie spice to sprinkle on top not Cinnamon a lot of people think it's cinnamon, but all on the Starbucks drink It's pumpkin pie spice so we could be baristas final decoration step We're gonna add a little Starbucks straws, and we didn't drink this or eat it both.

Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! I got so many requests from you guys to make something Dino themed and I thought, OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH! I have so many ideas!!!!! Yes! I even have a Dino shirt. They're pink little dinosaurs, and they have little party hats on them. Today, we're gonna be making a Dino fossil footprint cookie. This recipe is super fun because we get to use Dino toys to make them. Let's get started! The things you will need will be: 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, 1 egg , 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter, quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon, quarter teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of baking powder, two teaspoons of cinnamon extract, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, some extra ground cinnamon for decoration with a little paintbrush, and a three inch round circle cookie cutter. And then of course, our dinosaurs. We're gonna be using their footprints,  so if you have some toy dinosaurs, perfect. Now, let's put it all together! I love this cinnamon cookie recipe. If you like snickerdoodles, you might also love this recipe. It's very similar in taste. It is delicious. The first step to making them is combining our dry ingredients into a medium bowl and whisking together. Add your flour, salty, saltay! Cinnamon, and baking powder. Whisk together until well combined and set off to the side. Now, in a larger mixing bowl, cream together your butter and sugar. Mix together until light and fluffy. Now, add your egg and extract. This smells so good! I love it. I love it, I love it, I love it. Then, on a low speed, mix together until well combined. Our wet ingredients are ready, our dry ingredients are ready, now pour all of the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Then again, using a hand mixer, mix together until well combined. I kept mixing the dough until it started to come together, and I can actually hold it in my hand. Wrap it up in some food safe plastic wrap. Oh my gosh, sometimes I wish I had some raptor claws And I could just, like, [slashing sound]. Wrap it up tight, now pop the dough in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, but you can also leave it overnight. Our dough has chilled, it's time to roll it out, but first, a little bit of baking flair. I always see bartenders do all that fancy bartending flair, so I wanted to invent baking flair, so I've been doing it here, but now I want to up my game. I'm gonna try to do it one-handed. [laugh] This may be a disaster. One-handed, blindfolded, baking flair! 1, 2, 3! GO! [dramatic music] [fireworks] Oh my gosh, it worked! Take a pinch of flour, sprinkle it down in front of you, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop! And, make it rain, make it rain, make it rain! A little bit of flour, make it rain! [weird Ro noises] [more weird Ro noises] I'm in a good mood! [laugh] Roll your dough out, about a quarter-inch thick. Now, take your circle cookie cutter, press down, give it a jiggle, then bring it over here to a cookie sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper. Cut out as many cookies as you can. You can fit about six to eight cookies per cookie tray. These are almost ready to bake, but first, we've got to decorate using our Dino toys, I've been waiting for this all day. So I'm very excited! Using the feet, press down into the cookie. A little Dino footprint! Boom! [explosion] Boom! [explosion] Ahhh! Another name before a dinosaur foot fossil imprint is called a 'trace fossil'. Dino facts! I'm gonna switch it up and use some footprints from my little triceratops! Rawr! Hehehehe! Fun fact, my love for dinosaurs got me a boyfriend. I made a paleontologist joke, and then, my crush was like, 'Oh wow, you're pretty like, dorky,' and I was like [Ro sounds] and then, boom. I had a boyfriend. Cool story. Thanks Ro. Yeah. Last step, before we bake, using a small paintbrush, fill in our Dino footprints with cinnamon. Our cookies are now ready to bake. Heat your oven to 350 degrees and bake for about ten minutes. Ta-da! Here are the Dino fossil footprint cookies that we made today! I really love this recipe because it's easy mode, if you are in the mood to marathon, or have friends over to watch any dinosaur themed anything, you have an easy to make recipe handy! I'll be taking pictures and posting this recipe on rosannapansino.com, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, so you can check it out there. And if you guys make these cookies, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy, it makes my day. Especially when it's dinosaur themed because I love dinosaurs. I've had little toy dinosaurs on the set of Nerdy Nummies since the very first Nerdy Nummies episode. They're right over there! They're best friends! Usually they're piggybacking, but right now, they're playing hide and seek. I hope you enjoyed the recipe and if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright, thanks again, bye-bye! And now I get to have one! [Ro takes a bite] MMMMMMM MMMMMMMMHMMMMMM [Nerdy Nummies theme song]

Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies. Today I wanted to make something with the ball pan from my baking line. We have made a whole bunch of treats using this pan before, you may remember. We have made an Earth cake. There's a picture of that right here on the box. We also made a death star cake. So today, I thought what would be a fun cute themed treat to make with this pan? And some of you may have already guessed. Today, we're going to make a cake inspired by Pokemon - a Poke-Ball cake. If you're interested in using the pan that I'm using, I'll put a link down below. Let's get started! The recipe that we're making today is a super easy mode white cake recipe. The things you'll need will be cake flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, vegetable oil, milk, some eggs, baking powder, salt, almond extract, and vanilla extract. Now, let's put it all together! The first step to making our cake is measuring out our dry ingredients And pouring them into a large mixing bowl. Start with your sugar. We'll need 2 cups. Now add two cups plus two tablespoons of flour. One cup of cake flour. For our baking powder, 2 and 1/2 teaspoons. Lastly, add one and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Whisk together till everything's well combined and set off to the side. Now, we are going to measure out and pour all of our wet ingredients into a large bowl, starting with vegetable oil. Measure 3/4 cup. Now measure in 2 and a half cups of milk and three egg whites. Lastly, add one teaspoon of almond extract and one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract. Mix all of the wet ingredients together 'till it's well incorporated. Now pour all of the wet ingredients into the dry and mix together. You don't need an electric hand mixer. It's not electric! *singing* Now our batter is ready, our pans are greased. You can use butter or spray them with a little baking spray, and if you haven't used this pan before, we bake them with these little silicone rings right underneath. They stabilize them so that isn't like this in the oven - WOAH! I also like to place them on a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper. Evenly divide your batter between the two pans, almost all the way to the top. Now, it's time to bake. Heat your oven to 325 degrees We are going to slow bake these cakes for 1 hour and 30 minutes. About halfway through baking, rotate your pans so that your cakes will evenly bake. Once your cakes have baked, give them plenty of time to cool I've already leveled the tops of my cake, and using a small serrated knife I'm going to cut off the top of one of the cakes. This creates a flat surface for the cake to sit on. Now pipe a thick layer of buttercream on top of the cake. Then, smooth it out flat using a small offset spatula Grab the top of the cake and place on the top and gently press down to seal the two cakes together. Fill in some extra icing around the side. Then using a small offset spatula, Smooth out the frosting. Now, time to frost. I'm using buttercream icing in a piping bag with a number 1A tip at the end. If you're using my tip line, that's the teal colored one. Frost white buttercream starting at the bottom, working our way up to the middle. Try to leave a gap in the center Then, we'll switch to red buttercream. Place your spatula down and gently spin around, making your cake look really smooth and even. The white and red icing is smoothed out We've also left a space all the way around the middle for the black buttercream frosting. Pipe a smooth line all the way around the middle of the ball cake. Once the cake is frosted, pop it in the fridge to chill while we make our fondant decoration. The decoration is super simple. We're making the Poke-Ball button which is white and black. You'll need three circle cookie cutters. Each one is a little smaller than the next. Sprinkle a little powdered sugar down. Make it rain, make it rain! Roll out your black fondant. Using your largest circle cutter, cut out a piece. Now, roll out your white fondant using your medium and small circle cutter. Cut out one of each. Now, using water and a small paintbrush, paint the backside of the medium piece. Place it in the center. Oh, I love this. It's creating a little depth, little texture. We've got a real Poke-Ball button. Paint the smaller piece, and attach again right in the middle. Let this dry for a few minutes before you place it onto the cake. Taa-daaaaaaa! Here is the Poké-Ball themed cake that we made today using the round sphere pan from my baking line. This cake recipe was made specifically for the ball pan because it's the perfect amount of batter. I'll be posting the recipe and a bunch of pictures on RosannaPansino.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. You can check it out there, and if you guys make this cake, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy. It makes my day, and if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know. Leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright, thanks again, you guys. Bye-bye! *finger wave*

Hey guys, it's Ro welcome to another Nerdy Nummies I got so many requests from you guys to make something from Riverdale and specifically the iconic milkshake from Pop's Diner so that is exactly what we're gonna be doing today. Today, we are gonna be making a homemade strawberry milkshake and we're making everything from scratch other than the ice cream I am super excited because I absolutely love this series Riverdale and if you're not familiar with the series, this is like an Archie comic Meets a whodunit, and they had a baby, and I'm in love with it I've seen every single episode. Okay now without further ado… Let's get started! To make our homemade whipped cream you'll need 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Then for our milk shake you'll need half a cup of milk and 2 cups of vanilla ice cream To make our strawberry syrup you'll need 1 cup of water about 3 cups of fresh strawberries and one cup of sugar. Now let's put it all together and make some milkshakes! First step to making the milkshakes is making the homemade strawberry syrup. In front of me, I've got a cutting board a small cutting knife and a sauce pot. Start with your strawberries, cut off the tops and cut into fourths. Then just toss them all into the pot. After you've got all the strawberries chopped up and thrown in the pot, add your water and sugar. Now take your pot and a spatula over to the stove. Place the pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium high. Allow the strawberry mixture to come to a boil, then turn the heat to medium. Cook the strawberry mixture for 10 minutes stirring occasionally. Then turn off the heat on the stove and take your pot back to the baking station. Just took our strawberry mixture off the stove. Be careful, it's still very hot. Now pour all of it into a large strainer with a bowl underneath to catch all of the syrup. Delicious! Also using a spatula, just use it to move the strawberries around because we want to get out all the liquid. Once it's strained, set it off to the side. And now we're gonna make our whipped cream. To make the whipped cream you'll need a large mixing bowl I'm using an electric hand mixer, pour in all of the heavy cream and the sugar Now mix on a medium speed for about two to three minutes until stiff peaks start to form. Oh! Yummy, yummy yummy! I'm gonna put this in the fridge to keep it cool, and now we're gonna make a milkshake!  Oooh!!! All of our hard work is about to pay off. In a blender add 1/4 cup of our strawberry syrup, that we just made, half a cup of milk and two cups of vanilla ice cream. Oh my gosh, yaas! uuhh! Into the blender…               *sniff* Oh yeah! Mix it up and then pour into your milkshake glass. Add a little bit of whipped cream along the top. (in a sing-song tone) *doo doo* I'm just gonna make some circles. Woop Oh my gosh. This is so cute! And… No! No! No! It's too full! No! There was too much milkshake! Okay there. Oh. Oh no! Noooooo! And then for the final garnish, take a cute strawberry, make a little shit at the bottom of the strawberry. Be careful. Don't get your fingers and place it on the side of the glass. Noooo! And TADA! There you have it! Riverdale's strawberry milkshake, the milkshake from the iconic Pop's Diner. I really hope you guys enjoyed this recipe! Making homemade milkshakes is super easy and you can always replace ingredients. You can always switch up the different types of ice cream you're using or make a different homemade syrup. Whatever you'd like! I'll be posting a bunch of pictures and the recipe on RosannaPansino.com, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, so you can check it out there! If you guys make this milkshake or any other Pop Diner food, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your creations. It just makes me happy! It makes my day. If you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know. Leave me comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright, thanks again, you guys! Bye-bye! Nini. Mmmmm! Oh my berry strawberry! Mwah! Delicious! Bye love you all so much!!

Today we're gonna be making a salted caramel cupcake recipe (Yum!) The things you will need, will be : 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour; 1 cup of packed dark brown sugar; 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar; 1/2 cup of butter or 1 stick of butter; 1/2 cup of butter milk; 2 eggs; 1 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt; 1 teaspoon of baking powder; and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract Now let's put it a l together!!

Whisk together until well combined then we are going to set it off to the side Next in a large mixing bowl, we are gonna cream together our butter and sugars Then we are going to give it a good mix. I am using a hand mixer. Until it's light and fluffy Now add both of our eggs and vanilla extract and give them a big mix. Both of our mixtures are ready. And now pour all of your dry mixture in this bowl and mix it up. But you don't want to over mix as soon. As you can't see any more dry, STOP mixing! Add our butter milk. Mix together until everything is incorporated, but don't over mix. As soon as the butter milk has worked it's way in the batter... STOP!!!! Our caramel sea salt batter is ready, now it's time to scoop our cupcakes. Over here I've got a cupcake tray, line with a bunch of paper liners Scoop some batter and fill each cupcake about 2/3 full. This recipe makes 12 cupcakes. (All for me!) The cupcakes are ready to bake, we're gonna heat our oven to 350 degrees and bake this for 20 minutes While our cupcakes are baking, we are gonna be making some mermaid themed cupcake toppers out of fondant This part is totally optional, but i've got a little luster dust. We've got green, gold, and pink And you're gonna need a cookie cutter with a tail I didn't have a mermaid tail cookie cutter around the house So i thought, "Whale... what can I use? :/" Did you get it, cause it's a whale :D (Aha, I'm so funny!) First thing that we're gonna do to make this decoration, roll out our fondant And cut out a bunch of shapes into the fondant Then I'm gonna take my little fondant tool. Its got this small curves edge Press in a bunch of little imprints, to make the scales of the tail Now all of our tails cut out, I let them sit out for about 10 minutes to dry, to set And now I'm gonna be adding a little bit of shimmer For our Pink tails, I'm gonna be mixing a little bit of pink and a little bit of gold shimmer together And lightly brush the top of the fin For the Teal tails, I'm gonna be mixing a little bit of green and a little bit of gold Mix 'em together with a small paintbrush, and paint over the top To ice our cupcakes today, we are gonna be using a 2 tone frosting technique to look like waves I made some buttercream frosting and dyed some of it dark blue and some light blue And I scooped 'em into 2 plastic baggies Then over here I've got a large piping bag and an open star tip I'm gonna place the open star tip, down at the bottom of the bag, and then place 'em inside Once your cupcakes have baked and have plenty of time to cool. Now it is time for my favorite part... It's time to decorate! I got this cute little cupcake wrappers. They're sparkly and blue. (Heavenly sigh) And the top kinda looks like waves, like an ocean Frost the top to look like waves of an ocean All the way around the outside of the cupcake and then working my way in Cupcakes are frosted. This part is totally optional as well but I'm gonna be adding a little bit of shimmer on to the top to make our waves look wet RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN!!! RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN!!! RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN, RAIN!!! (I'm OK, guys...)

♪ Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! Today we are gonna be making something Valentine's Day themed. It is coming up soon, and I thought, "Hmmm..what would be a simple, easy treat to make?" 8-bit heart cookies! These cookies will be a great treat for anyone in your life who loves geek culture. I personally just love 8-bit and 16-bit hearts. I made a bunch of them in my baking line: Like this is a little cookie cutter. 8-bit hearts are just like cookies: the more you have, the better. Let's get started! The recipe that we're making today is a cinnamon sugar cookie recipe. The things you'll need will be: An 8-bit heart cookie cutter, 2 cups of all-purpose flour, ½ cup of butter at room temperature, 1 cup of sugar, 1 egg, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon extract, ¼ teaspoon of ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of baking powder. Then to decorate, we're using buttercream icing instead of royal icing. And I've dyed it black, red, and white. Place them into piping bags with #5 tips at the end for a little bit more control. Now, let's put it all together! Deet! First step to making these cookies: whisk together your dry ingredients in a medium bowl. So pour in the flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder. Then whisk together until well combined and set off to the side. Next step is creaming together our butter and sugar. Scoop all the butter into a large bowl, then add sugar. And, using an electric hand mixer on a medium speed, mix until light and fluffy. This usually takes about two to three minutes. This is what it should look like. Now add both of your extracts and the egg. Mix again until well combined. This is looking good. I'm gonna scrape it down using a spatula and then add our dry ingredients. Mmm! Once again using an electric hand mixer, mix together until well combined. Our cookie dough is looking good―smelling good. Now, time to chill! Divide your dough in half and wrap it up tight with some food-safe plastic wrap. Then, pop them in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes. The dough has chilled. I took one of them out, left the second one in the fridge to stay cool, and now we're gonna roll it out. But first, we gotta do some baking flair. [laughs] I- I don't even know what I just did. This is like a new trick. Our dough's out. Take a little bit of flour. Sprinkle it on top of your work surface so that the dough won't stick. [singsong voice] ♪ Tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee ♪ ♪ Just gonna warm it up ♪ ♪ Just a little bit ♪ 
♪ And it will start to roll ♪ Once your dough is rolled out, time to cut out our cookies. But before, I'm gonna take a little baking brush and just dust the flour off the top. Get it all off. Now, take your cookie cutter, place it on top of the dough, and press down. Boop! And give it a little jiggle. Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle! Then, I'm gonna pick it up and transfer it over to a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper so it won't stick. Now, cut out the rest of your cookies. Our cookies are now ready to bake. Heat your oven to 350 degrees and bake for 10 minutes. Once the cookies have baked, give them plenty of time to cool before you decorate. The reason you wanna wait is because if your cookie's still warm while you're icing, it's gonna melt your icing. Usually when I'm decorating cookies I use royal icing which is like THE cookie icing. It sets a little differently, and it hardens, and it looks beautiful. But today, I'm gonna be using buttercream icing, which is a type of icing that I use on cakes. I'm gonna start with the black icing. And remember: it has a #5 tip at the end. That's just a circle tip. It's a little bit larger, and it's just for more control. I'm gonna start decorating by piping the 8-bit border around the cookie. Once you have the border outlined, fill it in. You can always use an offset spatula to smooth it out. Once your cookies are outlined, next fill in the center with some red buttercream icing. Then, smooth it out again with an offset spatula and add a little bit of white buttercream icing in the corner to give it that classic look. Ta-da! Here are the 8-bit heart cookies that we've made today in honor of Valentine's Day. We used a cinnamon sugar cookie recipe, and decoration is super simple. I thought this was a very easy and classic geeky treat that you could give to a family member, friend, or that special someone for Valentine's Day. I'll be posting lots of pictures and the recipe on RosannaPansino.com, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check it out there. And if you guys make these cookies and decorate them, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy―it makes my day! And, if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know and leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen. Alright, thanks again, you guys! Buh-bye! And hope you have a very happy Valentine's Day! ♪ 
Hey guys, it's a Ro, today I am hanging out with my friend Joey! Hello there! You guys know Joey. We have baked together, hung out together, and I'll be putting his links down below So go check him out show him some love, subscribe I invited you over today because I was feeling, I don't know, fall and festive, and I thought, "What's like- candles!" I thought it would be really fun to do a candle smelling challenge! Sure, I don't really like fall scents I'm more of a holiday, Christmasy scent type of boy, so I'm excited! So for today the rules are, Joey. Okay. We are gonna be blindfolded, I got these cute little blindfolds because they look like pugs, because Joey and I are both dog owners! I only have one dog, Cookie, but Joey has three! I'm so jealous. "It is bed time! Go to sleep!" My friends went out and got a bunch of different odd candle flavors. Oh, they're odd ones! I have no idea what they are! Oh fun! There could be a poop smelly one. Yeah. Fingers crossed. We smell the candle and we make our guess. And if you guess it right, you get a point. The person who has the most points wins. Okay, but how close to the name do we have to get? I'm pretty lenient with points because I'm not super competitive. Flashback of Ro: "Yes! Yes! Yes! Woozipe! Woozipie! Oh my gosh!" (Repeatedly smacks Ritz crackers on table) "Give me a point! (slow-motion) Give me a point!" All right, let's put on these blindfolds and smell some candles. Do we look like little pugs? Let's smell the first candle. Can you smell it? Ha, can I smell it?!! Oh! That is potent! Oh... It's sharp! It smells like dryer sheets. It smells like old detergent. Yeah. It's really acidic. Acidic? Yeah, like, if you ate that, that's acid, you need a Tums. It kind of has a hint of like Menthol because it like kind of opens up the senses. Oh. Okay, do you have a guess in your head? I'll count to three, one, two, three, and then we'll say our guess. So we don't cheat. One, two, three: Pine-Sol! Clorox! Okay, let's look. It's green! Dog vomit! You were right about the acidity! Okay, dog vomit. This does not smell like dog vomit! It does smell like a cleaning product. It smells like the opposite of dog vomit! It smells like what you use to clean up dog vomit. Oh, this picture is terrible Joey! Look at this! This is disgusting! I'm putting the blindfold back on after that one. Okay, candle number two, we're ready! Ro, you have it in your hands. Oh, if it it is taller. Oh, then the last candle. Okay, give it a good sniff. Okay, I'm passing it off. Oh! Hmm. I know what it is! I know what it is! How do I know what it is? Because I know what it is! How? Ready? I'm ready! I'm not ready! Ha, I know what it is! It smells like, tropical. Okay, c'mon, let's do it! It smells- oh! Ready? Pina Colada! Yes! Oh, was it? We got it! At first, I thought I smelled pineapple, so it was throwing me off, but then on the after I was like, Oh, there's coconut in there and I was like what you, bu-bu-bu- Pineapple and coconut! All right, I have the third candle in my hands. It's teeny tiny! All right I'll give it a good little whiff. Like those little tea candles. Oh my god, this one smells so- all right you have to take a big whiff of this one it smells so good. Okay. Deep breath, here we go. Oh! (Cough, cough, cough) JOEY! OH JOEY! Oh my gosh, I'm like drooling and snot is coming out! Oh my gosh, it's horrible! I gotta give you credit, that was good! Joey do you have it? Oh my god! It's so bad. It's so bad! Bleh, it smells like old onion! Okay shall we guess? Oh... Ready? Three, two, one: Tobacco! Old onion! Pizza! No. No. In what world is that pizza? Have you ever smelt pizza that smells like that? Never! I eat a ton of pizza. And never has it smelled like this! If I smelled this and it smelled like pizza you would see me eating it. I think you could see me eating the candle! This smells like an old onion! All right we're on candle number four and I can already smell it! It's very strong! Okay. It's not bad. It's just strong. It's a strong smell. It's something with punch. Oh my gosh. You know what? It kind of smells like Starbucks! It's strong- oh! Joey, I just said it smells strong and bitter! You think it's coffee? What if it's old coffee? Or is it just really like a candle that's really intense. I think I know what it is. Okay! I have two options. Three, two, one: Hazelnut coffee or waffles! Old coffee! It is! It's coffee! We did it! Next one! It smells like waffle crisp cereal. Did you ever have that as a kid? No, I had Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Oh, okay. Can I switch my legs? Okay? Cause my other leg just fell asleep. Okay, we're halfway through it. I have candle five in my hands. Let's give it a sniff. Oh, this one is good again! (Sniff) (Cough, cough) I should just not listen to you! Oh my gosh it's so gross! This is gross! It smells like cat pee! You know like, when someone has a cat, but they never clean the furniture, you know, and then you sit on the couch, and then just like dust comes up with cat hair, it's just cat dander. Just like- bleh! I'm ready to guess on this one. That's cat pee! It's definitely cat pee. Ready! Three, two, one: Cat pee! (simultaneously) Oh my gosh, it's kitty litter! Shut up. Oh my god the cap is not even off! It smells that strong, and that bad, and the cap is on! Candle number six. I've got it. It's in front of me. We've got a lid, so who knows, it's a surprise. Oh goodness, let's both get our noses close. Ready, and we'll crack it open. One, two, three: Sniff! Oh! I know what it is! It's a meat pie, it is... Sausage! Sausage meat! Yes! I knew somebody in school who used to eat these as little snacks. That's my thought. Okay, I'm putting a lid on it. Okay, I think I'm doing- is it righty ti- Righty ti- no! That's not right. Okay. It's closed. Okay, ready! Three, two, one: Meat! A...um...a Slim Jim! Bacon? It was meat. Meat is bacon. Is a Slim Jim- Slim Jims are like, everything! I don't even know what they are. All right, so we now have candle number seven and turns out that this candle melted during shipping, so if it looks weird, that's why. Ro, shall we sniffle? You got it! Oh! Okay. (Sniff, sniff) Yeah, oh, it's up here. I'm tasting... tangerine. Girl, in what world are you living in. I don't know what's going on but my nose is playing tricks on me. It smells like... Apple cider. Like hot apple cider. Yeah. I think I know what it is. You ready? Let me try. Let me try. Three, two, one... Wait I'm not ready! Ha ha ha ha ha. You said it's orange! Clove! Clove tangerines? That's not a thing. I think this is definitely like a Thanksgiving thing now. It's stuffing! No. Let's each get two guesses. Oh yeah. Three, two, one: Apple cider! Clove, orange sauce glaze that goes over your Thanksgiving turkey. Okay, second one. Three, two, one: Thanksgiving dinner! Uh...like maybe a Thanksgiving stuffing with citrus in it. Turkey and stuffing! Alright, we'll give us both a point. We knew it was in this world. Candle number eight, I can already smell something. This is strong. I'm scared. I don't know what is. I don't like it You don't even have to light this, you can just leave it out, and it's giving off an aroma. Oh. Up here. I don't like it. It's like a old rotted Starbucks pumpkin... latte. Okay one more sniff. What are you thinking? Like, I have no thoughts. It's a sweet smell, it's rich, and my body does not like it, so I'm thinking like- My body loves caramel. Three, two, one: Eggnog! Moldy pecan! Hazelnut cake? Ew... What the heck? My friends... the one food I don't like is hazelnut. Really? Yes. I hate hazelnut syrup. That's so funny that you knew like your body hates it. My body loves caramel. Candle number nine. We each have a candle this time, Joey. I'm so excited. Alright, let's take a smell... Oh my gosh this smells so good! Oh, I know what it is. This is nice. I think it's a lemon. Yep. One, two, three: Lemon pie! Lemon poppy seed! Lemon bar? Lemon bar. We both guessed lemon... So half-point. Okay. Oh, Joey You know what this means? We're down to our last candle. And we're tied... Okay so this is the final candle, and we've been given it to us in a bag. I'm scared. I'm very scary because Joey... Okay. Okay, I'm pushing it out. You got it? Yeah, it's in a container too. Let me smell the bag. Does not smell good, okay. I do not like it! Oh! Oh what is it?

Hey guys, it's Ro welcome to another nerdy Nummies, I got so many requests to make something from the video game Zelda breath of the wild so that's exactly what I'm gonna do today today we are gonna be making the Royal Family's fruit cake recipe. You receive this quest from a man whose Ancestor was a chef for the royal family And it is his a lifelong dream to taste one of his family's recipes so we got to sneak into the castle Spank this guy with a leaf if you want, go into the library and find the royal family's recipe look at all these recipes om nomnom Then go back to the beautiful man and bake the cake And I thought it was the perfect recipe Because it's a fruitcake and I absolutely love making baked goods with fresh fruit in them It is delicious. So today we are gonna be making the royal family's fruitcake Let's get started the things you'll need to make this fruitcake will be 6 eggs 1 cup of sugar plus an additional Quarter cup of sugar half a cup of water ,half a cup of oil ,2 cups of all-purpose flour ,1 teaspoon of almond extract 1 and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of baking powder now let's put it all together the recipe that we're making today is a vanilla chiffon cake Very fancy and the first step is to separate our egg whites from our egg yolks so we want all of our whites over here and All of our yolks over here. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh now to the bowl with the egg Yolks add one cup of sugar and whisk it up a little bit, this would be the sweetest omelet You have ever eaten if you threw this on the grill right now And then add the rest of your wet ingredients vegetable oil, water, vanilla extract, and almond extract mmm mm mhhh Then gently whisk together until well combined I've set the egg mixture off to the side now in a large mixing bowl add your dry Ingredients minus the smaller amount of sugar we're still saving that for later I'll show ya once the dry ingredients are ready time to add in our egg mixture Whisk together until you can't see any more of the dry ingredients, this is a good arm workout I will say though that this is Easier than sneaking into the hyrule castle and into the library because at the time that you do it in the game You know it's under the bad guys Influence so you gotta be real. stealthy to make our meringue I've got a large bowl transfer our egg whites into the bigger bowl using an electric hand mixer Mix the egg whites until they're frothy it will look really bubbly to add our sugar we're using the smaller measurement, so slowly rain it in and by rain I mean make it rain while you mix But drizzle like every day in Seattle you want to mix your meringue until you get a soft Stiff peak final step to making the batter fold your egg whites and three parts into the egg Yolk batter mixture, and if you've never folded before it's not Mixing at all uh oh that's okay that happened. That's alright. I'll just put it back in here. I worked hard for that meringue now I'm gonna put it back in the bowl I'll eat it you want to be a little bit more Gentle to keep from knocking the air out of the meringue scoop underneath the bowl fold over and turn This is a cake that takes a lot of love it takes a little time So if someone makes this cake for you you know they love you a lot Batters ready time to pour into our pans in front of me. I have two round eight inch pans I've sprayed the bottom and lined with a piece of parchment paper or this Evenly between the two pans be careful because so much love went into making this okay jump over here Now the cakes are ready to bake here oven to 350 degrees and bake for 30 minutes also Just a side note the cakes are gonna rise very tall for this recipe and then once they cool They'll sink back down. So don't worry. Don't freak out That's supposed to happen with this recipe while they're baking I'm gonna show you guys this sweater How it looks like link , it looks like his costume. What's not his costume It's like his everyday wear look it has a little the hoodie is links hat Spoiler alert it's shield on my back after your cakes have baked give them plenty of time to cool I've also leveled each of them and set him over here cuz we are going to assemble and Decorate over here I have a bunch of fresh fruit that I'm gonna use to decorate and fill the cake So it looks like the image from the video game we have strawberries, blueberries Raspberries a little orange a little lime and a honeydew melon We'll start with the strawberries cut off the top and cut into four slices take the first layer I'm placing it on a turntable to make frosting a little bit easier in a piping bag I've got some whipped cream I use a thin layer on the top very thin It's just for our strawberries to stick Shingle your strawberries into two rings We'll start with the outer layer and work your way all the way around the cake now make a smaller ring right in the middle Once your strawberries are placed. I'm to add some more whipped cream to keep them in place Starting in the center Fill it up Then fill the ring ooooo in between the two strawberries and on the outside Once you've got it filled in pipe a thin layer over the whole cake but be very careful We don't want to move the strawberries now add the top of your cake flip it upside down Cuz it'll be nice and smooth, and then gently press down Pat pat pat pat pat pat now frost the entire cake with whipped cream And I have some extra strawberries over here, so these are gonna be my little snacks as I continue to decorate om Frost the sides go all the way around and work your way up then smooth it out with a spatula and another snack for My dog while the cake is chilling in the fridge We will prepare the rest of our fruit starting with our orange and lime we want orange wedges and lime slices *sniff* oh That smells good oh It smells so good. to make melon balls first step Cut your honeydew melon Butt - butt remember the end and where the stem is take a spoon and scoop out the middle you don't need it Once you got your melon you're gonna use a preseon scoop, or a melon baller. There's two sizes here I'm gonna go with the bigger size down and around bloop, and there. You go little ball of melon. I love when they have fancy brunches, and they have melon balls cuz I'm like opps here once you've got all your fruit ready pop your cake out of the fridge. I've already cut a slice I wanted to cut a slice and show you how to decorate one because I wanted it to look exactly Like it does in the video game for a cake this size You'll want to cut it into six slices that will look the closest to the video game again in a piping bag I have some more whipped cream with a number 824 It's just an open star tip And we're gonna pipe three rosettes then each slice gets an orange goes in the back a little lime wedge right in front one melon ball towards the front of the cake bloop like this and one raspberry buy the melon ball and Three blueberries and tada there you have it here is the fruit cake from?

Let's have a taste Mmm-hmm it's so soft. I can't I can't Oh This is worth the eggs some good 
Hey guys, it's Ro. Mother's Day is coming up, so I just wanted to make a fun gift idea video. This gift is something I'm going to be making for my mom this year. So mom, if you're watching this video, you stop right now! Not only stop, but don't look at the thumbnail photo, don't read the description, just stay off the internet this week 'cause I want to surprise you! A couple years ago, I surprised my mom with a cupcake bouquet for Mother's Day, and she absolutely loved it. So this year, I wanted to make her a daisy cookie bouquet, and that's what we're going to be doing today. Also, a big thank you to Wilton for supporting and collaborating with me to make this video possible. They were so sweet―they sent me this set of cookie cutters and it was perfect because it had the daisy one that I wanted. You can buy these cookie cutters at Michael's Craft Stores. So let's get started! The things you'll need to make these daisy cookies will be: 3 cups of all-purpose flour, 1½ cups of sugar, 2 eggs, ¾ cup of almond meal, 1 cup of butter at room temperature, ½ teaspoon of almond extract, 1½ teaspoons of vanilla extract, ½ teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg, ½ teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of baking powder. Then, the things that you'll need to decorate the cookies will be: A flower-shaped cookie cutter, a scalloped square cookie cutter― ―both of these are in the Wilton cookie cutter set that I'm using. Yellow sanding sugar, pink royal icing fitted with a #2 tip, white royal icing fitted with a #3 tip, yellow royal icing fitted with a #3 tip, a black food pen or―if you have a steady decorating hand― ―I'm gonna be using black royal icing fitted with a #2 tip. Four long lollipop sticks and three short lollipop sticks, a styrofoam ball, a flower pot, some pink ribbon, and some decorative tissue paper. I'll be using the vanilla almond sugar cookie recipe from the Nerdy Nummies Cookbook. This recipe is phenomenal if you're making sugar cookies that you want to hold a certain shape. And, we do today. We want them to look like little daisies. Start by mixing your dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Flour, almond meal, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. Whisk together until well combined and set off to the side. Now, in a large mixing bowl, cream together your butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Mix in your eggs one at a time to add one egg, mix it up, add the second egg, mix it up and scrape down the sides, then add your extracts―vanilla and almond― and mix it up one more time. We've got our wet ingredients, our dry ingredients, and now add all of the dry ingredients into the wet and mix together at a low speed until well combined. Our dough is all mixed up and ready to chill, but before we do, we've got to divide it in half. I'll be doing this with a spatula and eyeballing it. Place it on top a food-safe plastic wrap and wrap it up tight. Then, pop these in the fridge for about an hour to chill. You can leave them in the fridge from an hour to 24 hours. So, if you want to make your dough and hour in advance, you can do that. After your dough has chilled, we're gonna roll it out, but first we're gonna do a little baking flair. Let's open it up, and let 'er rip! [gasps] I did it! Ah, this is too fun! Take a pinch of flour, sprinkle it on top of your work surface so that the dough won't stick. Now add a little flour on the rolling pin. Make it rain, make it rain, make it rain. Roll out the dough a little thicker than a quarter-inch. This will be a little bit thicker than I normally roll out my cookies because we want to leave room for the lollipop to make a cookie pop. The dough is all rolled out. Now, it's time to cut out our cookies. I'll be using the daisy-shaped cookie cutter, cutting out six of these for the bouquet and one square for a special message. I'm gonna write "Happy Mother's Day". Aww! Cookies are almost ready to bake, but first we have to add our lollipop sticks. We'll be using four long and three short. I'm gonna start with the long. Gently lift up your cookie, place the lollipop stick underneath, and gently press down. The last long one goes on the square cookie. Then, the remaining three flowers get the short sticks. Cookies are ready, but before I pop them in the oven, I'm gonna put these in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to chill. This will help them keep their shape while they're baking. After 10 minutes, pop them in your oven at 350 degrees and bake for about 12 minutes. Once your cookies have baked and had plenty of time to cool, it's time for my favorite part. It's time to eat them all! Just kidding! [giggles] It's time to decorate. But for serious, make sure your cookies are cool before you start icing. Otherwise, your icing will melt on top of the cookie and we don't want that. I'll be decorating the flower cookies to look like daisies because that's my mom's favorite flower. But, I'm gonna be making a second video over on Wilton's channel. I'll put a link down below. It will be a video showing you how to make a couple different flowers using the same cookie cutter that I'm using today. First step to decorating is outlining all of the cookies. I'm outlining the cookies with white royal icing with a #2 tip. After you've got all of your cookies outlined, leave them out for a few minutes to dry. Then, we'll flood! I like to just start start at an end, make a bunch of zig-zags, and the outline that we previously made will help hold in all of the new royal icing. And, let the cookies set out again to dry and harden before we add some more decoration details. To give our daisies a little bit more definition, I'll be piping some details on top. I like to pipe a dot at the center of the cookie as a guide. Then, pipe each petal from the center, Make a little loop, go all the way to the edge and back. Then, work your way all the way around the cookie. I've let the cookies set out for a few minutes again to dry. You want all of the details to be dry before you do this next part because I'm gonna be using sanding sugar. To make your flowers look like daisies, take the yellow icing and pipe a dot in the center. Then, right away, take a little scoop of sanding sugar. This part is totally optional but I love it. Sprinkle it on top. Then, gently pick up your cookie and flip them over, letting the excess sugar drip away. So cute! Ahh! So cute, I love it! Now, it's time to pipe the Mother's Day message on the square cookie. We have two options. Option one: you can use a food writer pen. These are edible. But, if you're going to use these, I really need to warn you. You want your icing to completely set. It's a little bit different than just bring dry to the touch. You really want the icing to harden. You might want to leave it out for a few hours. Otherwise, it will crack your icing. You don't want that. The second option to decorate a little message on the top is just some black royal icing in a piping bag with a #2 tip. I decided on black royal icing 'cause I want to freehand it. I'm gonna start at the top and pipe, "Happy" and at the widest part, "Mother's" and at the bottom, "Day". Now, using the pink royal icing, I'm gonna add some details around the corners. Have fun with it! You can do whatever kind of designs you want. Now, time to assemble our flower pot bouquet. First, get two sheets of green tissue paper. I'm lying them flat down and then staggering them. Then, gather from the center― like this ―and place it in the center of the pot. Once you have it in place, place your styrofoam ball. Don't want it to move! There we go! Now, cut a piece of ribbon, wrap it around your flower pot, and tie a bow. Final step: position all of your cookie pops into the styrofoam ball to look like a bouquet. [singsong] ♪ Ta-da! ♪ And, there you have it! Here is the cookie flower bouquet that we made. I really love this DIY gift for Mother's Day because it's fun, it's easy, and customizable. I decorated my bouquet to look like daisies because that's my mom's favorite flower. But, I made a second video over on Wilton's channel. I'll put a link down below where I show you how to make a few different flowers using the same cookie cutter. Multiple designs; go check it out over on Wilton. I'll put the link down below. And, I'll also be posting a bunch of pictures and the cookie recipe on: RosannaPansino.com, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. You can check it out there. And, if you guys make a cookie bouquet, please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy! It makes my day. Thanks for watching, you guys! I hope you enjoyed the DIY Mother's Day gift idea. Buh-bye!

Hey guys, it's Ro! It's the weekend and I got so many requests from you guys to make something Inspired by the New 'Beauty and the Beast' that just came out I am really excited because I had the pleasure of attending the premiere of the new beauty and the beast and it was amazing I love the live action version just as much as the animated Disney classic It's one of my favorite Disney movies So I thought it would be perfect [to] make a theme treat If you can't tell I've decorated with a lot of roses the story revolves around an enchanted Rose But you know I'm also craving some apple pie, so I thought let's combine these things today We are going to be making an Apple Rose Pastry, let's get started the things you'll need for these apple Rose pastries will be three large apples I'm using Honeycrisp 1 Lemon 1 package of Puff pastry become frozen But you'll want it to be thawed half a cup of softened butter a fourth cup of honey 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract half a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon The first thing that we're gonna do is make our honey butter in a small bowl mix together your butter honey vanilla extract salt onion Cinnamon mix together it's all well combined and then set off to the side the next step is preparing our apples Start with your lemon why do you do that ro? Well? It's completely chop up our little apples We don't want to brown so I'm just massaging the lemon into the cutting board a little massage then take a sharp cutting knife cut it in half. Oh, that's nice. Oh Yeah, then squeeze half of your lemon into the bowl of water for this treat We need to slice our apples a certain way So I'm going to show you how take a sharp cutting knife and cut it right down the middle then take a melon baller Or you can use a small ice cream scoop or a spoon whatever you have handy around the kitchen And you remove the core doot doot doot doot doot Like this around in a circle look at that, no more seeds and no more core And then we'll cut off the top and bottom now turn your apple Horizontal place it flat onto the cutting board and cut really spinning strips like sixteenth of an inch thin As soon as you've [got] a few slices Place them into your bowl with water and limiting so they don't brown after you've got oh the apple slice And they're sitting in the water. It is actually coming to Microwave them the reason we do this is because we want them soft enough [to] bend when we roll them We don't want them to break Hulkies in the microwave for about five minutes while you're waiting you can sing some beauty and the beast songs there goes a baker with This tray like always the same room bread and rolls too slow And he's like good morning bells like worked on the bookstore. He's like. What are you reading? she's like it has [a] venture and Dragons almonds, but and great. He's like okay, you're weird Remember yeah, that's my girl after microwaving I strained and set the apples off to the side while we roll out our puff pastry one package of puff pastry Has two sheets, but I'm just going to be working with one to [start] Sprinkle down a little flour on top of the surface So it doesn't stick then take a rolling pin and roll it out. Just a little bit further [I've] got a ruler here using the ruler I'm going to roll out the puff pastry to be about 12 inches by 12 inches now using a smaller Cutting knife and about halfway at six inches cut your first line And then two inches over cut another two inches over at ten cut another and do this exactly the same on the other side So you'll end up with strips of dough that are two inches by twelve then using a pastry brush brush off the excess flour on the top [of] the dough citizen Now it's time to assemble our apple Rose pastries I really like this treat because it looks super fancy, but it's very simple grab one of your puff pastry strips I'm placing it on top of a piece of parchment paper So it doesn't stick to the surface give your dough one last brush just in case there's any excess flour Bread a thin layer of honey butter onto the puff pastry I'm just using the back side a little food and then take your apple slices And you're going to place them about halfway down you're going to overlap your apple just a little So they're touching at the end once you've got your apple slices lined up at the top of the pastry fold the puff pastry In half gently press down the pooh pooh pooh pooh saloon lastly starting at either end Roll the puff pastry and when you get to the end give it a gentle Pinch right here at the end to connect because you don't want your rose to fall apart like the beast's, his rose is falling apart All crazy in the movie. But look at that if it's just like a rose, it looks so fancy But it's so easy to make then pop your little pastry into a greased Cupcake tray then do this to the rest of your pastry strips. All of our pastries are ready And now it's time to base preheat your oven to 375 degrees and bake for about 35 to 40 minutes Tada! Here are all the Apple Rose pastries that we made today in honor of the new Beauty and the Beast movie I love this recipe because they look just like little Roses and this recipe makes a dozen. So its like getting 12 roses a dozen roses Happy Valentine oh No I'll eat those, those are for me. I'll be posting the recipe in a bunch of pictures on RosannaPansino.com, Facebook, Instagram And Twitter so you can check it out there, and if you guys make these little rose pastries Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It makes my day. Thanks for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe and now I'm gonna have one for me It tastes just like apple pie. Okay, I'm just going to eat this right now And if you would like to watch any other videos you can click up here. Or up here *humming* 
*nerdy nummies theme song plays* Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another nerdy nummies! Today I have a very special guest! LOOK! It's my friend Sam!
What's uuuuuup?! He is awesome, I absolutely adore you, he is a super talented music artist I'm putting his links down below, Go check him out, go give him some love Go check out his music- AND! What?
Not only are you really good at music, but What else?
He's a really good cook, you guys! Thank you!
I went over for dinner, it was amazing, I got so many requests from you guys to make something Zelda themed So today we are going to be making Rupee cookies But we're going to make a few different recipes, because rupees come in different colors And I wanted cute lil flavours to match! *Both in Unison* Let's get started! The things you will need for the basic recipe will be: 2 &amp; 3/4ths Cups of all purpose flour (plain flour) 1/2 a cup of sugar 2/3 Cup of butter 1/4 Cup of honey 1 egg 1 Tsp Baking powder 1/2 Tsp Salt 1/2 Tsp of almond extract and 1/2 Tsp of vanilla extract! Freeze dried blueberries, freeze dried raspberries, and some matcha green tea powder And to cut out our cookies we're gonna use these really cool Rupee cookie cutters! Yeah! I found these online, so I'll put a link down below if you guys wanna go check them out! Before we start, I just wanna remind you guys that all of the ingredients that we have here Is enough dough for one recipe, and we are going to be making this three different times because we're going to be flavoring each dough recipe! One will be blueberry, one will be raspberry, and one will be matcha! Now lets put it ALL together! The first thing that we're gonna do is grind up our freeze dried berries into powder! (Ooh!) We don't need to do this with the matcha because it's already a powder There's no like, matcha berry? 
Ya, No OKAY! So I'm gonna go first because I have the lighter color And if red gets in the blue a little bit, we're okay Oh lemme just have a- Ooh, here's a big one! Let's just really double check, quality control, *om nom nom* These are gonna be GOOD
Yeah, these are gonna be really good! I'll pour it in here! Okay Sam, hit the button! *raspberries blending*
*oohing and giggling* It's powerful!
I feel- I feel very powerful right now Now we just measure 4 TBSP of our Raspberry powder! Okay, now we're gonna grind up our blueberries, the same way OOH! 1, 2, 3, GO!
*Blueberries blending* Woah! I can't see in there!
It sounds good Now Sam, you're only going to scoop one TBSP of blueberries, because it's such a dark color Now we've got our two powders, and we're gonna set these to the side and start making cookies! YEAAAH! I dunno about you Sam, but I love matcha, so I wanted to start by making the matcha cookie recipe first And in Zelda, the green Rupees are the lowest ranking So we're gonna start at the bottom and then work our way up to the top bling Rupee! First thing that we're gonna do is whisk together our dry ingredients in a medum bowl over here And Sam, would you whisk for me?
I will do my best, but you'll have to instruct me in the proper, techniques
You know, like this, nothing too crazy We wanna keep it in the bowl (Looks good!) Pour in the flour, then we're gonna add a little baking powder salt, our Macha powder, and just whisk together til it's well combined, You want it to look like one color Next we're going to cream together our sugar, butter and honey mix together until it's light and fluffy! Now we are going to add our egg and our two extracts So I'll have you add both our vanilla and almond extracts to the bowl *inhaling and moaning*
We're about to get tasty up in here! We're going to add the full egg *egg cracking* try not to get any shells in there Yeah I'm glad you're doing that *Blatant lies* Yeah I never- I never get any shells [in there] [Pause here and screenshot for great reaction images] Just keep mixing 'til it's well combined! Okay, so we've got our wet ingredients, we've got the dry ingredients, what do we do? Just put em in?
Yeah! We're just going to pour all of our dry ingredients into our big bowl with the wet ingredients Just mix together until it's well combined! Okay, what are we doing with this? Because if we don't do something with this soon I'm just gonna eat it all Same Feeling! So right now, we're gonna divide it in half with the spatula, I'm gonna use your muscles Okay!
See, this is why I had you over, I just need your muscles! Story of my life! And then scoop half of it onto this piece of food-safe plastic wrap I'm im going to just shape it into a disc, then we're just gonna wrap it up tight our dough is ready to chill, we're going to pop this in the refrigerator for one hour! For our second batch of cookies, we are going to be making the blueberry blue cookie Over here we just finished creaming our butter, sugar and honey And now we're going to be adding some additional ingredients the vanilla and almond extract I'm getting very good at this!
Yeah! Then I'm going to be adding the egg, like before, with just a drop of blue food coloring dye! Go ahead, Sam!
Is this going to turn blue? Hopefully!
Ooooooh! Over here is the dry ingredients, all mixed together And instead of adding the matcha we added the 1TBSP of dried blueberry Pour all of our dry ingredients into our wet, mix together until it's well combined! Now we're gonna do the same thing with this dough, we're going to divide it in half, wrap it up, and throw it in the fridge! Now we get to move on to our last batch of cookies! The red ones! *oohing and giggling* So again, over here in a big mixing bowl, we have creamed together our butter, sugar and honey And now we are going to be adding these ingredients! This is the last time I get to do this, I'm so sad Then we're going to be adding one egg, and Sam, I'm going to have you do the crack! is it- I'm graduating, and I get egg responsibilities now, okay Just crack it, throw it in there, you got this! I'm just going to be adding a little bit of red food coloring dye to make to cookie pop in color! Hey! Mix it! Do I look like Navi?
You do! Hey! Mix it! She's like mad, she's like "Gurl, that's my job!" Okay, I think I have an idea of what we're doing next I think, just taking a wild guess here-
Okay, wild guess! We're going to add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients And then mix it all up Hey! Mix it! And one last time, divide your dough in half, wrap 'em up and put 'em in the refrigerator to chill Alright, so our dough is done chilling, now what do we do? We are going to unwrap these and roll out our dough! But first, have you heard of baking flare(!)? I have- Do we get to do it? Yeah! We've never done two baking flares at the same time 1, 2, 3!
*multiple slapping noises as the dough hits the counter* We did it!
That was pretty good! Sam, could you sprinkle a lil bit of flour on the countertop For the rest of the process I was trying to keep the flour in the bowl and now i get to break all the rules!
You can just let loose! we'll put our dough right in the middle and sprinkle some flour evenly on top, like that You wanna try? Can I?
Yeah! Okay! You just go short, short, short, short, We're going to roll the dough about a quarter inch (0.6cm) thick But it can be a generous quarter! Now you're gonna take your cookie cutters, and we're going to cut out a bunch of gem shaped cookies and place them onto our baking tray! Then you're gonna do this to the rest of your dough! Just cut 'em out! Allright, we are almost completely done, We have all three of these cookie colors laid out on these trays Now... How do we cook them? We are gonna pop these in the oven at 350F (176C) and bake for about 9 to 10 minutes And then we can eat 'em all! That's the best part
Yeah! ♫ TA- DAAAAAAAAH! ♫ Here are the Zelda Rupee cookies that we made today We made three different recipes For the green cookies, we made matcha sugar cookies For the blue, we made blueberry sugar cookies And for our red rupees, the most valuable, we have raspberry sugar cookies Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum!

Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies I got so many requests from you guys to make another recipe from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook So that's exactly what we're gonna be doing today Gems and stones can be found in so many different video games including one of my favorite games, Zelda You collect a little rupees, so today we are gonna be making rupee hard candies The recipe is a simple hard candy recipe, which you can dye to be different colors And we're gonna be using the mold from my baking line We're gonna be using this shape this gem shape is a hexagon which means it has six sides And it's the most similar looking to a rupie. I just love this gem mold It's so cute And it has shapes that I have been wanting for a really long time. And side note, you guys our swirl silicone mold was trending number one on Amazon for molds. If you want to help this mold become number one mold on Amazon, I'll put a link down below because if this becomes number one then the poo mold becomes number two. (laughing) In the book, I dyed the rupies red blue and green because I felt those were the most iconic But I really love this recipe because you can make them any color you want. Today, we're gonna be making the same hard candies with the same colors, but I'm gonna be using different flavors Let's get started! The things you'll need to make these hard candies will be: a mold I'm using the mold from my baking line And I'm only gonna be using the hexagon shapes. For the recipe, you'll need three cups of sugar 3/4 cup water, 1 cup of light corn syrup, 1 teaspoon of blueberry oil. 1 drop a blue dye 1 teaspoon of strawberry oil, one drop of red dye, one teaspoon of green apple oil, and one drop of green dye now. Let's put it all together! The ingredients in front of me is enough to make 3 different colors I like to make mine one at a time because when you're working with hot candy I don't like to separate it and move it around too much because it's just so hot the first thing that we're gonna do is Take 1/3 of our sugar water and corn syrup and pour them into a pot. Pour our sugar, that means we'll need 1 cup then. We'll need a quarter cup of water and a third cup of corn syrup Woah! (laughing) There we go! Then we add the one drop of food coloring I'm gonna start with green because I'm wearing a green shirt and the flavoring that we're using is apple And I just love apple hard candy so start with the good stuff. It's all good, but this is just like my favorite Use a toothpick to scoop, it in mix together until all the sugar is wet now We'll take this sauce pot over to the stove. Place your pot onto the stove turn the heat to medium and allow the sugar to completely dissolve. Once dissolved, place the candy thermometer into your pot and cook the candy until it reaches 275 degrees. Then, turn off the stove heat and take your candy syrup back to the baking station. Once you take your hard candy off the stove, pour immediately into a heat safe container with a pour spout at the end. And before we pour the candy into the mold add your Flavoring I'm using green apple! Whisk together work that flavoring in there. Oh yeah! Now pour your hot candy syrup into your mold and be careful because it's very hot I'm only filling them about 2/3 because I want them to be a little bit more bite-sized. Once you've poured the candy, let them sit for 45 minutes to harden. While this sits, I'm gonna make a couple more batches using our other colors. You can do it this way if you have multiple molds otherwise just wait till they've hardened and repeat I've given the candies plenty of time to harden. Pop them out, it's super easy This is one of the reasons why I love Silicone molds because they're bendy! Tug this way, tug, tug, tug, stretch it out, and the other way, then flip it upside down and pop 'em out! These look amazing! Oh my gosh you guys! Now do this for the rest of your candy Tada! There you have it here are the rupee hard candies that we made today. The recipe is from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook But, we switched the flavorings. We made green apple flavored, blueberry, and strawberry. One of the things that I love about hard candy recipes, is it's very customizable. You can make your hard candies any colors you'd like and any flavor. growing up one of my favorite candies were Jolly Ranchers So I love making a homemade hard candy recipe. Easy-peasy bite-sized and delicious! omnomnomnomnom I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the recipe on rosannapansino.com Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check it out there, and if you guys make these little hard candies Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy! It makes my day! And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies please let me know leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen! Alright thanks again, you guys, bye-bye and now I have a candy for me! I'm gonna have a green apple one. Growing up, my favorite Jolly Ranchers were green apple and watermelon. Let me know in the comments below what your favorite Jolly Rancher flavor is 
Hey guys, it's Ro! Just recently, I visited Disneyland, and made a video of some of my favorite treats from the park. And I got so many requests from you guys to re-create one of them. One of my all-time favorite treats from are those classic churros! Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum! They are so good, so that is exactly what we're gonna be making today! I am so excited because we have never made a homemade churro before! This will be a first. And also to note- this is not the excact Disneyland recipe. *whispering* I'm pretty sure that recipe is a secret! Shhhh! But, we are going to be making a recipe that's very similar to the churros that you find in the park. Let's get started! The thing's you'll need to make these churros will be: 10 cups of oil for frying, 1 cup of water, 4 cups of sugar (this will be to roll the churros in), 1 cup of flour, 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, 2 tablespoons of sugar (to make the churro), and 3 tablespoons of ground cinnamon. First step to making churros: In a large mixing bowl, mix together your dry ingredients! 2 tablespoon measurement of sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk together until well-combined, and set it off to the side! Now, pour one cup of water, and coconut oil into a small sauce pot. Bring it over to the stove, turn to a high heat, and bring it to a rapid boil. You really want a lot of bubbles! Bubble-bubble-bubble-bubble-bubble! Then remove from the heat and back to the baking station! It's really important when you're making this dough to pour in your hot water from the stove IMMEDIATELY! Pour it all in at once. Just be careful, it's very hot. And start mixing with an electric hand mixer until the dough starts to form. Add one egg; you're going to add the whole egg. Mix it up once again; the dough will come back together so just keep mixing. The next step is to scoop it into a piping bag with a #2D tip at the end. old down the sides of your bag about halfway. Then, using a spatula, scoop in, and use the side of your hand to scrape against. Just scoop half the dough at a time to make piping a little bit easier. Our churro dough is ready; our oil is heating up on the stove. Now I'm gonna get the sugar and cinnamon ready to roll our churros in as soon as they're done on the stove. I have a 9x13 inch rectangle pan (that's 23x33 cm for all of our British friends). Pour all of the sugar- MMM! And cinnamon into the pan and mix it up evenly. Once it's mixed, bring it and the churro dough over to the stove. Turn the heat to medium high until your oil reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (about 190 degrees celsius) Then, adjust the temperature as needed to keep the temperature at 375 (190 for non-Americans) Dip your fingers into little bit of water, and flick off the excess. You want your fingers damp, but not dripping. Pipe the dough directly into the oil to create your churro. And using your damp fingers, pinch off the end of the dough. Immediately after you pipe your churro into the oil, you can use tongs to shape the churro, if you'd like it to be straighter or in any shape you'd like! Fry the churro on all sides until it's golden-brown! This will take 2-3 minutes total. Once cooked, remove the churro (I'm using some tongs) onto a paper towel for one minute. Then, toss the churro into our cinnamon sugar mixture until it's completely coated! TA-DA!!!!! Here are the homemade churros that we made today, inspired by the ones from Disneyland. A big thank you to you guys for suggesting making a treat from Disneyland. Churros are my ultimate favorite treat whenever I visit Disneyland, and this is the first time that we've ever made homemade churros on my channel, so I'm super excited. I'm gonna post lots of pictures and the recipe on rosannapansino.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. You can check it out there, and if you guys make these, please take a picture and send it to me! I love seeing your baking creations! It just makes me happy! It makes my day! Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed the video, and now I'm gonna have one of these! Ha-ha-ha! Mm! Mm! Mm! Oh, that's so good! I don't know why we waited so long to make these; these are amazing! I have sugar lips!

Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! Today I really wanted to make a Nerdy Nummies themed treat And lately I have been eating a lot of like fruit snacks and gummy candy, so I thought, let's put these two things together. So today, we're gonna be making Nerdy Nummies Gummies to do so I'll be using the Nerdy Nummies mold It's got a cute little smart cookie logo, 8-bit heart and a little dino. Oh! Also, I'm using the cherry gummy mix from my baking line I'll put links down below to both of these if you're interested or you can use whatever Gummy recipe you'd like alright... LET'S GET STARTED! Making these gummy treats is super easy mode, The things you'll need will be: Half a cup of water, one box of gummy mix and two molds I'm using two molds because the box of gummy mix fills two of them and then half the box would fill one Let's put it all together! To make these Nerdy Nummy Gummies, the first step: combine your water and mix into a Heat Safe Bowl Whisk together until well combined. Now It's time to heat it up! Take it over to the microwave and heat for 90 seconds, then remove from the microwave, give it a quick stir, Then place it back in the microwave for another 60 seconds You'll know, it's done when the top is bubbling. Once your gummy mix is ready, pour it into something with a good pour spout I'm gonna be using this small bowl in my baking line cuz it has a really good pour spout and before you pour your mixture into the cavities, lightly grease them, then slowly pour ur gummy mix into each cavity of the mould. And don't worry if you spill a little like I did you can take a little damp paper towel, wipe it up, OR, or just leave it after it sets You can just peel it off and have another little snack. He Hee! And just a helpful tip if your gummy mix starts to cool while you're working with it You can just pour it back into a heat safe container and pop it in the microwave for a few Seconds once you pour in all the gummy mix it's time to chill! Pop these in refrigerator for one hour and then I'm Gonna watch whatever my favorite Netflix show is! Once they've completely set and chilled in the fridge it's time to pop them out! What I like to do is give your mold a tug at the top and bottom and on the Sides then push from the bottom and pop your gummies out Look at that! I picked up all of the detail, Looks adorable! the first ones for me Mm-Hmm these days, just like my grandma's cherry candies. I love them now. Just keep popping out the rest of your gummies and TADAAA!!!! Here are the nerdy nummies gummies that we made today not only is this treat super easy mode? But I just love that you can see all of the detail look at how detailed these little cookies are and the dinosaur Adorable I'll be posting a bunch of pictures and the instructions on Rosanna Pansino Com Facebook Instagram and Twitter so you can check it out there, and if you guys make these gummies Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations Especially with their nerdy nummies themed it really really makes my day if you like this video make sure to give it a big thumbs up and subscribe to my YouTube channel and if you have any other ideas for any other nerdy nummies Please let me know leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen also if you're interested in the mold or the gummy mix we use today I'll Put links down below alright. Thanks a lot. You guys bye. Bye 
Hey guys, it's Ro. Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! I got so many requests from you to make something My Little Pony themed in honor of the new My Little Pony movie I wanted to do something bigger in honor of the movie. So today we are gonna be making a two-tiered cake and I wanted it feel like a screenshot from the land of Equestria with all the little ponies. Get ready to make a lot of cake. Let's get started! The recipe that we're using today is the white cake recipe from the Nerdy Nummies Cookbook. The ingredients that I have in front of me are enough for one 10-inch round pan and one 6-inch round pan. I'm going to double it. I'm gonna make two 10-inch round cakes and two 6-inch round cakes. The ingredients you'll need will be 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons Of milk, 2 and 1/4 cup of sugar, 7 eggs, but we will just be using the egg whites, 3 cups of flour, 1/4 plus 1/8 teaspoon of almond extract, 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1/8 teaspoon plus a pinch of salt, 3 teaspoons of baking powder, 6 tablespoons of shortening, and 3/4 cup of salted butter. Now let's put it all together! *horse neigh* First step in a large bowl is to whisk together our dry ingredients. Add flour, baking powder, and salt Then whisk together til well combined and set off to the side. Now, cream together your butter, sugar, and shortening in a large bowl. Pour in the sugar, Mmm! Butter and shortening. Then, using an electric hand mixer, mix together until light and fluffy. Now add in your eggs one at a time, remember we just want the egg whites so what I like to do is the jiggle method. You'll also want to mix between adding each egg. So add an egg, mix it up, add an egg, mix it up, add an egg, mix it up, add an egg, mix it up, add an egg, mix it up. You know you get it. After the eggs are mixed in add your vanilla and almond extracts. Mm-hmm mix it up and just take a second to smell the vanilla. All of our mixtures are ready, we have our dry ingredients, wet ingredients, and milk. Add a third of dry to our wet ingredients Then mix it up. Add half the milk, then mix it up. Add another part dry, Mix it up. Add the second half of the milk, mix it up. Then add the last third of the dry and you mix it up. Don't forget to scrape down in between. Let me get this really pretty. the batter is ready, now Eyeball it divide it between the two pans. I have greased and lined with a piece of parchment paper at the bottom This is gonna be the fun part Just go for it. Okay, gonna get some over here All right - back over here and we need some over here, don't look at that If you just wanted to make a shorter cake you can just stop here and pop these in the oven But I am gonna repeat this process one more time. I'm gonna make another batch of batter. Heat your oven to 350 degrees and bake the smaller cake for about 45 minutes and the larger cake for one hour. While the cakes are baking we will be making our fondant decorations I have marshmallow fondant that I've dyed a bunch of different rainbow colors to make all of the details also a bunch of mini cookie cutters and circle cutters. I want the cake to have a bunch of apple trees for Applejack so we'll start with the brown fondant. The trees will sit flat against the side of the cake to make a Landscape. Try to give the tree some texture, make it look like bark and then start making the top of the tree I'm using a bright green color. I've got a small circle cookie cutter cut out a bunch of these Boop-boop then we want a bunch of leaves I'm using a very very small, probably the smallest, teardrop shaped cookie cutter I've ever seen. Look at it This is like a human tear So to get the green leaves to stick to the green circle I'm using water and the moisture is just gonna help them stick together I'm alternating the placement of the leaves up down up down because trees leaves grow all over the place Open up that red fondant to be apples a little dab of water and stick them on the tree I think Applejack would be pretty proud oh oh oh these are pretty great wait till we're done. You're gonna love it. Oh What's that Applejack? Every apple orchard has some fallen apples? Okay we'll make some spare apples that have fallen around the base. I'm Freehanding the leaves on top put them on the center, OOP. We've got the apple orchard covered now for some bushes I'm unwrapping the dark green and light green color. Roll Them out. Cut out a variety of sizes Using circle cookie cutters. Remove the excess fondant and cut them in half. We'll layer these on our cake to make our bushes. We have all of our shrubbery, now for the cake topper I'm gonna be asking for the help of Rainbow Dash, because she's always flying around the skies keeping it clear I'm making a rainbow cake topper I want it to look like a rainbow in the sky. So the back piece is going to be light blue like the sky Roll this out and shape it into a round door shape. And time to make the rainbow. You can pick any colors You'd like I chose red, orange, yellow, green, darker blue, and purple. Roll each color into a log, thicker at one end and thinner at the other. Our Fondant logs are ready, now shape into a rainbow *sneeze* *sneeze* Ooh, something tickled me, okay! To give it a little flare curl the ends, so it looks like a curly Ponytail, there we go. Just keep following the same shape, adding each color. How cool does this look? I wish my hair look like this, then me and Rainbow Dash could be like twins "Hey, girl, like your hair!" I'm like "Oh, thanks!" Take a little paint brush, dip it in water, paint the back of the rainbow This is gonna act as an adhesive So it will stick. Then place on top and let it set. The last thing we're making are some clouds. One of my clouds will be 3D, for the cake topper, and the other ones flat. For the flat clouds roll out the fondant and, using a flower cookie cutter, cut some shapes. Then, for the 3D cloud, roll little balls in varying sizes. Our cloud balls are all lined up Now, roll out a very thin layer of white fondant and place over the top. Ooh! It's gonna look so cool. Tuck it in cut off the excess fondant and there you have it, a 3D fluffy cloud. Our cakes have baked, and I've given them plenty of time to cool and cut each of our cakes in half It's time to assemble and frost. I've put one of the cakes in front of me on a turn table. Then pipe a thin layer of buttercream frosting on the top. Smooth it out using a spatula. Add the next layer and repeat. Add a layer and frost. Then, when you get to the top, flip the last one upside down so the bottom of the cake is facing up. This makes frosting a lot easier and less crumbly. Frost a thin layer all around the cake This is called a crumb coat, because... there's some... It might have a few crumbs in it. That's okay Weeeeeeeeeeeew! Pop it in the fridge to chill while we do the exact same thing to the smaller cake. After the cakes have chilled in the fridge for about a half-hour we will cover them with fondant. In front of me I have a really big pastry mat because one of the cakes is quite large. I'm gonna start with the smaller cake. Look at this fondant rolling pin isn't this cool? It's huge! And you'll also get an arm massage when you're doing it. Oh Yeah Roll the light blue fondant about a quarter inch thick. Fold back the fondant. I'm gonna fold it over my arm like this. Place the cake in the middle and cover. Then gently using your hands smooth out the top. Be sure to get rid of any air bubbles. Then smooth out the edges. Then, using a small sharp cutting knife, cut off the excess fondant. Trim the edges closer to the cake. Get in there. And peel off the excess fondant This is what the small cake should look like. Now we will do the same exact thing to the large cake but using green fondant Both cakes are covered in fondant So let's stack them. Now is also the perfect time to choose what serving plate you want to use. I've covered a serving plate in some green fondant, so it all blends together. You don't have to do this. This is totally optional I'm gonna assemble first, and then move it cuz I've been working out, you guys These guns are ready for a big move We don't want the cake to bow because of the weight, we need some structural support. To do so, we have straws. Press one straw all the way down to the bottom Then pull up just a little bit and Cut then press back down. Boop! Place them where you want your second tier cake to be. I'm gonna place the second tier cake not exactly in the middle, giving us a little bit more playroom in the front for decorations and stuff. Now add all of the fondant decorations that we made from before onto the cake. You can get really creative with it, to create a little snapshot of Equestria. Our cake is almost done, we put a ton of fun details But what's a My Little Pony cake without My Little Ponies? We have Rainbow Dash, she goes at the top Rarity, she's gonna come hang out here because the diamonds are her cutie mark. She designs clothes she's super fashionable and glamourous Pinkie Pie, who's my favorite, loves to throw parties and celebrate. Her cutie marks are the balloons. On the bottom tier I'm gonna put Applejack because she's always working on the apple orchard. Twilight Sparkle, the magical unicorn She's always studying books in the library with a little baby dragon. It's so cute. I love it all right and Fluttershy and her cutie marks are the little butterflies And Tadaaaa! Here is the My Little Pony cake that we made today. A big Thank you to you guys for suggesting something My Little Pony themed in celebration of the new movie I am so excited you guys I love making two tiered cakes because you can create a whole scene. This looks like someone went into Equestria took a picture of the little ponies hanging out in the land, and I love it I'll be posting lots of pictures and the recipe on rosannapansino.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter So you can check it out there, and if you guys make any treats that are My Little Pony themed Please take a picture and send it to me.

I have scooped the frosting into a piping bag with a number 829 tip! Our cupcakes have baked, i gave them plenty of time to cool, you don't want to frost em' while they are still hot cause it will melt your frosting and now for my favorite part, we're gonna frost and decorate! Im just gonna give it a double swirl One swirl around, and then a second! Boop!

[Nerdy Nummies Theme, link in description] Hey guys, it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! I got so many requests from you guys to make something Power Rangers themed, and I'm super excited because we have never made something Power Rangers themed before on Nerdy Nummies, so we're gonna change that today! It's perfect timing, because the new Power Rangers movie is coming out. I just- I can't tell you how excited I am! I grew up WATCHING Power Rangers. My favorite was the Pink Ranger. "Pterodactyl!" Let me know, in the comments below, if you have a favorite Power Ranger, and let's get to baking! We are gonna be making some Power Ranger Themed Cookies! Let's Get Started! The recipe that we're making today is a Vanilla Almond Sugar Cookie from the Nerdy Nummies Cookbook. I love this recipe for so many reasons, but one is because they really hold their shape while they bake. The Things You'll Need will be 3 Cups of All-Purpose Flour; 1 and a Half Cups, plus 1 Tablespoon of Sugar; 3/4ths Cup of Almond Meal; 2 Sticks of Butter; 2 Eggs; 1 Teaspoon of Baking Powder; Half a Teaspoon of Salt; Half a Teaspoon of Almond Extract; 1 and a Half Teaspoons of Vanilla Extract; and Half a Teaspoon of Ground Nutmeg. Now, Let's Put It ALL Together! First thing that we're gonna do is in a Medium Size Bowl, we're gonna whisk together our dry ingredients. Our Flour, Almond Meal, Baking Powder, Salt, and Nutmeg. Mix it together 'til it's well combined and then set it off to the side. Next, we are gonna cream together our Butter and Sugar in a big Mixing Bowl. I'm gonna mix it together with my Hand Mixer until it's light and fluffy. Now we're gonna be adding our Eggs and Extracts. We're gonna be adding our Eggs first. I'm gonna add them one at a time. Crack the Egg, mix it up, scrape down the sides, and then add our second Egg, and our Extracts, and mix it up, scrape down the sides. Now we are gonna pour all of our Dry Ingredients into our Butter Mixture. Woop! Mix them together on a low speed until they're well combined. Cookie Dough is ready, but now we've gotta let it chill. I'm gonna cut it in half with my Spatula, then take a piece of Food Wrap, and we're gonna wrap both of our halves up tight, and then pop these both in the Fridge to chill for 1 Hour. Our Cookie Dough has chilled, and now we are gonna roll it out. *FWOOSH*
*thunk* *dee's Power Ranger Theme* Perfect! I'm just gonna take a pinch of Flour, sprinkle it over my countertop, and roll it out, about a Quarter Inch Thick. Boooom! Got our dough rolled out, and now, using our Circle Cookie Cutter, I'm gonna cut out a bunch of cookies, and then transfer them onto this Baking Sheet I've got lined with a piece of Parchment Paper, so it won't stick. Cookies are ready to bake! We're gonna heat our oven to 350°F and bake these for about 12 to 13 Minutes. Once your cookies have baked and had plenty of time to cool, Now it's Time To Decorate! This is my favorite part! I love decorating. To decorate, I've got Royal Icing in a bunch of different colors. I've put all of them into Plastic Baggies with Tips at the end, for a little bit more control. We're gonna start by Outlining each of our Sugar Cookies, all the way around, in each different color. Remember, there are different colored Power Rangers out there, but these ones were my favorite! We've done our outlines, and let them sit for just a few minutes. This will act like a fence, like a barrier, to hold the rest of our Royal Icing in the middle. Now I'm gonna flood our cookie, and flooding just means filling it in. And use a Toothpick to press the icing around to get a really smooth texture. Once again, we're gonna do Pink, Red, Black, Green, Blue and Yellow. Now I'm gonna set these off to the side to allow them to set, and while they are setting, we're gonna roll out some Fondant for some last final details! We've got a lot of different things going on over here. We've got Marshmallow Fondant that's White, Black, and Yellow. Start with our Yellow Fondant, and I'm just gonna pinch off a little bit. Pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch! Using the end of a Tip, this is a #12, I'm just gonna press down into the Fondant. Just pop it out. Then, taking some tweezers, or you can take your fingers, you can pinch, pinch, pinch! I'm gonna pinch 2 sides of the Circle, making it an Oval. Then you're gonna make a bunch more of these. Every cookie gets one of them, so however many you wanna make! Now we are gonna roll out our Black Fondant. *dee's a tune* I'm using a mini-football-shaped Cookie Cutter. Cut out a bunch of these, and then using a sharp Cutting Knife, I'm just gonna cut off the ends. And, again, every cookie will need one of these, so cut out as many as you're making! This next part is totally optional. You can leave these Yellow, but I'm gonna be painting them Bronze, because that's what they look like on the belt. I'm gonna be using a little bit of Metallic Fruit Paint. For the suit design, and belt strap, which hold the Morphers on the front, that we just made, we're gonna roll out our White Fondant, and cut out some shapes. I have this very small, square-shape Cookie Cutter. Each cookie will need 3 Squares. Then I'm gonna cut out the belts. I'm using a Fondant Tool that kinda looks like a mini-Pizza Cutter. It's like wee wee wee wee...! Let's make some Belts! You can't fight monsters without a good suit on. No one's done it, can't- Never happened. I'm taking a little bit of Black Royal Icing, put it on top of our little Black Fondant cutout. Then, place our Bronze Oval over the top of it. All of our decoration pieces are ready! And now it's Time To Assemble! "It's Morphin' Time!" "Mastodon! Pterodactyl!" "Saber-Toothed Tiger! Triceratops!" "Bronclsaurus..." So we're gonna do this by placing 3 of our Squares on to the cookie, then you're gonna take your little belt, place it on the bottom- My fridge just farted. Rude. Once all the White Fondant is placed on the top of the cookie, you're gonna take your Circle Cookie Cutter, and gently place it over the top. Cut through the Fondant, then remove the excess Fondant. For the final decoration step, attach our Morpher to the Belt. Then we're gonna do this to the rest of our cookies. ~Ta-Daaaa!~ Here are the Power Ranger Cookies that we made today! A big thank you to you guys for suggesting this idea. I am super excited for the new Power Ranger Movie! I really like this idea for cookies because if any of your friends have a favorite Power Ranger, they can pick their favorite cookie! This one is MY favorite, because I like the Pink Ranger! But let's be honest, if I was a Power Ranger, I don't know what color- um- And I'd probably- I'd probably Morph, and I'd be a Squirrel. I'm gonna be posting a lot of pictures, and the recipe on RosannaPansino.com, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check 'em out there, and if you guys make these cookies, please take a picture and send it to me.

It's Cookie Eating Time! Om-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom! [Nerdy Nummies Theme, link in description] 
Hey guys, it's a Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies. Today I am dressed up like Te Fiti because I got so many requests from you guys to make something from the movie Moana again, So that's exactly what we're gonna be doing today. Today We are gonna be making Heart of Te Fiti sugar cookies and what I really love about this recipe is that there's very little decoration. We're gonna make the dough, color it, assemble it in a really cool Way kind of making a swirl cookie and then once they go on the oven and bake They're ready to serve so there's no decoration after you bake. Let's get started! The recipe that we're gonna be making today is one of my favorite It's called a Sablé recipe so the things you'll need will be a 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup butter, 2 eggs we'll only be using the yolks, 2 cups of all-purpose flour 2, teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt, Half a teaspoon of electric green food coloring and half a teaspoon of green food coloring. Now let's put it all together! First up to making these cookies is cream together your butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer Mix together until light and fluffy. That's what it should look like now add your eggs. Remember we just want the yolks let the egg white drip into the bowl boop-boop boop-boop boop-boop boop-boop boop-boop Put 'em in the bowl, boop. Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo and into the bowl again using an electric hand mixer mix on a medium speed until the yolks are incorporated. This is starting to look really good, and it's about to smell really good add your vanilla extract and mix together. After the vanilla add all of your flour and Salt keep mixing until the dough comes together You don't want any streaks remaining, and this dough will get really crumbly, but then it will come together. Come together! Dough is ready time to add your color. I'm gonna be adding a little bit of electric green. Then mix up until the color is even now divide your dough in half We're gonna wrap it up tight using some food safe plastic wrap. Now pop in the fridge for 10 minutes while we dye the second half of our dough a darker green. We're gonna add some more color. This is just regular green. Okay, so this one's darker now It's the second half of our dough and again Just like before wrap it up tight with a little bit of plastic food wrap and pop it in the fridge to chill Once the dough has chilled we're gonna roll it out to a rectangle shape in front of me I've got a piece of parchment paper so that it won't stick to the surface here we go Yes! and give it a roll my natural instincts want to roll this into a circle But you want to roll it into a rectangle shape just keep rolling your dough Slow and steady until you get it pretty flat. It's about an eighth of an inch thick this is ready now I'm gonna pop this in the fridge to chill while we roll out the dark green dough. Yes! You don't need to put the dark green dough into the fridge But take out your light green dough and we're gonna place it on Top of our dark green dough we're gonna stack them then cut off the excess then we roll. It's pretty cool Pick up the dough with the parchment because the dough is very Thin and we're just gonna lay it on top. Go for it! That wasn't the most graceful, but you just want them to line up as best you can. Then using your hands press down Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop and give them a light roll, so they stick together peel off the parchment I have a little ruler here cut an 8 by 10 Rectangle and trim the excess dough we've got an 8 by 10 rectangle now time to turn this into a swirl cookie turn the dough, woo, so it's facing the long way and Starting at one end use the parchment paper to start to curl. You want to roll the cookie dough as tightly as you can We've done it. We've made a two-tone cookie log. Take a look. Let's look at it. Also, kinda looks like a cookie burrito mmm! Wrap it up tight and some food safe plastic wrap then pop into the Freezer we really want this cookie dough to get firm for about 10 minutes. Once your cookie dough has Frozen time to cut into slices in front of me. I've got a cutting board I also have the ruler once again because we want to cut them a quarter inch Thick this kind of reminds me of the cookie logs You'll find at the store And they'll have a little design in the middle like a little pumpkin or a Christmas tree and all you have to do is Cut the dough and then bake up We've got all of our cookies on the baking sheet time for our final decoration step I am using a lollipop stick to make it look a little bit more textured like the stone, the Heart of Te Fiti. I'm gonna be pressing down six times into the dough starting at the center. One Two Three Four Five Six. Then do this to all of your cookies. Our cookies are ready to bake pop these in the oven at 325 degrees and bake for about 12 to 15 minutes. And ta-da~! There you have it, here are the heart of Te Fiti cookies that we made today using a delicious Sablé Recipe which is one of my favorite cookies in the entire world. I'll be posting the recipe and a bunch of pictures on rosannapansino.com Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check it out there, and if you guys make these cookies Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations It just makes me happy it makes my day especially when they are Moana themed And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know in the comments down below And I will do my best to make it happen alright. Thanks again you guys bye-bye! Now I get to have one of these~ Mmm. It's so good

place it down and then it will stick on there pipe an outline all the way around and then do some zigzags in the middle oh no that's okay oh no don't worry don't worry it will spread out hit the medium piece back on and then one more layer Nosa starting to look like a super cute cake so we're gonna breeze it for half an hour we took our cake out of the freezer and girl what does my X next we frost but before we frost our cake we got put in a little bit of structure I like you straws bow-bow straw yeah I stick it right in the middle of the cake and I'm gonna let you do it use your muscles girls just push down go go go go go perfect Lauren have you ever um braid a cake girl I have barely made a cake out of like a box okay I'm so excited that we're doing this bad start at the bottom with

for the in-between slices then smooth it out now we're gonna add the blue that you see on the side of the drink and I think it's the sour that was a sour right and that's right I remember yeah I've got the cutest little look at this little baby baby baby offset spatula and it has a triangle it basically looks like the smallest pie server in the world like if we made a little mini pie and you may be partners it's nice for like a little extra pie like I love those video to obsess gently press it into the cake to make the line where you want to pipe of the blue take the blue buttercream icing in a piping bag with a number 10 tip at the end for a little bit more control fill in a cavity that we've created use your spatula and smooth it out our cake is frosted anyway and we've got icing that

Hey guys it's Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! Today I am dressed like Merida from the Movie Brave ! I got so many request from you guys to do something Brave themed And I was thinking -HHmmmmm- while watching the movie I saw that she and her brothers and all of her family were eating these Iced rolls and I thought -That's what I wanna make- So today we are gonna be making the iced rolls from Brave Let's Get Started! The things you'll need will be: 3 cups + 3 tablespoons of bread flour 1 and a half cups of butter at room temperature 8 eggs Half a cup of milk An additional 3rd cup + a tablespoon of bread flour, we are keeping this separate for a reason 1 package of active dry yeast Quarter cup of sugar And 1 table spoon of salt You will also need: Some maraschino cherries Royal icing with a little bit of orange juice added in Aand a plastic bench scraper Now Let's Put it All Together! The first thing that we're gonna do is warm our milk. I put this in the microwave for about 30 seconds You wanted warm to the touch but NOT hot Add our yeast and our smaller measurement of flour to our milk Then take a spoon and mix it up to make a paste Set it aside for about 10 minutes to Let It Do its Magic Our yeast is ready, I've put it into a larger mixing bowl Wisk together our sugar and all of our eggs first before we use the dough hook Before we put this onto the mixer add 1/4 of our flour Mix together until the flour starts to disappear and add more  flour We are gonna be adding it in 4 parts this is 1 of them mix -add your flour- mix Then, in between, add a little salt. Just remember add your flour in 4 parts and the salt after the second Close the mixer, turn it to a low speed and as its goin' slowly add our butter Chunk by chunk Our dough is mixed. Over here I've got a big bowl and some flour. Sprinkle the bowl, I am also gonna sprinkle some flour on the top because this dough is VERY sticky And we gotta get the dough out of there  and put it in the bowl Our dough is in the bowl, now we are gonna tuck 'em in Just got a little clean kitchen towel For this recipe, we are gonna let it sit for about 1 1/2 hour to 2 hours until it doubles in size Our dough has risen and now we are gonna cut and measure them into 2 ounces ♪WAKE UP♪ Take some flour. Powder your work surface We're just gonna pick it up, flip it over  hope it comes out *poof* Is it g- Did it do it?   This looks so cool. This makes me feel like I'm baking in a medieval bakery Like in a castle or something Doesn't it? Get a lot of flour on your hands and now we are gonna push it down to flatten it out *Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap* Take your bench scraper and cut a little chunk And  just put it right over here on our scale, we want 2 ounces HUUUUUUUUH 1.78 tiny bit more BOOM 2 ounces Pick 'em up and you are gonna put 'em off to the side Keep cutting 2 ounce portions until you've cut out all of your dough. We've got all of our dough cut out and now we are gonna shape it into rolls It's a little bit different then just rolling it into a ball We've got  a technique You're gonna take a little bit of flour, just a little bit this time, not a lot Then you are gonna take one of your measurements And you've got some flour on each side Now we're gonna fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it and fold it Now we are gonna put the folded side down Then I'm gonna roll the dough in my hand its gonna go between my thumb, my palm and my pinkie Once your ball is ready we're just gonna pick it up, place it over here onto our cookie sheet line with a piece of parchment paper. And you don't wanna put more then 12 balls onto your cookie sheet. You don't wanna crowd them. Got all of our little rolls on our cookie sheet and now it's time to put them to bed one last time. So you are gonna get your little kitchen towel and put them to bed Now, wait 30 minutes. Let them sit at room temperature After they've proofed we are gonna take the towel off Ooo look at that They grow up so fast Now we are gonna brush our rolls with a little bit of egg wash Over here I've got 2 eggs mixed up with just a little bit of salt , paint over the top This will give 'em a nice shiny golden brown color It's time to bake! You're gonna heat your oven to 350 degrees and bake theses for 22 minutes Once your rolls have baked and had plenty of time to cool. Now it is time to decorate ! Over here I've got a little bit of royal icing in a plastic baggy And now I'm gonna ice each of the rolls to look like the icings from Brave in the movie The icing on the rolls in the movie are wiggly like this. And then I'm just gonna fill it in. Our rolls are iced and over here we've cut our MARAschino cherries in half Then we're gonna stick 'em on the top 1 a roll ♪♪TADAAAAAAAAAAAAA♪♪ Here are the iced rolls that we've made today They look just like the ones from the movie Brave *yam yam yam yam yam yam yam* A big thank you guys for suggesting something Brave. And I'll be posting lots of pictures of these treats on Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram and Twitter And if you guys make these treats, please take a picture and send it to me.
