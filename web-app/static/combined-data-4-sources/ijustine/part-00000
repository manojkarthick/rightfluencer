hey guys how's it going against Essene welcome back to my kitchen and today we are celebrating Valentine's Day the only way that I know how with my heart so what we're going to be doing today is we're gonna be making a bleeding-heart cake now I made one of these I think last year for Valentine's Day but this is different because it's going to be an actual real-life replica of a real human heart because why not so I pre-made the cake so that you guys didn't have to watch me make another box cake so without further ado Cakes police oh wow can you believe they just appeared like this out of thin air so what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be cutting the tops off of these two and we're gonna be layering these together so we're gonna have a three-tiered cake with the bleeding part on top so with this excess cake from the tops of it I'm going to mold together to make our heart so it's basically gonna be like a cake pop art in theory this is what I'm thinkin but usually the things that I'm thinkin never really sort of comes to fruition properly oh wow look at this so I'm gonna mix a little bit of this up with a little bit of butter so that it will smooth out a little bit easier because this is this consistency is thick like my body this is a lot like this is disgusting if you actually think about what this is like it is just a ton of icing this is getting so fluffy I'm such an idiot made a mess already hardly even started this video I haven't even touched the cake yet this is a nice little trick that I saw somebody do once on YouTube they put icing on this board so that it sticks I'm gonna cut the tops off of these can't find my cake leveler so it's very upsetting that I don't hmm so we're gonna save this put that into there cousin really me oh shoot that's not level I gotta find my cake leveler cuz this is not the life that I live no you stay there you monster we can glue that back together it'll be like it didn't even happen you can't even help [Music] this is basically the same thing that I did for the home pod but this time instead of a home pod and have a bleeding-heart on top okay so we're almost done this isn't even anything that has to do with the actual cake this is just like to put the heart on it's definite not my best work definitely not my worse work we're gonna be mixing up this lovely little cake mixture and trying to form it into a heart I hate everything that's gonna happen right now oh I hate it this is gonna be not fun at all I know I got to go into the hands but I don't want to this is so disgusting and this icing is like an oil bath it just doesn't oh no I think I'm gonna put too much icing in do I have AppleCare on this watch could you hand me that other cake over there Thanks yeah here just yeah that's good yeah you know what I could have done I could have probably put this in the mixer so I think we have a nice consistency that I may be able to form the heart so I know you're busy like filming and everything but a lot of that's perfect okay so it's gonna be kind of like a Lyga looks like sort of like an egg how's that look just maybe like you can just have it over there maybe just I think really just like flash it like a flash car so there's a lot of tubes involved in this heart so I think I might might not be as photorealistic as I had hoped yeah I don't know if this is really like what what a heart looks like it's just a potato did I make a potato there could be worse ways to spend your day like you could be me right now you could be making this don't worry this will get better I promise ah no you want no promises what have I done this looks stupid this doesn't look like a heart at all so things aren't going quite how I expect it so we need to make kind of like the arteries and stuff coming out of the heart somebody makes some fondant arteries and then I'm hopefully gonna paint this thing red I'm not sure I've definitely messed up my color scheme Oh Stephanie oh come on man brush slam upon it this point doesn't even matter oh this looks like a little calamari cool oh my god so this is not biologically accurate by any means but don't judge me it should be a little bit more this way but I'm gonna jam it here just because I think it's gonna fall off if I put it anywhere else [Music] so this is our gonna be using for the blood these are some country cherries in a can that's my dog Wow so I'm gonna Jam one of these inside this little ventricle here just for a nice added look so I need to get these nice and real juiced up like real blood I've seen Dexter no no no you do not you do not get to go out like that that is not fair I'm just gonna dump it on because what else what's the worst that can happen I'm not sure this is Oh [Music] pretty girls out right now Oh God [Applause] [Music] not really sure what else I can do to this this point this is not quite what I had envisioned perhaps maybe better luck next time well guys this is it I don't think there's anything more that I can even do to salvage this because at this point it's looking like a very very hot mess thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys have a lovely Valentine's Day if you have any more suggestions for things that you would like to see me bake in the future and that's attempt to bake of course leave those in the comments below and I look forward to chatting with you guys there so in the meantime well I guess I'm just gonna no I don't know what I'm gonna do probably go eat this while I watch Netflix [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
yeah it sounds like going it's Justine and today I am so excited because in my hand as you can see I have the new iPhone 10 and we are going to now test out some photos and some video one of the things that I'm most excited about as I mentioned in my iPhone 8 camera test video this does 1080p 240 frames a second and it looks absolutely incredible I have a lot of high-end cameras they can't even do that so this little thing is changing everything so let's go test it out I got Jenna over there she's there a sweat pan my first touch get on her okay Jack is like an iPhone photographer [Music] stop moving okay okay do one phone I'm actually impressed good it's like that one yeah look at that look very nice oh just a little bit so the problem is if you just have split in because let me take a couple more oh oh oh it's not an iPhone problem it's like it's a big problem yeah let's do a jump boiler alert that's how we get the shot so much like the portrait mode that a lot of you guys are used to on the old iPhone you can now do that on the front-facing camera so there's Jenna and now when I go into it I hit edit this will give you a good example of what it looks like so here's portrait that's the front-facing selfie mode you can also use the portrait lighting features exactly like you would in the normal rear camera portrait mode you can change it from the natural lights a studio light contour light stage light and the stage light mono so right now this is a test of the front-facing video this is just a test I wish that I had something more exciting to say or do hey Jenna hey whoa wait hi Nick hi wait hello we're uh we're just the park and I'm jumping and I'm dancing and I'm having a wonderful time [Music] [Music] so probably my least favorite things is changing from different camera settings because you actually have to go into the camera settings so here we are we're gonna change the slow mode to 120 and then I'm gonna change the regular to 30 for the second [Music] [Music] she warned that's my angel hello let's see some dog action I'll see what it looks like when we zoom in come on dogs give me some action hi Manny who's a good boy [Music] so my dog is not really kind of children and there's a very tiny child here super tiny he's being a good boy though now we've done a video test let's try out some photos one of the things I love the most about the new phone one of things that I love about the new iPhone 10 station lets it out we're at a dog park yeah this one looks so good smile oh my gosh that's great oh that's a nice Apple look there we go man good boy let me get this shot oh gosh that's disgusting portrait mode to Maddy who's a good boy there you are who's a good boy wait look here Maddy thick wait what this right here good boy here you go take a stick bribery oh gosh that was almost the first fall if it look [Music] [Music] so yesterday we were filming a bunch with the iPhone 10 and today we are back here outside getting some more really great shots for you and I'm so much happier with how the photos are turning out today because we have much more light the Sun is about to go down but now we're gonna take a few more portrait shots I'm ready for my close-up Nick should I move are you doing okay good [Music] so this did a really good job the color looks incredible this is a good shot this is something I'm gonna send home to moms and say mom thinking of you these look a lot better than the ones I took yesterday so here's one of Nick who is behind the camera right now studio light contour look at that stage light it did such a good job I'm impressed it does such a great job of pulling out highlights and so much color in the background I'm pretty impressed with HDR to be honest with you you can have the option to just save HDR photos or save the original I have it turned on so that I can save both the HDR photos look so great that there really is no need to even have over them on you our main focus on you okay so we're doing another back facing camera test here it is there is crying children here I think it's crying I'm not sure I'm not sure this'll look cooler in slow-mo [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh I'm dizzy the zoom lens also has optical image stabilization so not only just this help with your portrait mode photos but this will help with she's trying to reset her Apple ID password I feel bad cuz I can hear her in the background so obviously we've already talked about this but on the new iPhone 10 it has dual cameras much like the iPhone 7 but it is now placed in this beautiful vertical fashion there is the new quad tone flash in the center so this helps kind of even out all of the photos when you're using a flash which I haven't even tried yet so let's try the flash [Music] I've looked better at least the picture quality was good I'm blind okay let's see how it looks I think it looks it looks fine it's fine it doesn't look bad doesn't look amazing it just looks fine I tried the front-facing flash see what that looks like I don't like flash I hate take me go to the flash on I'd never turn it on the only time I turn it on is what it's accidentally turned on one of the things I'm really excited about trying out it's low light with the new iPhone 10 there's also an option when you put on the live photo which usually always turns on or like why are you turning on you try them crazy but there's a lot of great new features like loop bounce and long exposure that utilizes a live photo so maybe you might want to keep it on one of the things I do like about the zoom lens it does have optical image stabilization whereas previous version did not so yeah to me and you don't even know what I'm saying anymore all right let's get out of here [Music] you [Music]

wearing it anyway so for the cookies we're gonna need 1 cup unsalted butter 1 cup of granulated white sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 1 egg two teaspoons baking powder three cups all-purpose flour all right now that we have all of our ingredients let's let's assemble this hot mess and get these cookies started this is kind of softened but I feel like I might need to make it a little bit more warm so I'm gonna pop these in the microwave and then we're going to cream the sugar and the butter together I think that's good enough looks good to me oh wow wait and we've got our sugar put that in just like so okay let's start mixing this up can you plug it in make sure you always lock your mixer if you guys don't you should cuz I've made some mistakes you just turn down I'm gonna make sure this is all mixed in there everything's off the bottom so next we're gonna beat in the eggs and the extracts now we've got our butter and sugar mixture we're going to work on our dry ingredients how many two teaspoons of baking powder because I'll just mix this in with this this works oh now we're going to slowly mix in our dry ingredients into the butter mixture very very slowly here we go super-exciting oh yeah let's just get in somewhere now it's now we have our day already we're gonna borscht with us out into six different little sections and then we're gonna take each of those portions and we're going to dye them different colors so let's get out some saran wrap and we're gonna portion this out I'm concerned that this might not be enough but I guess we can just see what happens if you need more you can always make double this recipe didn't you little dough go to your home wonder what this tastes like mmm Wow I think I put too much bomb and extract it but I like almonds so this is good oh wow mmm I'm definitely gonna win don't forget to vote for my cookie at facebook.com slash play cookie Jim all right that's portion a sucker out a little bit of you a little more of you this looks like a little dinosaur look at him Wow so the first color I'm gonna do is purple because why it's one of my favorite colors much good Jam that in there and this dye is Wow it's powerful just drop some of that in there [Music] there he goes it looks perfect like look at that that's all I had to do it's not gonna go through wait to die the rest of these and you know what I just need to lighten the load a little bit I need to feel a little bit better about what I'm gonna do because this takes a lot of time because every time I do a color I then have to freakin reset because I don't want to mix in the other dull colors so gosh the struggle maybe I should just quit YouTube and just start juggling okay let's roll get in there [Music] go little buddy go so now we have our dill all colored I'm marking off some parchment paper so I know the size of the dough to roll this will make sense in a second please hold now we're gonna be rolling the dough on top of a fresh piece of parchment paper because you don't want to be rolling dough directly onto Sharpie because I'm not sure if you guys realize this or not but sharpies not edible surprise so you can see pretty clearly our little square that we've got marked off you can basically make this any size but since the dough that I rolled out wasn't very much I don't want to make it too big or I will run out we need to make an egg wash now I googled this because I didn't know what it was and we're gonna be putting the egg white in between each color so that'll kind of help it all stick together when it bakes it's now we need an egg white so we're gonna put a little the egg whites in here with a very touch of water get yourself a baking pan like this I'm gonna line it with some parchment paper as well so the first color we're gonna do is all red so basically gonna be rolling it out to be about size of this okay so this looks like it would fit in the square and now we're just gonna be cutting along these lines - I left the lines a little bit longer so you can just kind of cut along those just like so and that will give you a nice even little triangle this isn't it your ankle its right so we've got a rectangle here and now we're gonna be placing this over here and then we're basically gonna be repeating this five other times which is Wow doesn't that sound like fun flip it over plop it down so I'd recommend kind of like cleaning this off between each one because some of the color may transfer on to the other color and that's something that you do not want so the next time we're gonna do is the I guess gold orangish color get this square off [Music] now before we put this on to here we're gonna put that little egg whitewash on top of it okay you're just gonna kind of brush it on real nice real nice now we just put this oh god no no no no don't do it don't you break don't break on me buddy you could do it you to be very careful everything looks good and we're basically gonna be going through this whole process and learn all of these colors on top of this little guy and I'm gonna just press it down just a little bit there you go okay now we're gonna repeat this process four more times so let's go [Music] [Music] it looks so great like I'm so excited I'm gonna press this down just a little bit to get them all kinda sorta you know making friends make friends you guys are gonna be spending some time together would you take a look at this so I put this in the fridge for about 30 minutes to an hour while I'm making the icing and then I'm gonna cut this in half and put this half on top of this house so that we can make even more cookies out of this little slab I'm drink mine your butt mati I'm gonna clean up and then we're gonna start the icing so one two three clean now it's time to make our icing this is a pretty simple recipe I've never made it before it looks simple so it could potentially be difficult I don't know first we're just over there unsalted butter we need a cup witches two sticks if you didn't know so I'm gonna beat the butter on medium speed until creamy it says approximately two minutes but we'll see maybe that'll cut down on the speed we can do it for one minute I think I'm gonna turn down for for what for the next ingredients we've got cocoa heavy cream this is a lot of stuff I just don't know how this is all gonna work out let's just start dumping no it said slow I can't mess this up I've one job a little leave one job I'm just staring at it just waiting waiting patiently or something to happen spit on the rest of it scream Wow look at this this is great mixie I think time wow there's a lot of stuff in here I usually just need a store-bought icing but I thought today I'm gonna really class it up because I'm really gunning for your votes in this contest so I want you guys to be real proud of me for doing it all but myself beside the icing off to the side let's take a look and see how the cookies are doing our sloth has been cooling some spouts say probably an hour or so so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut this in half and I'm gonna place these top half on to this half so that'll give us a lot more to work with like take a look at that look how great it is Wow so now we're gonna place that on top of here I lost my my things so I'm just gonna just do that don't worry I wash my hands so many times but like my hands are cracking can you get this as even as possible it looks beautiful so here's the rough part is because it's not exactly even so I'm gonna kind of just cut this all off to make it nice and even just so sad so we're basically gonna be just like cutting out the center of this I can probably do oh yes look at that now is the magic so what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be cutting a very small little slice of this and that's we're gonna be using for the template of the cookie so we'll be sliced this it creates a nice little rainbow effect we use this and we do this and then wallah follow along at home this is a very very simple thing I definitely encourage you to try this don't have to do it first cuz is it the deepest I think I think that's how the song goes here's our first lab we're basically just gonna keep repeating this until we don't have any more left one single cookie [Music] we have cookies lot of effort very very little reward it's like life 10 cookies and this took me like like five hours so I think I'm gonna cook these for about eight to ten minutes Alexa set a timer for eight minutes we let this bake and then we're gonna ice them up and hope that everything works out well I can't believe how much time that took so we've got our I think about our cookies in the oven everything is actually going very very well and very according to plan so I'm quite surprised and also nervous so what we're gonna do is we're gonna prep for the icing I'm gonna put it in an icing bag because I kind of want it to look as good as possible who know what's coming out of the side well awesome with that okay we're taking them out now I can't chance this I can't chance this Alexa stop this is my life's legacy cookie jam these look so great I'm so happy here are the rainbow cookies now we're gonna fill these things with our homemade chocolate icing and we're gonna make some cookie sandwiches this is it this is everything this is I think a nipple more icing in it but it's a good start this is a good start I'm into it I'm real into it okay next one we're gonna get five whole cookies that's a lot of icing oh my goodness good here we go

Hughes maybe we could just put together half of it well that's just gonna look like a shrub I mean I'm okay with that if you are I'm invested now Justine this is gonna happen so we're not decorating a

you you you you you you [Music] [Music] so Jack what you up to I've been enjoying all that gratz has to offer well we really should be getting over to the factory you can do to come yes Jessica [Music] the word grats comes from the Slavic word meaning small Castle says here the grants has six universities one of the best-preserved city centres in central europe it's all very interesting jack but we've must really get over to that pace launched in rats has over a thousand different architectural styles to see 34 museums two galleries festivals exhibitions are lively covering comedy scene and over seven hectares of contemporary sculpture and you're taking me to see a factory yep sure AM it's better beware it'll be worth it trust me [Music] [Applause] hello and welcome I am Chuck white for and you join me live here in Graz Austria for the launch of Jaguars first ever electric vehicle the new Jaguar ipace but why am I in grass it's a question I have been asking myself again and again gratz widely regarded as one of Europe's greatest cities it had why laughing that serious it has so much to offer like the gratz burg a government building which boasts two spiral staircases which is the most spiral staircases in any building in all of Graz and you would be insane on your trip not to go and visit the Shahs burg wall voted one of the most beautiful walls in all of Europe if you like walls you came to the right place but this is not a sure about gratz no we're here because this is the epicenter in the field of hydroelectric power in the EU you didn't think rats could get better it just did I also bet you didn't know that Austria ranks amongst the most specialized countries in Europe in the field of mechanical engineering and although the cars are designed and engineered in the UK Jaguar produced cars all over the world with this being the actual state of the art production facility where the e pace and now the ipace are produced I mean literally being produced right now I don't know whether that is that gonna go on for the whole show because I'm finding it quite distracting could we stop it maybe maybe kill it oh my god that's actually worked I do

says I am so excited that Jaguar is now making electric cars what a future forward brand and we couldn't agree with you more James says this is the most beautiful Jaguar I have ever seen so you guys keep those questions and your comments coming in and we'll be reading those all throughout the night now over in the factory is Johnny Smith and my question is Johnny where are you I'm here Justine I'm here in the middle of the plant where the very latest robot technology is right behind me as these eight creatures construct the aluminium frame of the eye pace and the whole procedure is completely autonomous there's a bunch of robots here all moving in absolute unison it reminds me of that time I went to the N Sync concert yeah anyway what they're doing is they're using a combination of rivets and aerospace glue to construct the body show anyway just yesterday the oil paste was put through its paces its high paces where it took on a challenge in Mexico with a little help from the Panasonic Jaguar formula e team and our presenter Natalie Pinker is over there to join in with a four-wheeled electric phone hello Natalie very special reveal of the brand-new Jaguar ipace two cars two drivers and the challenge naught to 60 miles per hour and back to a standstill as fast as possible join us a little later to find out who wins mmm I don't want to spoil things but I'm pretty sure the better-looking proper car wins the British one still to come we have got the results of that race and the car unveiling and even more excitingly you in the studio and at home will get to see the live sparkling chemistry between me and my new best friend Ian Callum director of design please remember to keep your questions and comments coming in hashtag jaguar electrifies and hashtag ipace as we get ever closer to the reveal of the ipace here in lovely grats anyway everyone is always talking about smart technology if like me you still think a CD Auto changer is impressive then the ipace will blow your tiny minds the new ipace is so easy to get your head round one could even call it child's play and here is a short film that proves it hi I'm here to pick up my new ipace okay very funny are your parents here [Music] the whole car is a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot where's the button to delete internet history you know just in case um buying a gift for someone I don't want them to see what it is inside the cabin are six USB ports guys already way ahead of you I piece recognizes your key fob as your approach and automatically adjusts to your preferences like same jump seat position and your favorite radio station coming up next don't Celine Dion fm obviously that's broken Youngblood systems Bolton AI that's what I'm talking about spy stuff where is the ejector seat button there is no eject to see hubcap lasers it's a learning computer that calculates your exact range based on weather traffic and your driving style you two are cramping my style I'm out of here zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds 696 Newton meters of torque talk I'm all about the talk you don't even know what torque is do you talk is my middle name actually it says here it's Benedict any questions one question which one of you is gonna teach me to drive you don't know how to drive no I do [Music] well it can't be that hard [Music] so it seems there are three golden rules in this industry never work with children animals or genic Whitehall's anyway I'm in production heaven in the middle of the factory where a combination of humans and robots just here fit the axle to the chassis now even if you have no idea what an axle is and you didn't know that it fits into a street corner doesn't matter just look at that precision this is a beautiful sight and this happens here in gratz every single day and this process of the the engine or the electric motors being joined to the body show is called the marriage and in the case of the ipace it's got two electric motors one on the back axle and one on the front axle because it's four-wheel drive now I'm going to continue watching this for a couple of minutes because I'm totally transfixed by it and then I'm going to come and join you Jack for the big reveal No either I've accidentally turned on the heated seat or I've soiled myself oh sorry so and I paste takes about eight hours to build once it's in the trim part of the factory but it only takes a fraction of that time to charge let's see where we are with our charging studio car 38% not bad at all and now the moment I've been waiting for over in Mexico where the I pace is about to take part in a fantastic head-to-head challenge a quarter or mile a deserted section of a formula e track two fully charged batteries who will win I am on the edge of my extremely comfortable and well-designed iPay seat [Music] [Music] welcome to Mexico on Saturday this track will host the latest round of the ABV Formula e championship but we're here to celebrate the launch of the brand-new Jaguar ipace with a very special challenge showing the innovating from race to Road has placed Jaguar at the forefront of the TV revolution and here it is the I paced all-electric all-wheel drive and nought to 60 in just four point five seconds so what of its Challenger we've brought along a car from an established player in the EU markets but does it have what it takes to beat the Jaguar ipace in our head-to-head challenge driving the eye pace is panasonic Jaguar racing Kiwi formulary star Mitch Evans in the Tesla is Brazilian Indy 500 winner and former IndyCar champ Tony Kanaan the challenge is very simple from a standing start the drivers have to reach 60 miles per hour as fast as possible and then break to a standstill the one carrying the shortest distance wins capiche I got it who's gonna win the eye pace is later Darrell I've got this come on then enough of the talking get in the cars so the pressure is on can the ipace become the envy tipping's this thing is a beast you've got zero chance bring it on [Music] [Music] [Music] this is quite a walk may I smashed it I need a faster car can you give me the P 100 d well for the price of a P 100 day I could almost buy 2 of these sure sure me I still get another car to try ok that is the bigger brother to the first Model X it's the 100 d it's more powerful than the 75 d but will it be quick enough to beat the AI pace let's find out [Music] yes so two of two Jagua have won it by similar distance again you're pretty smug and rightly so how did it feel yeah it was great the responses in sin and also pulled up really well surprise yes eight I had him but two out of two oh I give up proof then that Jaguar are really set to shake out the Eevee revolution I think we need to pop into Mexico City and sample a few sights and delights I agree dinner and he's buying it done come on [Music] yeah how is that for a challenge the ipace one of course but what do you expect from a car they can go from nought to 60 in 4.5 seconds with a 90 kilowatt hour battery did I why why have I started talking about Jeremy Clarkson I don't know what have I seen electric vehicle with a sports car performance making it one of the greatest cars in the world the new Jaguar ipace sophisticated and great looking a bit like its designer Ian Callum director of design [Music] ladies and gentlemen the reason we are all here today in gratz police show your appreciation for the stunning new Jaguar I pace [Applause] [Applause] ladies and gentlemen I give you the brand-new check your eye pace and it's designer Ian Callum director of design Wow Wow can I just say so damn stylish and the car is great as well I mean you must be so proud it looks very crazy we're all very proud of it yes I would drive that car Jack you can't drive I would get driven in that car it's beautiful congratulations and I know how eager many of you today are to get behind the wheel of this car well now you can as of this moment it is available to own now still to come I'll be chatting to my new best friend the yin to my yang the secret to my roy ian callum director of design and i'll also be meeting a second Ian Ian Hoban don't worry you're my favorite keep your questions coming in hashtag Jaguar electrifies and hashtag ipace now a chance to discover how the Jaguar team produced not just another electric car but a true Jaguar car that sounded you like the sound of that though I should do the voiceovers for Jaguar definitely you're gonna this is my favorite line in the whole script get ready for this brace yourself you're gonna love it the car that electricity has been waiting for yeah that's good come on drag bigwigs you love that let's find out a little more I'm really passionate about sustainability my business is based around building low-energy houses and encouraging people to live learners your lifestyles so is this a family car as well yeah absolutely I mean really really a very good get your packaging dimensions director and so if the battery mounted on dampers or something the battery is actually a structural part of the car try again so the batteries solidly mounted to the frame we didn't think that's just a massive advantage again it's harnessing the benefits of having a battery of it being an Eevee to make it a better car yeah such fun and it's really incredible it felt so sure-footed and it felt like a proper off-roader you could actually take it pretty much anywhere in the space inside as well really impressive felt very comfortable I'm 6 foot 4 from Headroom and so that's all really good with a TV with a good range and go off-road can go very fast can do everything I guess [Music] I'm joined by a Callen to take a closer look around the new jag your IPAs hey how are you yes good good so this is your newest baby it is and the team yeah and it's fair to say that it is unconventional for a Jag it is very unconventional anyway I mean it's yeah quite different isn't it yeah well for starters things in jankier terms long bonnet where's that gone yeah long bonnets we had long bonnets because we're big engines ok the v8 so six cylinders there is no engine the front of this except a small electric motor sitting between the wheels so we can have a short bonnet and the great thing about that of course is it gives all the rest of the room over to the occupants right advantage it's quite Aero efficient was it designed by the wind tunnel or was it designed by you a lot of physics in this car I have to tell you the airflow comes through this vent here the front off the front flows over the roof perfectly formed roof to hold onto there then through to the back but it holds on to the car all the way through all but physics this is quite an abrupt backside can I say it is especially for a Jaguar but you know believe it or not Square back ends in the car are more efficient for aerodynamics than rounded back ends yep worth bearing in mind yeah so we've cut off the back and we've followed physics 30 on this car for the right reasons yep right let's go into the place where you live when you drive a car because this is the thing I've got for you viewers I'm a special I've got any in Callum cam look come on cam it's a bit creepy but don't worry it's so that I can show people what we're going to talk about take me through this because obviously this is the place where you live in a car so the cockpits all important it is you know it's got more space than it had before of a car of its size but the great thing been working on is the amount of usable space and the practicality for instance the centre console has got a an opening here under the armrest and it's 10 litres of space 10/10 almost large enough to take a handbag troika be useful goodness Johnny that H big yeah that is big that's fantastic yeah so you've got the occupant space presumably to design electric car is it a bit liberating compared to what you're used to yes it's usually liberating you know from the wheel the wheel centers upwards it's it's a free free range of for so we can do what we want above it and it meant it means we can do the shape draw the shape that we want above the wheels yeah it's radical its Israeli is it fair to say that this is as radical as the XJ was 50 years in 1968 yes unfortunately remember 1968 quite well yes I think this car the XJ was a very radical car a 96 it this car is just as radical now as that was then maybe even more so really yeah I think so you watch this space I think it will be well thank you very much thank you very much in well obviously there's a bit of a buzz going on on social media about this car right now it's growing and growing and iJustine is there maintaining law and order for us what's going on Justine there is a lot going on online and everyone here is also excited but everyone online is also very very excited and I have some tweets here this one specifically from Sergio I have never been a car guy until they went electric now the new Jaguar looks like something out of a movie so hopefully soon we will see this in some future movies we have one here from gadget Jack who says what's your favourite feature of the new ipace one of the things that I most love is I've always wanted to have an electric vehicle and I think this will be my first one I love how spacious it is and it looks amazing - and Doug we've got here it says it's great to see such a well-respected car manufacturer getting serious about evey I agree Doug now the I paste looks awesome and I love the tech and especially the in control apps and I can't wait to get my Spotify playlist on my driving track of choice is shape of you by Ed Sheeran hey Jack no you my driving track well when me and Ian go on our long drives in the countryside we tend to listen to Michael Buble together don't we nobody okay we don't oh as you can see Ian is back now with me in one of his beautifully designed chairs and we have had lots of questions coming in we're gonna try and answer as many as possible fan questions for Ian Callum I don't know whether that's fans of cars or specifically Ian Callum fans that's how much of a big dog he is in the automotive world he has his own fandom they're like Beliebers but mainly men in their 60s okay stop it you're feeling me no first question what is your favorite thing about the ipace I love the overall shape of the car it's quite distinctive is quite different it's quite radical and of course the fact it is electric guilt free guilt free how much has it changed from the original concept cars what we see here actually very little a few millimeters here neighbour overall this does represent the concept car we built a concept car that you can buy how difficult is it building a car around a battery rather than an engine it's actually much simpler to be honest with you because you have much more freedom you don't have to worry about these great big lumps of met will be used to deal with so it's actually a little easier yeah more fun more fun much more fun Jags have power and presence like their designer Ian Callum it doesn't say that I've added that um these are fine questions how different is it driving a battery version without the engine roar well you know jag has have been known for the roar of their v8s and strict sixes but also there's a serenity in Jagger's history as well the lovely limousines that were very smooth to drive this car is full of serenity and quietness and it's a wonderful place to be it also has a wonderful interior will we see a host of new Jaguar cars with this new modern interior yes this is actually a template for the next generation of jakers you'll see lots more of this and all of our cars a final question this comes from your biggest fan he's called Jack and he's from London and he asks will we be keeping in touch after this event yes jack thank you in now yes Rommel applause please now one of the biggest concerns for drivers when purchasing an electric car is whether or not it will get you to where you want to go well maybe this will put your mind at rest [Music] my name's Simon Purcell we're out here in LA with Jacobs ipace our first electric car this is a TT car talling tryout car it's one of the first vehicles after the actual production facility we have over 200 prototypes we're gonna take a road all the way to morrow base so we'll have a good opportunity to see about this battery range so we're gonna do this entire trip without stopping to charge the car will be capable of delivering more than this kind of range in real world so let's go [Music] how long does the battery in a car like this last we design a battery life to be at least 10 years it's nice to not have to trade up considering the environment and wanting an electric car but also being able to benefit from the luxury of a Jaguar car so and what do you think of the Ray trip I truly enjoyed this road trip I think this is a great car it is absolutely comfortable it's a great ride and can't wait for it to be on the market I'm here to witness the moment where the all-important 90 kilowatt hour battery pack down there is brought up and met the chassis of the ipace there but how does the I pace battery actually work well earlier today Jack and I attempted to demonstrate just that for the help of a large host pipe and a whole load of buckets [Music] okay I'm going to try and explain how an I paste battery pack works and how you go about charging it I cannot wait okay let's start with a basic to charge a battery you need to supply voltage greater than the battery itself via some kind of charger got it the greater the difference between the battery voltage and the charge of voltage the quicker charges what will charge the battery the other thing to explain is that in the case of the I place it has 432 individual battery cells Oh like the graphs Carlisle prison interestingly the third-largest prison in the whole of Austria the 432 high energy density lithium ion pouch cells they do kind of look like cover suits are arranged in groups and these are called modules okay imagine a bucket of water what color is the bucket it doesn't matter it's important to me okay grey good cuz that's what I was imagining to charge a battery we need to fill these buckets of water without spilling in estates village is bad johnny has spillage issues he hates spinach I split the buckets to represent three modules okay twelve cells per module dust 36 bucket our trustee if we fill them from a hose from to greater height gravity and also pressure you'll cause a lot of spinach if your hose is too high there will be a lot of spinach yeah Johnny's fixin exactly like this [Music] not very efficient lots of spillage but slow the water pressure down and maybe reduce the height you can brim the buckets more efficiently so if you get your hose closer and you reduce your flow less village exactly spillage is inherently inefficient clever thing about this battery is that the cells are not charged individua they're all charged in unison in these buckets it looks negligible imagine trying to fill a swimming pool with a hose it wouldn't really happen but having met my pool boy becomes very highly rated okay there's one thing I failed to mention as well about my pool boy no good because a decent one is hard to come by these days at the end there's something important that happens and this is called cell balancing this means they're all constantly being topped up evenly and this ensures the longevity the battery pack and also the maximization of charge and balancing the cells ensures that the battery doesn't go over 450 volts yes exactly can I ride one other fire engines now I'll put your hose away Johnny thank you Jack and Johnny I think we all learned a lot here and I'm hanging out now with jim chapman so this is pretty exciting so how are you doing I'm all right I think it's been a long time since I've seen you yes it's good to see you again you too I love the way you say Jaguar okay I don't even want to talk about it I'm sorry that's how we say it you've literally never sounded more American than being right here in Austria well it's super exciting to be here now if you do you see yourself living with an IV or than Evie I mean is this gonna be the I pace will this be your electric car that you go to yeah totally I think that a big thing to me is my carbon footprint at the moment I travel a lot for work and I'm trying to make cutbacks whenever I can so I want to have solar panels on my roof I want to start driving electric and I think this is it's really sexy to look at it still looks like ejaculate but it has all the benefits of being electric and you're gonna be doing a live stream on Instagram later - correct I am pretty much as soon as this is over head over to Jaguar on Instagram because I'm gonna be taking over and kind of giving sort of a behind-the-scenes e-type thing I might chat to you I chat to Jack chatting to Ian I'm gonna try and out Jack him if I can nice so Jaguar or Jaguar what do you think I think Jaguar okay I will try my best throughout the rest of the show right now we're gonna go find out where Johnny is because he's been everywhere the show Johnny where you at I just ain't have a look at this here we are on the rolling road this is the bit where the eye pace is being driven up and having a full systems check for the very first time remarkable think that eight hours ago this vehicle was just a collection of parts and of course because this car is electric it's now ready to drive and it can be driven indoors without any kind of exhaust emissions I can't wait to get behind the wheel Jack it's a great time to be a driver sorry jack no offence mate I'm gonna stay here and savor the moment for a bit Jack it's back to you in the studio you a medium or a large oh sorry I was just buying men in some lads on tour t-shirts to commemorate our dirty weekend in Graz okay I am now joined by Jaguars vehicle line director Ian ho burn welcome another legend in the world of Jaguar firstly what is a vehicle line director I worked to get this one right all no really yes yeah hundreds thousands of engineers have put their heart and soul into this car and I incredibly privileged to lead that team of engineer amazing that we've got some questions for you as well first up in the absence of an engine what makes this car go though it'll be the two electric motors one motor on the front axle and one on the rear in fact you can see the motors just behind me hanging up how far does it go on a charge so on a single charge ipace will go 480 kilometers that's almost 300 miles it depends a bit on how you drive but 480 kilometers and how long does it take to charge at home so at home it will charge in just over 12 hours from completely empty to completely full so it will charge overnight at home and in fact if you're out and about you can use a DC charger and you can charge from nought to 80% in less than 40 minutes I dunno what to do now cuz my next question is how long does it charge Alfie about sorry I'm gonna have to think on my feet and come up with another question in them oh dear does it have any cupholders yes it does have cupholders save miss know about cupholders and it has four for two in the front and two in the perceptional okay that was a silly question I'll end with a serious technical question how many rugby players could you fit in it I'm talking forwards or backs all very good let's go it backs backs five easily and a scrum half in the boot in the boot and it's got two boots a front boot has the fruit a boot at the front are we calling it a fruit or a front I think we're British so we should call it a fruit fruit the fruit Ian say fruit and therefore it is fruit thank you Ian's now when the jack your team tests the cars they really test the cars from extreme weather conditions to excessive driving the tests a rigorous and thorough just the way I like my tests designated to replicate a lifetime of customer use it's this car s safe on the road s normal car the stability control we have fantastic front to rear bias we're also able to talk vector across the car so we can control the talk that we apply across the car with the brakes as well aside you feel the the handle light compares to a conventional car I thought it would be bigger different like weird feeling but in this fits really good ciara good good we have four wheels right yeah yeah doesn't feel like a family car they the car felt much smoother than I thought and yeah it was a pleasant surprise it was really good [Music] [Music] [Applause] Johnny's back how was that for you as a self-proclaimed car geek yeah it was actually I mean I loved factories anyway I'm one of those people I love to see how things are put together jaguar of clearly positioned themselves as a tech leading car company so yeah good times does it come in blue does it come in blue it does actually yeah cesium blue metallic it would it would suit you well we are nearly at the end of the show so let's find out how the charge is going oh yeah this is the bit where I ask you ask her yeah Alexa Alexa asked Jaguar remote how long until my car is fully charged your car is currently 62% charged it will be fully charged in 27 minutes is there anything else I can help you with today [Music] there is but not in front of a live audience Alexa please can you put me and Ian Callum down on the guest list for Paradise gentleman's spa in grass that's a lot of charge at this level he'll get you to Prague from Vienna Prague impressive yeah it only matter of time before we the charge is finished but first ladies and gentlemen we're going to be thrown back over to the wonderful iJustine thanks Jack now there is just enough time for a few more last-minute messages and I have everyone telling me that I've been mispronouncing Jaguar the entire time but guys that's how we say it over there in America we have a couple more here which everyone seems very excited and I'm pretty excited bout the alexa integration we have a question comment here from Nick Dobson on Twitter says this launch looks so electrified I want to be there we wish you were here too Nick danny is saying Jaguars going electric this is a dream come true where do I sign up and Nick loves the modern feel of this car is this the future yes it definitely is well thank you guys so much for tuning in that's all for me here I had so much fun in Graz and enjoy the rest of the show ladies and gentlemen get your wallets and your credit cards ready the books are now open you can buy an eye pace so go and get one and be the envy of all of your friends Thank You Justine I feel genuinely enlightened about today we've witnessed the future and yet here it is today you can go and own it pretty cool you taught me about spillage as well we've learnt so much spillage thank you so much for joining us here today in grats for the live global reveal of the new Jaguar ipace still to come we have some of the incredible highlights from the show and the world premiere of the documentary that you will not want to miss thank you everyone for tuning in for more details and to of course watch this show again which hopefully you will go head to jaguar comm thank you and goodbye [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] January 2018 a new Jaguar is heading down the production line [Music] but this vehicle is unlike anything the company has made before [Music] this is the eye pace Jaggi was first ever electric car and the front-runner in a transport revolution we've decided to go into this challenge sooner rather than later because we are jacket because of history's urban innovation because we're not frightened of the new designed from the ground up the ipace is engineered to be tough with aerodynamic lines and a long-range battery powering an exhilarating drive [Music] this is the story of how this radical new car was made and of how it changes everything [Music] the ipace project began with the highest ambition to make the world's finest electric car but achieving this would push Jagger as designers and engineers to the limit it's the first big change in a hundred years in the motor industry and that's the real challenge for us designing a brand new car is no easy task it would take nearly four years from first sketch to finished vehicle but going electric and needing no engine comes with sizable benefits giving the design team far greater freedom in shaping the car so remove the people forward so we'll put the cabin yeah like so yeah so it's actually heading towards the front wheels very different but I think they saw how your work I think it's gonna work really really nice proportion so it's all about the drama of the front hunched and in the rear horn sweeping Bank this cab forwards design has given the eye pace ample room for five large adults none of this would have been possible with a conventional engine at the front powering the ipace is a sophisticated long-range battery so this is one of our early prototypes of the battery it's fairly large it basically fits from the rear wheels to the front wheels so the lowest point of this battery is the lowest point of the vehicle the heart of this battery is the cell which is not dissimilar to what you'd find in the tablets or a mobile phone but we have a lot more of them we have 432 in this pack and there's a lot of infrastructure that facilitates the control and the cooling and ultimately the performance of this battery this new temperature controlled battery allows the ipace to travel 480 kilometers on a single charge so we've got to a point where the range of an electric vehicle is something that people can relate to their daily laughs but there's more to this new battery technology than range alone [Music] fast charging points are springing up worldwide giving the iPass a charge time from empty to 80% of less than 45 minutes and with artificial intelligence technology to recognize the driver from their key fault and calculate the cars range based on their driving style and regular journeys the AI pace is at the forefront of the electric revolution [Music] back in the design studio the result of months of creative effort is gradually beginning to show and not just on a computer screen [Music] this is technical modeling clay Ian Astbury job is to cut it to shape it is great to say common out of just a lump of clay [Music] this has got people's hand prints on the front prints on it hard work and sweet the drill bit follows a pre-programmed route shaping the car was utmost precision but from start to finish with rough cuts and finish cuts we could probably do a full car in about five days I feel like it's an important moment because it's the birth of something really isn't it but nothing can replace human skills when it comes to shaping the clay the human element is massively important because without that love and care that you you know put into a model it wouldn't be the same you're sculpting a car you're using clay and you're using tools to make something come alive it is a sculpture in a sense with the clay model nearing completion ian callum arrives for one of his regular inspections hey guys all right what's your about good ok what do you think but I think I think is fantastic obviously fantastic the definition of the cabin and the haunches it's just right now it's superb he's got all the power towards the front and yeah I love it but the stunning shape of the eye pace is more than just the work of the designers [Music] the engineering team also play a crucial role and with prototype cars now available they're preparing for a vital test one that will influence the shape of the car and the range of its battery good test aerodynamics [Music] this is a full-scale wind tunnel which can go up to 260 kilometers an hour and it's something that is controlled just by a press of a button so until you come in here you have no idea exactly the sheer size of what's behind your test this really allows us to identify where key tweaks and changes how they're impacting the rest of the flow on the vehicle it's a really really powerful visual technique for that this is one of the first prototypes that were actually built for the real bodywork but we still have some prototype parts on the car itself we've done lots of work on plane models calculations but now this is a real car truth time [Music] it's our first electric vehicle which means that something like aerodynamics is even more important we have to try and optimize it as much as we possibly can but even millimeters of changes hugely impacts the range of the vehicle [Music] okay that's looking good in today's test the team analyzing one of the I paces most striking features the air bypass it with no engine the air flows in through the grille and out through the duct so what we were able to see with the smoke is the air being diverted through that duct and actually creating a much better angle on to that front windscreen which hugely impacts the aerodynamics and ultimately the range of the earth as well [Music] tests like this have resulted in a car that slices cleanly through the air greatly increasing the distance it can travel on a single charge [Music] the eye pace is so aerodynamic and it's electric motors so silent that exterior noise could easily spoil the cabins tranquility so engineers are trying to identify where noise might enter the car they all have here is an acoustic camera so for instance for us to click like this it means to my fingers because of the high energy level created at my fingertips today the team are using the camera to analyze the dashboard of this prototype car that there is the perfect view wherever you've got that yeah cool that's perfect I'm out you're good to go this kind of testing ensures that the IPS will be as refined as any other Jaguar ultimately our aim is to create the most refined battery electric vehicle on the market today whether that's road noise motor noise wind noise anything we need to just get down to the lower level as possible but making a near-silent electric car creates another challenge like all Jaguars the IPAs is designed to be fun Ian so fields job is to ensure it sounds fun too if I just start with the the first car model that we've got I will then go in and add some sound at about somewhere between sort of 50 to 100 kilometers an hour such that it represents when you are accelerating up so you get the sense of power of the car in the electric eye base there's no engine noise to give dynamic feedback to the driver so Ian is creating his own it will play through the car speakers the next layer of sound I introduced to to progress is from about 100 kilometers upwards this is where the sound starts getting a little bit edgier a little bit sharper as if that's not enough right at the very top end above about a hundred and forty I've got a another sound that comes in this even edgy is still so this is us absolutely flooring it we've got a lovely a trace color hound there in the real sense of actually we really want to pull this car forward and it's in line with that heritage just you know we have a history of making great sounding really fast cars so this one needs to be no exception but an exciting sounding car isn't enough the team also wanted to be tough so they brought a prototype to Jaguars proving ground for a high-impact test sophisticated sensors fitted by the engineers will record how the ipace copes with severe bumps on the road okay Doug we ready [Music] the car cycles through different tests on different surfaces but this is only the start because the information gathered here is now taken back to the engineering lab where the car is really put through its paces this test will run for the next eight weeks the IPS it's a new step for us but we still test it to the same level as we would any other product but there's more to this car than its robustness [Music] [Applause] the ipace is a Jaguar through and through so the team have come to Italy to ensure it drives like one [Music] this is the Nardo ring a banked circle of tarmac so large it can be seen from space it's one of the few places on earth where cars can be constantly pushed to the limit [Music] today the I place is being tested at maximum velocity VMAX [Music] but regular pitstop safety checks are essential [Music] okay with the midday temperature at 35 degrees okay okay they saw the team carefully monitor the heat generated by the cars constant high speed cornering we have to keep a close eye on aware and terror that rate that's some of them can reach up to 650 degrees pit stop complete the car heads back to the track ready state it's hot tiring work yet the team are determined that the eye pace will drive like a true Jaguar but Italy was only the beginning in total the team clocked up over 1.5 million test miles worldwide even minus 40 in the Arctic on their mission to make the world's finest electric car this is the eye pace the first all-electric performance SUV from Jaguar the future [Music] 
hey guys how's it going of happy holidays it's another video about the festive season I have a hot glue gun today we are going to decorate holiday iPhone cases so you got two cases here I have a

done [Music] you 
hey guys it's Justine and today I am so excited because we have got four different drones that we're gonna be testing out the pneumatic air just came out so we're gonna test that in comparison to but the Mavic Pro Platinum the DJI spark and the phantom 4 pro advanced and here's our little Mavic air my precious I've never even seen that movie so I don't even get the reference Serena I'm updating one of the apps before we go and then we're gonna start flying I got two phones one for my friends one for Mara [Music] we've got all four of our drones lined up we're gonna do a quick little test basically just getting a nice little camera view here without anything moving I do have to shoot the spark separately because it connects to Wi-Fi and all of these things are interfering with it so first we'll shoot these three then the spark hopefully it all sort of look the same record record phantom record 4k 34 k 30 I'm gonna do a quick little walk in front of it [Music] [Music] so that's the magic Pro platinum out right now and one of the things that was new about this is it supposedly is 40% quieter and listening to it now it is a lot more quiet even the pneumatic air [Music] that's reviewing the footage from all four of the drones one of the things that I was most shocked at was the variance in color between the four I put everything on auto auto color balance out of exposure pretty much everything so that you guys can see exactly what you would be getting directly out of the drones one of the things that I thought though it was kind of shocking is the best auto color came from the spark I've even noticed differences between the two of the same exact drones like my sister we both have a Matic Pro and even flying those on seemingly the same settings sometimes I will be like this looks different than yours so I felt like that's something that's pretty common but what's great is you can pretty much customize anything so depending upon what the light is like so you can set the color balance to match wherever you are another cool thing that we tried out in Malibu is Nathan was flying his phantom 4 and he added a lot on to his footage so he was doing this in camera on the drone so basically what I'm going to show you now is what he shot this is right from the drone to your eyes I am doing no color Corrections all habit [Music] shutter speed for drones is that you should actually shoot with a slower shutter speed so if you're filming at 30 frames a second it's not a bad idea to film at a 30th of a second so you have to have enjoyed NC filter when the drone is moving through space you're taking pictures as you shoot video so feel stepping as you watch playback of the drone with a sharp shutter that's moving fast it feels like fun so I started the day with my ND filter this is the DJI and this is the 8th filter so far there aren't any available yet for thematic air but I do use them when I'm flying with my maverick or my phantom especially on sunny days because it makes a huge difference one of the things that I forgot to mention on the mavic air review is they have two new smart capture features they have the asteroid and boomerang so basically the drone will do a set flight pattern and we'll save that right to your phone so you're able to share that out immediately let's say my favorite is probably the asteroid so basically the drone follows the flight pattern directly up so does a really cool spherical shot of everything around you [Music] although boomerang it just takes off and creates a boomerang pattern so it goes up outs and then back to recommence [Music] so far I'm loving the Medicare it's amazing but the only problem is the battery life it does only last 21 minutes which is still a fair amount of flight time but I'm so used to having extra batteries and for this I only had one so I've been struggling and shooting this video for the past like week and a half because every time I go to film I only have like 21 minutes until I can go back and charge the battery right now the Sun is going down my battery's dead so whatever I shot is whatever I shot the batteries die very very quickly so I definitely recommend if you are gonna be getting this do get the fly more package it is worth the extra money for the extra batteries because you're gonna need them hey Jen that I could have that uh that time-lapse you're shooting oh I'll buy you dinner I'll buy you dinner my goodness guys this time-lapse is courtesy of it's me Jenna a YouTube channel go subscribe hey do you let me see the new drone or fly the new drone at all not yet I'm sorry this is gonna cost you dinner this is it's me Jenny Farnsworth's I press the button [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you [Music] 
hey guys how's it go it's Justine and today is a very long overdue video today I'm gonna go through all of the updated gear that I use to shoot my youtube videos before we get started if you're a beginner this was nothing that I would have ever been able to get when I first started making YouTube videos well I first started making YouTube videos I was using the iSight camera that was built into my macbook and guess what it worked for me I get the question all the time about what vlogging cameras do I use and it's changed so much throughout the years because I used to be all 100% Canon and I was such a huge canon fan I still am a Canon fan but unfortunately they've kind of dropped the ball as far as consumer 4k cameras go they currently don't have something on the market that is this small and compact that does 4k and I just recently did a video about this this is the Sony rx100 Mark 5 there's a many renditions of this particular camera but this is the first one that I have ever had in the series the best part about this is it does 4k it also does 120 frames a second so if you do like to shoot slow-mo videos and you don't want to lug around all of this stuff this is the way to go you can also shoot in various picture profiles so if you plan on doing any sort of color grading shooting with those profiles will allow you to do that so this is the camera that I would use on a day-to-day basis because it's small I can throw it in my purse it's quite versatile but this does not have an audio input and that drives me absolutely crazy because I'm so particular about audio and sometimes when I'm editing and there's audio pops and there's a lot of white noise it drives me absolutely crazy but I'd already shot the video and since I'm shooting these videos by myself I can't really monitor the audio so I just gotta cross my fingers and hope for the best I always keep this with me even if I have one of these other cameras I'm sure after this you guys don't have a ton a question so hopefully if you have any of those you can leave those in the comments below and if I can't answer it hopefully that somebody else in the comments can help answer it for you so what we've got going on here I'm filming right now with a sony a7s mark 2 which is this camera I do have two of these mostly because when I shoot my cooking videos I love to have the same camera so that everything kind of matches up and it looks very even so when I shoot the Far Away shots this is the lens that I use this is a 35 Prime and it is absolutely beautiful so this is the 35 millimeter Prime and this is how far away I have to be to get myself in frame so when vlogging with this lens it's nearly impossible because I'd be like this that's not gonna work out so well but this lens is incredible I do a lot of close up shots with this camera and this lens so a lot of times if you see me looking off to the side I'm looking off to this camera and trying to get a close-up shot we don't have two cameras today because I'm showing you this camera what I love about this is it's incredibly large sensors you can also get really great shots at night in low-light situations this used to be the camera that I would vlog with I would actually take this around with huge lenses microphones and it was just so tedious and heavy and crazy and I was like what am i doing and I had this realization because this is a very expensive camera and I made a really big mistake Justine did you just drop your camera in there last year when I was on vacation with my family I dropped this by accident into a pool and I had just bought my second camera so that I would be able to up my game as far as the cooking videos go oh my heart hurts that camera is so expensive but fell right into the pool and it was like this is a way too expensive a mistake to make so I was trying to figure out what is an alternative solution to not carrying around than a 7s mark too but still be able to get sort of that same type of quality at the time there was another option it was the sony a6300 but there were a bunch of people who were complaining because they said that it overheated when you shot in 4k for too long and that's where this guy came into play this is the sony a 65 hundred and the biggest difference between this and the a7 s as this uses full-frame lenses and this one does not the sensor on this is so much smaller than this one I'll give you guys a side-by-side comparison so what the bigger sensor you're able to get better low-light photos and videos and it's crazy after using this one so much and then switching my lenses I'm like man this is insane you guys can see what I'm talking about as far as the sensor sizes so the bigger the sensor the light that is allowed into this camera you make precious another lens that I like to use so this is the lens that I used to use to vlog with all the time this is a 16 into a 35 so the 16 allowed me to still get a nice wide angle view and I can still zoom in a little bit to the 35 the one that I'm using right now is a 24 to 70 I don't like this lens a lot but it's not the best for vlogging because it still isn't that wide-angle views so this is the 24 to 70 let me give you what it looks like without being zoomed in and out let's zoom all the way in so having that 16 is perfect this is the 16 to 35 and I loved this so much because it is very wide angle yet it will do a little bit of zoom as you can see you there one of the other reasons that I switched to the a 6500 is it's a lot smaller sometimes I do miss having the a7s2 when I'm out vlogging especially in low-light situations but the ease of use for this in comparison to this I can use smaller lenses which are much lighter like this is a 16 to 70 which is pretty crazy this is the 16 to 70 and this lens is so great but clearly it's not the best for close-up vlogging but what is great about it is the zoom [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a lot of the vlogs I do shoot with this if I'm not carrying around this if I'm not able to switch lenses and I'm gonna be in a situation like an event that I'm not able to switch out to this one this is a much more wide-angle lens but I also don't get a lot of zoom this is at 10 2 and 18 so the 10 it gives a much wider field of view which is my favorite look when vlogging and because it's such a wide angle now I'm using the 10 to 18 lens on and the a 6500 and as you guys can see it's a very nice wide angle but I can also zoom in just a little bit and he's off I usually don't have to worry about things not being in focus because the biggest downside of these cameras is the screens they do not have flip out the screen like what is this come on ah just flip to the side what are you doing all of that taken into consideration though my tip if you're vlogging without a screen is when you lightly touch the shutter button so if I'm vlogging like this I'll lightly touch that I don't usually help to get me into focus quicker so I can just go about my shooting and hopefully fingers crossed I'm in focus and there's plenty of times especially on this lens that it's not always quite in focus but you just gotta roll with it like what am I gonna do I can't reshoot something that I shot and what's done is done like I was saying about this lens it's much lighter at the size comparison that's a big difference and the weight way lighter this is the 2.8 18 millimeter and this is the vlogging lens that I use the only problem is it's fixed so whatever you see here there's no zoom this is it but if I was holding the camera you guys would be about this far away and all the way back here it's what you see have you guys connected to my iPhone so I can see what I'm shooting this is working out great so what I'm blogging I like to use this little Manfrotto tripod it's small its compact I know a lot of people love using the jovi tripods but I'm not the biggest fan of those I and but I feel like they're not that sturdy so what I like about this is it's pretty sturdy even though this is the tripod that I was using that it when I camera fall in the pool but we don't talk about that this also has a pretty smooth pan so when you push this in a lot of times you'll see some of my shots where there's like a nice smooth pan I'm just holding that in and going like that and panning absolutely off to use the audio cuz that's loud speaking of audio definitely something that's very important apologies if I'm jumping around I'm not very good at organizing my thoughts I'm just kind of talking as I think of something so right now we're gonna discuss microphone this is a fairly new purchase for me I bought this a few months ago when I was in New York this is phantom powered which means it takes power from the camera so you don't need any other batteries you don't need another cord to plug into the camera it just works it also has these little left and right microphones so if you want to shoot in stereo you can but they also move so if you're doing some sort of an interview or something you could point one here or one there or you know like if you get the point and put on its little you little microphone song let me see that baby 860 500 is also a touchscreen which is nice but I turned it off I felt like I kept hitting buttons when I didn't mean to if it's also shoots in hundred twenty frames so you can get some super cool slow-mo shots and for me going between these two cameras I really was not able to tell that big of a difference because a lot of the times since I am on the go nothing like I film on auto a lot there's just no time to be messing around with settings you just kind of have to again and cross your fingers hope for the best and then when you're in editing you're kicking yourself because you're like man why didn't I do this this is one of the goal mics this is what I used to use before I use this so the problem with this that I found when I switched over to the a 6500 is it was so close it was actually getting in my shots what I love about the go microphone is it's a lot less expensive than any of the other rode microphones you also don't need a battery so it just powers itself from the camera but you do need an audio input which sometimes can also cause trouble because I'll forget to plug it in from this is this rode microphone this one is really nice because feels a little more sturdy but it will give you a much better sound it does need a 9-volt which is always quite unfortunate because guess what the battery's dead can you know what no one ever has a 9-volt battery this just plugs in right to the side but this little guy seems to have solved all of that the audio and this is a little bit better than this but what I'm doing is side by side comparison it's it's you really can't tell unless you're listening for it you might be wondering what I'm filming with like I said if a 7s2 with this little setup is kind of unique because I have one of the small HD cameras on this little tripod thing that has two mounts so one for my camera and one for the small HD screen and I'm using Sennheiser wireless microphones that are connected to a sony XLR input which is also phantom power lock your XLR input in from this current microphone that I have right here that actually came with this set and then in the second input I have the Sennheiser wireless microphones plugged in as well so that's the current set up here that I usually use at my unboxing desk so these small HD monitors are incredible and you really do need something to be able to see what you're doing especially if you're shooting by yourself because how are you supposed to know these are great they come in many different sizes there are various price ranges depending upon how bright you want the screen the resolution how large the screen is and what you plan on doing so I'll put all those links in the description below so everything that I talked about will be down there so you guys can check it out SD cards I've been using these Lexar ones mostly because it was the only thing available on Amazon Prime now and I was desperate for SD cards so I was able to get a bunch of them within 15 minutes on Amazon these are only 128 but you like to see mine on you get a bigger card well first of all that's the only size that they had and two when I'm shooting I kind of like to have a backup of if I'm shooting a bunch of videos I'll take those SD cards out after I've shot like four videos set them aside do not touch them and start shooting on different cards so I just know that that footage is safe there's no chance of me deleting it and Leslie those SD cards which I've definitely done before it's quite a process people think this is very easy and I wish that it was I wish that I could say that everything is just magic but it takes a lot of time to edit some of my cooking videos can take me anywhere from 15 to 20 hours to edit and even then when I'm done I still don't feel like I'm done there's so many more things that I could do as far as color correction and music and graphic but I just kind of run out of time so unless I have somebody full-time helping me do all of this I kind of just have to say alright and that's enough you're done now interesting one of the downsides to these Sony cameras is the batteries die super quick so my biggest recommendation is if you do use any of these you'll clearly figure that out very quickly that extra batteries are a must and constantly carrying around extra batteries and chargers but the good thing is you can charge this via micro USB so the RL and you're desperate you can always do that so this has been a lifesaver one of the most difficult things especially when editing 4k footage or managing large files and trying to edit is how fast is your hard drive this is a little teeny tiny solid-state drive and I have been using this for a couple of months my friend Sara DG and my friend Nathan who also helps me shoot at times they both recommended this and it is pretty much saved me so much time they currently only go up to 2 terabytes so I have two of these that I kind of bounce back and forth between footage so I'll do a shoot copy the footage here take that footage and then back it up to another drive just in case something happens and it's something that I'm really worried about losing and it was a very big videos lots of time commitment especially sponsored videos how that goes up to a third Drive but this little guy has been great I mean look how small this is 2 terabytes solid-state fragments 2 terabytes does not get me very far I probably have like two videos on this two videos meaning all of the files that go into creating two videos a little case is super cute that I've been using for my SD cards I felt like I was so unorganized I just had SD cards everywhere and there is not a central home for them although I am missing some because this used to be all full so this is also the latest GoPro Hero 5 I used to shoot a lot more with my GoPro but I really have been doing anything that crazy but I love this little guy it's super cute and the best part about it is it's already waterproof so you don't have to have another case over top of it to make it waterproof the audio one this one I feel like is not as good as the previous version which is why I still used to love using the Hero 4 since this is already waterproof I think that's probably the reason why the audio isn't that great it's not bad by any means it's just not as good as the 4 was without a case on it last but not least cell phones cell phone video now has gotten so incredibly good that if you hold it up side by side leave the Samsung or the iPhone up to one of these it is really hard to distinguish which is which which is a really great problem because sometimes when I'm filming I do still after all these years kind of get embarrassed pulling this out at the mall it just feels super invasive there's just a very nice familiar feeling when you just flip that front-facing camera and you're talking to your phone maybe for me because I feel like I did that for so long but it's something that is so easy to do it still looks good I hope this was somewhat helpful for you guys it's a lot of things but I think my biggest advice to you guys if you want to start I don't want you to be intimidated by this video at all because you don't need all of this stuff to start all you need is yourself camera and if you don't have a camera you have a phone you can edit you could upload you can basically do everything from the palm of your hand well hopefully as as far as you guys to go out there and get creating whatever it is that you're passionate about go out make a video and have fun doing it well thank you guys for watching I'll put links in the description to everything that I talked about today I don't even touch on drones but I feel like you guys you get the point I've got it off your own videos but you guys know what I use this is such a long overdue video because I get so many questions and people say oh I just bought that camera that you recommend it was

today we're check us out starting out great this is the echo spot it's essentially a squish down circular version of the echo show I unbox the echo show here not too long ago Alexa oh it's updating what do I do this has taken a really long time and since then I have got the echo show for pretty much everyone I know as gifts because it is probably one of my favorite devices in a very very long time for Christmas I got my dad one of these and the echo show and what's great about this is it has a screen it's integrated with Alexa and it's kind of just like this little tiny mini computer that just sits around your house but it also has a built in camera so you could make Alexa I keep calling them Alexa time calls I think it feels like Alexa time I don't think that's good it's cold it's essentially a FaceTime but calling through Alexa when I saw they announced the spot i pre-ordered this immediately these came out the end of December so let's just stop talking and open it oh yeah this looks great they have two different versions they have a black and a white they also have the echo show in a black and a white version too I chose the black version mostly because the one that I got originally was black so I thought let's just match that looks like a magic 8-ball that's been cut in half well Justine shattered her iPhone within the next month don't shake it that's a good hold you go like this no are you sure cuz you're shaking it there's bubbles and then there's apparently it is decidedly so that I'm going to shatter my phone in the next month the setup on these are pretty simple you basically just plug it in you connect it to your Wi-Fi and you connected to your Alexa app on your phone so here it is I mean it really does just looks like it's chopped in half magic 8-ball plugged in hello my ghost pod is ready for set up so it's kind of cool because this is a touch screen so you can interact with this directly just have to type in my Wi-Fi password since this is already connected to my network and I already have one set up it already says welcome Justine and if that's you you type yes yes that's me checking for latest software days this is where things tend to take a hot minute what I really like about this too is you can enable drop in so if you want to drop in on any of your friends who have also enabled drop in and allowed you to drop in on them you basically could just say her name call so-and-so and then it'll allow you to view their camera which yes I know that sounds completely absolutely terrifying but that is an option that you can turn off so it's not like this is something that just it because you have this you can do that it is an option you could turn it off don't worry echo spot device will update it okay install that as I install the updates your echo spot will restart twice okay good to know so if one of your friends has the Alexa app and they don't necessarily have one of these they can still talk to you and contact you they just have to have the app I'm so sorry if any of you guys have your on she's probably going crazy right now because I keep saying the name and I'm so so sorry from here on out if I'm not talking to her I'm gonna call her I feel like this is an episode of Gossip Girl one of the big trends at CES this year was integrating everything with a and Google so if you have a Google assistant where you have a or even Vic speed if you're a Samsung user integrating all of these little smart home devices into other things so for example at the LG booth I was using the remote control to navigate my lights in my house but that was using Google assistant so because it was hooked up to Louisville assistant I didn't actually have to say hey Google trying to space it out because if you guys have these devices I know they're going crazy this thing is still updating so I'm still talking to you guys another thing that you can do with this is you can use green room calling so I have one of these in the kitchen so as soon as this thing is set up I can use this to call down to the kitchen if I'm traveling and I have my a app open and I have drop in and abled I can drop in from anywhere in the world to my home and see what's going on kind of sounds a little terrifying does it it is but then it isn't I mean this is the future so you either get with it or you don't or night soon yep spot is ready okay I can't tell time on an analog clock I need digital we've got the weather what's five times 235 five x 235 is 1175 I love math Ed's home recently active so we're gonna call my friend Edie hello hello do you well you won't see me because I'm filming you there you are hello there I am see how did the Internet hi Internet what's going on so there's me later wait where's a little oh there I am so that's them right there what school did you get the white wanted a black one I got the black one to match the other black one is cuz they have like are you comes guys he always you always comes up when someone's on you well this is me robbing us with paid off it's really cute this thing is so great I love it oh my goodness that's like the most precious thing ever well thanks for accepting my call yeah okay well I'm gonna continue my review my review is it so cold your that rig yeah do you see that light I added my new light up here no I said when I went to CES I was doing a wily factor but I started it too late it was at the end I was like oh we should do a well we factor from like 1 to like 100 and yeah bye hi bye see how do I enter Alexa and call Jack go into the app and I can do a couple of the things in here and I can make some little changes like I can change the space so is it weird if I make a photo on my Alexa a picture of me holding the Alexa so I'm going to show you really quick that's an example no no so if I have this in my office like I said before I could just drop in using my phone and I can see what's going on in my office just using my phone so guys this is the Alexis spot I'm such a huge fan of all the things that amazon has been doing with the integration of Alexa I'm so excited for the future of what they're gonna do because if this is what they have now I can only imagine what they already have in the works what can we look forward to next I don't even know but I can't wait to find out let me know if you guys have any suggestions for things that you'd like me to review or unbox here and also let me know what you think the future of Amazon is going to make next I don't know [Music] [Music] [Music] 
This is iPhone 10 not X 10 not to be confused with DMX Xbox one X or OS X which is actually OS 10 oh, wait You say what happened to nine With an all-new edge-to-edge 5.8. Inch OLED super retina HDR display This is iPhone 10 It's 10 because it's the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. [Steve Jobs]: "Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone". Ten years ago Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone on stage at Macworld 2007 and I was there I am standing right in front of the iPhone Spinning around shortly, and you'll be able to see the front of it I saw it in person inside the spinning glass display and little did I know at the time that this phone would change my life not just mine Everyone's, this was the start of creating simplified apps social networking and laying the groundwork for new forms of communicating like iMessage and FaceTime It put the world and our friends in the palm of our hand like usual and typical Apple fashion They may not have been the first to make a smartphone, but they revolutionized simplified and made it desirable and mainstream I can promise you that I will never be the first person in line for any sort of Apple event There's no way, this is it like we're here. We're first This year was special Apple announced the new iPhone 10 at the Steve Jobs theater at their new Apple park campus This was the first event that they had ever held there And it was a beautiful reminder of what Steve Jobs started 10 years ago with the first original iPhone [Tim Cook]: "And it was only fitting that Steve should open his theater". Remember a time back in my day when you couldn't even copy and paste on the first iOS What is that what apps you got there? That's nice You've got your Wi-Fi on so what's new with iPhone 10 you asked It's got Face ID Instead of using Touch ID because there's no longer a home button on the iPhone 10 you use your face to unlock your phone Hopefully you weren't too attached to that Touch ID because your face is now the replacement With the full front edge to edge OLED screen sacrifices had to be made It's actually quite shocking how fast Face ID works it just works. It's hard to explain. It just works Setup is super simple. You just roll your face around following the on-screen directions, and there you go This is all made possible with the new TrueDepth camera it projects and analyzes more than 30,000 invisible dots on your face to create a very very Very precise map your face is now registered for logging in and face pay Yes, face pay just double click the side button and just as you would with Touch ID Apple Pay pops up And I just bought a cheese will that looks like a pumpkin with my face It's so great like I just paid with my face But what if I'm wearing a hat or glasses or I get old or get Botox? I'm not quite sure but Apple has promised us that it will learn your face as you change whatever that means Privacy is obviously a huge concern for most people and if it's not then you should really rethink your priorities with face ID'd there's a one in a million chances of a stranger unlocking your phone randomly whereas with touch ID it's 1 in 50,000 of course if you have an identical twin, then those chances are a little bit higher I don't have a twin and all the twins that I know were unavailable to help me with this day I've seen I'd love to help you, but I'm trying to win Dancing with the Stars right now and Jonathan He's busy bench-pressing kitchens. Here is mine on twin sister She can't get into my phone using her face even though people say we look alike, but I don't really see it Now what did she chases me around and tries to use my face to gain access into my phone even though I don't want her to this scenario. I'm sure will be replicated if someone refuses to unlock their phone for you There is an extra layer of protection to avoid this from happening by turning on attention awareness It'll only unlock your phone when you're looking at it This will also be used in some apps so that they'll know that you're actually looking at your phone and avoid dimming the screen from Inactivity if you're still not sold on face ID that's okay You can still opt to use just the good old fashioned passcode all this talk of face ID and removal of the home button justine how do we do things using the same familiar gestures in iOS will get you around your new iphone 10 just fine a Simple swipe up and you're back to the home screen Swipe down in the top right corner for access to your control center to get to your notifications You can swipe down on the left or you can swipe down right here on the top swipe up in paws to show your current Open apps press and hold on those open apps to delete you can swipe up or you can press this little delete button to remove them you can also access these by swiping left and right at the very bottom of your screen you can also use hey Siri if You have that turned on just by saying hey Siri that will activate Siri on your iPhone. No stop it I'm recording vo Siri the on button is now a dedicated Siri button press and hold to ask Siri a question I ever tell you that I actually met the voice of Siri Some of you may already know this, but if you don't this is Susan Bennett the voice of Siri What's your favorite staple all my favorite phrases? I don't know and I don't care To turn off your iPhone 10 you hold the power button and the volume button down you can also turn it off in the software In iOS 11, which I actually had no idea about until finding it right now So take a screenshot you hold the power and the volume up button Magically with these screenshots the notch does not appear what kind of sorcery is this one of the things that I've been looking forward to forever is wireless charging both the iPhone 10 and The iPhone 8 are embedded with Qi wireless charging, and it has an all-new glass back this is by far the strongest glass that Apple has ever implemented in their phones both on the front display and the back I Definitely don't want to repeat of this this might have been my first iPhone shatter, I think I'm not sure I've lost track with the air power out in 2018 You'll finally be able to charge all of your devices on this. This is a wireless power mat You can charge all of your devices at the same time, and I mean it's wireless But like it's not just no wires connected to your devices you get the point this here is the fan-favorite Top notch this thing has so much technology packed into it an infrared camera a flood illuminator proximity sensor ambient light sensor speakers microphones front camera and a dot projector all of this for animated emojis face ID and Portrait mode selfies, but let's be real selfies are a thing of the past Animated emojis that mirror your exact expressions of why you're really dropping on the new iPhone 10 You can record up to 10 second an emoji videos and text them to your friends. Hey Jenna Another thing that I really like about the in emojis is if you don't want to send a video you can Actually turn it into a sticker so all I have to do is instead of hitting record I just make an emotion and click it can I drag and drop? Just like you would do an iMessage sticker Much like the portrait mode that you may be familiar with you can now use the front facing camera with new portrait lighting modes natural light studio light contour light stage light and stage light mono I'm not really sure if this is considered hashtag no filter, but come on We all know those hashtag no filter photos have been retouched and edited color corrected face tune face blurred beyond recognition But hey I did not a filter, right One of the biggest physical changes and main identifiers to say hey guys guess what I have the new iPhone 10 is the rear dual cameras they've now been rotated vertically with a quad tone LED flash right in the center so that everyone will know that you have the Newest iPhone you can also let them know when they ask about your new phone that it has a larger and faster 12 megapixel sensor with improved optical image stabilization and new on the iPhone 10 optical image stabilization on both lenses a new iPhone 10 features the brand new a 11 Bionic chip that is currently the most powerful and Smartest chip in a smartphone with the for efficiency cores and the new CPU it'll be about 70 percent faster than the previous 810 fusion And the two performance scores are up to 25% faster Did I lose you it's okay make yourself some flashcards So you'll have these details ready for a salty Android user and I'm not hating I've had plenty of Android phones in my days I just want you to have the facts ready one of the things that I just couldn't get over is how? Beautiful the new screen is it has a million to 1 contrast ratio with the best color Accuracy of any previous iPhone they've also increased the speakers by 35% And they're in stereo this will make binge watching an entire Netflix series a little bit more enjoyable I don't usually have the true tone display Turned on but depending upon your current lighting situation your displays colors will shift to give you the most accurate Representation of what you're looking at it's pretty easy to switch on and off so if you find yourself looking at your screen and wondering Why it's turning a little bit? Too yellow or a little bit too blue that could be the issue another of the things that I'm loving so much about this new Phone is the video options now with the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10 You can shoot 4k 60 frames a second and up to 240 frames a second at 1080p so what that means for most people is that you're probably going to eat up a ton of storage Really really really quick, but what that means for making cool high quality videos you can do that right from your iPhone And if you're new to my channel welcome, I'm a sucker for slo-mo with the new optical image stabilization You'll see a noticeable difference in low-light photos New and iOS 11 you can loop bounce and create long exposure shots from your live photos also with the back vertical cameras this placement Is so much better aligned for depth sensing, which means increase spatial awareness for augmented reality? I haven't got a chance to spend much time with any AR apps but the few that I have a tried are a lot of fun with all of these new integrations in the latest iPhone 10 and the iPhone 8 I'm really looking forward to seeing what developers are working on with AR kit, so that's the new iPhone 10 It comes in space gray and silver with storage options of why even bother 64 gigs and oh my gosh I shoot a lot of holes hey video in photos of white dog 256 gigs leave me some comments below and let me know what your favorite iPhone can feature is Thank you guys so much for watching.

hey let's shoot some videos I just hop on Amazon and I start looking for silly things and you found this it's huge well I feel like everybody has done the Easy Bake Ovens which i think are like the coolest thing ever do you know how many high tech ones they have right now like they have them in like every color they look like spaceships but I was like we need something like cheesy that seems like just strange and different found this have you ever heard of Lalaloopsy before I've seen it around but I'm not really sure what it is they look like just a bunch of cute doll so I looked it up because I wasn't sure either and apparently there's a Netflix show they have a YouTube channel they have dolls and toys and it's all based around these little like rag dolls and I thought oh my gosh this thing says it's a real baking oven whoo what's open this up I've got a very tiny little pink pocket knife here today oh but I thought it was nice and festive and pretty and matched our theme go for it that's like an exacto knife thank you there believe it I gotta get one of those ones that wrap my vegetables okay looks like we've got some mix we'll set that off to the side let's just dump it out okay oh wow okay whoa whoa some stuff may fall okay I'm ready I'm ready okay this spatula is like the size of you biggest spatula I have ever seen I mean it's adorable it's actually cooler than I thought I'm having a really good time already are we have you done oven how many watts tell me false warnings on the back there's been there's danger there's more warnings than directions whoa whoa we might need a tiny mixing bowl let go like a spatula maybe okay I got a little bit of baking spray pole spatula we got it is something you should never do is put things on a hot oven but it's not a relevant greenies on that one we're gonna evenly coat a pant let's actually step to completely live oh is plug in the oven and turn it on and preheat for 20 minutes preheat this is the smallest old cake pan go for whoa okay you've evenly coated in the whole entire table in my damn Jersey own it ready to go you've got to do this one oh we don't we're mixing in here but that's okay it's okay it's fine step three batter half of the birthday cake mix okay and then two big pinches and one pinch and a dash of water in the mixing bowl okay but like what's a - how big is a pinch and then I pinch this and then it says two big pinches and a pinch so that's two big big give it one get any bigger than that okay dude one more big and now a regular pinch this is the same nicest remaining job they're just safe inches perfect all right oh shoot they're trying to be cute this is so silly okay so this measuring spoon are the pinches I smell burning something I'm just not sure that not your hair oh it might be me here let's put this over here oh this is the big pinch and your pinch is not this big you need to at least put one more piece yeah but look I think what it's saying is half of the birthday cake is a few pinches and one pinch hate it it's so bad just let you guys know the pinches are measuring spoons it's code for measuring spoons yeah see a John this you think because I'm oh my god do you want to know I don't think I do I'm not sure idea what let me let me please it's a ages eight unless you know they're really smart eight-year-olds these days I know ooh you don't think about that now it looks like a funfetti cake and then use the oven spatula to push it in okay it's a bake for 12 minutes my gosh we could shoot an entire other video and the time then takes us a cake to bake this makes for 12 minutes that's too much time oh this is like a real mini cake I'm just gonna dump this in here I think I might enter on this side they got a little graphic I think oh that my pinch measurements may have been slightly off I mean this is the big moment that we've really been waiting for dun-da-da-da here this is this is you can do the honors I want to see what's happening you see one says stop here it won't but it doesn't go in a sarong again you can't wait wait I think maybe wait I think that might be how we there got it in there now you get this out I don't know hey you hold it easy-peasy oh it's here look is it yeah I it's in there how long is this thing completed oh it's kinda needs to go back a little I overdid it so there we go perfect just jiggle it into the sea the little hats oh I see it oh it's in there it smells like burning plastic like I wonder why how we're gonna get that thing out of there I'm concerned but that's alright okay separate mixing bowl we are gonna combine frosting mix one pinch and one dash of water you he's brain I don't think we we don't need is great you might have hit the spray very far away oh yeah I think I've broken actually the lids come on drop the spatula oh sorry Justine I gotta worry about cleanliness in our kitchen don't worry it's only gonna touch the pan you know the food we didn't even wash the pan so first of all this clearly is not something that we should even eat we didn't it mix still dissolved it looks really good I'm gonna get that in there mmm watch your touch a little warm yeah thicker as you think that's like get me this is disgusting I mean that is a good consistency it's real thick this consistency is of kind of like a cookie icing I'd say how the royal icing and that

inside the oven in our cooling chamber I'm just gonna they do have hole I don't think we're ever gonna be able to use this again I think this is a vented yep yeah though I think we need more more do you want more sprinkles you're getting again this looks something like something like I don't you oh wow it's really warm I mean this entire thing was baking that smells like burnt yeah it smells like burnt plastic buon appetito Villiers treat ourselves treat yourself right right yo sell of this tank hmm hold on I have two fifties and I think I just cracked [Music] yeah well apart okay the cake is not bad it tastes so bad look I just want to got a taste of it I mean now I cracked a tooth and I'm going to food poisoning it looks so cute though I'm super tolerable this tastes so this is disgusting me but why it's because of the recipe do you have the aftertaste has a really strong aftertaste I I do have to be alone oh my gosh it's got a very strong aftertaste it is rancid what would be the flavor of the aftertaste I honestly don't know but it's really bad like it tastes like hey this melted I considered that this was gonna be something easy and I was like wow we could make cookies after this no we have cookies oh they have cookies but we can I cannot I cannot bring myself to even know that that look like little buttons well guys that's it thank you so much for watching make sure you guys go check out Rose Channel we've done so many fun videos oh my gosh we've been having a blast but this is the I forgot what was even called lala-lulu see Lalaloopsy oven and to be honest you know I had pretty low expectations and this is actually better than what I thought was gonna happen so what we did okay we did okay all right that's it oh [Music] I'm trying to think of a scale from like we did really bad that we did excellent I was like yeah we did something it's bad it's pretty gross we did something we did something [Music] 
hey guys how's it going Merry Christmas today I like to save my well I guess the most difficult baking videos for the actual holiday for Halloween I mean if it's really cool gravestone cake so I thought for Christmas I'm gonna try I'm gonna bust out some of my fondant skills I wanted to make a peppermint cake now here's some inspiration there's this little one they've got like little gingerbreads on it and some stuff and then this is like some peppermint so basically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bind both of these cakes I don't really know what's gonna happen - as you guys know nobody ever knows what to expect in this kitchen maybe it'll all work out great maybe it won't I'm going to try my best i pre-made the cakes because you guys have seen me make cakes before like we all know what what goes into that actually Jenna made these games I can't even say that I made them we look two cakes so for this you're gonna want to make one basic white cake I mean honestly this is a box cake so we just kind of dump this into the mixer did what you do to make a cake and then Jenna put so much red food coloring in this we use gel food coloring and then we use some other red food coloring because it was not turning red basically one of things if you have an allergy to red dye do not eat this because you will die and actually I don't think anyone should eat this cuz there's a really great chance that you're not gonna be with us any longer first things first oh I need my cake pan me my cake mat okay we've got that so okay no wait this is all wrong I've gotta prep my icing first oh gosh so we're gonna do is I learned this little trick from my friend man about cake he taught me that some of this pre-made icing that you get all you got to do is dump it in here add some butter and then it'll make it much easier to spread so we're also gonna do is I'm gonna add a little bit of peppermint extract to it so it'll be a nice peppermint flavor it's just expired I can't find an expiration date so let's just hope for the best we've got our spatula okay when I flip it like 14 times in the air but yet when I'm holding it like a normal person this is the life that we live blessed I'm not really sure how much peppermint next driver like for me I you can never have enough peppermint heavenly okay let's just dump some of this in every time I do these cooking videos at the end of the day I've got the booyah stomachache because I want to eat every that I'm making I got the boots with the fur the whole club's looking at Hershey I'm so used to not ever having the butter be soft I left this out overnight no look at it i'm bari take a sweater off because i'm sweating so that's going we're gonna that smells so good i wish you guys could smell it it smells like freakin Santa Claus Lane [Applause] [Laughter] can you see it it's burning my skin is burning my skin can you see oh shoot Oh God my face okay oh my face is still burning but I'm not sure what to do about it like it kind of feels like I'm getting like a chemical peel or something I have never had one before but I imagine this is what it feels like and it's not a good feel done enough because I think I stopped caring once there's pain involved that's what I'm like it's time to stop oh my face is still burning it feels so minty like just the picture and imagine you put in a piece of bum and your mouth feels minty those what my face feels like I'm so uncomfortable sweater is constricting on my body my pants are too tight I need my skin all right we've got a cake and I'm so upset because normally when I do this I'm able to really do a great job of evenly cutting these cakes but I can't find my cake leveler so I'm not sure what to do I'm gonna have to do it by hand so let's just hope for the best thank you so far I'm doing a pretty good job leveling this was gonna be a four layer cake but uh I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to cut this in half again so this is gonna be our nice little you know I think to hold together I got these I saw them on Amazon I was like yeah I'll get them they are peppermint I guess little chips so I'm gonna sprinkle those in the middle and hopefully nobody cracks a tooth when they're expecting like a nice soft cake I guess it's post Malone but say candy flakes with the peppermint on top candy Thurman hunts out oh god I gotta stop oh my god this smells like what my face feels like oh my god I'm having such a Merry Christmas since this is no longer gonna be four layer cake we can just plop it right on I probably put my headband back on this will help me focus [Music] SoDo put this in the fridge I think the icing looks pretty good I may put another coat of icing depending upon if I feel lazy or not but if you do this I would recommend putting another layer I might skip that books in the fridge get it - oh I don't have room in here what am I thinking Oh have some vegetables why would I put vegetables when I get up cake this is the best well Matt ever thank you a man about cake I basically Oh anything good that I do in my kitchen to him in row because they're just the best I just thought visit the new toy it's a fondant roller I mean would you guys even imagine like not long ago I didn't even know how to use fondant and now I'm a fondant roller Who am I you've got two colors we've got a nice lights and we've got a nice red and now we're gonna roll out Alexa play roll out [Music] [Music] [Applause] red fondant no water lob jokes from here on in I promise actually I can't promise I'd sentido roll this out big enough to cover the entire cake and I'm concerned because the last time I did this I almost went into cardiac arrest being so out of shape that rolling out this fondant I was exhausted all right this is big enough and if it's not at this point I don't care because it's I'm tired okay get ready for this are you ready for the flip because I don't know what's gonna happen Oh actually this is not that bad I think this is hopefully gonna be big enough it's not yeah it's okay it's okay because I'm covering the bottom anyway hey it's like I love hate like I really have fun doing this and then I and then I do things like this and I get very upset this is supposed to be real smooth so supposed to be smooth and beautiful this is the point where my expectations were super high and now the expectations I have none everything that I thought I was gonna do feeling I'm not doing anymore we're gonna add some decorations to it I also have some lights they're obviously not edible so don't be silly [Music] it goes supposed to meet goals it's supposed to be a Christmas cake cookie I think I'm gonna swap this out for this little guy we'll put you on when I dented it so I'm gonna be straight so since I dropped this uh it's not sanitary and it's probably not gonna be straight Wow that's so cool you big guy you're supposed to like put stuff on here to make this stick but I've stopped caring so we're gonna just do basically all I care about is this one section okay that's all we need it doesn't matter this isn't gonna stick on here because I didn't put anything on it to make it stick so why would it stick that doesn't even look straight I guess I'll just put them over top I'm not worrying about this backside this doesn't exist in my world shove that in there seems to be something that I had really high hopes for I had a lot of dreams when in doubt just buy premade deck stuff from Wilton and call it a day this looks like something out of Mario Odyssey like one of the things that you like jumps around like one of the I think was like a I forget what it was even was it looks like something from the game I lose all holes in one ho equal oh ho ho put a little Christmas tree right here very honestly I'm so upset okay I swear to you this I had all intentions of making it was beautiful no just looks like trash I wanted to make all custom fondant creations on this it's okay you got it you gotta make do with what you got and this is what I've got right now Merry Christmas these are silvering I got them at Target I went to the store the other day like actual store I usually buy everything online and I couldn't believe it there's a lot of stuff at the analog store these are incredible this workspace has been contaminated so we're gonna put this around the cave since I don't care about the back I'm just gonna put the battery pack back there you wrap this around my little cake oh but this is the coolest cake ever actually I mean these Christmas lights definitely elevated it I haven't seen stranger things but I feel like this is don't they have like lights or something that you can talk to another world or another dimension I'm not sure [Music] well I hope you guys enjoy that slow-mo montage I shorted did you I didn't eat yet but I'm sure I did look at different color hat oh my goodness oh god I've got a nice puppy Wow hold it on this is their icing on the inside oh wait till you see what's on the inside oh well I made that cake nice okay here you go here's your slice eat up it looks like it says hi Christy like this little guy flick good race should we take a bite you take one first cuz I made it I'm worried is this peppermint icing mm-hmm don't engage cause it's out of it it doesn't taste good I don't know what it tastes like chemicals what bothers doesn't it I mean it's good you're delirious no it's not bad I I just feel like there's so much red dye in that top cake it looks so lovely okay lovely I'll take it up you guys have a great Christmas Happy Holidays whatever it is did you celebrate I hope that you were enjoying it another break cake stop it I don't like that I don't like that at all I've lost my mind this took way too long to do I'll see you later [Music] 
hey guys how's it going it's Justine and today we are in my kitchen and we are making a freaking pumpkin pie and I'm so excited because I love pumpkin pie and I've never made one before so I'm not really sure how this is gonna go I've done a lot of google research about pumpkin pies but I think what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna follow the recipe on the back of this can it says it's a famous pumpkin pie it makes ten servings so I've got all of my ingredients ready we're gonna make this in the blender obviously there's also a problem because I realized I don't have ground ginger I don't have ground cloves but what I do have is an abundance of pumpkin spice spice and I don't know what's in here but it smells good so I'm basically just gonna dump a bunch of this in there and across my fingers and hope for the best what I do have is nutmeg and cinnamon which I kind of have a feeling that this is all in here anyway so I don't know who knows Happy Thanksgiving cinnamon ginger cloves in small bowl see I can't do that because I'm making this in the blender so I need to put the liquid ingredients in first so what we're gonna do we're gonna put the evaporated milk in first I hope this is evaporated Belka yep evaporated milk is fresh nutritious milk from which half the water has been removed come on No so sugar who put you in there two large eggs one up to one test ground cinnamon I was surprised it tisp is actually a lot more than I go that's definitely more than a tisk pumpkin spice everything nice I know but a cinnamon if you will that's super spicy enough but not least we need a pumpkin or using Libby's said it was famous maybe libby should make something for Thanksgiving that would be good I may have a few new subscribers who might be a little confused about my channel are you a baking channel or you a tech channel why are you dressed as a lobster these are questions that I'm unable to answer for you I am me I'm also confused the pumpkin is actually really good for dogs when they have diary pumpkin pie pumpkin pie I mean that's that's really it well I guess we'll set this aside while we prepare our crust now we're gonna make this very special because I am making a pumpkin poo pie where does the poo come into play and I got this beautiful pie pan off of Amazon it's beautiful it's like super official I've never had a pie pan before why would I have one because I don't bake pies but today I'm making some pie I've got this it's a it's called macula Lee honestly delicious pie crust No let's see how it works look at this oh this is great I just have to roll it out I like what cancel okay anyway I hold myself back together all right here's our dough that's it that's that's it like I just literally rolled this out oh it's very cold oh you're supposed to just roll out is it frozen no it's just refrigerated it says 20 room temperature for 25 to 30 minutes 60 minutes of frozen doughnut crack if you cold be sure to let this set for a required time before unrolling don't don't can I put on the microwave this sauce [Music] don't oh God melting every bad idea I'm so sad I guess what I don't care get in there we're gonna mold this back together and we're gonna make this pie look at beautiful as can be pinch it like no one's gonna see the bottom of this pie I mean honestly it to be totally honest with you if anyone eats this they're probably gonna die so let's be real look at this it's looking perfectly fine push this down at the bottom so I'm gonna probably open one of these other ones so upset so I'm gonna put this in the microwave again no okay Nathan the shape pieces had a very rapid no like what this may be like beat like warm itself up inside here so I can I'm gonna pour in the mixture now this is very liquidy like this pumpkin pie supposed to be like a pumpkin spice freakin latte or what's up this looks very suspect Alexa it's pumpkin pie supposed to be watery mm-hmm I don't know that see I don't either so the reason this is gonna be a pumpkin poo pie is I'm going to be using Rosanna's little poo emoji cutout here oh this is starting to glisten anyway you guys know how on pumpkin pie is they always have those little like decorations on them like festive little leaves well we're gonna have a cutout poop on it and I'm gonna bake it a little poop separately and then I'm gonna put the poop on top of it and really this is all theoretical I just I'm obviously at this point I don't even know if this is gonna even cook like this looks like trash it looks like I went to Starbucks took a pumpkin spice latte and dumped it inside of here questionable Wow [Music] we've got a problem this is so hot it's boiling I can't use this Oh No John Donne Tom this is clearly not gonna be edible I've ruined Thanksgiving do you guys remember I think it was last year at Thanksgiving and my one project that I was supposed to make was pumpkin bread that's what I didn't do make the pumpkin bread properly all right we've got one last try this one's too hot this one's too cold it still feels a little cold you can do it Jenna can you bring me a hairdryer I can't unroll this last little bit because I know it's gonna be too cold so I think a hairdryer may solve the problem magenta sees what I'm using this far I'm gonna set everything off to the side a little bit of a crack it's okay so I'll be heating it up because I didn't saw and then the rest of them cracked you'll see in the video later so to make it the pumpkin poo emoji we're gonna use this little pumpkin cutouts cut this out just like so and we're gonna bake that separate now I mean a to warm hey Jen can you come here we need to transfer this on to the pumpkin pie without breaking it two months yes that stink it's disgusting wait I think this is gonna work jam it back in then what happened there oh okay wait let's put it back together oh you know what okay because we're gonna do we're going did it work did you put this here you're gonna add some of these little holes here and I'm gonna cut this rest of this off we pinch this all together so like honestly I think that this will just sort of like merge back together and everything will be fine I've already ruined Thanksgiving you remember oh yes I've already told them try to make a vegan pumpkin from me this is like so sure I'll just put it back in the oven or this is just like an impossible I think it's the top so the directions that says let's do a couple of different things 15 to 20 minutes you're supposed to cover the outer crust which I have a little thing for that so this protects the edges like why do I even care I mean at this point this is an absolute mess so this covers the outer edges here so they don't get too crisp and yeah I'm not sure I would just say don't do anything that I'm doing in this video 340 350 400 okay well I'm gonna let that preheat then put this thing in the oven and I will see you guys shortly a lot of things have happened first of all I think the only successful thing that has happened is this tiny little poo that I cut out of the original dough I baked this for about 15 to 20 minutes there's a lot of things that went on because it was like oh okay so at 15 minutes you have to turn the temperature down to 350 and then 20 minutes remove the little thing around the crust and then do something else it was like this is a lot of work and the whole time I'm watching this freaking pie and it is jiggling like jello like my body and slow motion so we're gonna take it out I don't know what to expect I'm slightly nervous and I'm actually a little upset because I really did try moderately hard to make this work Wow it is crisping up a freaking storm I think I probably should have taken it out like 20 minutes ago it's bubbling I should probably close the oven okay do you want to get in here and take a look yeah like it looks like do I have to let it cool before I can cut it are you a pumpkin pie expert that's not like pumpkin - shut up what do you think it is encrusted on top like all the hope you guys I've ever had were like just pump look at those that's our poo looks what did I mess it up just wash this is so hot oh there we go that's nice yeah careful now what do I do I'm so I'm so confused like oh my gosh but I want to eat it now so I probably have to let this cool off and oh my gosh guys put whipped cream on it melt mm-hmm okay well I guess I'll let this cool off and then I'll see you guys in a little bit like what I look so bad I still never seen a pumpkin pie like that you've never helped occupy overtop of like apple pie oh no you're right I don't did you make apple pie huh I completely messed this up from the beginning and I was wondering what the plan was I've never seen it done that I've never even maybe you're onto something maybe I'm an idiot or movie this your version like I did not even think about it I've never seen a pumpkin pie with freaking crust on the top of it you're right it's apple pie oh my gosh OOP goodbye pumpkin poop I can buy a pumpkin oh man okay well I'll let this cool off and then we can try it we've got the pie ready and cooled god this thing's so stupid I still can't believe that I put crust on the top of it like in my mind because there was two crusts in the box that was like well of course I put crust on top of the pie of course that oh it smells good Wow oh wow this is this is like soup this did not firm up the way that it should Oh at all oh my gosh like I don't want to try this but I have to so it's actually not bad but this consistency I do not think is correct and all this extra flaky goodness let's try this crust oh god that is burnt that is burnt that is not good look at this that is super crusty super crisp Jen I would offer you some of this but I would actually recommend you don't eat it I burnt it go get your trash spoon you might as well just take a scoop from the middle it's up alright yeah it's not bad it's just like it's like pudding well pumpkin pie usually a little softer yeah but this is like soon is it still oh look at this this looks like garbage yeah just take a bite at that well guys thanks for watching if you don't see me again it's because it's because I died from making a pumpkin pie well thank you guys so much for watching Happy Thanksgiving I love you guys let me know what you would

I actually just used white fondant, and I rolled in this brown food coloring And this is we got a nice little tan dirt so first things We're gonna ice up this cake and then we're gonna roll out the fondant and we're gonna start decorating I Don't know why I'm such a perfectionist when it comes to icing like literally my like life and house and everything can be falling apart But I'm like I've gotta make sure I use the cake perfect for you I would put this in the fridge this will chill up and then we're gonna roll out dude, dude dude our fondant and then we'll continue with this video I Like dusting my workspace with a little bit of powdered sugar oh, yeah, this is a great dirt color look at that I Don't know how to use this oh This looks like too much work because this will let you roll out to like a very even level It's quite a hefty little a slab of fondant I Am exhausted So folks guys get back in there This works And we have to place it on top of here, and I'm very nervous because this is a very Finely rolled fondant especially for me because I'm not good with fondant. Oh Gosh oh, my oh my oh my oh boy. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow okay? Oh? God you didn't see anything You saw nothing I really messed up the side are really bad. It's crunch this in like so It fondant is so cool like this is awesome. I just rolled this out. Yeah I made a few mistakes because I don't wanna talk about Let's get this real nice around these edges looks moderate not my best work not my worst work. You guys have seen some things here Definitely some clean-up on aisle Graveyard here, mmm. I cut that one a little bit too much now I've got some tombstones that we're working with they're so cute They also have little bones in them - if there's an edible marker so you can write on the tombstones so what I'm gonna do Is I'm gonna dig up a little grave here so for the dirt. We're gonna using Oreos So I basically just need Real close we're gonna put some Oreo tops into a bag So let's open these up and see what we're working with here cuz I have no idea This is gonna look great. I'm so excited okay here we go. Let's write PI P very original hey Now we got to figure out our placement of where these are gonna go so we're gonna put one right here, so I'm just gonna cut out like a little I Guess area for it Yeah look at that that looks great And I like that these can kind of be a little messy because it's clearly a graveyard And it's not gonna be like a very neat place He looks so cool Okay put you in there, so now this is where it's gonna get silly cuz I got a cutout of Grave. This is a fresh fresh grave Look at that. Oh my god. I love it. I love it this is so great so I have a little bit of icing inside of here because I'm gonna put the Oreos over top of it, so I want to kind of stick like it's the dirt Mm-hmm perfect oh my god. It looks just like dirt. Oh alright in we go another grave Let's smear some Smudges of this on here so that we can get some of the dirt like look on it to stick from the Oreos Yeah, that's great.

Bye bye Okay cool great. Don't care anymore. Can you do some slow-mo? Yeah?     
Hey Siri Wow wowie hey while we you guys Are new here I say while we all the time And I am going to present blame my friend Edie for saying it once and then me Laughing really hard about it and now we Say well we all the time now that I've Calmed down from the Siri while we I just wanted to make a follow-up video to Sum the home pod videos that I made Because I made a lot of them I made a bunch I made an unboxing I did a review Basically showing the features of the home pod but this was before I really Spent much time with it having spent at Least a week with the home pod I will Say it sounds absolutely incredible that is something that no one can deny I listen to a lot of music all day long when I'm working editing doing whatever I always have music playing securely Judging this thing as a speaker and a Music playing device it is beyond Fantastic one of the things that I think People are comparing this a lot to is so Knows because Sonos has really great Sound qualities I have so no speakers All throughout my house in every room I have one speaker whether it's a very Small one or in the kitchen I have a Very large one that produces a lot more Sound it's one of their newer ones I Don't have any of the Alexa powered Soto's though all the ones that I have Are from the past few years the mass Appeal for me of the Sonos is playing Them and never seen the room and right Now this little guy is not capable of That and that is a huge huge letdown I Bought a few of them this is the most Recent purchase I got to this space gray One so that would match my Space Gray iMac obviously in my IMAX setup video I Hadn't got this one yes so I was still Using the white one but this definitely Fits with the desk aesthetic much more but all those things aside what has it been like spending a week with the home Pod since then I've had a home 5 party And I've spent plenty of time with a Home pod I've also converted my entire House over to everything home kit Whereas before I would specifically use The hue app but now everything is voice Enabled through Siri I turn my lights on Off I've enabled routines when I come Home or I leave so certain lights will Turn on I have motion activity so now Everything is integrated with home kit Where this falls flat it's very very sad For me because I really do love this Thing a lot especially being an Apple Fan this just fits into my entire Apple Ecosystem And of course you guys know I'm a huge Apple fan so yes I'm slightly biased but What I'm not biased about is my love of Sonos I have a loved Sonos for so long They sound great but the sound quality in comparison of this to some of their Smaller speakers this definitely is much Better quality well that being said These sono speakers are less expensive You can also get two of the Alexa Powered so no speakers for the same Price as this guy but this looks so Incredible and yes it is Siri in abled But no it is not as smart as Alexa or Google and that is the real unfortunate Reality but the thing is all of those things are software updates so easily This can have the potential to be the next Alexa or the next Google home but Right now in its current state those two Are still far superior they've also been Around a lot longer but Siri has also Been around for quite a while I still feel like Siri has not unlocked her full Potential but again it's a software update so now the ball is in Apple's Court Let's get Siri to the level of Alexa and Google and then we're talking this did Not ship with his full capabilities Without airplay - you're not able to Play in different rooms you're not able To sync them all up together I wanted to Have one in every room I really wanted This to be a Sony's replacement but Right now it can't be because I cannot Play music all throughout my house at The same time that's not going to be available until airplay - so that should be later sometime this year and you also aren't able to do stereo speakers so if You want to do surround sound and have Two of these set up in front of your TV And watch a movie on Apple TV because That's the only way that you can use them if only there was a way to sync This to your television with an optical Cable like there is for the Sonos of the Sound bar that would be really really Awesome so the reality is the home pot is not as smart as Alexa or Google but the good news is she definitely has the Potential to be these things are easily Updated with software so now it's Basically just apples choice thanks Alexa another thing that I feel like my Homepod and my Apple music it's well It's not a bad thing but I feel like I bought a lot of music around 2002 my Apple music tends to supply me with a lot of music from like the early 2000s hey Siri play me some music here's a personal Oh station built just for you let's kick things off with some Third Eye Blind Every time look I mean I still AM like a Huge Third Eye Blind fan hey Siri stop Playing but it's so crazy because it's Still definitely favours music that I've purchased over music that I've recently streamed using Apple music so I've been Doing a lot of work kind of retraining Apple music to like my interests now so I didn't start really using Apple music Until I got a car the supported apple Carplay so before that I've just been using Spotify because I had so many Great Spotify playlists that I didn't Want to completely convert over so now I Think that I'm using Apple music more Than Spotify mostly because I do drive a lot so I tend to be talking to Siri a Lot in my car so because of that Apple music has slowly taken over Spotify but I'm still I absolutely love Spotify and Another thing that a lot of people are Complaining about is you're not able to Use third-party music apps with this so You can but it has to be playing on your Phone so essentially if you want to listen to Spotify you have to airplay it to your home pod from there you can Still get some sort of smart commands You can ask for specific questions if it is in the database live what's this song When was this long release play another Song on this album so those types of Things still sort of will work depending Upon what app you're using but my Over all thoughts of having spent plenty Of time with this over the past I guess at this point maybe a week and a half Almost two weeks I'm definitely looking Forward to the airplay to update so I'll Be able to play stereo music I'll be Able to play music in all of my rooms But right now I just have one in my Office one in my kitchen and one in my living room I was thinking about getting them for surround sound for my TV but I Probably won't because I already have The Soto sound bar integrated into my Televisions so I would love to have them There but since I can't really use them We're just watching normal TV you can Only use it while you're watching Apple TV I feel like they would get more use other places in the house so I think a Lot of people may be on the fence if they want to buy a homepod or not and I Think if you're looking to get one now I Would say do it if you're looking to get More than one I would say potentially Wait until airplay 2 is out unless you just want to get them anyway and just Wait patiently for it to actually be Unlocked to its full potential but until then I will be the one waiting patiently but know this will not be replacing my Alexa anytime soon I feel like there's So much that I have integrated into Alexa that she is just sort of another addition to my smartphone essentially so I hope you're having fun with me are you Having fun with me so far Hmm that's something I don't know Oh No come on girl calling me hanging in front All my friends play me some music okay let's press play starting with paper shoes by Incubus what was the song released paper shoes by Incubus came out on November 22nd 2006 it's not playing I also haven't Noticed the white ring happening because I don't really have a lot of wood services in my house I don't know if any of you guys have experienced that let me know in the comments below if you have molted my services are either mirrored reflective or this just like a white lacquer so I have not run into that at all yet that's also kind of an unfortunate thing and I feel like Apple's response was a very Apple response like respond they're like well just don't put it on a wood surface so I Guess don't put it on a wood surface all Things considered I really like the home pod and I'm not just saying that because I'm a huge Apple fan girl I love small compact speakers this looks good any Room it matches my setup perfectly as far as Siri being smarter yeah it's definitely a possibility there's a lot Of things that she is lacking in comparison to Alexa and google home but Again is a software update so fingers crossed that all of these things happen very very quickly well thank you guys for watching I would love to hear you Guys thoughts I know you have a lot of Thoughts because I've been hearing them Quite often on Twitter I will see you Guys in my next video let me know if you have any suggestions for things you would like to see here and if you're not

Thank you internal power supply Alright, this is what we've been waiting for the time has come Here it with heavy You're a beefy little boy Or girl. Oh, this is cute. It says hello from Seattle Xbox one To do a size comparison so the Xbox one X is a slightly bigger, but not by much, it's a little bit taller That was very scary I almost Dropped this does feel a little bit heavier, but not really by much to be honest. Oh there's coffee on this xbox May have spilled it. Got me the other day. I don't want to talk about it I didn't spill it on the Xbox, but I did spill it on the carpet and some of it clearly splashed on this I love this white Xbox I'm sad that they didn't know the Xbox 1x in new white one of the things that I do like is they made all of the back slots and ports the same as only Xbox one X So it's very very easy To transfer from your old Xbox to your new one all the cords will go over right into the same slots Okay the Xbox 1x it'll be out very very shortly a huge Thank you to Microsoft for sending me an early one to check out. I'm so grateful I've been playing a lot of destiny, but I kind of took a small destiny break to play stardew valley and mario odyssey But now that i've beat mario odyssey, it's time to hop back into destiny. I've got to get reading I have been traveling a lot this past month And I knew that I was leaving so I was hoping that Before I left I could complete a raid and guess what I did not It's a pretty big time commitment and trying to coordinate six people at the same time who have very clear schedules who have zero Plans for an entire day to get this raid completed seems to be quite challenging. Hopefully in the near future I'll be able to do that especially with the holidays coming up I'll have some downtime and so my friends will have some downtime and but I can't wait I've been having so much fun with destiny Other than that I'm looking forward to Call of Duty, which will be out so Soon, I have been waiting for a good Call of Duty for the past couple of years So I'm excited because so far our World War 2 was so much fun I played it a bunch a three and I also play the beta on PlayStation and on xbox so before you know it Call of Duty is back I know a lot of the pro players do play on PlayStation But I'm going back to xbox for this one like I said most of my friends play on xbox And it was kind of lonely over there on PlayStation Xbox xB I'm back.

Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine &amp; Jenna, and today we are gonna be making ice cream I love ice cream and I love ice cream so much the video that we did on Jenna's channel a while ago We made that mold ice cream-
/oh my god, the peppermint rolled ice cream? We're not allowed to make it We found that I was like we can't make it because I could not control myself-
/ I mean, she was drinking it! It wasn't even in the ice cream form it was just a liquid and she was like gotta strong-
/ Things happened, I had the worst stomachache ever and We're not gonna make that mistake again, but today, /
- Wow! Have you picked this up? 
-Yeah, I picked it up decided here. We are making ice cream We are going to be using a ball now You basically put ice cream mix into this ball, and then you put ice on the other side of it And then you roll the ball for about 20 minutes, and then guess what? you have ice cream I did that earlier, and I knocked over the whole during- Um? This is ice cream solvent? Yeah, this is recommended on Amazon, but man this box has been destroyed This is if you want to take your ball in the pool. So don't float are you wait wait wait? It's inflatable well. We don't need that right now You will blow this for me. Yo I hate it hurts. My ears shoot. Me too. Well we might not listen up We might not inflate our balls, but that penology in play that crap. This is a thing well We might have to I'll blow it. I'm so confused Well, let me explain to you I'm confused. I don't have to do that. We can just kick this around is it. Did you freeze it? That's not how it works So there's two sides one of the sides you put the heaviest and the other side you put the green This is fun. I wish I can invent some fun oh It's a little dirty Yeah, it does something fair. Well. You don't eat from this side This is where the ice goes this does look dirty what have you wash it. I've got questions hands look I feel like this is fake They scoop that right out of that Breyers, candle yeah But I just don't feel like this is a fitting for like what this is like. It's just a beard picture. Okay anyway I can't get over this big big big oh No you can't make a big mint because I can't control myself oh Cool I'm gonna wash this because I'm gonna want to eat this ice cream all right I will Investigate what we do welcome interactions with a basic vanilla. I think we need a pint of cream Oh Pure and simple wrestle a speck vanilla, yep line up lines of cream yes pint Whoops. What is your pass wait wait one third? Oh really one third cup. I thought I said one one third cup Wow Good thing you're here This isn't gonna come from an extract you have a little bit. Yep one in one half To sugar up everywhere that moves that I don't know what that was how much was that well Why are you doing that because one of the things that you're doing right now? I'm putting a little vanilla in there. Well don't Use that because I use that um. Oh yeah, that's the problem. I use this unbox stuff It's not clean part makes Holly burst into flames Pardon me well at first I Didn't really had a ready to roll doing rice in the bowl Yeah, get break at the rice ready pour the mixture into the metal sill into the top for expansion This is where putting the ice and the silver inside of it is where the ice cream goes. Thank God I Don't want to drop the ball on this one oh Yeah, hold up straight Put it about an inch give it. That's an inch Yes, yeah, yeah, it's good. It's good enough. So now what we're gonna. Do it's gonna close this up You don't want our cream coming yeah, now. We're home. We gotta go play with the ball. What does Maddie's gonna like it? I'll be rolling this and all of his pee that's disgusting well. It's facts put the foot they've left Let's put the inflator on light it up This is like did you like Oh God yeah breathe let's just go around You're covering to put the ball in its protective gear it just goes like this Then you this is absolutely ridiculous. Can you imagine having this at a pool party? tight squeeze around this book This is fun So it's done yet Oh I quit oh I don't think I'm ready This is still this is not even cold. I think we still have like 10 minutes to go. Oh Oh Gosh delicious. You realize you just like the boy I just lick the ball you guys like the but you guys are just like dog pee I Just rolled this ball, I'm crap. What do I do all right? What do I do? I want to make us ice cream? You know turn the dryer that is an Absolutely incredible idea except. It'll break your dryer. It's just an empty out some of the water from the ice I think I'm enjoying what am I immature? SLU turn doesn't say rolled around and dog through all But if I put it on like this is a bad idea You look miserable, this is what I look like it's a lock We've been doing this for like 20 minutes or so and I don't want to do it anymore here we go It's so good here, I'll take a bite of you give me the camera I Think I might a few go but like this is rolling around and poop and pee mm-hmm No Maddie So I will say that if I have more patience this would work really well I'm quite impressed if you guys want to check this out I'll put a link the description to Amazon where you can get it. This is not sponsored I Bought this because I thought it was gonna be a lot more fun, but I'll tell you what man Actually work though like it's all like stuck to the sides Like it's definitely perfect Is it impressive? Thanks for watching 
So you guys have seen the unboxing and Now it is time to do the iMacPro 18 Core 128 gigs of ram 4 terabyte solid State drive setup and yes I got the 4 Terabytes you guys really see why don't Ask questions you should know not to do What by now let's set up this is a clean Desk day for me this is my current Setup this is actually my sister's 5k iMac because she never really uses it That often so I said girl let me borrow That until I get my iMac Pro in and now That I've got it this can go back home To Jenna so when I'm not editing on the 5 k iMac I pretty much edit everything on My Macbook Pro touch bar the export time In comparison from this to the iMacPro Is insane later on in this video I'll Show you guys a comparison of how long It took me to export my home pod video On this MacBook Pro in comparison to the iMacPro so without further ado let's Just set this computer up because I'm Freaking out I don't want to talk I have a problem I'm also eating Pretzels off the floor so maybe cords Aren't my only problem right now on my Macbook I'm exporting my homepod video For an examples to show you guys how Long it takes on here and then as soon Is I get this I might pro setup we're Going to export it from there and see how Long that takes but I think I think We've got just about everything set up Down here It's time to start it up are you ready To come and get it no hey Siri fast Forward 30 seconds Music Hey Siri stop playing I'm going to get a Copyright strike from her oh my god this Thing is so beautiful So I need a mousepad because this is not Going to work through the spirit I love Pretzels okay so this pretzel looks like An anchor guys it's late I'm tired I Normally go to bed at 9 o'clock and it's 12:30 right now but I need to discuss Some things with you so far we've got it All set up and the export of my homepod Video to 57 minutes and 6 seconds this Is the home pod project this is the Video that we shot just showing some of The features of the home pod now I added This both on the iMacPro and on my Macbook Pro but what's crazy is I did Not even get these fans to trigger at All it just was completely silent the Fans on the MacBook Pro it was basically Just non-stop I felt like I was going to Overheat so Nick for these what did we Shoot this I was shot on GH 5 but what Compression did you do so usually on the 8 bit    I'm completely fine Using the MacBook Pro but it was Definitely struggling with these ones But this iMacPro it was handling it Like a champion I mean look at this Everything just it's so fast if you guys Want a really good Mac Pro 18 Core Comparison I'm not gonna be doing any Crazy speed tests or anything but you Should definitely check out Jonathan's TLD today I'll put a link in the Description to his video craze it was Amazing he did so many great speed tests And I I'm not even going to bother cuz just Going to watch his video I'm just going to sit here and tell you that this freakin thing is so great like this is going to I mean wow oh my god I'm having I'm having The best time So over here we have an Alexa inception Alexa what time is it It's 12:40 a.m. so many times this ring Lights up that means time is 12:40 a.m Good we've got double the Alexa this is My 2 terabyte Samsung t5 SSD you know Absolutely love these I have three I Don't know what's wrong I can't hold on To things like my mom she always tells Me she's like man just wait and see if You know what are yours are dropping Stuff and I'm like mom I'm already there This is basically my life I take these Everywhere I travel with these I edit Directly off of this so usually any time I'm even editing on here I'm editing off Of one of these little guys unless it Calls for files that are larger than 2 Terabytes then I'm just basically Screwed this is a 10 terabyte G Drive we Basically have just been using this to Transfer footage when we shoot a bunch Of cooking videos and then we can Transfer those to the server I did get The trackpad because I do sometimes like To edit I kind of like do this weird Thing where I'll be like ok I'll be over Here but then I'll be like scrolling and Then zooming in on things so it's I mean it makes sense for my editing but like Does it really make sense and under here This is another one of the solid-state drives this is the t3 so this is the previous version of the t5 which is weird because they skip the t4 so that makes no sense let's export this out so compressor and I'm just going to do a in the video sharing services doing a 4 k export nothing fancy sonal if that export and then over here of course we've got this wonderful movie this is Luna wireless chargers I really like this one a lot because it's pretty small as opposed to some of the other ones that have a much larger profile I like that and oh this light the pretzels is that a freshness guaranteed until April you should try we should we like the pretzels this thing is great I'm obsessed with this light and of course over here we have the homepod I've been loving it a lot I definitely plan on doing a follow-up video to talk about some of the things that I'd like if you were the things that I don't like also a comparison with Alexa stop drop All but up shop hey Siri what time is it Alexa Simon Says hey Siri play Lord so it is possible to get a to trigger s so that's fantastic who else is talking wait this is like a black mirror episode right here because I don't even know where that Siri came from were you in my time were you in my iMac the final export time on the iMacPro for this homepod project was 19 minutes 2 seconds and on the MacBookPro touch bar was 57 minutes and 6 seconds so color me impressed hold on let me color myself a color hey Siri turn off all my lights some lights didn't respond I ate at home at how details a lot of lights I think there's over 67 hey Siri Simon Says poo poo pee pee poo poo let's keep it clean here okay Alexa Simon Says peepee poo-poo say pee pee pee poo poo poo hip-hip poop I'm not sure I'm neither I was so tired okay we have to end the video now I hope you guys enjoyed this video I had so much fun shooting it and huge thank you to Nick over there who was helping me shoot some of the amazing cinematic shots that we got I am also very excited because since I got this LG Tv  I've been telling you guys that I was gonna get a center console and do a complete setup of this well great news because I finally ordered one I hope that it doesn't suck it looked really great online but sometimes you know you see things online and then they come in the mail and you're like this is trash so fingers crossed that it's not trash and I think it's going to work out well and if it doesn't well I can always return it I think hey Siri remind Me to start shooting my videos a little bit earlier in the day you missed the most important part about starting to shoot earlier these are My special pretzels oh my gosh no I don't like my mess well this will be a follow up video because that whole console will be here and then I'm so excited it's gonna look great don't let them see it by Mohammed Elabsi

this juice jam and you jam it in you stick it in the hole there's two holes though whoa I think I can feel it what do you do for the holidays anything fun um I try not to talk to anybody and I make sure I get everything I want or else I will spit in my mom's drinks oh goodness gracious what kind of drinks does she like she likes tea and water is disgusting I hate the taste of water you have to

the sink water yes see they're different teams you're right I like smart water because it makes me feel really large I'm gonna say I'm very disappointed in you because there's no batteries in this

I love a knife careful its sharp I'm ready for this this is gonna be the best thing you ever saw I love the holidays I think they're annoying I just I wish that all I had to do was just get presents and not talk to anybody God isn't even fucking working just being cool oh there's no me out it's counting there it is it's warning yeah it's a little it's a little squirt if you're not fans do not don't for me I'm gonna unsubscribe to all of them I'm trying to glue these lights on but I have a feeling it's not gonna work out so it's gonna work half faints you have a favorite a lot with a holiday snack um yes I like macaroni and cheese my sister does is well I didn't ask what your sister likes I just want to sell them I don't know why you just told me that because I didn't ask about your sister I don't care about your sister or late I don't want to have anything in common with her I do not trust her well my glue gun is already out of blue so that's a minus for you on the hangout factor of being friends yeah I'm pretty upset too mine's NT already you knew that you had a huge celebrity like me coming over and you got the sale gun well to see Pinkett pretty and it was like oh my gosh weird I'm gonna love it what do you want for christmas oh I would like a new drone I feel like an airplane kind of I don't believe in airplanes I think it's a conspiracy theory let's talk about it why do you think those windows are so small I think we're just driving I think the windows are just movies they're just pictures I don't think you're actually flying I think I go to the twilight zone or something and then you end up in a new place everything that I thought I knew is not anything that I know see oh my gosh you're gonna love what I'm doing I can't wait to see it I don't wear it every day this month I don't know if I can talk to you ever again well I hear that you're having a party that I'm invited to yes a New Year's Eve party very excited about it we made something really really awesome on Miranda's channel yeah just made a cake pop with an iPhone inside of it yeah dreams come true it was pretty much like a dream that I didn't even know that I had and I had it and I didn't even know it I mean I know it now we just pretty much changed the face of humanity with that one you know Wow hot is hot glue jeez I think I burned off all of my fingerprints you know what that means the good thing you have the face recognition phone now I was gonna say we could commit crimes now huh do you have a plan with yours are you just kind of going for you no I'm just using this is more like an impressionist type thing you know I'm just sort of like feeling like real impress oh and impress it like you're requesting yourself and impressing myself with every squirt of this glue gun mistakes are in the eye of the beholder so maybe your mistakes or another person's beauty or maybe you're just not talented but that's not for me to decide do you see what I'm doing it actually looks really good oh wow just wait wait till I'm done Justine I'm blowing your mind mine looks like I'm making a Christmas freakin cats I don't even know what I'm making I think this is but I don't know my states this is that Texas I don't know I think I'm gonna change it up maybe I'm gonna do like um something else like a Christmas tree oh what's this for did you ever do Christmas planes when you were younger I think I was like the baby Jesus once you weren't Jesus I was like a baby so are you a boy are you a girl I'm a girl but I was still baby Jesus but Jesus is a point or is it 2017 you could be whenever you want you can't be with everyone but that wasn't 2017 this is like greenstick you know they don't really work to this oh this sucks well it's your fault for getting the knockoff brand you didn't know I mean is there like a glue gun brand that people use um the ones that work you burn yourself again yes is that true you can burn off your fingerprints and then you can do a crime and no one will get in trouble it makes sense because you don't have a fingerprint right so as long as you don't leave a blood trail like they're never gonna find you can't get this freakin glue to stain your right this glue sucks everything's on awesome that's not a royalty-free so do not put that in just like put in another team I will everything is awesome you better put something else in there and you're gonna get flagged you know it's worth it for that my favorite movie was the lego movie I thought you're gonna say your favorite movie was called demonetized no which sounds like a horror movie for youtubers yeah but I think it might be like a real-life yeah unfortunately it's a just Jim and I'm burning I don't think you should say things like that out loud I said that once they're not in trouble Ashley don't yell it at church cuz that's where I yelled it and they got in really big trouble I'm sure depolarized Wow wait I don't think this is gonna hold up on my body if I try to put this watch this watch this you just gotta like squirt it on and flop it on top all right I'm gonna put the glue yes Nani's agree gosh I think we should invent a glue gun I think we should invent a t-shirt company because I am crushing the game would you sell it we could but it's in a mystery box so we need to try that next I agree I really want you to meet my friend but she hasn't been around it really long you I do not have friends just well that's why she has to been around for a while but her name is a Justine she's to be my roommate oh really and some things happened so what happened she didn't want to be your friend anymore I did and I might have like injured her do you need me to help you do you need some no I do not need your help look at your sweater it's really the best that I think I've ever done do you need any other presents or can I steal me you can have them I really had high hopes for this I feel like that's a good life lesson that I hope no no no that your expectations are very very low and anything that happens think about it Thanks do you need something I blame you I'm sorry I know it's really hard everything is awesome not if you're on it oh do you think you'll wear this year is your Jersey prettier no because Christmas will be over on true so I'll probably wear something even prettier than this I'm getting pretty close to done then I'll

here yeah shoot [Music] 
Hey guys, it's Justine and today We are chatting about all things Apple watch Series 3 now the biggest difference between the new series 3 Apple watch is that it will now support Cellular and what that means is you're basically not going to need your phone You will just need your watch to do all the things that you would need your phone for like make calls for instance Text messages you can even listen to streaming music which is something that I'm really excited about Another thing that is new is Siri will actually talk back to you previously you would just get a response via text But now because of the new processor that is in the Apple watch series 3 Siri will be able to respond to  you you won't Even need to look at your phone you do watch your tiny phone on your arm So cosmetically the old watch and the new series 3 is the exact same size The only difference is the back heart rate sensor crystal is and I quote "two pieces of paper thicker now I didn't get a chance to try it on and it did not feel any different at all I Did not even notice that this was bigger I feel like two pieces of paper is extremely thin And I think about all the new things they have packed into the new watch that's a pretty big Advancement something that I thought was pretty cool is the biggest question was well Where's the antenna going to be if it's still gonna be the same form factor the entire front face of the screen is the antenna And these little green dots demonstrated right here But my new friend that I met at the Apple event that shows you that it is connected to cellular They share this amazing inspirational and a very Emotional video during the keynote that showed all of these people who have used the Apple watch for the past year in the past two Years, and how it's changed their life there isn't even an instance where the Apple watch actually saved the wearer's life They realized that their heart rate was much higher than it should have been for a resting heart rate when you're not doing any activity And that can sometimes signify something is wrong so with that that allow this person to be alerted instantly that hey I think I should probably go to the hospital so obviously you heart rate is a very important thing to have being monitored constantly It also plays a huge factor in fitness and what I love about the new Apple watch is they're going to be working together with A gym kit to allow you to sync your watch data And your gym equipment together so for example if you're running on a treadmill that treadmill is gonna be able to more accurate release How long you've been running your distance your pace all of those things and a lot of times especially of gym equipment It's very hard for those things to be tracked by wearable devices Because it doesn't really know what you're doing you might be able to tell it yeah. I want to treadmill yeah I'm on a stair step But it doesn't actually know the machine itself has the data of what tasks you just performed so now all you have to do to Be able to get that data right to your watch is Tap and go they also said that they're going to be having some support for snowboarders I've never snowboarded before so I'm not really sure all of the things that are gonna be going Into that and what you guys would be looking for we'll be able to monitor elevation And I'm sure maybe there's sort of a setting in there that they could be like hey How fast was I going down this mountain? I'm not sure, but I feel like that information would be kind of interesting to me if I was snowboarding I'm also not a big swimmer, but there are some new features for swimmers They also did a really cool demonstration of this woman on a paddleboard in Tahoe And they made a call to her and the only thing that she was using in that live keynote was her watch and it sounded Really really good brand, and I don't make many phone calls But there's a lot of times when I take my dog for a walk that I like to still have my phone then I'm holding My phone walking the dog. I'll have a water, and then I have to pick up the dogs There's a lot of things so if I'm just taking the dog for a simple walk I will now just be able to take my watch and still be connected Still be able to get my text messages my apps and other sort of Notifications that I normally wouldn't be able to get if I didn't have my phone with me I'm a huge fan of being able to stream music from your watch. That's gonna. Be really cool, so using Apple music They said that you'll be able to stream more than 40 million songs you think about that and put that in perspective That's all that's a lot of music. This is one of the new watch faces It's a nice gold and it kind of matches the new iPhone eight gold color And it looks really really good in person this watch band is called Spicy orange. It's so great. This is one of the new sport loop bands that they just introduced as well And it's a new type of model that it's made of like this breathable fabric so when you feel it It kind of feels like velcro, but like a really soft velcro. It's kind of spongy. It has a little bit of push back I'm not really sure how to explain it and velcro is right here So this allows you to pull it as tight as you can all the way around your wrist now I have a problem though because I have small wrists Which I probably should pop down to the 38 because it would make a lot more sense But I do like having a bigger screen I'm basic But I usually don't run into this issue of the watch bands being too big because most of the sport bands they come with two Different sizes they come with a small/medium and a medium/large band So you're able to adjust that to the size of your wrist and I was at the Apple campus And I was so excited that I was like I am gonna treat myself And I'm gonna buy this Hermes Apple watch band and one that I thought I was getting was this loop band But this loop band is only made for the 38 the 42 comes in the one that I was unboxing and I didn't know this At the time so when I opened it I was a little bit surprised because I was expecting that it was going to be the loop and all the way around A little deceived by the display so unfortunately when I tried it on I was like man. This is really really big Problem with getting the 42 millimeters I Put it on the tightest setting and everything and I wore it for a little bit I was like I have to return those if there's no way that I could justify spending this much money for an Apple watch bands It does not even fit so my suggestion to you guys if you are planning to get one of the more expensive watch bands do Try them on first go to the Apple store Give it a shot because I don't want you to have the same problem that I had while we're on the topic of watch bands They also introduced a bunch of new colors of watch bands. I love being able to switch up my watch bands I could care less about what I'm wearing I care way more about what my watch band is but since I've been wearing this Nike sport loop one. It's been my favorite It's a very breathable. It still does get a little bit sweaty, but it's way better than the ones without the holes That's why I'm really excited about the sport loop because that is something that I feel it will absorb sweat And you'll have to worry about being like hmm another day I gotta loosen up my Apple watch because my arm is sweating in addition to the new gold face They also have this gray ceramic. I'm a huge fan of the ceramic watch basis I have the white one which I'm sure many of you guys have watched me unbox here previously I love the ceramic it feels great on my wrist It is a little bit heavier than the aluminum, and it is a little bit more expensive So we're deciding which Apple watch is right for you I think what it really comes down to is price And do I want something a little bit smaller and lighter, and is it necessary to have LTE I don't think it's a how to present necessary to have LTE especially if this is your first album watch But this is your first Apple watch I think it's gonna be a really cool feature to have to really not have your phone if you work in a job or for Say a class you will be able to have access to pretty much everything that you would have on your phone on your wrist Let's take a look at some of the new watch bands that they introduced this one. Here is my favorite It is so beautiful. It is called the fuchsia. It's a beautiful leather fuchsia of it I feel like I'm probably gonna have that same issue that I have with this that I had with that Hermes version then you Sport loop here are some of the new colors. This flash looks awesome here. It is spicy orange I love it electric pink midnight blue dark all of sports seashells sport. I feel that will probably get dirty I've never had any problems with any of these white bands getting dirty because they are that silicone so it's very easy to clean but What this I feel like it's more of a fabric so I mean I would probably just throw it in the wash when I'm doing Laundry. I don't know what will happen to it I can probably do it test to see the outcome so maybe I'll get the white get it dirty See if I can clean it and see what happened so I can do a test for you guys to see if it's okay to Throw your Apple watch loop fans in the wash people also Tell you that you're not supposed to throw like tennis shoes in the watch, but all of my Nikes I throw them in like every other week and guess what they're fine. Here are some of the new sport bands We have a rose red book blue sport band the ultra violet dark olive Soft white I like this fog sport fan. That's a really good color pink midnight blue black It's still a really huge fan of the Nike sports fans, so here's a few other new colors They have the pure platinum and the black pretty sure they had this one before but I still really liked that look this one looks To be like a dark blue. Here's a few of the woven nylon these all look really great as well There's really so many customizations that it's insane. Here's in the leather. Here's the cosmos blue There's my baby pink fuchsia other colors. These all look really good than modern buckle I'm more of the sporty fan, and here's their Mezen leather They're so, beautiful, but here's the problem 38 millimeter only I did not know and they all look great No real question is how much of these things gonna cost so we're gonna look here And this is the breakdown of all of the models they have You can get it with GPS or the GPS and cellular. We've got this series three This is the silver aluminum with the Fox for fans That's a really nice look like that looks super slick course the rose gold is by far one of my favorite colors ever although I'm probably going to be getting the ceramic one again so to differentiate between the Apple watch seriously the cellular and the previous versions without Cellular they decided to put a red dot on the crown, I'm gonna be completely honest with you I do not like the red dot at all red is my least favorite color I think red is a really great accent color, but in this sort of a scenario I don't think it is it all mostly because there are so many different colors of Apple watch bands and different Combinations and some of those things as a designer myself I would never put red with some of these colors like it's just like it's like a contrasting color And it's just I am NOT a fan at all, but with that being said I'm still gonna get one anyway I do think that it was smart on their part to put something cosmetic that would differentiate the two But I feel like the red is there nothing else that you could've come up with like there's gotta be Something something else that you could have done beside the red either way. Here's that lineup. Here's the silver aluminum case with the GPS They've also got the rose gold the Space Gray Space Gray aluminum, it's a gold look at that, and it looks incredible They also have some of the Nike watch series so here. They are here. Here's the silver aluminum case with pure black Oh my gosh the Space Gray the silver aluminum Space Gray and looma do with OGS you get the point and then we have the Hermes Apple watch series these ones are super expensive because of Obviously the brand and the leather bands then we have the Apple watch edition so that brings us here to the white ceramic and B gray ceramic and these both start at $12.99 I pick areas to see what that number? Combination is of the Apple watch faces and the fans and the GPS and the cellular like how many different combinations Can you make with all of these cuz it's gotta be pretty high another thing that I thought was really cool Is they announced this air power so it's kind of like a power? Wireless connecting match you can put all of your devices onto it And it will charge them at night At night because I feel like that's most of the time that you're going to be using that when I'm on the go or during The day I usually have like a movi charger with me And I don't usually charge my Apple watch on the go one of the things that I forgot to mention is all of the watches That were at the Apple event we're running watch OS 4 And there's a lot of new features in watch OS 4, which makes it pretty exciting I never did install the beta on my watch I thought about it But I think I'll just wait at this point for the actual thing to come out if you guys can't tell I'm a huge Apple Watch fan I wear mine almost every day everywhere. I go. I love dressing it up and dressing it down I have worn it so many times on red carpets usually sometimes It's you know with an outfit that you should wear an Apple watch with but I will wear it and a lot of people ask Me what do I use my Apple watch for? mostly And it's weird because I don't really know if there's one set thing that I use it mostly for I feel like it integrates seamlessly Into my life, it's sort of second nature. I just kind of look at it I see what my schedule is I go do set activity I love being able to use it for navigation when I'm driving in my car It kind of gives you that little hey the gentle tap of you have to turn soon Which is great because I'm not very good with directions It's also great for when I'm in a city and walking I can just have those walking directions on my wrist And I don't have to have my phone up so if you've ever been skeptical about the Apple watch I think now is the time they have worked out all of the bugs all of the kinks And they have finally figured out the place for this thing anyway This was a very long video, and I talked a lot, and I probably could keep talking But I'm gonna end it here and as soon as I get my hands on one of the Apple watches I will make a video about it, and I'll let you guys know my full review and all of my thoughts but just for now I'm gonna go ahead at this video now. I'll see you later. I can't believe I still edit my own videos what am I thinking? I'd have a lot more free time to play destiny if I didn't edit Did I like it? 
Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and today, I am extremely excited I feel like every time I start out a video I'm really excited because usually I'm unboxing something cool, and I get to show you guys something amazing and today That is no exception. We are unboxing the new Mavic platinum this actually has a few new integrated features that are different from the original Mavic you can fly up to 30 minutes with the new intelligent flight battery And it has 40% less noise so if you thought the original Mavic Pro was quiet Then this thing is definitely way more quiet than the previous and soon We'll find out so some of you who may be new here may not know But the Mavic pearl has a very special place in my heart and just think guys don't get it confused This is the Mavic pearl platinum the original one launched last year, and I got a chance to go to, New York We got the drone early we created a really fun video to be a part of the whole keynote event and it was so much Fun and I had the best time I got to go in the stage I got to talk about how drones have really changed my life Specifically with the Mavic because it's so small its compact the quality is incredible so basically you can take this thing anywhere It's great because when I was on stage I actually had my purse with me, and I was like I've got a drone in my purse Which usually would be a joke, but now it's a reality Especially with the spark now. I'm getting off on a tangent either way this is The new drone that we're gonna be unboxing today the mavet Pro platinum they also announced a Mavic Pro Alpine. It's beautiful It is all white and it is absolutely fantastic look It's unboxing gonna be heading up to Big Bear so I will give you guys a nice flight demo as soon as I get there But right now. I gotta unbox and get on the road Period is is a more platinum color which is awesome hence the name platinum hello, baby here's our controller pretty much the same as the previous Mavic and the Platinum avek right here my gosh this thing is awesome. If you guys haven't seen it already I also did a really fun video on the DJI goggles Which these are also compatible with so if you guys are a huge fan of flying with the goggles? And if you've never experienced it it is definitely something that I feel like if you don't go and buy them yourself find a friend Rent them and try flying in fpv because it is just it's it really does feel like you're flying But you're on the ground and it really is so confusing to your mind because you're like what is Happening right now in the latest math a firmware update It will allow you to do fixed-wing mode So if you're flying fpv this will give you a much better experience when you're flying with the goggles There's also the new Kwik shop function so if you guys are familiar with a spark This was really great because you could do a bunch of really cool quick shops And it'll say it directly to your phone. You can save it share it and it's pretty awesome Let's see what else we've got in here. We have got cut a power cable micro USB This is what you connect your phone This this looks pretty much identical to the previous Mavic so if you do have an older maverick You can also use that charger. Yes, they've got an extra set of propellers, which are also very important It is always nice to keep these handy Just in case you break a blade because if you do you can just pop these on and you're ready to go But I like that these have a new silver tip on them I need to get myself to an Apple store and check out the Alpine version because I bet it looks so fresh Take a look at this new battery like I said, this is the new intelligent wolf-like battery much like the phantom pro 4 if you're familiar with that they also have a different line of batteries that will allow you to Fly a little bit longer I'll tell you what when you're on the air those extra couple of minutes are very very crucial you excited to see it It's not like I haven't seen it right here. Yes. Yes. Yes, I didn't think the bottom was gonna look this good I'm actually very surprised I thought that it was gonna be like a lighter gray color But I didn't realise that it was gonna be so shiny just like the other Previous Mavic these little guys have fold out is fold well as well when you put this in sport mode Let me tell you what it is fast It looks really really great. I'm so excited. I'm gonna go grab my other maverick. So I can give you guys a side-by-side comparison Here's our platinum and here is our, mammoth Pro Now these are both pro models But this one definitely has some higher specs like I said is the 40% Quieter you get the longer flight time I get to fly with my new iPhone Which speaking of which look at this nice look you guys look great together. This is clearly gonna work out very very well What is this do you want? The gold tips they have two different colors? This is crazy silver comes on them in the gold are the extra ones that's kind of cool well I'm gonna go charge This up set it up And then I'm heading off to Big Bear and I will do a flying demo and I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys think There it is that's the Matic pro sounds like While we Now we're gonna climatic Pro platinum We've got it right here, so let's see what this sounds like in comparison to the pro Just up in the air. All right you ready done I'm really sure I can tell a difference. I mean is it 30% 40% 50% I'm not sure a percentage, but I think it sounds quieter sounds like butter have you ever listened to a stick of butter? Pro platinum this thing is so amazing I still have a sticker. I don't even take off because it was brand new 
[Music] we're inside this LG tunnel there are 246 55 inch televisions inside of this tunnels and it has all of the Dolby Atmos surround sound so it really feels like you are in these places like beer right now soaring in the sky [Music] the LG Chloe now these are concept robots that can do multiple things there's one to bring you room service there's one that can potentially check you with your hotel and there's one that may one day replace shopping cart what a key things that have noticed here as he as this year is integrating Google and Alessa into other things it's all using Google assistant but you don't even have to say hey Google and it's integrated into the remote change like brightness to a hundred percent change lights to blue search YouTube videos for iJustine Oh what do you know it's basically you can use the remote control for your television to control your lights to control your entire home so basically change the color of the lights turned on air purifier I can turn on the air conditioner this is why I don't ever have to leave my house this is actually a pretty cool demo people have TVs at different locations it's really hard to be able to see from different angles with these they have an accurate color angle so no matter what angle you're at you can see all the colors at much more of a true depth the bottom is conventional and this is the top you can see the accurate color angles we're heading in to get a demo of this or K HDR projector you can scale this up to 150 inches Wow [Music] it's actually shocking at the picture quality because this looks like a television but it is a projector the colors are so vibrant licensed projectors over 20,000 hours basically you can watch its projected for eight hours a day for seven years straight I give them my time quite wisely watching plenty of Netflix shows on this thing you guys know I'm always struggling with monitor solutions and I'm trying out so many and I've seen a bunch of people try the ultra wide monitors and I think this may be the solution that I need predator [Music] [Music] basically just taking a little rest here at the CES cxeh cxeh cxeh I'm getting such inspiration goals all of these mock living rooms why can I not be an adult why does my house never look so we made to the Sony booth let me go check it out Chuck I've run into so many people this this trip okay you can Juna Juna so this year is like a little timeline of the past several years of sewing cameras it's showing where they started from and where they are now you know it's not kind of like that Drake song started from the bottom now we're here Jenna do you see this they have an 89 with the new sony RX z row on top of it it's their tiny new little action camera that you guys see me talking about they also have a bunch of different adapters and wages for this thing too so you basically take this rx zero and do so many different things with it they've a filter adapter page they have housing the camera control box there's the camera itself here is a teardown of everything that's inside of it and this is a really I hate to say I don't like saying aesthetic but this is a very aesthetically pleasing teardown photo [Music] I bow and it's kind of crazy because he has a lot of artificial intelligence built into him he can recognize up to five family members imagine there being like seven people in your family he had three toes as one does he does this is depending on the how the person treats the dog it'll respond differently so if Jenna is nice with ezvid odd than I am it's gonna like you more so this is I bow it isn't concept it's actually a real product he said that you can only get it right now in Japan and it sold out so maybe we just go to Japan and maybe we can find one so this is his little puppy pad and if it's blocked and can't find it he has a little tiny camera on his little butt right here that'll use the ceiling and he'll be able to navigate his way back home because he could tell and remember that there are two lights on the ceiling did you say you wanted to go see shirtless man it's okay I'll go shoot up to 40 the clarification of what's going on the Artic zero that I was just talking about they're doing bullet time they have 16 of them up here so it's capturing in real time and doing the matrix effect it looks really crazy I think they're reducing up on the screen we need to set up your face [Music] there's one of the actual Intel drones if you guys have seen it me the synchronized droning that they've been doing they have a really cool demo that they're doing here at Vegas over 250 drones are synchronized together to create this incredible experience every night from 8:00 to 10:00 they're applying these at the Bellagio and it is amazing but I'm holding one right in my hand surprisingly the thing it's very light here's your drone bag oh thank you hey this is sap from super south TV as you can see in the video that you've been struggling because you haven't filmed anything either I literally I think I filmed like three clips in this whole time what's great is I think CES is more about the people like seeing everybody when was the last time we met was New York but is there anything really cool we've seen the huge TV from Samsung one hundred and forty six inches I kind of want that on my wall it's pretty crazy to do this modular so you can have as many as you want exactly so you could just like have an entire wall of just this place and it was so busy there as well like I was trying to get some shots of it but there was like a hundred people in front of it it's furniture is smart furniture it's enabled with VIX fees so instead of yelling over to the other room say hey refrigerator what's in my fridge you can basically talk to the coffee table you can talk to your chair did you see the refrigerator that can basically preheat your oven and you say okay fridge preheat the of it like it's actually crazy how bixby is integrating into everything I have the family hub 2.0 do you know we don't use it I don't have a new one though it is pretty insane it's one of those things that you don't need until you have it but it's awesome I can see what's in my fridge right now do you want to show us your fridge no okay well if I would look at my fridge there's probably spoiled eggs and just a bunch of like coffee surround the TGI booth and they announce the Osmo Mobile 2 and the Ronin s did you get a chance to check it out yet I have checked out both there's gonna be two versions of it this so this one the one that they've got through the dslr's but they're gonna have a smaller version the mirrorless is apparently and I think that might be a bit more manageable well thanks for being in my video thank you for having see you I'm gonna put my microphone back now okay bye [Music] something that I've been super excited to see is the new razor phone you guys know that I absolutely love phone sort of huge iPhone fan they just announced a Razors laptop it basically integrates with the razor phone where a normal track pavatt Beach that's what the phone goes to guys know I'm a huge huge lightbulbs fan and but guess what razor now has an integration with you so you can basically customize all of your razor LED products with hue ice McComas to do I can now configure all my lights at the same time and I can also position them based on how they're physically located in my room that's the connection I'm using the speakers before those are awesome yeah those are actually our brand new speakers we just lost which on Tuesday okay you have a favorite song or Jim or even you want to do that your channel [Music] open up the door stop I usually listen to the censored version so I'm a little shocked because it's been a while since I've heard the full remix alright guys that does it for CES 2018 we're about to now embark on a journey back home to LA and we're driving so wish us luck unfortunately I don't have a self-driving car but that's alright maybe in the future oh gosh how long do you think it's gonna take Jen alright yeah support [Music] 
hey guys how's it going it's Justine welcome to day two of CES and today we are not actually going over to the convention center we are the sands Expo so this is kind of like an offshoot of a convention center over here is a ton of smart home tech which is my absolute favorite [Music] so I found something that I'm really into sweeping [Music] we're talking about smart sleep here at the Philips booth now what exactly is going on here because this looks very high-tech oh it is very high-tech it's actually our newest is a new two world technology called smart sleep and what it does it in the Hans's deep sleep and people who typically get less than seven hours of sleep a night has sensors on the forehead behind the ear to track your sleep and it sends a tone and that tone has been hamptons those slow waves and makes them long and strong again I started freaking out I was like guys it's David I just saw you walking we I went to your show I think was like last year I went through the tour of his incredible Museum you gotta come back we just redid a made of four times space incredible please I would love to oh my gosh they would be so awesome we just talked about yesterday about all the stuff that you're doing and it's great I follow you for so long and this is so great are you doing CES what I'm seeing everything that's new you know of course I use technology in my show yes and I try to use technology where people don't know it so even the inventors of these things I disguise him the way so yeah they're amazed by itself it's a great place newspaper what do you do there he is checking it out we're just like covering and finding cool stuff the iving the thing that I do love about your show is he uses technology if you guys have never seen a David Copperfield show you have to go and just witness it because it really is incredible and I think you're pushing the boundaries as far as magic technology and just bringing the funds in space [Music] one of the things I love to do at CES is obviously go around and find cool things this booth behind me I have absolutely no idea what it is there's no branding it basically looks like a huge Call of Duty map they gave me a blindfold to go in and I know nothing about what it is so I'm number one slightly terrified number two there's some security guards in the back and it says authorized personnel only so really I don't even know what to expect oh that's some industrial velcro oh my god now what is you I hear some music Oh oh my gosh I have no idea what's going on right now please remove your blindfolds [Music] right now are we still at SIA [Music] I am here of my own [Music] [Music] no I don't know what I have no idea where Nick is I don't know if I'm talking to myself am I talking to the camera Nick I am here of my own free will [Music] excellent see it's just that easy so volunteers for the procedures Oh do we not most of all into your volunteer almost tributes what have happening right now over the future of skin care what you just experienced was a completely we integrated into our newest release REO being the largest beauty device Graham we wanted to create something that really broke barriers and what you experienced was really that human experience of what we're doing so I'm sure you've seen people sit for 20 minutes in our masks we've done it yourself oh yes definitely sons of the masks challenges what you do so like you experienced we have a cryotherapy which is a cruel treatment in this we also have the thermal therapy I just turned the device on so it's a preheating we're gonna start with thermal therapy when you are at home you put the cartridge on and you do it 90 minute treatment it's warm it goes up to 102 degrees Wow well sequence it you'll scan your mask with your phone and then that will program your device that's so cool so so there's basically an app for your mask now what you're saying oh my goodness so and then it'll go through and you'll feel some pulsations which made us famous in our cleansing device yeah DeLuna as well as what you're seeing there with the red light is RGB LED light therapy and so what that does is stimulate cochin also is age-defying this is definitely not what I expected I mean this is something that you see at comic-con where you're running through like a zombie maze and you're getting attacked and then you come out with like well no we've got a nice face mask for you whoo this is the best zombie apocalypse ever I don't want to spoil it for anybody else but that was wild [Music] okay we probably should get one right clickbait titles that is nice [Music] there's always fun little gems that I'll find it but this is actually super surprising I always use Philips toothbrushes but look at this this is something I didn't even know existed this cup is the charge most people take their toothbrush and just throw it in a cup well now when you do it it's actually functional this is charging the toothbrush so this is called at the one it's a smart piano and it's really cool because it basically turns learning to play in the piano into a game I just tried to read sheet music for the first time in my entire life and I managed to play a song just LEDs that run along the piano and they light up so it'll let you know what you have to press and another cool thing they said they've launched here at CES is an LED panel so if you already have a piano you can also use the software auto open closed lid heated seat dryer deodorizer Wow wait I made a mistake when I started the CES videos I should have been doing a while we factor a while we from skills 1 to 10 [Music] what's happening and how do I get that outfit because it's incredible [Music] this was so shocking because like the dress is changing colors it's kind of like the dress like what color is the dress is this just eating Tac Toe like your Kindle reader but it's on a dress how do I do it I don't know really how to do that but that guy oh I'm not really sure look forward to CES we ended up at right now I'm not sure if I'm comfortable or what's up extinguisher gun this is the future I mean it is a mirror and I do feel like this is a future black mirror episode I mean this mirror is connected to the Internet I can use filters there's apps it runs on Android Anna has a built-in camera okay here we go I'll focus up what this is running forgetting Windows the simplest things I am so easily entertained hey come look at this sort of things that I'll announce here at CES is gonna be doing more third-party integrations so taking the towel technology and putting it into existing things like this this is a Herschel wallet they made this custom so it has a nice place for your towel to go this is key smart it's not made by tile but it's using the tile integration so instead of attaching a keychain tile to your keys you attach your keys to of this awesome little keychain here well that's not a key that's the popping bottles there's a flashlight cool Wow I'm enjoying so many of the small simple things here is here so in some of the newer wireless Bose headphones they have tile built into it so you can just use the tile app to find your headphones this is probably one of the smartest things that I've ever seen because how many times you guys lose your Apple remote all the time so one of the new things that they also announced at CES is tile integration with Google and Alexa can you hear me so let's do like a little demonstration I'd say that we lost our keys we could say hey Google a style to wring my keys sure here's Baroness I'm where are my keys oh right over there found them a style to find my phone all right over I found the amount of times that I've heard that specific ringtone you guys know I lose my phone a lot a style where my backpack is your backpack was lasted to 101 it would tell San Mateo of where was last checked in so you can go to that address USA retrace your status find your backpack we just got word that Shaq is here and he's playing a video so let's go see it I want to read by tradition $10,000 purse we saw him and now we leave okay one of the things that I was really excited about CES is finding smart doorbells but it's really crazy because I can't find any of them anywhere see that was a joke guys because they are absolutely everywhere every turn that you take there are smart doorbells and smart outdoor lights it's wild now let's go because we're already 15 minutes past the time that we should be here we have started and end of the day at Starbucks the only difference between the end of CES is normally the Starbucks line is all the way wrapping around here all the way to there but guess what nobody here now baby just uh [Music] 
hey guys how's it going welcome back to my kitchen and we are here for another festive Christmas episode of cooking stuff I don't even know what's been going on but peppermint mocha from Starbucks is one of my favorite drinks so today we're gonna be making peppermint mocha shots now we're making a little candy shot glass as well we're gonna be using this mold here so we're gonna be melting down these candy melts putting them into here and then we ready making the peppermint mocha drink to put inside of it but it's not gonna be a hot performant milk because if you put a hot drink into a candy Cup it's gonna melt so that's not gonna work out well so things we need are these shot glass makers and these candy melts so the first thing we're gonna do is I'm gonna make the shot glasses cuz these have to set for a pretty long time like I don't know how long but these are it's probably gonna take a while I got a new knife thank you Susie I love knives so much this one is so nice so I guess this is gonna be the first use of my day knife let's cut up holy it's just so sharp excuse you I'll leave that mmm I love Christmas let me tell you what it's really good these candy melts are absolutely delicious so you probably should watch this but I'm not going to so if you don't see another video for me this is why I didn't wash my mold they're gonna melt this up in the microwave I'm not really sure how long but you should put it on half power because you do not want your candy melts divert start do yourself give it a little mix this is probably gonna make one cup oh my gosh this is so hot I'm burning I'm burning I'm burning my flash burning my flash so now we're gonna be just dumping that into here ooh this isn't hot a lot at all like one bag is gonna make like three cups this looks like something from my nightmares wobbling oh my gosh do you guys have a favorite Christmas recipe something that you make with your friends or your family let me know in the comments below I would love to hear about it and try to recreate and mess it up completely so I'm gonna set this off to the side and then we're gonna make our peppermint mocha mixture that's gonna be going inside our little peppermint shots I sure hope this works now that our candy melt shot glasses whatever you want to call it or sitting off to the side it's time to make the peppermint mocha and I am so hyped for this you guys don't even understand so for the peppermint mocha we're gonna need whip cream 1/2 tbsp of peppermint syrup 3 tablespoons of baking cocoa 3 tablespoons of warm water or - 6 shots of espresso but we're just gonna use Starbucks coffee 2 cups of milk and mint peppermint chips it's time to make our peppermint mocha keep wanting to close this but it doesn't close yeah not really sure what to mix this in mmm Rhea but today we're gonna be using the sangria pitcher to make oh wow that was very scary so you're supposed to do this fruit in here and then it kind of like infuses the water but we're not doing that we're doing something else so we're gonna put in our cocoa water oh wow I'm making a mess that looks like when my dog doesn't feel well and he has an upset tummy shouldn't I wasn't a blender what was he thinking that looks pretty melted in the milk those well this smells delicious already yet mixed up so we have to add our syrup we've got some peppermint syrup do you say syrup or syrup I'm curious but I'm gonna say it how I want to say it knife you weren't this is so sharp I just actually can't believe it mix it up and then it's set to add 4 to 6 shots of espresso I think we're gonna be more peppermint because I put a lot of coffee in here 90 calories for two tablespoons it's drugs am I supposed to put these chips in there doesn't say these fractions that I found on Google we're not very I'm very good I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with that I'll figure something out cuz I'm smart I feel like I should try it first what if it's not good what if I have this at my Christmas party that I'm probably not even gonna have and people don't like it it's just a little sick it doesn't really taste good I don't think there's enough chocolate or enough mint or enough coffee it kind of tastes actually really terrible to be honest with you so I think we're just gonna carry on with the video and act like this is delicious let's go check on our peppermint melted shot glasses oh boy so it's been approximately I'm not sure how long but it looks like our shot glasses have completely molded so I'm gonna take this out and then we're gonna fill it up with this really disgusting peppermint mocha knockoff drink so I'm gonna put this in the freezer for a little bit just because maybe that I don't have room in my freezer this is a refrigerator for a minute maybe that'll make it taste less like crap but I'm not sure okay let's pop these guys out it's like this mold is birthing a shot glass gonna pull it out oh oh this is so silly Wow can you believe it having triplets just don't let go here you go what's our last one these look really good so if you guys do this and expect for these to mold up really really quickly I can't lie to you I did this a few days ago so I made these ahead of time because it'll probably take you maybe five or six hours I think to completely mold don't expect it to be something that's like real quick because it is not what a disappointment I feel like making these baking videos has really set me up for a very successful life because I fail a lot and I am so okay with failing okay let's fill these guys up look at this here we go feeling mmm no it's delicious doesn't it I hope that you try to recreate this and let me know if you can come up with a better peppermint mocha recipe because this was not a very good one I haven't used whipped cream in a while I better test it okay looks good oh no it's going into the yeah look at this Oh No shoot okay well I've done some things some things have happened we have one good one now we're gonna add our peppermint flakes onto the top Wow Martha Stewart come at me Rachael Ray what's cookin good-lookin well here they are these are really incredible peppermint mocha shots I think this is a really great thing that you can make for a holiday party or something you should probably not follow this recipe the only thing that I did correct was make the shot glasses they look pretty good feel like I should try it huh look I'm disgusted at my own creation [Music] it's like an acquired taste mmm well thank you guys for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this fun little holiday hmm whatever you want to call it if you guys try to recreate this recipe let me know I would love to see if you guys do it better than me because I'm pretty sure that's something that you'll be able to do quite easily if you guys have any other recipes that you'd like to see me do for the holidays leave those in the comments below and I will see you in the next one hopefully the next video was a little more successful than this I'll see you later bye [Music]

hey guys how's it going it's Justine and this video has been very very requested and I didn't even realize that I haven't updated you guys on which Apple watch I decided to keep there has been quite the Apple watch dilemma going on in my household it's really so stupid I mean it's definitely the most first world problem that you'll ever hear about so long story short the Apple watches that I ordered was the 38 grey ceramic which was one of the brand-new ones they recently launched and the 42 white ceramic which was the one that I had intended on keeping ever since my first Apple watch I have always had the 42 and for whatever reason I just thought that's the way that the Apple watches are supposed to fit I have very small wrists and when I tried on that 38 millimeter one I was like this fits perfect oh boy this is really nice actually I mean do I need a bigger screen does this look better on me but the problem was I didn't necessarily like the gray one I really like the white watch face and I love this pink band and I think this looks so good on the white this is the look that I like I mean good I love it I love the pink with the white so it's having such a debate and I was like I don't know what to do I don't know which one I should keep I think the p-38 fits me so much better but I have all of these 42 millimeter bands what do I do it's such a stupid problem to have but you know when your entire of life basically revolves around your love of Apple products these are the types of problems that I have I mean I have plenty of other ones but these are the ones that I choose to share with you here on YouTube so a few days after I decided all right I know what I'm gonna do I'm going to keep the 38 millimeter white but I didn't have it and the shipping was like six weeks out which I thought was crazy so I ended up ordering that one and then I was gonna return the two that I already had and then I saw at a local Apple Store I could pick it up same day so I did I went picked up the 38 I had it all was well but for some reason the one that I had just ordered that said was going to ship in six weeks it shipped that day and I'm freaking out my credit card is like fraud fraud fraud so that one shows up within a day so I then have the the Apple watches that I have to return and I'm like this is absolutely insane so the otter watches are returned I then and back with my beautiful 38 ceramic which is so great I love the fit I love the pink band I love the white face and love even the red dot which uh stay tuned because I have a video coming out very very shortly to show you how to cover this thing up even the red dot doesn't bother me as much anymore mostly because I can't really see it because when I'm going like this I don't see it so the red dot signifies that this is a cellular Apple watch and if you guys don't what that is I mean clearly you've gotta know if you're watching my channel because I've talked about it so many times this but what the heck was that that scared me so bad my GoPro just turned off but that happened as soon as I touched this and I was like that's not a sound that my watch is supposed to make anyway the red signifies that it is a cellular Apple watch which means you can make calls you can send text messages if you don't have your phone which is so awesome like that's so great I can go walk the dog I can still have my watch with me I can make calls I can reply to text messages I can still get Instagram notifications right here on my wrist now in theory this should have been a very very very easy thing to set up some of my friends had no problems at all but for the first week or so there were some issues there a bunch of complications but my complications were not on the Apple side they were on the carrier side for whatever reason I was not able to add a line and everything that could possibly go wrong was going wrong and I was so confused I probably spent maybe six hours total on the phone with tech support I mean there were times I was basically just cleaning my house and I had them on speakerphone and they would come back and be like you still there I'm like yeah I'm still here the kitchen's clean I've moved on to the living room but throughout this whole process I will say the people that I talked to on the phone in tech support and customer service were so nice like I have never had such a good experience like talking to customer support they're asking me about my day what I plan on doing for the weekend I felt like I had made some new best friends and they kept saying we're so sorry we don't know why this is happening and this and that I think it's because I've been such a longtime customer did everything that I had was like old line and I'm grandfathered in for unlimited data just it was pretty much the perfect storm of disaster they could possibly happen getting this to work but with all that being said it now works which is amazing I'm gonna try to call my sister I'm putting this in airplane mode so you guys will see that it work call Jana is Eric College and she's definitely gonna pick up because I never call anyone so she's probably gonna think that it's an emergency here we go here we go I think it took a second to realize that it was no longer on Wi-Fi and connected to my phone hello it's not an emergency I know I'm making a video about the Apple watch smells like oh my god Jenna's definitely gonna think something is wrong it's working this is great yeah I was like Jenna's definitely not think this is an emergency because I never call and what I do it's an emergency I am so sorry if you had your watch on you would go no no emergency okay well thanks for uh thanks for answering I was gonna text you but then I had already turned my phone on to airplane mode I was like all right I gotta just call I'm sorry thanks for playing okay that's it bye I didn't have any I know I'm making you video like right now you're this is a demo of the Apple watch making a phone call really okay you call me okay I'll call you answer on your watch calling generic I'll get a drink are you on your watch are you on your watch yeah that actually sounds better than you did on the phone okay bye Thanks well that's that I mean it was a super long story and a lot of dumb problems and really you know it's just it's very very silly and insignificant and really just a dumb I just seen problems so feel free to make fun of me all you want I'm a in front of myself my friends had made fun of me but here we are I ended up with a watch that I wanted and I'm extremely very very happy with it so thank you guys for your suggestions I read through almost all of the comments and so many of you guys really just seen you clearly like the 38 millimeter so get the 38 I just didn't even know that the 42 was too big for my wrist I mean it basically took up my entire wrist and I didn't even realize it I mean like I did but maybe I was in denial and I cannot believe how soon it's gonna be before the iPhone tennis here so prepare yourself in the meantime if you guys aren't already subscribed to my channel feel free to do so just click

today can guys help my current favorite color is hints [Music] you [Music] you 
how many days has it been since September 23rd 2017 how many days ago was September 23rd 2017 it was 13 days ago 13 days okay that's a more accurate number so technically it's now been almost two weeks since I got my iPhone eight it's funny cuz in the comments you guys always say I bet you Steen's gonna make a two days with iPhone video or a three day with iPhone video 15 minutes with iPhone video or whatever new product it happens to be you could substitute the iPhone 4 or whatever that product is now I didn't do a one-week with iPhone 8 because I posted pretty much eight days straight of iPhone videos I think a lot of you guys have been looking for an updated video on what do I think how am i liking it am I having any issues so here we are we are two weeks in with the iPhone 8 and I'm not gonna lie I absolutely love this phone while there isn't a noticeable difference just by holding it just by looking at it from either side I mean if you are a very perceptive person and you can tell that this is a gold phone then yes you're gonna be able to tell of course I have a case on it if I didn't have a case on it this is what it looks like just in case you haven't seen it yet if you haven't seen it yet does that mean that I haven't been making enough iPhone videos now the number one thing that I like is this phone is much much faster especially running iOS 11 now I'm not the only one that is been experiencing a lot of issues with iOS 11 my phone has been crashing a lot you guys have told me this I've been getting tweets a lot of my friends have been having issues and really when it comes down to it I don't feel like iOS 11 was a hundred percent ready to be released to the public it still feels like it's in beta but there are still some issues that I feel like they're working out so hopefully those all get resolved very very quickly because it definitely is annoying what I'm doing something especially doing screen recording there's been a few times where I've been halfway through filming a video and I have it all synched up so I'm talking to my camera I'm screen recording my screen and then my phone just restarts and that means that the screen capture that I was recording also stopped recording and did not save I have been using I was 11 since beta 5 which has been a pretty long time at this point so I've definitely seen iOS 11 at its worst but going back to how fast this phone is being able to take photos being able to switch through all the portrait lighting effects editing exporting videos it's significantly faster than the 7 and I would say if you're an average phone user you might not really notice that huge of a difference if you're coming from the 7 to the 8th but for somebody who does basically everything like runs their entire life and business off of this phone it's made a huge difference I love all of the new video quality options being able to shoot at 4k 60 frames a second at 240 at 1080 it's pretty great even though my do follow this 4k 30 that's what I usually post most of my videos and it is so great to be able to have that slo-mo option you gotta get it Wow one thing that I do wish was a little bit easier is it takes a while to get into the settings to change the quality but you have to go into the system settings and then you have to go to the camera settings and you have to go through in school through and figure out which one you want to pick I just feel like it should be something that is easily integrated into the camera app like you shouldn't have to leave the camera app to change those settings I just don't understand why there's not like an option that I can't just like click and swipe or something and it'll automatically change here I just feel like that would be easy and logical it's kind of crazy to think that we are weeks away from the pre-order for the iPhone 10 and a lot of you were very confused as to why I got an iPhone 8 and why don't I just wait for the 10 that's a very crazy question I'm not sure why you would ask me that like would you expect me to be 8 and then just wait for the 10 I can't do that I have an eye in front of my name do you expect me to wait over a month for a new iPhone when there's a new iPhone that's already out that I could have in my possession for an entire month especially a blush gold beautiful iPhone 8 11 and 8 features is augmented reality and to be completely honest with you I haven't even downloaded an augmented reality app like I had all intentions to I was like this is so cool I'm gonna do this all the time and it never did now what I'm thinking about it I feel like I probably should at least download some so I could play with them and test them out that could be really fun for screen capture that can actually be a really cool video itself do you guys have any augmented reality apps that you would like for me to try out you can leave those in the comments below and I'll check them out I made a video the other day talking about the new iOS 11 emojis and I just wanted to go on record and apologize because number one I didn't know what this was I'm so sorry I was like oh yeah it's awesome fitness thing I was like one of those things that you put down and like it helps teach Julie push-ups it's from the sport curling I've obviously heard of curling before but somehow that was not something that came to mind when I saw that emoji the next thing that I need to apologize for is this this is apparently not a porcupine it's a hedgehog guys started tweeting me pictures of Sonic the Hedgehog and I was just like this like I was actually the facepalm emoji so I guess to sum up all of my thoughts on the iPhone 8 I really really like it and I'm so excited that a lot of you guys have also been loving it so I had a few friends who decided to get the 8 instead of the 10 and that's mostly because they really still want the touch ID a lot of them don't believe that the face recognition is actually going to work the way that it's supposed to now while it was at the Apple event I saw a bunch of people using it all of the phones on the floor were tied to the person that had it and I was constantly accidentally locking my phone so then they had to unlock it and it was very seamless so if you want to imagine what that looks like basically you just look at your phone and swipe up this is my control center but it's that fast you look at it and swipe up and you're in your phone I'm feeling pretty confident that it's all gonna work out and everything is going to be seamless although I did have that confidence for the Apple watch and I just finally got it to work on LTE granted the issue that I was having was a carrier issue and it wasn't necessarily an Apple issue so other than tons of portrait photos and slow-mo videos basically just shooting videos about the iPhone for the past two weeks that's really pretty much all I've done another thing that I've done is of course listen to audiobooks which brings me to this month because let me tell you what I get to share with you what I'm listening to what I just downloaded this let's see if you can recognize this book it's Joey's no book do you guys don't know Joey his channel is Joey Graceffa and this is his third book and it just came out this week and I'm so excited because I just downloaded it on audible and he's currently on tour so if you are enjoy yourself a fan or if you're now a new fan you can check out his book on audible you can use my link audible calm I just seen you can get 30 day free trial and a free book so you guys know that I'm a huge audible fan and I feel like for me I Drive around LA a lot and I am it's at least stuck in traffic so instead of fitting in traffic it just listening at the top 100 songs like always audiobooks for me make me feel like I'm actually accomplishing something while I'm stuck in traffic I always appreciate when you guys send me recommendations these outside of the things that I choose to listen to which is mostly my friends books I get most of my recommendations from you guys audible is also celebrating their 20th anniversary which is kind of crazy because I remember what audible first came out I mean 20 years ago I was three so happy 20th anniversary audible and thank you so much for supporting the YouTube community we love you and I love you thank you for passing time with me in traffic so to celebrate their 20th anniversary they are turning the microphone over to you guys check out audible.com slash audible 20 they are giving away 20 Volvo's to you guys and all you have to do is tell audible why you love them so I wish you guys the best of luck and that would be absolutely incredible if one of you guys won from signing up you would definitely have to drive it to California pick me up take me out to pizza take me to get some coffee and then we'll probably go I don't know shopping cuz why not anyway don't forget to check out all the comm slash I've seen for a 30 day free trial and Agua calm slash audible 20 to enter their 20th anniversary contest and if you guys do decide to get Joey's book make sure you take a screenshot and tweet it to me I'm so excited to listen to this I'm gonna be heading out on a trip here very shortly let's see this is only nine hours in five minutes that's nothing that is like a Netflix series like I can probably finish this in two days of traffic which is so sad to think about so I guess going back to the iPhone eights I absolutely love the look of it I've told you some of my favorite highlights of it and I am just looking more and more forward to the iPhone 10 how many of you are still calling the iPhone 10 the iPhone X biggadike consciously have to catch myself every single time before I say it I give myself a slight pause iPhone 10 I'm probably gonna miss this home button I am looking forward to the portrait mode front facing camera oh I didn't even make a video about the pixel - that looks pretty awesome it's gonna be interesting to see how the pixel two handles portrait mode I've seen from some of the demos that people have been posting but they look really really good unlike other phones like the iPhone and the note 8 they all have dual cameras the pixel still only has one they said that they use machine learning to determine what should be in focus so I'm really looking forward to seeing how that stands up to the note and the new iPhone anyway I will see you guys in my next video I hope you guys enjoyed this quick little update on my thoughts about the iPhone 8 and I will see you in the next one have a good weekend echo give it to you we're gonna give it to us over to you [Music] 
Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and today we're going to be chatting about my office because I've been getting a lot of questions Since I've just posted a video, to hopefully answer a lot of your questions about what gear do I use but then that video ended up spawning more questions about well what's your office like? Where do you work? What do you edit with? So I thought I would make this video to give you guys a quick little update on what I've got going on because I mentioned in a previous vlog I had an organizer come in professional organizer like this is a thing like these people are absolutely incredible. One of my downfalls is organization and I have very very poor organizational skills like I'm not sure if it's just me but I feel like a lot of creative people we spend so much time creating that the rest of our lives sometimes gets out of control now, not only is there organization involved but there are some closet build-outs happening as well i have one master closet being built out so this is what this is gonna look like but this is what It looks like now and if you guys can see all of these bins all of these things will eventually have a home. Now all of these things in these bins came from places all around my house from my drawers from downstairs, from upstairs, from my bedroom everything that essentially didn't belong in the place that it was has now ended up in these bins and they'll soon will end up in this closet that's not a closet yet. This little space right here will hopefully look like this I'm so excited because the first few phases of This entire process is over and when I say It was insane like Everything That i had in my house Everywhere Was out in the open Like It was Just so nuts. But anyway, this is my current office setup so I kind of wanted to do a Before and Then an after and also get some suggestions from you guys Because I'm having a very big dilemma but more on that Later. Obviously The centerpiece of My office is right here, this is My Lg Oled Wallpaper TV I did an unboxing and setup video of This previously so I'll put a link in the description and up here In the little i if you guys want to check that out, but this thing is awesome it's one of those things when you're sitting and watching it that it feels so realistic that It sort of almost confuses my mind like I forget that I am looking at a television. The fact that it's so thin It actually blew The minds of the guys That were installing It. They were like This is crazy we've never even installed One of these before and They did an absolutely Incredible Job So my phase two sort of for this TV setup is i really want to get this cable Behind the wall and That's something That I'm gonna have to enlist a professional to do because Clearly i don't think i'm capable Now this cable is Very Important Because This Attaches to of the sound bar Here now the sound bar is not Just for sound this Powers the entire screen so you plug everything Right Here into the back of the sound bar this is where the hdmi goes and right Now we Have the New 4k Apple Tv hooked Up Which i haven't even Got a Chance to try yet so you Guys Will be Witnessing my first time trying it Out One of My favorite Things Other Than These Beyond incredible picture quality of This television is that The Sound bar has dolby atmos so when i'm sitting and watching TV and i Turn up That Volume It Feels Like You're in a Movie theater It Feels Like i Actually Have surround Sound set Up in this Room Which i don't Using The Dolby Atmos it's Able to give you that Feel i wish that i could show you in this video What it's like but I can't except for flailing My Arms Around because I'm getting so Excited One of The Things that i was Excited about with This tv When i first got it was the future of the things that i Could Use With it the first Thing has arrived is the Apple 4k TV now i'll be Able to take full Advantage of The perfect color quality on this TV it's Kind of Crazy Because the lg oled Pixels can Switch off completely What This means is black Is Actually Black Pitch Black So this is still a Part of The tv right Here This is still a Part of TV and the reds are redder like The colors are so Incredibly Vivid like i Said before it's Kind Of a surreal Experience Bye-Bye Oh my God One of the Movies that i was Excited about That Was in 4k hdr Spider-Man Haven't Seen It i've Heard Great Things so That'S gonna be the first movie that i watch To watch We gotta shut all the lights off Gosh Where's the remote UGH Another Thing that i'm Excited to connect to this TV is the new Xbox That Will be coming out Later This year, taking full Advantage Of 4k and hdr gaming is gonna be really awesome to test Out on here As i mentioned gaming You might Be confused as to why there are two monitors sitting Up when i have this Massive Huge Tv that It could also Be gaming on so we had these Stations Set Up where we had three of us playing destiny at The same time Two People could Be Playing on these monitor stations Here? And The Third Up here on the tv it definitely Got a Little Bit crazy and a Little Bit confusing because we're all Yelling and Screaming and sitting on This Couch Very Very close This is Matty's little Bed right Here so these two stations we have? Astro Headsets Hooked Up to them and those are Just Connected Directly to the controller These gaming stations definitely aren't a permanent Solution but For The time being While i'm super into destiny This is what we've Got set Up here and this light Right Here is definitely not something that i usually have but i felt like? It was Kind of Dark Over Here in the corner so i needed to put a Little Bit of light on Myself I love these light Panels They're small compacts and They're Really Easy to use There's one also Behind my Desk Which is Kind of permanent back there i use that a lot When i'm Shooting sort of like The iphone Rumor videos When i'm sitting at my Desk This is Actually Matt's Little small hd screen i need to return it to him but i really like It because it's easy When i'm Kind of Just on the go of Vlogging and i need to see what it looks like Because Sony Cameras do not have a Flip-out Screen
Come on this Is a New Addition to the desk this is the new Mophie Wireless Charger For The New iPhones This Is also a Nice Little Apple Watch Charger Which Doesn't really Look Very good i got to get A New one extra lens and these are some of My favorite lego minifigures Benny steve Jobs and Myself Plus Over here the original iPhone That i Just Remind Myself Started From The Bottom Now we're here so this Here is my editing station and this is Hooked Up to my macbook pro This is the Usb cu Edition with The touch bar and this Setup Is not Very organized but It Works for me i have it sitting Here? Underneath of My Desk There's two hard Drives Hiding Behind It Which i use for archiving footage back and  Up here to this Mac Monitor Which i've Been using for a Very long time and i'm so looking Forward to the imac pro or Potentially Apple Releasing a New monitor Because i would love to have something to connect to my Macbook? Pro i used these Little Samsung Ssds and these are so great Because They're Very Very fast Especially When i'm editing Off 4k footage these are the T 3s and this is one of the new T 5s that i Just Got And i thought that i wouldn't be Able to tell a difference in speed but Actually i Kind of can- Is that Good? There we Go it Turned some lights on so over here this is what i used to do vo This Is the razer Siren Mic And i actually Really Really Like This because it Allows You to also monitor Your audio and It Usually Sounds Pretty Good for everything That i need it for This Works Very well to make It sound like I'm actually in some sort of A studio or something When Clearly I'm not hey what do we Got over here? Gotta move This light Over Here so this will look Better from The Office so over Here this is where i have My? Surface studio and You Guys probably are like Just scene Why do you observe a studio so this Surprisingly Replaced My Gaming computer i wasn't Really Doing Much PC gaming and The PC gaming that i did do this Was Perfectly fine for It It completely eliminated The tower don't Get me wrong i absolutely Loved having an Incredibly Overclocked Powerful Pc That's Water Cold It Was Huge it's a Tower its massive i didn't Need it it Was super clunky and it Was Basically Overkill for anything That i was Doing Number two i'm not using it to its full potential so i plan on Actually putting that in Another Place to have a completely separate gaming PC set Up for anybody who may come over who wants to play Pc Games or stream? But for me right Now in my current state of me still editing my own videos i don't have time to do anything Except shoot and Edit and When i do Play Games i'M Playing for my own enjoyment Not to stream or post or Edit Any more gaming content Because i don't want to add Any more to my plate a lot of These Days Maybe if i Get Somebody to edit Half My videos I'm Mostly even Playing Diablo 3 I know diablo 3 yes i've Been Playing again It Was One of My most favorite Games ever Overwatch Actually Runs Really Well on here and of Course Minecraft Also Over Here connected to the PC i've Got This our MC babyface audio interface Which is connected to this sure microphone this microphone is Way Better Than the Saira that i have over there so depending upon the project or what i'm Doing it will sometimes switch These Microphones Back and Forth or i'll Record The Audio Over Here take it to the mac and next to that This is my astro mix amp Next to that is my super nes Classic Next to my nintendo switch That Is also Decked out in Classic nes Decal Style It Looks so good i Cannot Wait for Mario Odyssey And Below That attendance Which we've Got the playstation 4 Pro and then Below That we've Got the xbox 1s Which is connected to a monitor at the couch Let'S Just completely Ignore my lack of cable Management Please Which leads us back to the lg wallpaper TV and What this sound bar is on this is the dilemma that i'm not sure What to do and i first started doing an office Reorganization i thought hey maybe i'll Just Get Rid of these Desks Then i realized that I'm Very Attached to these desks and i absolutely Love the look of them so then figure out How to make This Work but the problem is this center console is Actually Just a Dresser from One of My Bedrooms and it Does Not fit the sound bar at All so I'm looking for a Really Great media Station to put here so i have opened Suggestions What do you Guys think i Should Do Should i mount the sound bar Should i not mount the sound bar i'm also Working on something Else That i will Hopefully Have installed Soon Which Will be a Very Very fun video that i cannot Wait for you guys to see i Will also Probably Need Room for That Too so that Thing Will Need Room and That Thing is about the size of a PC tower Which IS also one of The reasons that i was Kind of trying to make Room Over here getting Rid of One of The towers AnyWay I Feel like Making This video is Kind of Crazy Because This has Been my dream office Since i was i don't even know since i ever started first getting into tech Now i used to watch leo laporte and he still Is one of My favorite People ever i used to watch leo back in the day When i was Very Very Young me and my Grandmother Would Watch It all The time after School we'd Watch the Screensavers and i would see all of Their Crazy Setups That They would have and all of The amazing tech That They were Reviewing and i Was like Man One day That's What i want to do and it's pretty Crazy Thinking back to my childhood Self and To be sort of Living Out that dream of What i wanted to do when i was little It's crazy to think that the Jobs that we are Doing Now they never even Existed When i was a Little Child Like The Jobs that you Guys are going to create that don't Exist now is going to be so Fascinating Anyway That Could be a Whole nother tangent and a Whole nother topic But What i am most Excited about is that i'm Able to share with you guys My Excitement for Things Things that i love and you Guys share those Things back with me i'll see you guys in my next video and I'll see you guys in the comments until then i'm gonna use this Christmas Chapstick and Go out of This video Could Be Flink Destiny Right Now but no i'm not 
hey guys it's Justine and today we're unboxing the new Apple home pod yes here it is I'm so excited about this so you guys know that I'm a huge Apple fan but I also love smart home tech anything that can help me simplify or control my home especially through my voice I'm a huge fan of so let's get to the unboxing now we've got a great little pull tab here so I don't even need a knife I even brought a few selections for today but it looks like I'm not even gonna need these after all guess I'll put this away okay round because you gotta see this here it is it looks so good it fits my aesthetic perfectly it smells it doesn't really have a smell it looks like we've got some little instructions oh this is fantastic they of course included a wonderful Apple sticker here and it has a circular little cutout connect your Wi-Fi and turn on Bluetooth hold your device into the home pod and then complete the on-screen setup all done now simply ask Siri to play music to learn more go to the tips set up your app I love this extension cord unlike most Apple cords and cables it more like that plasticky finish whereas this is sort of like a soft kind of fabric you feel Siri welcome to the iJustine household you're gonna love it here Kate's plugged in something's happening hi hello okay oh it's happening it's happening so it's asking me if I want to set up and yes I do now it's asking me where is the home pot bathroom bedroom dining room garage hallway kitchen living room master bedroom office patio and I guess I'm just gonna choose office for the sake of I'm in my office right now so the next screen is personal requests allow anyone to use this home pod to send and receive messages and reminders create notes and more with this iPhone when it's connected to the same Wi-Fi network so you do have the option to turn this off so potentially your friends could troll you and send and receive messages on your Siri home pod but I'm gonna enable it I'll take my chances terms and conditions yes I will agree so the screens the accounts and settings screen so basically what's gonna happen here is you're gonna be using your iCloud account Wi-Fi all of the settings that you have on your phone to configure your home pod hi I'm Siri welcome to home pod you can't tell but I'm waving to get my attention say hey Siri hey try it Siri hey Siri what can you do hey Siri what can you do I can do lots of things like turn on the lights give you a news update and tell you about the weather now you try say hey Siri play some music hey Siri play some music okay here's a personal radio station built just for you starting with Third Eye Blind remember any time you have a question just say hey Siri I love this song it's almost like she knows already hey Siri stop playing I'm gonna get a copyright strike so I gotta be really careful hey Siri play me some top 90s rock playing some 90s rock oh hey Siri what is this band this is EMF this track is called unbelievable hey Siri when was the song first released unbelievable by iana came out on May 7th 1991 Alexa stop playing oh my god oh my god no hey Siri stop playing it was it was taken at me does that I didn't mean to say I'm so sorry to offend you what are the upsides to home pod as opposed to other smart devices as this has a six microphone array so basically it can hear you from very far distances or even while the music is playing there is a lot of tech built into this little guy that we don't even see it features seven horn loaded tweeters right down here at the bottom and at the top is actually where the high excursion woofer is that is weird of getting the crazy awesome bass at hey Siri do I have any new messages you have two new messages from Nick the Proterra digital touch message that's my proof of life yes what do you want to say I'm texting you with my voice using the home pod right now I am texting you with my voice using the home pod right now ready to send it yes hey Siri text Jenna is Eric and tell her that I am sending her a message from my voice on the home pod your reply to jenna ezarik Friday says I am sending her a message from my voice on the home potted some way sister I have a little fried egg emoji next her name so that's why I said jenna is Eric tried a do I have a new message you have three new messages for me Oh what are we on for tomorrow cheeks would you like to reply yes we are still on for tomorrow to do some cooking videos well let's tell you if I'm laughing or not yes we are still on for tomorrow to do some cooking videos hey Siri turn the volume all the way up that's very loud are you sure yes turn the volume at half this is great I'm having a three-stop fling play me some music okay let's press play sound just press the volume down you can do that just like that so it's crazy about this isn't matter where you put your home pod it learns your space so in real time it is processing the environment and what it should sound like so no matter where you are in this room because of the speakers that are all around it you don't have to just be standing directly in front of it if I were to place this in the middle of my room it would sound exactly the same no matter where I was standing so the way that this process is sound is different depending upon where you place it because this right now is close to this wall it is real-time configuring each speaker to give you the best listening experience I am still so shocked turning this thing up all the way there's no distortion at all turn the volume all the way down Wow that scared me height after the button this is also touch sensitive so if you do press down that will activate Siri so she is soliciting right now as you can see I don't have that information all right you press down that bill yep though I was talking to my friends hey Siri stop playing this thing's fast it's really really fast it's kind of difficult to give you guys a listening experience because everyone is listening to this video on different speakers or different systems so there's really no possible way that this is gonna sound the same if you actually experience it in person I'm gonna just tell you it sounds so good well guys I just wanted to do a quick little unboxing for you so you can see what's inside the box and how to get this thing all set up plus a few of my favorite features I love that you're able to actually have a conversation with Siri hey sorry when was the song released weight of living part 2 by Bastille was released on March 4th 2013 I think that's when I actually interview them as MTV event I did so the home quad obviously does work best with Apple music and that's because Apple has all of the information about these songs in their database but that doesn't mean that you can't play anything else from Spotify or anything else from your phone with that you'll just have to use airplay okay I'll pick office Juby father so that's great hey Siri what song is playing this is called scared to be lonely by Martin garrix when was the song released scared to be lonely by Martin garrix was released on January 27 so there's a lot more that you can do with home pod and I'm gonna go over that all in a separate video but for now this was the unboxing and a quick first look at the home pod honestly I only was going to get one of them but now after seeing it and playing with it I definitely am getting more later this year there will be a software update to allow you to use two of these and give you surround sound hey Siri play me some party music sure here's a personalized station of party songs by animagic oh yeah Calvin Harris she knows me so well hey Siri stop playing well thank you guys so much for watching my unboxing video I have another full video testing out more of the features of the home pod once you're done watching this which is right now because this is the end of the video go check that one out I'll put a link in the description and annotation and a card and I think you can figure out how to watch it I'll see you there bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and today I am so excited because this is the moment that I have been waiting for And I think it's a moment that some of you have been waiting for as well I now have my new iPhone 8 plus, and this one actually isn't mine, but I am unboxing this one as well This is the silver iPhone 8 So one of my favorite things about the gold iPhone 8 plus so far is the box is also a very light beige color So you might not be able to tell unless you hold the other one up to it It's a very very slight tint let's start the unboxing Trying to contain my excitement as some of you might think that I'm overreacting into you I say I am NOT This is someone who is genuinely enthusiastic about iPhones and everything Apple I need the stickers out of there. Back, okay, but we gotta get my stickers I have to save my stickers I cannot lose them Hey, Motorola Do you guys want to use this enthusiastic face next time you parody one of my videos for your commercials? I'd say call me, but I'm a little busy. Yeah, I don't want to take it out of the box. It just looks so pristine and perfect also, put up the silver Ah Shoot I got so excited for the big reveal that I forgot instructions Better put this away All our accessories just came right out with it. We've got our charging brick I usually use the bigger charging bricks because they charge my phone much faster got our ear pods and also we cannot forget the wonderful infamous dongle if you don't know what that's for I Just can't talk about it and of course last, but not least we've got a lightning cable. I'm still surprised They didn't end up going type USB C on the iPhone 10 I thought for sure that they would I feel like it may have been a little bit too much We removed your headphone jack your touch ID and now you have to unlock your phone using facial recognition Oh by the way. Now. You need a whole nother cable all those lightning cables. You've got bye-bye I would have been perfectly fine with it though because I've got so many USB C cables mmm Good thing this thing is waterproof I'm very very excited. I don't want to take the bottom in Wow Now for the front I cannot stress to you how beautiful this gold is if you're a fan of rose gold jewelry. This is definitely something that matches Actual rose gold jewelry the other two golds that they had the one was too pink the other was too gold But this is I've said it before but this is a perfect marriage of both of those golds to this Here's my pink sand band to kind of go with it. It's a pretty good match. Here's my pink sand iPhone case now Let's see how this looks on it because this is what I was hoping I was hoping that it would look perfect, and it does OH it's turning on!! The color matches almost perfectly and it looks really really good There's a slight gold accent right here on the touch ID got our lightning port as usual It looks really good This almost makes me really sad that there's not going to be a gold iPhone 10 if you have an iPhone iPad and bring it In your by to sign it on if you want you can also I've never done this before quick start a little prompt just showed up It's saying set up new phone, and then I'm going to hit continue, and we're gonna see what happens So during the set of that brings you to this true tone display Setting the iPhone automatically adapts to ambient lighting conditions to make colors of your consistently different environments next up. We've got this little guy We've got all of our same accessories This is kind of giving me a little taste of what to expect with the iPhone 10 because I do plan on getting the silver Estimated time remaining oh boy this is going to take a while oh Just getting five minutes twelve ten nine. Oh, I don't know I'll be patient the silver is really really great So in comparison to the gold let's take a look So it's like all of my apps are being re-downloaded, which is probably gonna. Take a little while for sure well those download I have two other cases to show you guys here. This is a rose red color And I know you guys know that I'm not a huge fan of red, but this is more of like a berry type color So it's not necessarily red. I feel like if I was gonna have a red case This is definitely the color that I would go for see what it looks like on me silver 8'o I'm always curious, what do you guys prefer do you prefer a smaller phone? Do you like the 8 plus? Do you like the size of the 8, or do you even think that this is too big? I've also got one of the new iPhone 8 leather cases. This is the cosmos blue Seem to Why are you so difficult? This is actually a nice color blue let's see the blue on the gold phone. It's not bad I don't think that I would pair this blue with the gold though. You would probably go very well with the white I'm sure it would look perfectly fine. Also on the black. It's not bad I feel like this is not a justine color though. I might try to go caseless for a little while I know that's very very scary well the thing I thought was kind of interesting is they removed all of the text below the iPhone So as you can see there's text here no Text here very very clean. Here's some of the new wallpapers. I think I'm probably going to choose I already have one of these sets which I previously had downloaded whenever they had the leaked images. I picked this one Here's a look at some of the new camera features. I've got the natural light the studio light contour light stage light Stage light mono. I'm wondering if I'm gonna be able to try to take a picture of myself Place subject within stage light okay, the struggle of making videos by myself I don't have anybody to take this picture for me. This is gonna be a great test Let's see here. I feel like that what I might be in okay. Let's just let's press the button is you would have Okay, I just took this picture basically And just set up a timer and took a picture of myself very dramatic oh Yeah, this is definitely gonna work way better. We want to have somebody else take the picture for me I'll be doing a full camera review and test very very shortly so look for that in the next couple of days There may be a chance the videos already up I'd be sure to check my channel and make sure you subscribe so you know when I launch new videos my phone is still currently updating So there it is I need to be much further away. I can't reach my arm any further One of the big highlights of the new 8 in the 8 plus is there is now wireless charging I covered these chargers in my previous video where I opened some accessories for my new iPhone and my Apple watch This is the mophie charger, and this is the Belkin wireless charger, and if you're completely clueless on how this works you may have missed That demonstration well, thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this unboxing of the new iPhone 8 plus in gold and the silver 8 I'll be doing a much more comprehensive review especially Dedicating a lot of time to the camera, but that's something that I'm not able to film by myself So I'll be recruiting my sister once again who actually unboxed the iPhone before me She got the Space Gray which I'm very happy about so we'll be able to do a color comparison so look for that video soon But the next one that I'm going to be posting is the Apple watch series 3 unboxing I got the gray ceramic and the white ceramic and I'm not sure which one I want to keep I guess we'll find out why I box that thanks for watching, and I'll see you guys soon Your sweet I'm not well just kidding I'm perfectly fine debatable hahaha 
hey guys how's it going it's Justine and today I'm answering the question that you guys have been asking me for months everyone has already done their IMAP Pro unboxings and I've been so excited for this computer but mine isn't here yet when they originally announced the specs there were rumors the iMac pro with 18 core was going to be delayed I wasn't gonna let that stop me because usually whenever I get a computer I end up specking it out to the max because I put these things through a pretty much a torture test every single day editing especially with my macbook pro almost all of the videos that i edit in the past year or so since I've got that MacBook Pro with the touch bar I've edited everything on that I shoot everything in 4k and I edit almost everything off of solid-state drives I don't necessarily always edit on the computer because I'm always so afraid of one losing my computer to the hard drive space filling up because there is only two terabytes on there so usually when I shoot a video what I'll do is I'll put it on the two terabyte drive because that's what I'm gonna edit off of and then I make a backup of that on a separate Drive and now that I have my server I basically dump everything on to the server first then put it on to my two terabyte drive and if I happen to be traveling and editing then I usually like to have an extra backup of that in case something happened to the drive that I was editing on but the question and the reason that you guys are here is which I met Pro did I get and if you guys have been following me on Twitter there was a slight a little bit of a hiccup in the messaging of when my computer was gonna be delivered I got this email it's that Justine congratulations you're I'm a parole was on the way and then within 24 hours those hopes and dreams were quickly ripped away from me faster than you can say hey dry Mac Pro is gonna be here just kidding an email had prematurely went out to everyone who ordered the 18 core iMacs and it's still as the February shift Dave what is it ah my current ship date is February 5th through February 19th and the reason for this is the 18 cores were delayed I feel like pretty much everyone I know that his ordered one has already gotten theirs but I was crazy and I went for the 18 core the 128 gig ram with the 4 terabytes a low state drive that's kind of crazy because to get the 4 terabyte solid-state drive which I know most people didn't even opt for it was like 2,300 some dollars extra just to get that 4 terabyte drive which makes sense because it's solid-state and right now solid-state drives are extremely expensive but because this computer isn't really that updatable I had date it to the max because I feel like for me this computer is gonna last me for a very long time I say that and then as soon as I get another computer you guys are gonna come back to this video and it's going to haunt me my words will haunt me but either way I'm not gonna sit here and justify why I bought in over $14,000 computer because I'm not sure if I'm sane I don't know if that was the same decision I don't think it was a very good decision monetarily pretty sure I probably coulda spent $14,000 as an investing in a Bitcoin mining farm but that's another story my entire life basically revolves around Apple and technology so for me this is an investment an investment in my future an investment in the future videos that you guys are gonna be seeing I'm still trying to justify in my mind how much I spent a freaking computer well guys that's the answer to your question that's the I micro that I got I got the spectat one I'm super excited I'm still trying to justify to myself that it's okay it was an okay decision make sure you guys come back stay tuned for the unboxing and you better believe that I will be doing some tests of exporting from my macbook pro and iMac 5k now I know that I don't use premier but I would love to do some premiere tests as well because I know I have a lot of you guys that do edit on premiere of a lot of friends attending on premiere so I'd love to see how premiere and final cut stands up against each other while exporting and rendering videos across the MacBook and iMac and the new I buy pro so I'm gonna stop rambling I'm just gonna go think about what I've done and I'll see you guys in my next video [Music] 
Hey guys Justin I was telling myself to see you gotta stop you gotta cut down on the iPhone videos beginning You got a new iPhone and everybody knows that but the new a Century City Apple store Just opened up the day at the iPhone 10 came out So it's driving past and I decided that I need to come and check it out. I came here to this Apple store I think it waits in line for an iPad at some point I Got too, that's what I'm getting I'm getting the pink one Not really sure where it's at this is all new, but they just recently reopened up this mall so everything is brand new I've never seen you So where's the Apple Store Here it is I didn't even recognize a because there's no big Apple logo anywhere The only Apple logo is over here that I could see which is kind of crazy because it's super bright that I really didn't even See it OK, I push my iPhone now because this camera just died so Welcome to the life of vlogging behind me is the new Apple Store. Let's get it Exposed so, there it is. there's the Apple logo? Right there It's so quiet in here this reminds me a lot of the one in New York that they have with this huge screen This is awesome, and they have like a little needed Apple area you can sit right here and learn and hang out I want to see something on this screen Look at this. We're doing a live art with Simon. I've got Rowan a puzzle Stay have the apple cases opened up this like, I know, I cannot believe haven't get it these How do I buy them it's so crazy I could figure out how to get a case and only got a do you pull this open and there's right here It's like magic so the new Apple store is really really nice But I just got home and I texted Matt and Jenna I said hey you guys and play call of duty, and Matt says we should all have a LAN party And I got really excited I told everybody to come here my internet kind of sucks, but in fact on my xbox And I'm gonna go we're gonna have nice land part. It's gonna be great. It's the food one of the things That's a problem though is Matt Plays mostly on playstation because he's a pro player and most of the pros all play on playstation They used to play on xbox, but then now they're all on PlayStation which is unfortunate the past two years I switched back over to PlayStation to play call of duty And then I realized that I never actually ever play with a pro player, so it really doesn't matter so this year I'm playing Call Of Duty Back when Xbox like it doesn't even matter if I have a 4k Xbox or not because I play on really small monitors It's all about the refresh rate, baby. Let's go Yes, it does everything is just going swimmingly Do you see this this is my first smartphone I'm gonna do a video soon reacting to some of the things that I have on here I did plug it in and I was pretty shocked future video you might bring this one So this whole past week has basically been iPhone week, and I have non-stop and shooting and editing videos. It's pretty time-consuming so today I'm gonna treat myself. We're gonna be playing some games Call Of Duty. He came out a few days ago These are the best hard drives ever other the samsung solid-state drives. No, I'm pretty vapor flip my switch in here I might have to bring another bag One for Jenna, let's see maybe I'll bring one for Matt to Check out this sweet wine fridge look how much wine I have?

Hey guys. How's it going? It's Justine. And today we are doing a what's on my iPhone X video these videos are always so highly requested and so crazy because a lot of the times I start completely fresh when I get a new phone and the iPhone X is no exception I also started fresh from when I got the iPhone 8 And I thought for sure that I was gonna just port everything over to the new one and I decided no I'm gonna start fresh on my iPhone X Let's do this, and it usually takes me a good two weeks Which it's been a little bit over two weeks now that have had the iPhone X to really get back into the flow Figure out what apps I need and you definitely figure out very very quickly what apps you cannot live without when you don't have any Apps at all so starting on my first page these are Not quite in any particular order, like I used to have, let's see, I used to have this over here I like to have my maps I don't really use my phone that often, but I'll put that one back over there So things aren't exactly the way that I used to have them, but this is sort of my work in progress This is what I cannot live without basically. I should title it that. What apps can I not live without No clickbait? Hello only clickbait, if it's not true to starting off here from the top. I've got my calendar I've got my Apple maps and Google Maps, and I tend to only use Apple maps when I'm in the car And I have it connected to car play because it integrates very well with my car then if I'm wearing my watch it alerts me When I need to turn so a lot of times they'll opt to use that when I'm driving as opposed to Google Maps But I do feel like if I need to get somewhere and I want to make sure that there's a traffic Or this or that I do feel like Google is much more reliable still to this day But Apple Maps integrates with my car and my body so it's it's a tough choice anyway moving on o'clock We've got the phone. We've got the Notes app which I use a lot I use it for everything I use it for making lists things that I need to buy video ideas It's probably my number one most used app next to messages next is the App Store then Instagram Twitter snapchat HQ trivia if you guys haven't been playing HP trivia it is the most fun game I've been talking about a non-stop It's not sponsored. This is just honest-to-goodness excitement for a fun game basically twice a day there is live trivia you play you can win real money if you'd like and you have it already sign up using my Little code right there so that I can get some free lives. Yes. I need the lives then if you miss a question It's almost like you didn't actually miss it because they gave you a life, but you can only use one life per game Ah the struggle. I am so bad at trivia It's unbelievable next up we have Facebook and then Amazon and then Amazon Prime now Which allows you to get deliveries almost within an hour or two Apple TV remote YouTube and then YouTube studio Which is a studio app for creators? It basically lets you have more features You can edit thumbnails you can do stuff that creators need to to who there's more in-depth analytics you get the point settings Starbucks very important right next to post mates, and if I didn't have Cole's mates I probably would be very hungry all the time Or I would have to learn to cook and clearly we know how cooking goes for me and down the bottom I have kind of like my most used things which no matter what page. I'm on I like to have them easily accessible I've got my messages my email which clearly I need to check that Safari and my camera handle the next page. We have well. It says it's weather, but this is basically I need to change that Actually, let's change that too I'm gonna rename it to stuff This is basically all of the Apple stuff that I didn't really wanna necessarily, delete But I don't really ever look at weather news stocks reminders iTunes Store iBooks home health kits wallet photos FaceTime podcast compass find iPhone find friends tips a voice memo con I can probably delete the tips the files app keynote iMovie watch. Oh, there's a watch update I better get on that calculator pages music and TV No, I do use a lot of these apps, but a lot of times when I'm looking for something I just kind of swipe down and search for it so if I'm looking for pages I don't really want to have it on my home screen but I can find it easily by going into the folder or searching coinbase if you guys are a bit coin or aetherium or virtual currency who Purchasers owners, that's probably my favorite cube This looks like a very fun game, but it's more a game of life. It's a period tracker. Sorry guys Ladies you might want to check it out next we have Netflix their facebook Messenger I clearly don't really use that very often because I could messages uber venmo Sonos Dropbox the Apple Store Phillips hue which I love that's what I use to control my lights DJ I go for that's what I use to fly my drone the activity tracker for my Apple watch and my phone PayPal Spotify clips, I love the new clips act like you can push yourself and It's kind of struggling because it uses depth to sense to remove the background and since I'm pretty close to this wall actually it's doing Pretty good job. Let's see what else we've got metropolis. We've got this riverfront. This is my favorite It's the Millennium Falcon so you can like look around and see stuff. That's around you. Oh a mega destroyer What we look at this oh my god. What else is there? Ah? sketchbook 8-bit Teegarden these are really cool. New clips update is pretty great I just wished that they would make it so that you can film vertical instead of making everything square because that really messes up when I'm gonna save things to Instagram and like I can't put this in my story. It's a square. What are you thinking tumblr? Saucy if guys don't know. What saucy is you guys may not be old enough, but it is an alcohol delivery service, so yeah It's kind of like post mates, but for alcohol and last, but not least I have my games folder I haven't really downloaded many games with teaser basically my go choose I never made a video a long time ago making this cake from cookie Jam But I'm currently working on something else very fun also from that game, so spoiler alert Jedi challenges I did in a box scene with my friend Alex if you want to watch that video I'll put a link in the description and an annotation somewhere here. It's kind of like a really insane, AR game Where you can be a Jedi and you just use your phone you put it into the headset you have a lightsaber and man It's just the best next I have goat simulator, which I just started playing I kind of want to do some gameplay of it So I stopped playing so that I can sort of go through and you guys can see my actual genuine Excitement and surprise from playing it because I opened it up. I was like what is this? This is the best thing that I've ever seen in my entire life I also have best fiends and best fiends forever because obviously Another game that I'm obsessed with this is the destiny to companion app so if you guys play Destiny at all that's something that you can use to alert your clan that you're gonna be going and getting ready for the raid I still haven't raided yet I just really need to take like a week off from real life and just sit and play destiny Prestige and call of duty and finish Mario Odyssey. I think that'll probably be what I do during Thanksgiving and Christmas So maybe then I can catch up on games well. I guess that's it Let me know if you guys think that there's any other apps that I'm missing I did have a few AR apps there was it Was that Dragon app it's like this little dragon friend, but I didn't download it on my new phone yet There's a bunch of other AR apps that I do want to check out I know I keep talking about wanting to try AR a if you have any other recommendations Of ones that you guys like or some things that you've been playing that you think that I would also enjoy feel free to leave those in the comments below and let me know if there's any other apps that you think that I'm missing I Feel like there's so many apps that I can just get lost in the App Store Downloading and buying things so if you'd like to help guide my purchases or free games Let me know in the comments below and let me know what your favorite app is is there an app that is your favorite of? All time whether it's an iPhone or an Android feel like probably the camera and messages app if everything else went away I could survive with just those two things well.

hey guys how's it going today we are heading off to the desert for what I am calling a tech retreat and yes of course the dogs coming with us not calling this a tech retreat because I'm basically packing up all of my drones some of my cameras and we're going to the desert to update firmware I know it's completely absurd Jenna we're going for a day I've got five drones in this backpack smartphone two phones one of these phones has some beta software for something secret on it one day to knife I have a knife too oh yes that's one of my favorites actually I have mini knife just as all the other not and you coming - oh my gosh does he look handsome shaggy another wine yes should we bring a rider away I really have two White's left this one asabi unblocked yes please dad's driving it's thank you why are you this is dirty Wow Starbucks now has a blonde espresso roast which I am obsessed with of course I would say that I'm obsessed because that's what a basic girl does thanks for driving because I drove to Vegas for CES and that was a lot of driving not sure if I had had a good time hood they weren't here to witness what happened on the way home oh wow there's a setting in my car when you're doing cruise control it has Lane Assist it'll kind of basically drive for you not like the Tesla will but it will do like small turns and stuff like that but one of the things is it will detect if it thinks that you're falling asleep and I'm such a bad driver that I wasn't falling asleep but he thought that I was that would kept yelling at me blinking it says I have to take a break take a break four and a half hours of that let's start up the rx0 I talked about this thing so many times [Music] [Music] we've got about an hour left enough we have to be the bathroom really really really really bad because Jenna drank all that straight we've only been driving for about an hour and we've already made it to two stops at Starbucks we had to go to the bathroom help subsided get some pumpkin bread where's Jenna oh this is a problem she's not here look at us focus I found 10 focus incredible hey buck he just ran out the door like ran out I can open to get a shot and you even so fast we've got a nice little living room Jenna's room bathroom my room kitchen and a nice little fenced-in yard for Matty to play so I got some shampoo and conditioner on Amazon Prime I thought it was travel because it had these little pumps but those little pumps on top must have meant that it is basically an entire gallon 33.8 fluid ounces for two days breakfast is being made good morning from Joshua Tree we're making breakfast all of those plans that we had to fly drones and update drones basically you know this tech retreat has turned into a relaxing retreat and we're going to go hiking we're basically not gonna do any of the things that we plan on doing hey Siri play me some music let's kick things off with please don't go by Mike Posner [Music] [Music] okay two waters there are snacks got our camera I was excited because I was like we're gonna be a little nowhere there will be power lines right by the house so I can just go outside test her own there's a power line right over top of the house so I don't want to fly that close so really we're just gonna go on a hike and enjoy the rest of Joshua together that's the airflow okay Wow so while we're driving here we just saw on Twitter that I was nominated for a vlogger of the year which is so crazy because in this past year I actually stopped vlogging [Music] I have been vlogging for a very very long time and the past year I decided that I was gonna kind of stop blogging I cut back I still do vlogs I'm vlogging right now but for the most part I focused a lot more on tech a lot more cooking videos and then in between I would fill in with vlogging it's kind of ironic that I basically quit doing the thing that I was really known for and my channel became way more successful than it had in the previous years and now I'm nominated for a vlogging award I'll take it that's pretty awesome you guys want to vote I'll put a link in the description Rio's can check it out that's probably the last time that I'm gonna say to vote because I hate spamming you guys to vote for things so with that being said I'm probably not gonna win but look at me I'm vlogging [Music] I've only got point three to our journey to the 49 Oasis palms Jenna's doing the voiceover for planet Earth hit her up we haven't gone very far at all [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ah-hoo oh I got pinched by it something amazing

few videos about it already I did unboxing and a really cool demo of it I'll put a link in the description if you guys want to check those out so to get in the mood I'm gonna start off with a beautiful soundtrack by the one and only hey Siri play some DMX I can do lots of things try asking hey Siri spell the word entrepreneur hey Siri what does happenstance mean or hey Siri translate this is delicious into Chinese I will say about the whole pod that I absolutely love is it can hear you from pretty much anywhere that you are in the room even when you have the volume at max level anyway we're here to make a cake so just I got it I got to get the cakes I've already baked them the first thing that we need to do is we need to level off these cakes I'm thinking that I can probably get by using three of them hey Siri what do you think of me I really couldn't say okay alright better you don't Hey okay that's not level I'm not good at this we're getting down to the nitty-gritty who says that Scott of HQ cheerio that is so perfectly level I cannot get more level than this actually I probably could but it's good enough you go replying the first layer here so this is how we're gonna connect this all together well link it's like a little bit of glue [Music] play some party music this pitbull hey Siri who is this this is fireball featuring man I really wish I wasn't gonna get a copyright strike hey Siri stop playing I'm having a little bit of a problem because I'm afraid that this is gonna fall over cuz it definitely is starting to tilt so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna jam these knives into this and hopefully uh this will help stabilize it so no to anybody that's like wow I really want to take a big bite of this cake you should probably be very very careful hey Siri I think I think that you're my best friend sorry I don't understand understand dealer that's holding up nicely so we finished one container of icing already but anyone's like just saying what to do this weekend oh I just made a home pod cake hey Siri what do you think about being a home pod I think therefore I am but let's not put the cart before the horse we are gonna be covering this in fondant so this doesn't have to look perfect but I do want it to sort of be as smooth as possible cuz I am gonna be putting another layer on it after we take it out of the fridge this is gray fondant and I am beyond impressed at the incredible color match this almost looks exactly like it so now I gotta roll this thing out hey Siri play roll out Wow I'm extremely impressed with my fondant rolling skills this is probably the thinnest fondant that I've ever rolled I know guys get hikes so one of the key things that I'm trying to replicate on this home pod is it has this incredible mesh covering so how do i duplicate that here I got some of this burlap garland 20 feet 6 meters I don't know I was at the craft store I'm like Jenna we gotta find some burlap this is definitely not sanitary so if you think I'm gonna do a taste test after this I'm not okay so this smells very bad Oh Mike this is poison smell this you gotta smell it just do a quick smell whoa Wow death let's hope this works so we're lay this here and do a little roll [Music] we're gonna add a second layer of icing to this before we apply this fondant put this back in the fridge for a few more minutes and then we're gonna cross our fingers and hope that this all works out guys we're having some issues I put too much powdered sugar on here now and this is sticking to I've absolutely no idea if this is gonna work but we're gonna try it oh this fondant so thin I don't even know this is gonna work as long as one side is covered what we can fix this we can fix this it's fine everything's gonna be this is not anything that I had pictured at all this is absolutely disgusting I'm so upset if anyone says Justine you didn't try hard enough like I actually don't think that I could have tried harder do you think this is funny things right now now that it's already falling over so I need to prop this up a little more like jam this fondant so from this angle it Ullman looks acceptable and trim around this bottom a little more I can't believe how bad that looks behind like it looks so terrible I think I'm gonna need to have a professional make me a cake for my home pie party that I plan on having because this is not acceptable my friends what expect this from me but this is not the quality that I'm going for okay what size do we need the big one okay there we go oh look at that oh there's a hair on them oh that's disgusting so something that I want to do because this is very shiny I have this clear piping gel it looks like this it's gross just give it a nice Sheen it is almost identical so as you guys can see here this is my home pod cake and this is the home pod you can see some slight similarities as far as the color and that's about it hey Siri do you know who I just seen is Justine ezarik is an American YouTube personality host actress and model five million views across her YouTube channels since 2006 oh wow and Wikipedia would you like to hear more no but am I gonna approach a billion views soon cuz if that's the cake the answer to that oh haha I wasn't talking to you I was just talking yeah apparently I'm a host actress and a model so that's some new information thank you guys for watching if you want to watch my unboxing of the home pod or a demo of the home pod I've got those videos below in the description and I'm sorry my spirits have you went from here to here like I started from the top and now I'm at the bottom Drake needs to write a song about me place started from the bottom now I'm here that's it I'm done I'm defeated it was a nice attempt I'm so sad this looks so stupid [Music] you [Music] 
hey guys how's it going happy 2018 this is my first unboxing video of the year and I'm just gonna be completely honest with you it's not gonna be that exciting of an unboxing it's basically making a video about a single iPhone case not sponsored here's the case it says it's holographic but I tweeted it and everyone says that's not hollow that is just iridescent I don't know I mean what exactly is the difference between a holographic and iridescent because this is a fine line it is a very fine line to cross so far my favorite case is my iPhone 10 have been the basic Apple cases I love the silicon cases so much the two main colors that I've been a huge fan of is this oh my gosh what's it even call it it's like the pink sandstone or pink stone pink sand pink something something with sand it's something with pink also the silicon case in white I've also been a huge fan of tech 21 cases I did a bunch of videos with them earlier last year talking about how durable the cases are and I'm probably honestly gonna have to end up putting this back on because I have found myself dropping my iPhone a lot lately and I'm not sure why I like I will just be holding it and it basically jumps out of my hand I know a lot of people are concerned about the battery issues that the older iPhones have an Apple slowing down their phones what I'm concerned about is I think that the iPhone is now getting a mind of its own because I think that it has been leaping from my hands to its death on the ground and I have zero control over it maybe it's a me problem but I think that the iPhone 10 I think it has a mind of its own the next case that I've been using is this case right here it is sort of a love-hate relationship that I have with this one of you guys tweeted me this is such a scene if anyone can pull this off it's you and so I was like you're right to be honest with you I don't know if it was that wise of a choice it's a cool color but I feel like for every day it just did not really match my personality I know I'm so bright and sunny and cheery you think this would be a beautiful pick but no it's just okay so from there I switch back to this and then I was shopping tonight because I'm going just es tomorrow or today depending upon when you're watching this I am probably driving up as we speak as I speak as you watch I saw this case and I said oh this looks super basic I have to get it I also wanted to take the opportunity of course we're going to CES so why not open something so super technologically advanced like an iPhone case I mean make an entire video about an iPhone case what's worse they can be posted on YouTube I don't know posting a dead body follows it too soon maybe it is especially pieces to it do I have to use this I hope I pushed record it's been a while since I've filmed any videos because I had so many videos prep for the holidays it's a little uncomfortable just coming back to this desk in this office I pushed regard we are set and now there's a car backing up I've seen my videos in the middle of the night for a reason I'm getting used to making videos again okay obviously I clearly need to put this on so we're gonna put this on first this is not look protective at all so I have a really good feeling that my phone is probably going to shatter at CES so I'm going to bring my iPhone 8 as a backup because this does not feel protective at all I feel like if I drop this this case is gonna shatter it's just not a very high quality case but I'll tell you what it looks really good do we like this or is it so super basic and stupid that it's not a good look I'm confused now I'm having conflicting feelings I don't want to tell you guys to go out and buy this I also don't want to tell you to not buy which was this I'm a little indifferent to be honest with you he kind of looks cheap I was so excited about this case when I bought it maybe I'll return it I'm not sure Lucy what are we even saying it's almost like I forgot how to make youtube videos maybe I did anyway look I do funky what do we think I'll tell you one thing it's better than the yellow it's pretty flashy it feels heavy I think I might go back to my tech 21 case let me know what you guys think in the comments below and if I remember I will put a pull here do you like the psiphon case do you not like this iPhone case well it G I'm going to CES I skipped last year because I felt like I don't really know I don't remember what my reason was I know I definitely had one I tried to cut back on traveling since I got a dog which was about two and a half years ago at this point so I really now only travel if I actually have to or if it's a link super fun or if I can bring him along with me so I figured see yes this year I was definitely not gonna miss it so I look forward to meeting some of you guys if you're going to see us we'll let me know I will be a bunch of random places so I'll be tweeting out throughout the week where I'll be usually I don't prep the videos in advance so I usually don't ever have any videos to post but for the holidays it got really crazy all of a sudden I ended up shooting a movie which I don't think I told you guys about that'll be out I believe sometime this year at this point we filmed it in Pittsburgh and it was so much fun I had the best time especially because I was back in my hometown filming a movie and the movie is awesome it's soaked I can't wait to tell you guys more about that I had so many cooking videos that I posted for you guys because I had shot those in advanced editing at those so I can really focus on shooting the movie because doing things that are sort of outside of my comfort zone I don't want to have to worry about YouTube and YouTube is a huge stress for me because I do still edit all of my YouTube videos by myself which is so crazy I know everyone keeps telling me to get an editor I have had so many requests if people telling me just you know I can edit for you it is a very difficult thing to let go of for me it's very very difficult and I don't think that I would ever 100% let go of editing all of my videos I feel like these types of things where I'm sitting here talking to you where it's a more intimate conversation these things are always edit cooking videos I feel like who can let it go a little bit with those I think it's pretty straightforward I'm just I'm making something I'm usually screwing it up and then you have the end result so there's a clear formula for that but what I'm doing vlogs I don't feel like there's a formula I feel super attached to the content because it's something that I've shot and then I get to tell the story how I want to tell it it's crazy I don't know I'm not sure I've just been trying to figure out this whole YouTube space and what I want to do in 2018 I would love to hear from you guys what are your favorite type of videos that I make let me know in the comments what your favorite videos are if you want to tweet me what your favorite videos are as well feel free to do that because I'm pretty much always on Twitter non-stop at this point I'm just rambling because I'm excited to talk to you guys and I'm excited for this year and excited to make really fun things and I've got a bunch of fun projects coming out and I don't know I'm just excited I feel like this year started off a little bit rough patch here on YouTube and it really brought my youtube spirits very very low it took my motivation right out from under me it took my inspiration just I don't know I really just sat around for three days and watched arrow I don't even know if that was it good wise choice of my time but I'll tell you what this show is really good I finished flash over the holidays I have just been getting in all of the CW shows and also this is completely completely sidetracked because I've been watching so many superhero shows I've decided that I want to be a superhero I mean I've always wanted to be one but I feel like that's not realistic because there's not really actually superheroes in real life I mean maybe there are I don't know I've never met one that starts falling off god this shirt is great target going back to superheroes I don't read comics I've never really read comics that I love the Marvel Universe I love the movies I love the Netflix shows and now that I'm getting more into the DC shows like arrow and flash one of the things that I was most impressed about with guardians at the galaxy for example was to me I knew nothing about that franchise I knew nothing about those characters and not a lot of people did they basically took these unknown characters this unknown comic and brought it to life so what I am interested to see is what is the next thing that most of us normal people who don't read comics what's the next thing that we should be looking out for and is there a character that I could potentially play because that's what I'm hoping for I need an unknown random superhero character that is somewhere hidden under comics got to dust it off a little bit and be like Justine this is you this is you or do I just create my own that's interesting maybe I could just do that instead but what I love about an already-existing character is there's an entire universe already built and that universe could potentially tie into whether it's Marvel or DC it could already potentially be tied into their world I just wanna be a superhero is that too much to ask maybe it is too much to ask I'm not sure maybe had too much caffeine maybe it's time for me to end this video it's been a rough beginning of the year guys but we're back we're at CES now did anybody make it to the end of this video cuz I'm not even sure if I'm gonna be able to make it to the end of this editing it in my dog is sick Oh God he pooped on my couch like I'm disgusted I don't even want to show it to you oh I'm gonna go I'm gonna edit this love you guys I'll see you later did I even make a bit of sense in this video I don't think I did [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] 
got new toys oh man I'm so excited I almost dropped this camera we're gearing up for the holidays and we're doing some massive cooking videos because you know why not like Justine what's your channel about I don't know is it cooking I don't know is it tech probably is it vlogs I'm not sure you guys your guess is as good as mine but we've got so much stuff over here all prepped for cooking but something has finally arrived I've been waiting months for this this is a new light this is Nick hi hey oh gosh oh gosh oh boy this thing is so incredible yes I'm ready my godson that is an LED panel my Wow look at this it's beautiful it's actually beautiful look at that mounting plate built-in it's like a flat-screen TV whoa I know I'm good and surprisingly light too like if there's not much to it like it but it's not light no it's like oh oh gosh puns they're not really yeah for the view do you know how to set it up I'm I can figure it out but I look at inventory list and it also comes with peace even this light stand is awesome like this is so nice I'm excited kitchen game going strong so soon [Music] that's the coolest lightweight design I've ever seen a spider in the bag and I'm not a fan of bugs and you're really not a fan of spiders no not not a big spider guy yeah you definitely can this is a much more industrial light than I'm used to cuz where do you in this light is too good for me well if you need to use it at any point remember that this was just supposed to be like a super chill easy blog so you could dim it and it has tungsten and daylight's you can basically set it how bright you want it and what temperature you want oh look at that this is incredible hey let me just tell you what you don't need when you're first starting out making YouTube videos I mean this is honestly this is a dream come true not one this is down the rabbit hole Anton power batteries are those big batteries that you see at the end of like film cameras when you watch behind the scenes oh yeah it doesn't have one it's got two oh you can hook two batteries onto that and you'd probably never have to recharge them for the whole this is awesome three completely different types of diffe you and you can stack yeah I guess they will melt that and I'll work on this over here so the mounting is about to happen there we go so where do you think we'll need it we want to go up and point down to prove capper looks great velcro everywhere all right let's try this thing out let's plug it in I'm excited this is Wow shooting Christmas videos christmas came early for mommy this is the best unintentional unboxing video that i've ever done all right we're missing uh that's what we need okay videos are gonna look live okay plug this one in are you controlling from this one here's our controls blown off we've got power we've got power put it up to the max are you are you ready because I'm freaking a help you're like doc right on and back to the future is so bright oh wow this is nuts oh yeah we have to worry about that reflection off this stupid it up refrigerator I got you raise it up yeah me and look at this we can all watch stop it yes wait go back again oh this is I'm gonna need Sun Tan Lotion me too oh my gosh yeah we're definitely gonna need the diffusion like no I like it to be really bright I can't like it's hurting my eyes [Music] Wow wait [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

hey guys how's it going so I am off to San Francisco right now and this is mmm whoops my original flight was supposed to be at 10:30 and it is now 12:30 p.m. last night we were shooting so many cooking videos and I was so exhausted that I woke up this morning also there's no possible way that I can physically get up go to the airport and make this slight on time so thankfully Southwest is amazing not sponsored but you can just change your flight and they don't really give you a penalty so I changed my flight my back to bed for two hours and then clean my kitchen which surprisingly it cleaned up quite nicely you guys don't even know the mess like I'm just gonna just wow wait for Valentine's Day and st. Patrick's Day cooking videos and you'll see what has happened there's still some icing on the floor well I guess outside the airport now that it's time for my actual flight [Music] the airport and since I got a house like I need a coffee so bad as I waited forever because they just made a fresh pot of it and as I'm walking I spilled it all over myself [Music] [Applause] let's do a hotel room tour here's the shower it's like a nice little bathroom plenty of room oh here's my office it's a nice view of nothing oh look at that just making sure my outfit is on fleek [Music] what's gonna go down tonight will be over is sleeping quarters right so for some context is Who I am pretty shocked uh there's nothing wrong with this room it's clean it's nice but I think it got tricked because these are the photos that I saw online and this is this is reality expectation reality this is a very unique design but definitely not what I signed up for and not even that oh I left my camera in the uber obviously I'm vlogging on it right now so I got it back so thank you very very kind of a person for returning my camera to me because if you had it this blog wouldn't even be happening because it wouldn't have a camera and all the footage I shot this morning wouldn't even be ever seen by you guys go into the bathroom bringing a bowl my stuff here we are [Music] some of you guys might be new to my channel probably don't know that I made some of my first Apple store videos that I moved to California in a San Francisco Apple store and right in front of me is one of the brand new Apple stores here in SF and it is oh my goodness it's so beautiful it has an incredible open front design like the entire front of it is glass it's two stories this thing looks just oh my god guys I'm having a moment okay I'm gonna go in and I'm switch to vlogging on my phone so here goes [Music] surveys my emotions are running very high right now and people are watching me vlog obviously because you look silly vlogging no matter how many times how many years you've been doing it look at these upstairs this is incredible they have this whole open floor there are actual real trees here that people can sit and enjoy the outdoors but yet indoors I just want to sit I'm gonna say this is so cool okay let's go see on the other side the screen is massive this is something that I need in my house I basically just want to make this building my house like a nice little outdoor patio I can come out here and I can enjoy the outside but yet the outside is inside so it looks like you can enter this store from either the front or the back and the back is actually the second floor so right now we are up here all is a covering name oh my god it's so far this is probably one of my favorite Apple stores so that I've ever been into it's perfect let's see if I can find something to buy something that I do I definitely need is a new dongle because my sister broke mine she put it into her computer and then she dropped her computer and then it bent USB C port so I don't have an SD card reader right now so that's gonna prove to be a problem this isn't vlogging on my iPhone but I really need one cuz I can just drop everything go to my computer look at these these are very nice okay well they don't have any USBC card readers so yes I'm gonna leave now but I just wanted to show you guys the store because I've been wanting to visit it for a really really long time and I've been waiting very very patiently for it so here it is and it's it is stunning what else and we're going to be doing that you know 6:00 p.m. after you started really smart Oh No I'm so sad I walk all the way down here is so excited it's like Oh creepy the museum closes at 11:00 well guess what they're having a private event today so I can't go so now I guess we'll just find somewhere to eat dinner bleh my iPhone game [Music] this game that's called the last day on earth and I a hundred percent have to blame Nick because who's playing it all to see yes but they're playing a game Wow I'm eating dinner and this restaurant [Music] Valley long time yes I've had a meal that is missing particles one of things I love ostentatious Cove is incredibly this is so big I'm having an incredible meal is so addictive this is that it's strung it up a lot oh no I died I just looted my own body so this is desert these are like doughnut beignet with chocolate and caramel and then they give me ice cream and just an added bonus a lot of desert for just myself not even look at it like my stomach is so full an amazing dinner finish eating some dessert and then they brought me another tiny mini dessert this is overwhelming a mini dessert look at the little mini this is something that I should definitely try to make it a feature video it's mini macaroons this is you [Music] I'm back I'm out of breath because I was like you know what I just ate so many desserts and so much delicious food take the steps just Ain take the steps and Wow the steps I took now let it go up more steps to get ready to read the brush my teeth so this hotel is still so interesting to me I've never stayed in such a random hotel room like this it feels like it's pretty newly renovated because everything is clean and they feel like maybe they're missing a few things maybe I can help them out of there let's hide this that's will okay this is gonna change the whole feel of the room helping a chord management well have a bunch of meetings tomorrow and then I'm heading back to LA I'm hoping that depending upon where my flight is

Okay guys, how's it going? It's Justine and today We're gonna be talking about my top five favorite features in the new iPhone 10 
ㅜow, my first feature that is a favorite Obviously there's probably more than five But we're gonna just keep this to the top things that I'm super into.
No.1 the OLED screen and the first thing that kind Of took me by surprise is how small this phone is.
now the phone itself is small in comparison to any of the plus sized phones But the crazy part is is the actual screen itself is slightly larger than the screen on the plus phones
So for size reference, Here is the 8+ and here is the 10 so judging by just the body size You can tell that this one is much much smaller than the plus What is crazy to me though is this is the iPhone 8 These are almost the same exact size, but when you put the screen side-by-side That's where you can see the huge difference between the size of the screen and the eight screen.
Just take a look at that It really is all screen I'm so proud of myself because I haven't called it the 'X'
one single time since I started this video so Apple is calling this the Super Retina display.
one of the things that I think a lot of people were worried about is because there is this notch cut out That is going to take away from watching movies or watching content on your phone 
and to be honest with you, I really didn't even notice that it was there
you have two options You can either enlarge it to full screen So yes the notch will be cut out or you can squeeze it and shrink it down so that it only plays in this Little area, right here since I haven't had this very long I haven't really got to watch any long feature films or anything really that crazy because I basically just Got it, and I've been making videos non-stop. I'll be doing a full review once I've had this for at least a week so stay tuned for the week with iPhone 10 video Thank you, Mike you guys know I gotta do one number two is the front-facing portrait mode, and I absolutely love portrait mode on the iPhone I've been using it ever since it was first released into beta that I was pretty surprised How well this actually worked, but with the new front-facing features? It's able to sense depth and with that you're able to get some incredible portrait mode photos Here's the field that I took while we were outside and as you can see here This is with portrait mode on and this is with portrait mode off and also Just like the rear camera portrait mode You can also go through and use some of the portrait lighting, so let's take this photo for example This is a picture that my sister took so if we go into edit you'll see here You have all of the same features that you have From the back camera non portrait mode for trip mode you can switch to the natural light to the studio light Contour light and the stage lights which didn't work very well on this photo But I do have another one that it worked really well on and I was quite impressed look at that I mean that cut out almost absolutely perfect again The portrait mode is still in beta so you will sometimes get an imperfect photo And that doesn't just happen on the iPhone that happens on any of these phones that have these new portrait mode effects I'll be doing a full comparison video with the pixel to the no dates and the new iPhone 10 So we'll be able to get those shots and really see which one is the best and again the hard part with doing those types Of comparison photos some of the cameras perform better in various Lighting's so it's really hard to tell which is the best I still say That whatever camera you have with you that will always be the best one and cleeshay. I know but it's true number Three is wireless charging, and I know what all of you Android fan boys and girls are saying. We've had that forever. Yeah, okay I get it, but the pixel 2 - what happened there Where's your wireless charging at I was actually very surprised that they decided not to do that but anyway moving on the iPhone 10 and the iPhone 8 both have wireless charging so if you always already have a wireless charger as Long as it is Qi wireless enabled. You'll be able to charge your iPhone 10 or your iPhone 8 So if you see all of those little wireless charging stations around at the mall or coffee shops There's a really good chance that you will now be able to utilize that with your iPhone test There's two different chargers that Apple has out There's this Belkin one and there's this Mophie one the Falcon one is significantly lighter But the Mophie one is significantly smaller so really I think it's kind of just a preference on which one you think looks better I think that I prefer the Mophie one. I have one at my desk and I also have one in my bedroom Where's this one? I feel like matches this desk very nicely So I think it really just depends on what you're looking for I would suggest going the Apple Store and checking them out But I also think I probably would recommend the Mophie one so you just take my recommendation if you'd like you Number four is an emojis and this was a huge highlight at the Apple event when they first announced this I know it seems a little silly and it seems a little crazy But really this is just showing off the facial recognition technology that Apple has now in the iPhone 10 I mean it's kind of weird to just watch this group emoji mimic my facial expressions like I close my eyes I raise my eyebrows and it picks up all of that Wow Wow wait wow-whee So this type of detail that you're seeing now This is only a small taste of what will happen when Apple opens this up to other developers. What will they create? I'm not sure But I'm excited to find out I feel like there's so many different possibilities With a our kit and all of the really cool augmented reality apps haven't really messed around with that if you guys have any favorite Augmented reality apps that you guys are trying or checking out feel free to leave those in the comments below and I would love to check them out as well last but not least and it's a very very huge important part of IPhone 10 so technically I probably saved the best for last and that is face ID so setting up face ID is very very simple All you have to do is align your face after you click get started So it tells you exactly what you have to do position your face looks like I need to move the phone a little bit lower and now You just move your head like so and then you're gonna do it again Just like that And that's it your face scan is complete and one of the things that I was really shocked about is How fast this really is and it is super intuitive and it seems weird to sort of explain it to somebody? Especially if they've never used any type of facial recognition software I use it in my surface studio I've used it on my note 8. I've used it to my Samsung s8 even though I've used it so many times before in various different things it still was so exciting to be holding an iOS device and to just Unlock with my face and not only can you unlock your phone with your face? But you can pay with your face Basically any place that you would be using touch ID face ID has now replaced that you can use touch ID to buy things But now you can use your face to buy things I went to Whole Foods And I used it for the first time and it's really really exciting Definitely getting a pumpkin cheese this is a pumpkin cheese This is something that I've never seen before But today is the day. Is this something that you're into? Because I'm into it Are you still filming? Ok I just I just use Apple pay with my face for the phrase the first time I don't know why this is so exciting what it is so when you guys use this for the first time Just let me know what you think so those are my top 5 favorite things There's so many other things that I really love about this phone But I will save those for my full review video after I've actually got a chance to play with this I didn't even add that the camera is amazing that clearly should be in the top 5 feature Oh, there's just too many things, but so far I'm absolutely loving this phone And I look forward to making some more fun videos for you guys guys have any suggestions on anything else you would like to see Me test out with the new iPhone 10 leave those in the comments below And I will see you guys in my next video And if you're not already subscribed make sure you hit that subscribe button and that's it I'm gonna go edit now, so I'll see you later 
Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and today, we are back with another iPhone X video, I know what you're saying Justine it's been at least two or three days since you've last posted a video about your iPhone. We know we get it, you've got one, but guess what else I've got. Today, I've got some friends. We have got the Samsung Note 8 and the Google Pixel 2 and over here we've got the Sony rx100 mark 5. This is my absolute favorite vlogging camera so it's gonna be really fun to see how this kind of stands up to these guys and to the iPhone X. So let's go. Jenna just got the basketball court, we're going to take some pictures, we're gonna get some videos and we'll see what happens. The first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take some photos so Jenna, my lovely photo assistant here my lovely photo assistant, here I'm coming. Hello. I was playing basketball So I'm gonna have you take some photos on all of these and then the problem with what we're shooting right now is when I did the iPhone X camera test it was very overcast which actually was pretty great for shooting on this camera right here this big one Hello, hi Nick. Hi the first on the phone cameras that proves to be a little bit more difficult. Yeah, but watch this You think I could make it? No. No? No. You didn't even hit the backboard Take a normal picture and also take a portrait mode picture on all of them, yes. First up we have some photos from the iPhone X with the rear camera. This is the iPhone X rear portrait this is an example with the blur on, blur off and back with the blur on again and here you've got them all three side by side with a portrait the normal photo and blur on Moving on. Here we've got the Note 8 rear camera and then moving on to the Note 8 live focus Here, they are side by side with the normal and the live focus right next to each other. Instead of calling the portrait mode, Samsung is calling it the live focus. Here's those same shots using the Pixel 2 and here we have the Pixel 2 rear portrait as you can see, it did a really great job of blurring out the background. Side-by-side normal verse portraits and normal verse portrait yet again. Throwing in that Sony rx100 point-and-shoot here we have those two shots back to back. I can't. It's...It's all relative. Right now we're trying to do an action shot test and Jenna is trying to press the button on all of these cameras at the same time so we can get the same shot. It's not going so well but we're trying. Looking at this test after the facts You know I had really great intentions but I feel like it wasn't executed properly. All of these phones did a pretty great job at these action shots. I didn't really spot much motion blur but of course trying to get all of these shots to match up properly proved to be a little bit difficult. So right now we're gonna be testing out the front-facing camera I'm gonna be taking some shots, and I love the Pixel front facing portrait mode. It does a really great job. Now let me see the front facing on the iPhone X, Pixel 2, and the Note 8. Which ones do you guys think looks the best? I did leave out the rx100, but here it is I felt like the phones did such a really great job that it was kind of hard to throw in this point-and-shoot camera especially since I feel like the phones did a much better job than the Sony did but here it is for reference. Everything's reporting think I'm in frame on all of these. Let's just maybe move this this is I'm having fun I'm not sure We are now recording with all four cameras. The first one I have right here, this is the Sony rx100 This is the iPhone X. This here is the pixel 2 and over here, we've got the Note 8. So let's just walk around a little bit Spin. Hi Nick. Hi. Hello You're walking around you get some different perspectives here. See what these lens flares look like oh look at that. Can you? Can you not talk about Those flares JJ Abrams call me definitely. You're definitely gonna want to use these shots in your next film. So right now, we're testing out the slow-mo on all of the phones and the rx100 We've got them all at 120 frames a second, so we're gonna test out the slow mode and see what we got and I'm gonna take up the drone. Let's do it. She's taking it down This was such a fun test to do, and I honestly planned on posting this video, Wow like a few weeks ago But I ran into some problems getting the slow-mo footage off of the Note 8 and the Pixel 2 so here it is I hope that you guys enjoy it. I look forward to hearing your feedback on which camera you liked the best I'll put a poll up here at the top on YouTube and you guys can choose which one was your favourites. Did you like the Pixel 2, the iPhone X the rx100 or the Note 8? 
  I definitely posted a lot during launch week and a lot of you guys who have subscribed for vlogs or cooking videos More like, "What's happening!" but for most of you guys who know me, I'm sure you weren't surprised I plan on doing the week with iPhone But I felt like I had posted so many videos within a week that I thought maybe I would just wait and do it two Weeks with iPhone so here we are, it's been about two weeks since I got the iPhone X It really is A beautiful device so the first week that I had it was basically filming and shooting and editing videos about the phone So I didn't really feel like I got a chance to try it out and use it in sort of an everyday normal Setting like I normally would so don't trying our testing week We tried out a bunch of things. The first thing that we tried out that I didn't even share on my channel because my sister post of the video is we did an underwater test, "Would face ID work underwater?" And number two, "Would your phone actually work underwater?" And the answer is no. It doesn't. The screen doesn't work on water. Since this was our video She volunteered to use her phone to do this test. Currently her phone is still working perfectly fine. The iPhone X is rated to be able To withstand at least thirty minutes underwater, it's recommended that you don't go past 3.3 feet Which thankfully the pool that we were in was about 3 feet cuz my sister dropped her phone, and we both like It for him to be quite difficult to go underwater Try to keep your eyes open while swiping up and trying to see if the phone is actually Responding to your face in this test we did conclude that the phone does not work underwater You weren't able to swipe up it also didn't recognize her face We did have some difficulties with face ID trying to recognize each of us with sunglasses on in very bright conditions so the reason for this is because if it's super reflective the phone is unable to see your eyes in this bright light and if You have the attention awareness on, if it can't see your eyes It's not gonna unlock your phone. The way that you can get around This is turning off the attention to awareness so basically you won't have to look at your phone this does make face ID a little Bit less secure so that means if somebody comes up to you They can swipe up and unlock your phone with attention awareness on if somebody tried to do that to you You would have to be looking at it for it to unlock It has been a little bit frustrating when I'm outside walking my dog with my sunglasses on and it's super bright And I'm trying to use face ID and it's not unlocking him, and he's pulling me super hard going to the bathroom And then I'm trying to clean the bathroom up But I'm trying to use my phone and unlock it and it's not working. So normally effectively I'm going to be in a situation where I'm gonna have sunglasses on it's super bright I do turn off the attention awareness, but for the most part, I have been keeping it on because it is an extra layer of security. Other than that I've been pretty impressed with face ID I Know a lot of people have been saying with they're having problems some of my friends. They're saying it's not recognizing me It's taking too long Even at first my sister was having an issue where it was taking a while to recognize her And I think the reason for this is a lot of people when they first set up their phones It says hey its face ID times, set it up. and you're kind of in a hurry you want to set up your phone You're not really paying attention. You're just sort of moving your head around and I feel like that first set up It doesn't get a really good read on your face. So if you are having this problem I definitely recommend going back in Rescanning your face and seeing if that helps. Another thing that I tried was what if I looked like a zombie, what if my face was uncompletely recognizable? Well face ID recognized me. I decided to go all out I had this incredible special effects makeup artist Dan Gilbert come to my house make me look like a zombie and see, if we could fool, the face ID. Now one of the things that I read in the Comments is a lot of you guys are Suspect because you sent Justine during this whole process, you were unlocking your face from beginning to end, and the thing with face ID is It learns your face. So perhaps this entire time that I was getting my makeup done I was unlocking my phone Maybe the phone was learning my face throughout the whole process, which is of Very very very very a valid point and that I don't really know I don't know if that's the case. Now the reason that I decided to obscure most of the bottom of my face is because that Previous day that I'd met Dan we did something for another shoot where I was a zombie and I obscured most of my eyes and most of my forehead so I thought I've been unlocked with most of the top of my Face I'm scared It's gotta be something down here One of the things that I did notice is that when you turn off the attention awareness is it's not actively seeking for your eyes So it doesn't lock your phone a little bit faster, so again if you are having some issues with it unlocking slow or it's out recognizing your face try turning that off try rescanning and Let me know if that works for you. Going back to the sunglasses I tested out probably like 15 to 20 pairs of sunglasses to see if they would unlock But I was right here in a controlled environment where there's no sunlight, it's my studio light. So with that I'm not having a lot of reflection so all those sunglasses worked indoors But did they work outdoors and not so much I also heard that people were saying if they are able to unlock their phone using their reflection in the mirror Hmm, let's try it It unlocked Yes, it works! So it looks like face ID does work with a reflection of yourself in the mirror Interesting. But it doesn't work with a printed picture of yourself. One of the things that I was worried about with this phone is because It's so much smaller And I was so used to having the plus size phones that I wasn't going to like this as much as I do Surprisingly having a smaller phone is incredible I can fit it so much easier into my purses, into my pants pockets, into my yoga pants I've got like a little side pocket thing when I'm running or hiking or not really running Closely if just walking the dog around the block it's so great to not have such a Massive phone like I previously did. So the form factor of the X is comparable to an iPhone 8 or any of those phones that Are that size but the screen size is actually larger than the iPhone 8 plus. Which kind of puts this in the most perfect, Sweet spot for the size of a phone. I know what you're saying, "What about the notch?" "Do you love it?" "Do you hate it?" Honestly I am not really sure, I feel like I'm kind of 50/50 because there are some times where I'm like man Just don't trying to watch something and then as little notch is there and it's like why are you there just? For then other times it does fit pretty seamless with apps so I don't really notice it, but to say that I don't notice it all, I would completely be lying because It's there, like I don't know how you Can't see it like if you don't see this, then I don't know what you're looking at because it's there the knotch is there. But if they were to remove the knotch, I don't think I would be upset at all I think that I would be okay if it wasn't there I mean I see why they have to have the notch here because there's really nowhere else to put it if they didn't put the Notch there, then there would have to be some sort of a black bar up here Just to house everything that is inside of this notch, proximity sensor, it has the true depth camera, Speakers can't it's got so many things inside of that little notch today I mean I get it, but how are they gonna get rid of it for the next phone, or are they not? Or is this is this the new normal I? Thought that I would be taking a ton of front-facing portrait selfies, but to be honest I really haven't taken very many I guess in the past week I've just kind of been playing call of duty, so that's really not something that's very interesting to take pictures of. Especially a front-facing selfie My friend Joey said he's returning his iPhone X, No.1, because he wasn't a huge fan of the face ID and No.2, because The camera quality was too good And I a hundred percent get where he's coming from because when you take a front-facing picture now. I mean it sees everything It's like, "What?!" I've taken tons of photos of my dog I've taken what if I had been taking pictures of I don't even know honestly since I got through the iPhone released week I've basically been playing video games, and it's been great, so yeah, I'm looking through here I haven't really done a whole lot the past few days Here is a cute picture of My baby boy doggy and his friend Yossi. Fires picture my wine fridge while that's really exciting Oh, here's a picture of me and Alex Clark we did a fun video the whisper challenge video And we unboxed a very fun the Star Wars Jedi Challenge game What else are some wine, got a LAN party, more pictures the dog? Yeah, I basically have Done a lot. So other than taking pictures my dog. I've been very very impressed with the new snapchat filters now granted I don't really use Snapchat as much as I used to I feel like most of the time when I'm going to post something on snapchat I end up just posting it on my Instagram stories But I decided to hop into snapchat and test out to the face tracking features that they have now With some of their face filters, and they are very very accurate. I was very shocked. Hey guys. How's it going? I'm just shooting some videos here, but I was testing out a new snapchat He's tracking on the iPhone 10 So like it's very very and it's like here's another one with glasses on like look at this like I move it and it does I'm so impressed. I'm impressed. Oh yeah, this is This is great One thing that snapchat did right is get in early get the face tracking features and really implement that to the max on snapchat Let's see what else have I been doing I mean the phone is obviously so much faster than the 7 although I did kind of have that middle phone I had the iPhone eight between the X so having the jump from the 8th to the X Didn't really have an overall feeling of that much difference because both of those phones the insides are basically the same thing Also the camera quality on the 8 is almost identical to the 10 being able to have the slo-mo options to go up to 240 At 1080 is pretty great although I don't really use it that often But I have found that I've been vlogging a lot more on my iPhone because every time I go to vlog I either don't have my vlogging camera Or the battery is dead and a lot of you guys didn't really notice a difference when I went from this to the other one of course I can tell because I'm the one filming and editing and the front-facing camera on here is obviously not as good as the 4k SONY that I used to film with, but overall the audio on this thing is great the video quality looks amazing. The photos look Incredible almost too good and too realistic. The battery life, I haven't really noticed That it's been worse than the 8 or the 7 mostly because I'm always carrying around a movie, so I am unaware of battery life ever I don't know if it even gets close To being read I'm plugging this thing in I've also really loved having wireless charging pad one by my bed By my desk over there, and I even have this one over here, which has been my charger of choice the Mophie Wireless charger, so I use this one of my desk and this one I kind of just move around throughout the house wherever I happen to be and in my bedroom. I have the Belkin one I'm not really sure why I decided to do that I feel like I like the look of this one and it's a lot smaller than the Belkin I have some white lamps in my bedroom, so I felt like the white matched a little bit better But it really is nice. Just being able to roll over from my phone on the charger I don't have to worry if it's plugged in or if the dogs gonna jump down and knock a cord off the bed It's been pretty great so I know welcome Justine to wireless charging why did the pixel to? Decide not to do wireless charging. I'm so confused I feel like they rushed the pixel to out just to be like here's our phone here it is It's ready, but it wasn't it wasn't ready. I will say the front-facing pixel to portrait mode is really really good I did a couple tests of that and I'll be doing a future video here Hopefully very very soon of the note 8 the pixel 2 and the iPhone X doing a little photo comparison video comparison I know a bunch of people have already done it But I'm a little bit late either way even if I didn't do this video for you guys I would be doing this for myself anyway, so I just kind of want to test it out and see for myself what kind of results will I get? Stay tuned for that!! So I guess I should probably talk about some of the things that I Don't like about the new iPhone X, and there's not very many. I know what you're saying, "Justine! You buy this!" This is my video. I'm telling you the things that I like and I don't like. one of the things that I absolutely do not like it all and it's been driving me insane is closing apps. Now Apple says that you don't have to close apps because It doesn't really make a difference. It's not gonna kill your battery. It's not gonna do this It's not gonna do that well. I like to close them I like to be able to just go and swipe right down here at the bottom see the things that I have open not Everything that I've opened in the past two months. The problem now is to close apps you have to swipe up and you just hold and if there's a There's a delay now normally. You would be able to just swipe up from here to close, but now you have to hold in and then swipe up or Hit this little button right her. So, it definitely takes a few extra seconds Just to close some apps when before used to be super quick. Of course This is a software thing so that is a very very easy fix. Hopefully in a future update of iOS 11. Oh gosh, speaking of updates. Wow the biggest troll I feel like in internet history was the iOS Bug where it turned the letter I to like an A with a question mark or something there was a bunch of different things that were happening you would type a specific character whether it was an A or an I and Then you would hit Send and in that sending process between you typing it and actually hitting Send on Twitter or Instagram or wherever This would appear and most of the times when you were typing it you wouldn't actually see it until you hit Send Are you posted of whatever it was you're posting and this infected Everyone because it wasn't just an iPhone 10 thing it was an iOS update it took them probably like four days Maybe to fix it which I feel like is a pretty long time especially when the entire internet was just crumbling at our fingertips Most people on Android couldn't see the issues so a lot of them are very confused as to what we were all complaining about or What we were seeing the struggle was real Thankfully that update has been updated so if you guys haven't updated to the latest software update on your iphones, please Please too, It will save us all so much hassle. So I guess that's it I really don't have much more to say that I haven't already said or I Haven't already posted in a previous video if you guys want to watch all of those videos I'll put a link in the description where you can check out my iPhone X playlist there's tons of fun videos there if you haven't Seen them already, and if you have seen them.

Hey guys, how's it going? Today it is very cold in Los Angeles. Last week, it was I kid you not 113 degrees and when I was in Anaheim and this here is an iPhone 10 vlog Guys LA has seasons.

oh I didn't look at my view last night I thought there was gonna be like a big reveal to say guys I'm in Pittsburgh but it was just a building but that's where I am I'm in Pittsburgh I'm filming something really really fun so usually I don't actually get to spend much time in the city but today I've got a day off and I'm going to hang with my friend Dez who you may remember if you guys have been fans of my channel for a long time we used to make videos together back in the day when I lived here so I'm kind enough to meet her we're going to an afternoon showing of Star Wars which I'm so excited about because all of my friends have seen it without me I've been super busy these past few weeks so I had zero chance to see it but today I've got day off and I can't wait we're also gonna go to Target and probably go to Starbucks so come along for the ride where's the other shoe how am I gonna make a montage starting off my video with one shoe I look like a bee Suri [Music] back in Pittsburgh baby oh my god I love the city I love the people I love everything about it and I especially love it it's the holiday season because there's Christmas decorations up it's so festive it's so amazing I'm super excited I'm also going to see Star Wars I am like a child I am I am a child basically I think we're gonna go to Target first cuz I gotta get some items in place and turn left under William fireplace by GPS got through you lost we're on track I forgot to pack a bigger bag - the bag that I have is so tiny like it basically can only fit a mopey charger and my phone in it which that's not ideal so I need to get some jammies oh there's that's a dress that is not jammies just it's incredible so I think this is perfect unless I found a Star Wars backpack so far I haven't seen one yet does this here hi so I was like dad's I'm at Target I'm in a little boy section looking for some webpage she's like looking for little boys is like no shopping for myself I was looking for Star wear sweat pants and look at this they actually have girl star wars what pants those are so soft look at these ones I forgot to my pants I've been sleeping in the hotel with so cool okay that's one of the things in the list some brands having a Christmas party and she said that we could like better Christmas sweaters or onesies oh gosh there's a Chewbacca over here wowee I think I'm just gonna wear my r2d2 sweater why are they boys section let us let us ladies have have some fun - I mean I wasn't even like trying to go shopping I just wanted a few items it doesn't actually work that well that's a future video that Roe and I filmed but it's not out yet so stay tuned last thing on the list can I get a retail can I get a redo I'm putting the lotion and the best because of course I would get the popcorn with the porn bucket Belson has bb-8 on it too which is incredible so we just got out of Star Wars and it was so good but why not well that's crap because I thought it was absolutely fantastic I loved it now this is gonna be a good segue into a video that I filmed a little while ago but I never really had a good place or so really who Star Wars museum my friend owns a ton of digital stores are some that is never seen the light of day so let's cut to that but I went through weeks ago this is Craig hi Greg how are you can you explain to them where we are right now and what's going on because I feel like I did not do it justice weird Carter Sexy's which is one of the oldest art stores in LA coincidentally the art store that sold the guys at ILM the art supplies to design the original Star Wars and I tonight in doing a pop-up gallery of all the artwork I own from the original classic trilogy of Star Wars done by all these famous artists to celebrate the fact that I have a virtual museum that any of you guys can go and visit which is really cool I tried it out I was picking up all of your pieces and throwing which is something that you can do in virtual reality but not in real life but do you have a favorite piece here is one of your most coveted with other than this one that is you every weird painting of you know is not this was done by the legendary artist Drew Struzan who did posters for all the Star Wars movies he also did posters of The Goonies and back to the future which there's a movie poster you love drew I had done some sculptures for Lucasfilm that in collectible sculptures and I needed to do a Star Wars box and be awesome if Drew would do it and he did and he painted me as an x-wing pilot to go on the back of the box another fun fact which is completely unrelated to this I once got my arms ripped off in a video with Tommy Wiseau and the man that made those fake arms that's my claim to fame I rip your arms crazy and oh my gosh and the disaster on has just came out - which was an incredible view but that's a whole other story what other few do you think is your second base um can we go see the art that I own from Star Wars I'm calling this exhibit the lost art of Star Wars because when they were making the movie particularly the the first one in New Hope no one thought that it would even last two weeks in the theater so as all the artists were working their heart out doing all these drawings and designs if something I rejected it just got torn up or thrown away so this piece right here is from Empire Strikes Back and it is the trench on Hoth after the rebels were defeated but Boba Fett is in the trench I asked Joe Johnson why is bogus Boba Fett because he doesn't come into the story till later yeah and it turns out that designs for both offenses were actually for this super trooper went before Lucas even wrote the script he was like oh we got a design these like super storm trooper I mean this is like I'm a Star Wars fan but this is completely taking them all to an entirely new level like this isn't just absolutely incredible you guys see one more thing that's incredible paintings here and this collection drawings right here are the first-ever drawings done for Star Wars so if they kind of had lunch Lucas like oh here's my idea there's these good guys and bad guys and and Collin came up with these drawings and he said that the only thing he knew for sure he had to do was make the good guys in the bad guys identifiable to the audience Wow so these original paintings here before anything that was strong just something super simple you know just something I put together over lunch you know no big deal thank you so much for sharing with us now there's an entire VR experience do you guys can actually see I'll put a link in the description so if you guys have a chance that'll work it's called the sansar vehicle that we use and if you have a vibrant oculus it's it will see all this stuff really close you guys gotta check it out okay bye okay now we're back here hi des did you like it I can't believe I have a bucket what am I gonna do with this I got stuck under the chair and it's now I got bent on it so we are at furries holiday party and I've got this incredible r2d2 sweater on and Brian hey Brian let me see that sweater find your lack of cheer so what I'm gonna do is I got these little lights and I'm going to string them through my sweater so that it'll be like super festive I hope this works but I'm really not sure if it's gonna I'm ruining my sweater [Music] do the keys know you're driving why would I have the keys Wow Christmas that is all the time we're going Christmas shopping well basically only buying one thing we're getting a grandmother and new iPhone so I'm super excited about it but it's Christmas youth so what are we thinking camera is also gonna die so I'll probably be continuing this vlog on my iPhone like usual my camera has been dying so fast it's actually crazy there's got to be a new camera out soon cuz this one is seen better days I'm chilled to the core at least it's not snowing like in Chicago a lot of snow you can put our seated heated seats on our CDs Wow is it Chili's it's actually not that cold considering so Christmas Eve at the mall let's see what it's like everyone's probably not like yesterday true everyone's probably spending time with their family not come to the mall we also have to go to Whole Foods studies in your mom ah take this it's like an empty mall [Music] so I completely forgot the new South Hills Mall yeah has a new Apple store where is it I think it's the same place no they move I'm actually not sure wait do you go to build-a-bear because they have new Mario builder bears I love smile off the ball okay it's not here anymore now it's advertisements here it is look up look use your head turn it looks so good [Music] okay I'm walking it look at these doors they're amazing they all just swing out so this is like the new style of app stores that they have the first one that I saw like this was the one in New York that they have like the whole World Trade Center they have like huge screen over here -

Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and today, we are back with another iPhone X video, I know what you're saying Justine it's been at least two or three days since you've last posted a video about your iPhone. We know we get it, you've got one, but guess what else I've got. Today, I've got some friends. We have got the Samsung Note 8 and the Google Pixel 2 and over here we've got the Sony rx100 mark 5. This is my absolute favorite vlogging camera so it's gonna be really fun to see how this kind of stands up to these guys and to the iPhone X. So let's go. Jenna just got the basketball court, we're going to take some pictures, we're gonna get some videos and we'll see what happens. The first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take some photos so Jenna, my lovely photo assistant here my lovely photo assistant, here I'm coming. Hello. I was playing basketball So I'm gonna have you take some photos on all of these and then the problem with what we're shooting right now is when I did the iPhone X camera test it was very overcast which actually was pretty great for shooting on this camera right here this big one Hello, hi Nick. Hi the first on the phone cameras that proves to be a little bit more difficult. Yeah, but watch this You think I could make it? No. No? No. You didn't even hit the backboard Take a normal picture and also take a portrait mode picture on all of them, yes. First up we have some photos from the iPhone X with the rear camera. This is the iPhone X rear portrait this is an example with the blur on, blur off and back with the blur on again and here you've got them all three side by side with a portrait the normal photo and blur on Moving on. Here we've got the Note 8 rear camera and then moving on to the Note 8 live focus Here, they are side by side with the normal and the live focus right next to each other. Instead of calling the portrait mode, Samsung is calling it the live focus. Here's those same shots using the Pixel 2 and here we have the Pixel 2 rear portrait as you can see, it did a really great job of blurring out the background. Side-by-side normal verse portraits and normal verse portrait yet again. Throwing in that Sony rx100 point-and-shoot here we have those two shots back to back. I can't. It's...It's all relative. Right now we're trying to do an action shot test and Jenna is trying to press the button on all of these cameras at the same time so we can get the same shot. It's not going so well but we're trying. Looking at this test after the facts You know I had really great intentions but I feel like it wasn't executed properly. All of these phones did a pretty great job at these action shots. I didn't really spot much motion blur but of course trying to get all of these shots to match up properly proved to be a little bit difficult. So right now we're gonna be testing out the front-facing camera I'm gonna be taking some shots, and I love the Pixel front facing portrait mode. It does a really great job. Now let me see the front facing on the iPhone X, Pixel 2, and the Note 8. Which ones do you guys think looks the best? I did leave out the rx100, but here it is I felt like the phones did such a really great job that it was kind of hard to throw in this point-and-shoot camera especially since I feel like the phones did a much better job than the Sony did but here it is for reference. Everything's reporting think I'm in frame on all of these. Let's just maybe move this this is I'm having fun I'm not sure We are now recording with all four cameras. The first one I have right here, this is the Sony rx100 This is the iPhone X. This here is the pixel 2 and over here, we've got the Note 8. So let's just walk around a little bit Spin. Hi Nick. Hi. Hello You're walking around you get some different perspectives here. See what these lens flares look like oh look at that. Can you? Can you not talk about Those flares JJ Abrams call me definitely. You're definitely gonna want to use these shots in your next film. So right now, we're testing out the slow-mo on all of the phones and the rx100 We've got them all at 120 frames a second, so we're gonna test out the slow mode and see what we got and I'm gonna take up the drone. Let's do it. She's taking it down This was such a fun test to do, and I honestly planned on posting this video, Wow like a few weeks ago But I ran into some problems getting the slow-mo footage off of the Note 8 and the Pixel 2 so here it is I hope that you guys enjoy it. I look forward to hearing your feedback on which camera you liked the best I'll put a poll up here at the top on YouTube and you guys can choose which one was your favourites. Did you like the Pixel 2, the iPhone X the rx100 or the Note 8?

hey guys how's it going it's Justine and today we're gonna be unboxing the new GoPro Hero 6 now this just came out so I'm excited to take a look at it I've had so many GoPros I'm a huge GoPro fan one thing that I'm not a fan of by GoPro is the oh my god [Music] but let's not get into that we're here to talk about the euro-6 one of the biggest upgrade features that you can now do 240 frames a second in 1080p the 4k 60 and the 240 1080p is kind of interesting because now you can also do that on the new iPhone so I look forward to testing those out and seeing which one looks better it's waterproof up to 33 feet voice activated and it has the touch LCD on the back let's do this oh this is I don't even need my knife it's a nice little tap here just all ready for me to do this looks very very similar to the Hero 5 very similar I mean I'm pretty sure it's almost exactly the same [Music] one of the things that I was most upset about when I did my previous unboxing which I watched back because I was like what do I do last year when I had box this the first thing that I'll notice is my hair was much more blond my camera was tilted my lighting wasn't as good my biggest complaint though was that the new GoPro was USBC power oh come on now not mostly I was upset because all of the other things that I had with microUSB or of course lightning but now at this point it's only been a year and now I want everything to be USB c-e-o while the times change my friends so we've got a USBC cable we've got our two sticky mounts and our battery and our GoPro so here's all our stuff now they said no a huge GoPro fan what I love most about GoPro is its versatility you can take it anywhere you can throw it in your purse if it gets wet does it matter we're losing light you might be confused as to what's going on you might like just you know you're crazy and you're right I potentially could be but this is the GoPro Hero 5 and this is the hero 6 let's take a look at them side-by-side this is the 6 this is the 5 looking at them head-on they basically look exactly the same they did change a little icon here on the 6 it looks more like a power button as opposed to the little capture button that will allow you to like add moments let's set this up so we can hopefully get outside here very very quickly ok we're gonna charge it and do a setup at the same time here's our little welcome screen hello how are you got my GoPro all paired up to my phone which is great because you're able to control it through your phone you can adjust settings and it's much easier than using the interface on the GoPro my bad recently at 13% oh boy I guess let's take it outside and test it out real quick little test holding up both gopro side-by-side and comparing the quality of each one we're shooting 4k 30 frames a second and in wide view so these are basically side-by-side each should be fairly the same quality our GoPros are now filming each other I can't wait to take these out in some bright light I'm gonna do a full GoPro only vlog so ready see what that looks like to see is this something that you could just vlog with look at my setup back here stuff phone tripods battery shoes so we're currently here editing having a lovely time there's a problem because when you're shooting in the higher framerate and now encodes a different codec so it's now using HEV C which is great but I haven't upgraded my mac to high sierra yet just regular basic sierra does not support it so i'm not able to edit in final cut or even open any of the files so right now i'm having to convert it all hopefully the footage looks okay i don't know this isn't this was unexpected I didn't realize this is gonna happen 240 frames a second on the GoPro Slovo 240 frames a second on the iPhone [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] thank you guys so much for watching you hope you guys enjoyed this quick little unboxing tomorrow I plan on taking the GoPro Hero 6 out and I'm gonna do a little vlog test basically just gonna do an entire vlog all day on the hero 6 and see what it looks like I'll probably post that video in maybe a few days from now so stay tuned if you're not subscribed make sure you guys click the subscribe button and be sure to turn on alerts because I'm not really sure if subscriptions work the way that they're supposed to on YouTube but the

Cooking Channel who are you what is this place I wish I have an answer for you I would say that my channel is basically an extension of myself it is all of the things that I like and hopefully you can

Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine. And today we are doing an unboxing of the new Surface book 2 laptop. I know what you're saying, "Justine, aren't you the biggest Apple fan girl ever?" Yes, yes I am. But this laptop is incredible I absolutely love all of the service lines by Microsoft my main computer is my macbook with touch bar It's the USB-C version that came out last year and my second computer is actually a surface studio And I love this thing I love it so much. Most of my editing I do everything all on Final Cut, but I started using Premiere a little bit more and know will not be Replacing Final Cut. Don't worry. And those of you on the premiere Adobe side, I just can't. I just, I just can't, I'm not ready. Let's get into unboxing this what's new in the new surface book 2 is They do look pretty much exactly like the previous version of the surface book, but there are now two models This is the 15-inch model and there's also a 13-inch this Also has a USB C port which I'm extremely excited about because most of my hard drives that I use they're all USB C Thanks to the MacBook. This also has an SD card slot. I know what you're saying, "Wow!" It'll also work with a surface dial Which is I am a huge fan of it took a lot for this to fully integrate into other products But this does now work with premiere which is kind of exciting cause you can scrub through the timeline. A lot of people I know Edit with premiere and if they send me files I need to at least be able to know how to change things around if need be. Let's start the unboxing This is the 15 inch surface book it now comes in two different models There's the 15 inch and the 13 inch you can customize the smaller version with an i5 or an i7 and the 15 inch only comes with the i7 Processor. You can spec out the RAM up to 16 gigs you can also choose between various hard drives This is the one terabyte 16 gig model I wasn't even gonna do an unboxing this it was just gonna be a personal thing for me to open and look at and then I Really did want to share it with you guys because a lot of you guys Give me such a hard time for being such an apple fangirl and like yeah, I am a fangirl But guess what I have been so impressed with a lot of the things that Microsoft has been doing especially with the Surface line like This thing looks great, and it really does spec wise rival the Macbooks and also price wise Why is because these are priced a little bit higher than I feel like normal laptops are because not only as a laptop But it also can be a tablet you can detach the screen And they have said that the tablet mode you can use for five hours And with the screen attached in laptop mode you can run up to I quote 17 hours But I'm pretty sure if I was editing videos or doing normal things that I would be doing on this laptop It's not gonna last for 17 hours, but it's got some beefy beefy batteries in it One of the things that is a little bit different in this model from the previous version They made this hinge a little bit more sturdy so that it will be able to support the larger screen So this is where you would be charging your laptop They also added a new USBC port which I'm extremely excited about this could be used for data transfer and also Charging and on the other side we have a SD card slot and two USB ports This rain is huge definitely has some weight to it. It's probably heavier than my MacBook Pro. I would say if I had to guess Let's turn it on while I turn that on let's see what else we've gotten here Documentation, no thank you wow this is very heavy this has got to be our charging Brick in here this thing is very heavy its massive This has a very very strong smell Okay, it's just a moment. Yes. I'd like English please. Thank you. Hi. I'm Cortana hi there. I'm Cortana. No I'm Cortana Are you Cortana. Sign in here, but touch a Wi-Fi there, and we'll have your PC ready for all you plan to do Oh girl. Yeah. I'm a grown-up If you need an assistive screen reader Stop. ...press the windows Shhh. control and enter keys at the same time to enable narrator How do I Shh. Okay enough intro. Let's dig in. Well, what are you doing now? Surface dial I thought this was a little sticky tab. I didn't think that it popped the whole back of it all. Please holds. I thought that peeled this little sticky back off. Let us know if this computer is owned by your work or scroll. Me. It's yours. It's mine. Follow these instructions, and I'll meet you back here once it does. Yes Thank you. Use Windows hello to unlock your PC. Quick as a wink with just your face No wink required. Want to set that up now? Sure. Hold still for a second. Okay We need to learn to recognize you. Learn me. Cortana is super pleasant. Few more things polished up for you and Windows will be all yours. Looking forward to helping out! Me, too. Let's set this up. So this is a little sticky tab that you pull off Just like that and that's what I thought I was pulling off earlier So right here is the little eject button when you press this it prepares your device before Come here. Wow, tablet mode. This is really it's actually quite light. Do you want to switch a tablet mode? Yes, and to attach it back on. We just do that same action Voila do you want to exit tablet mode? Yes, obviously switching to tablet mode will save your battery when you're using it in tablet mode But I feel like I like having it. Ask me because maybe I'm not ready Making sure. It's me does have the facial recognition which is kind of great I use that pretty often on my surface studio Which I talked about very very often especially with the new implementation of face ID on the new iPhone I will say one of the things that I'm pretty excited about is the SD card slot I know as crazy and simple as it is I'm excited about it because I go to a lot of shoots And I shoot a lot of video and a lot of times I like bringing the least amount of things as possible so before I'd have to rig my macbook separate hard drives dongles SD Cards all of these things that try to make that work, so now I can just bring this in a hard drive And I'm good to go I also don't like bringing my main computer that I do all of my work on my editing and everything because I have so much Information on that that I'm always so afraid that I'm gonna leave it somewhere It's gonna get stolen now that I'm slowly learning Premiere - I'll still be able to do a little bit of editing on the go With this but man, I really love Final Cut okay? I love it so much at this point it would take me so much time to relearn everything and to be as fast as I am and final cut and I was so slow and Premier that that time wasted is very very valuable especially when it comes to editing and posting videos for you guys to another stylist Does not come with a pen so I need my stylus separate. I guess so All right Hello, hello, mr.. Frizzell is pretty awesome. We just can attach that like south there it is Am I'm doing all of the work that I did You can choose between several different things especially in this app there aren't as many options But depending upon which app you have open this dialog to various things so here we go we can zoom zoom zoom zoom Can adjust the volume As you can see right there All the little dial this thing's pretty awesome Let me know if you guys would like me to make a follow-up video Maybe like a day in the life with the surface book I don't know. I've never really done one of those before but I thought maybe it could be really fun Maybe to see how I would use this over my Mac and what I do with my Mac Maybe just a day in the life of my gadgets what I don't know. I'm not sure well See you guys in my next video Thank you so much for watching leave me some comments below and let me know if there's anything else you would like to see me Make in the future, and that's it. I'm gonna go editing now, so I'll see you later. Bye! 
Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine back with another unboxing and today This is something that I'm really excited about I have had my eye on this for quite a while and finally I was like okay. I'm buying it I need this in my life mostly because the cameras that I use are Sony other than the rx100 which has a flip up screen These have a flip up but like not flip to the side This is my higher-end vlogging camera, and then the a7s2 which I'm using right here They all have these screens that do not flip out those one of the things that I absolutely loved about Canon don't love just being Able to flip that screen to the side really quickly see everything that I need to see if for whatever reason Sony Is just so opposed to that so hopefully in the next line of cameras that they come out with they will take us vloggers into Consideration my friend Nick has been shooting a bunch of my cooking videos for me recently he also shot a lot of the iPhone 10 cinematic shots that you guys probably saw in all of my iPhone 10 videos so with that he was using the Panasonic gh5 And this camera has two SD card and you can record for just however long you want to unlike the Sony's which end up Overheating if you have them on longer than an hour, and they start recording your shooting in 4k after about thirty minutes I do feel like there's a lot of things that Sony needs to address But with all that being said I am by far the biggest fan of Sony ever which is why I'm unboxing this today Which I haven't even told you what I'm unboxing. This is that you focus Sony bundle This is by small HD so what this is is a 5-inch small HD screen It's a touchscreen and this is the focus bundle so it comes with this arm right here So you could attach to the screen you could attach a mic it also comes with a battery Charger looks like a micro HD camera. I guess. I'll just find out why don't I just open it and stop talking? I've been waiting so long I was like do I buy this do I not buy this I don't really need Need it because matt has one so I've been borrowing his smaller one, but then he needed it back so I said okay I guess this is my time It looks so good, holy moly God why is this smell this smells like the lawn and garden center of Walmart? So this does a micro-hdmi in which is fine? I just hope that it comes with one of those cables because I don't have one. Oh it comes with a little glass face Oh, this is good because I'd like to protect my screen because I do not trust myself. Okay, nothing else in there What have we got in here, ooh All of our accessories okay, so it looks like it does come with an HDMI cable which is very great news Oh Wow so I'm assuming that I can still use some of the other batteries that I use I have so many extra Canon batteries So I usually do use those on the back of this but this thing is as heavy as my camera and it also stinks with this battery I Have use this camera here is our HDMI cables looks like it comes with a regular one a micro in a minute. So this looks like it has a HDMI adapter here's the issue the Microphone that I use is a hot shoe mic so if I use this I'm now gonna have to use a different microphone And it's not really that big of a deal because it gives us all these little extras So I'm able to easily mount a microphone over here if I would like to there's a little Hole that you have to match up to on the side of this into here So it'll go a little bit tighter got myself a another Microphone here, so this can just go right here on the side It gives you some extra little adapters, so you can just attach these to the side if you'd like You guys are getting the first view I don't even know what it looks like but wow this looks So silly oh, it's so crazy that it's a touchscreen Yeah, guys. This is the future right here so the tripod that I usually use I am a vlogger now Bring that battery it is so insane like I can't believe it This will be so great when I travel because I don't like to bring a huge crazy setup like I have right here But this will all kind of condensed down very easily to be able to pack it I did order this monitor through bnh, which I absolutely love not sponsored. I bought this just a full disclosure I guess whatever deal B&amp;H was running it gave you a small HD case with it, too So I have like this nice little Pelican case for it. This is so heavy Well what am I doing, but while this screen looks so good? I've got to get that cover on there before this thing gets destroyed So I've definitely gonna mess around with this because I feel like this isn't the ideal setup I don't like where this microphone placement is there's got to be something else that I can do and maybe if I can even get Like a smaller microphone. I could get something hmm. Well. Thank you guys for watching I hope that you enjoyed this random unboxing of my small HD screen This is the small HD focus again if you guys are interested I'll put a link in the description Leave me some comments below and let me know if you guys think this is realistic because it's not realistic am I crazy It doesn't really even matter so you know if you would carry this around in public I'm not even sure if I can bring myself to do that, but we'll see I'll see you guys in my next video 
hi it's Justine this is ro hello yesterday when we were filming I started with the video office like hey guys it's ro we were having so much fun and in her defense she had had a lot of sugar we tasted a whole bunch of candies so great we were on a sugar high and it was a little later we were like getting really silly we were but today we're gonna do something very simple I thought it would be really fun to do a Q&amp;A because people are always asking us questions in the comments how did you meet what's your favorite color I feel like is always a very common question today I asked you guys on Twitter to ask us some questions and guess what I've got question questions the first one I thought was very appropriate so we did do a Q&amp;A before on Rennicks channel which was very fun that wasn't real life so I may have answered a few of these but you guys might not have seen it so just in case this question is how did you guys meet how did we meet hmm well it's kind of a long story so I loved her content and when I started my channel you have been doing YouTube for awhile and she had a big fancy channel and I was just starting and I was too nervous to ask her to come bake with me I made a cake that I thought you would think was cool and it was the best ever it was a Call of Duty cake cuz I know that she loved to play that game tweeted it and I like tagged her in the tweet I was like you might think this cake was cool or something and I did and I wish that I would have filled my reaction because I was freaking out I was like sending it to my sister I wasn't ever really like oh my gosh don't go this amazing cake like this is so cool and this was way before I ever even tried to bake anything I'm so happy you liked it every that was like our first interaction was on Twitter you didn't even slide into the DMS I didn't then I was still too nervous I was really shy because I didn't know really anyone in YouTube community I think I knew maybe two people and we ended up meeting in person and like a YouTube thing and at the YouTube space I don't remember what it was it was one casual space is it a panel I don't know but I remember I got your number and yeah I will have you and is Roseanna nerdy nummies so that's how we met yeah and then I just blew her up all the time as soon as we exchanged info I was like we're friends now oh we are and here we are yeah and I'm sending you like funny pictures and gifs and mm-hm I even met anybody not on the internet in a really long time like in real life first I have to be honest my whole world isn't how YouTube like all my friends are youtubers and we need to get out more whoa expand our whoa I don't know I know a few musician really but they also are on YouTube well if they got a VEVO channel does that count a grey zone yes well we'll discuss okay next question Oh what do you consider touring together I would more than consider I would say yes they do bring Maddie because he's a DJ what do we do I don't know we need to have a show or something we can't just just get on a bus um well okay so my dog is DJ one sec we've got one thing okay I can cookie to any she could she perform maybe she'd dance she's real cute she is super cute talents it's okay we can work on it we can work on it she can be the tour manager she can sit okay we'll have to figure two in our show would be which this could actually lead into a second question that I saw what does it what was it any hidden talents well I just told you mine that's juggling and it's not really that hidden because I do it all the time you like it but I didn't know you can juggle until we were hanging out this is kind of a hidden talent I can bark like a dog you ah oh my gosh it's weird let me hear it do you want to it's okay it might be loud hello to myself editing okay okay I have to see it up cuz I gotta really just like get in there okay okay okay your hidden talent is you can bark like a dog yes you can also juggle but people know that yeah let's hear this tour is gonna be incredible yeah sound effects and everything we got it do you think cookies gonna freak out maybe so cookies asleep right here next to me she may wake up okay she would cookie hi honey are you scared he's very concerned this is a true Italian because she thinks she thinks it's real it's okay good evening sir nobody I'm fine err okay what did I say I don't even know what I said oh my gosh oh my oh my honey she's very concerned just stating everything's okay let me yeah we have to we have to console her oh my it's not real what did I say just something that you real to you like a good Jessie thank you coz she thought it was real totally fooled my hidden talent would be well I like to say you know people know that I think I did it I did one song but it was like an acoustic pop song where it's but what they listened opera wait what but I haven't made a video of it yet but I'm classically trained and I sing opera I I can hit really high notes really that vibrato and that legato but wait I didn't help this yeah yeah I'm serious do you want to give us like a little a little something oh my god I believe more tea but okay look it up I do it have o mio babbino Caro what does that mean oh it's like Oh dad it's it's oh interesting well it's Italian ah Greta and the girl wants to marry someone and she's trying to convince her dad that you know she what I did marry Laurie was going somewhere else it was the way she's gonna marry okay no no it's there [Music] there is another [Applause] I'm gonna a copyright strike list you shot [Music] at this table even though you were friends with an opera singer did you at least samples you having a flip [Music] I am in shock right now okay well I guess on tour I'm just gonna be getting UT do you think the kids would enjoy an opera like number that's the thing is that operas just not as popular as pop music so maybe if we made it like Oh pop opera you know when you mix anything with pop it really works like it could be rock pop it could be good yeah like a medium opera like Maddie to be up there like doing a little DJ scaling I've always wanted to sing the song from Fifth Element I don't know what that one is they have an opera singer and Fifth Element and I don't even know if some of the octaves are possible because I don't she's an alien hmm you know yeah we're not in the same vocal range it's like a human bull but it's just like maybe you can just like you know lip-sync that's totally fine we're okay with that are at our show like this is not like I had no idea like what I love that we're learning stuff about each other this is insane what's your favorite color combo color combo what do they mean by that ya know would be you know like a beige color or like a green and like an olive I mean I would say my favorite color combo I've matched I love white and black but those aren't colors per se I've had a pic of color I would say like pink and black well like for decor I'm really liking white grey and blush like rose gold for like home decor but in general I'm really festive and I love the holidays Halloween is one of my favorite holidays so a black and orange combo for Valentine or red and green for Christmas yeah yeah I think those are good but I hope we answered your question yeah so Alexis you never read ones names like this Alex Alex if you're asking if we have any advice on parent slash dog hood I'm assuming you mean dog parents yeah because we're dog mom yes we are we've got a little Maddy little cookie I'd say the biggest thing is Wow I mean definitely giving them attention but I think the hardest part is a lot of people will get dogs as rescue dogs which you should always rescue do not shop always adopt is sometimes when you get a dog later in life you're gonna have to break a lot of the habits that they already have but training from a very young age is so so important I'm saying that all dogs have different personalities but there are different breeds do you have different general temperament for sure I mean you know like even like poodles like my dog like it'll be John like they're all very similar mm-hmm cookie is a French Bulldog and they have a reputation for being very stubborn and that is very true so I heard when we were training her had to train very young and mean to be very consistent and it took almost a full year to potty train her to go outside but now she will never go in the house I know I mean I travel a lot so like Maddy has been traveling since he was like eight weeks old he's been so pleased a great travel he's a pretty great traveler but he also doesn't like children very much like these small little kids and babies so it's hard because it's one of those things that it's hard to break because I don't want to like be like hey can I borrow your child to see what my dog will do so it's sometimes a hard thing to break but man it's the best thing yeah I like being a dog me to Lourdes is nice to be patient in consistency they love having a routine yeah which Maddy does not have a routine he's at my house he's at my sister's house he's with like strangers all the time now here did he's here yes with cookie they love to play together now off to show you guys his DJ skills cuz they're pretty impressive if you haven't item Yuja never put animals on the table you know I do even an exception that they were to I had done the pug sit on the table because I was scared he would jump out of the chair what's up come here come here DJ see you man guns DJ come on you got this buddy good boy good times DJ here you go good boy okay come on Mattie sounds DJ come on let's go you've got this time to DJ good boy yes come on let's go wait don't want them to marry can you go another really good piece of advice is to get a dog when you're ready for one like I wanted a dog for so many years yeah I wanted to wait until I really had the time to take care of one exactly and give the dog the best life and I mean I thought that I was ready but then a lot of things popped up he was sick for almost an entire years my pretty much for entire year stop traveling I had to cancel a lot of jobs because I was like this is a responsibility that I took on so now I have to take care of himself it was worth it though whatever is that worth it so worth it life with the dog is amazing it really a cookie makes me laugh every day let's see what else we've got we've got Wolf Blitzer who is asking what is something you guys want to make together the most on nerdy nummies maybe something Super Mario Odyssey themed super mario de si is such a fun game like I'm such a huge fan of Mario and you love Mario and you love talking about this so much yesterday yeah just talking about this yesterday I was staying up until like 3 or 4 a.m. which for me is very late like I don't stay up late I go to bed at 9 o'clock but I just couldn't put the game down you were telling me that I know I'll be really fun that's a good idea yours may be like the Mario yeah maybe we should make them Mario hacked what about so classic the Bowser and Mario my wedding cake Oh cupcakes to go around it oh my gosh that would be so cute the wedding cake is pretty cool too oh it's so great no spoilers no spoilers I'm really excited now I feel like I've drink ten cups of tea mom I need a sip look at you look at the size of this coffee it's tea it please oh yeah see I could if I could I was drinking tea I drink this much coffee I would flip the table let's see what else we've got oh here you want here asking who was better at Mario Kart just need well I mean I don't know yeah that's down we might have to play one day so we're playing Mario Kart at your house cuz that was like with a group of people one it's kind of unfair yeah cos you know I was so mmm I'm real mediocre I don't come in last place but definitely not first that's basically like my life motto like I don't want to be the worst and I'm totally fine not being the best just like okay it's like it'll be here at Mario Kart you know I like you something goes low because then I can achieve that but you're really good at Mario Kart I'm not bad you don't want to brag because that's not her style she doesn't like to brag but she's really good at Mario can't beat Matt though which makes me very upset she's insanely competitive when he goes to that game so this one Oh save the best for last rikiei wants to know what would your ideal first date need and what do you look for in a potential boyfriend okay jobs if you tell me oh your dream first date be I am NOT gonna lie like I love a good dinner and I love a good wine good food I'm also fine doing absolutely nothing because I mean I feel like as I've gotten older I just like to sit I don't know I mean like dinner some wine you know dinner wine ah a chilly evening very chill so you could get to know each other or even if it's like you're unsure like you can just go for coffee that's always a good one you can like feel it out you're like Melissa something I don't want to get well yeah and it says first date trade deal first ah so what coffee date might be really good because it's casual just in the waters casual not a lot of pressure definitely not inviting a first date to my house so that's off the table so that okay yeah and then a dinner I feel like might be too long and then the wine may be too formal first date coffee coffee date that sounds good or a dog park date they have a dog so body a good because that can be shorter if is hell working out yeah you could get coffee and then go to a dog park that's good and then you can see if they like your dog and if your dog likes them even Maddie's dogs yeah yeah instincts that we don't even know about I feel like sometimes they pick up them on stuff that we don't know that's true i 100% agree and if you don't like dogs like it's clearly not gonna work out would you have an ideal first date ideal first date would probably be something like we're talking about I really don't like to be swept off my feet like a row man someone who comes badly who's super suave was like roses and just over the top usually makes me very weary like people are like fast talkers or like sweet talkers to charming I usually go whoa you're a really really suave and then red flags go off in my head like true and then you can do some googling and then you can research them and then you can get a background check and then you go search all of their Facebook and then you can see if there's a police record and you got to really do the guac before you have the first date so you basically have to have an internet first date first to do the research to be jel something like yeah I would like a coffee date well thank you guys so much for watching make sure you go check out Roe's channel and be sure to subscribe we've done so many fun videos together so many lately so just love it do a quick search and you'll find something that hopefully you will enjoy that's it we'll see you guys later bye [Music] 
Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and guess who it is? It's me! It's Ro! I've missed you so much! I know Justine's been gone in Hawaii, and I missed her terribly I almost flew in for a day But I remembered I had made promises an engagement so it would have been a lot of fun one night. That's insane I would have flown to Hawaii, but like I miss you And then flow now and I was like if I can't it's been one day yeah, that's not worth it But we will go again. Yeah, but what I have brought for you today Is something super exciting. You guys know that we absolutely love Starbucks, and coffee and everything that is in that World of Starbucks. Love. What did you bring me? Zombie Frappuccinos. Now these have been through Los Angeles traffic so they may not be at the caliber Oh, okay, when I first got them oh, oh, the home has gone down a little bit little whipped cream has deflated a little bit But I'm seeing a light purple this this is so cool oh wow it held up Pretty well Looks like when I picked it up, so that's a good thing this cooler is great I miss you terribly, but you just brought me the new new this is supposed to look like brains Like zombie brains. Yeah, do you think so well it's green like you know the cartoon zombies And then we've got a little bit of like dark red coming down So it's kind of like bloody and then I wonder if this was more foamy because it did come from traffic so did definitely Deflate a little bit like a No did you try the  cotton candy frappicciono  I did try the cotton candy Frappuccino And I tried the unicorn Frappuccino, but I was a little bit late. It was the unicorn one Yes, it tasted really sour yeah, it tasted like a sour mango I wasn't the biggest fan of that But I think this is gonna be a little bit better house bunch of people I saw cuz I was reading reviews cuz this is Green, we won't know what the flavor was But they said it should have been like a matcha tea or something like that makes sense a green tea a matcha But it's not it's not Miss the mark green apple. Yeah, I think it is actually a mint, and no we're not meant do you say caramel or caramel? It's supposed to be caramel, but I say caramel okay. Me too. Well. I'm gonna get rid of this cooler, okay You can get it on Amazon. I got it for a great deal. There you go Thank you how to open your straws like I do this its because I used to waitress so we used to break Just just the tip like this, and then you would remove the bottom and just put the top in So that you know people could remove it themselves that's a good idea Please see soup really like a hip hop and see if this looks like a nurse. You're really dig in and just whoa Just start carrying. Oh Chuck. Oh, is it a red velvet. I don't know Oh, is it an apple on the bottom red velvet on the top. What are you is it freezing whipped cream? Purple No taste like anything the color makes me think it should taste like berries Yeah, that's like blackberry raspberries, but I'm not mad, and I'm just you know disappointed What do any other thing that my mom was Adin? What do we do next not mad just? Don't know what to do because right when the unicorn Frappuccino came out I felt like I was the last person to try it yeah, but now I feel like I'm trying this right away Okay, let's just try it right It's really sweet oh This is so weird it's like I think I definitely taste the chocolate the aftertaste I was gonna say is cocoa I'm tasting an aftertaste of cocoa it's like green apple hits me, and I could be totally wrong It's like a sweet sweet something we need a sweet Apple, and then the aftertaste is cocoa super sweet apple and chocolate apples Apple Crunch, there's no crunch there should be Y does not even Apple at all Maybe it's pear and I can't tell oh oh that tastes like Apple mm OH maybe caramel apple with a little bit of chocolate yeah, that sounds good that sounds delicious That's what it is my vote is a caramel apple with a little bit of chocolate aftertaste YUM like whatever This is how to taste the barrier maybe that's just I'm getting confused by the Apple the color is tripping me out because your color this looks like it should be a Blackberry hmm hmm You haven't give my drink Cola, so I'm gonna get a tummy ache Oh, but I think it might be worth it is there anything hidden in here hmm Look at me. Let me feel around Okay, I definitely finger know there's jumps in there Yeah, I probably Like body parts, maybe like a problem bleeding. I'm so cool. I'd be really creepy Wow Really creep people out put an eyeball in there Happy Halloween I've got me what I really really freak people out I just protein probably I feel like that's a delicacy somewhere, so I would say like on a scale of one to ten What would you give this scale one to ten also be kind of like a scale of like something you wouldn't obviously have everyday But just like a yeah probably not everyday cuz I have my favorite go to Starbucks drinks cuz I'm really particular I grew up in Seattle home of Starbucks the heart of Starbucks, so I definitely have my favorites I would say that this is pretty neat if you like a green apple flavor It's a lot of my watch. I'm gonna hit. Oh. No. I got I got Hey Hello, got whipped cream all over my watch oh Wait, did you give it a rating? It was like oh, I forgot okay? How do we do it, right? Let me get it right and you maybe you do a rating first cuz I'm not really good as Rayleigh I'm not either, but I would say I would give it a 7, but now This is a scale of 10 so the only reason I'm giving it a lower score is because it doesn't have coffee, and I love Caffeinated beverages this doesn't have coffee. Oh, I'm feeling a lot of energy, so it must be from sugar That's it and I would say the unicorn frappe because I didn't really like it was probably a four so just one Way higher, I would say it's not my favorite Starbucks drink in the whole world But a really neat idea definitely like this but Starbucks. I'm waiting for the 10 Where's the spresso shocked I mean? I just drink basic black coffee, so I'm really Just a little this is neat. I love it cheers Cheers Mmm no.2 at Starbucks. Oh well my cold is there coffee Frappuccino light. I love that so good however I'm feeling if it's a really hot day like it has been here has been like a hundred and 310 degrees I'll just do an iced coffee with a little bit of almond milk sometimes a little bit of coconut milk And then if it's a hot drink. Oh, chai tea latte, or a vanilla soy latte I'm in now. Do you like the Oprah? Chai is it? Cuz that's a lot of chai? It's a lot of time you like that. I always say extra Oprah, and they're like, huh? That means extra. Chai, yes, see I like just their regular try, but you like try a lot do I love it Well, I mean I guess that's it. There's really not much more. We could say about this. Yeah well I'm just glad I got to try the zombie Frappuccino got to try the new new while it's new well guys. Thanks for watching make sure you check out Rose Channel We've done so many Starbucks videos, so I'll also put links to those cuz they were super fun We did last year we did the pumpkin and that was a bad the fall trip all drinks. I'm so great well That's it see you later. Bye 
hey guys how's it going so today marks the first video of my Christmas cooking series and I'm not really sure how many there's gonna be I think there's gonna be a lot I'm hoping that there's a lot it depends depends on a lot of things it depends how many times I fail at cooking it depends how much cleanup there's gonna be but either way we're starting this off by making basic gingerbread cookies now there was a time back in my old kitchen you guys might remember this I don't think I'm supposed to actually be putting this all in yet that was the first time that I've ever made gingerbread and it was the early years of my cooking videos I've learned a lot since then so this is my Redemption video we're gonna make gingerbread cookies now these are gonna be very special gingerbread cookies because I'm gonna try to make some of some of my youtuber friends so these are youtuber gingerbread cookies no promises that they look anything like my friends but we'll save so one of you guys actually tweeted me this recipe for gingerbread cookies I tweeted on Twitter that I was looking for one I was really hoping for like a home style family tradition gingerbread recipe but you guys all thought I was joking and you sent me a lot of memes this recipe calls for 3/4 cup butter softened so and with all that being said probably not gonna measure anything but that's okay it's it's the effort that counts and I'm putting forth a lot of efforts like I've got this freaking thing oh man have a holly jolly Christmas it's the best time of the year here's our butter in in you go for their mixture [Music] now I have all of our dry ingredients we're gonna kind of mix this up and then I'm gonna slowly put it into the gingerbread mixture then it tells me that I have to refrigerate for four hours or overnight like are you insane nobody this is a super impressive like I'm impressed with what I've made its gingerbread go Wow okay so we've got our gingerbread mixture which is delicious by the way now we need to chill this for four hours or overnight like that's ridiculous like what a waste of time just hold this container very strong yes thank you for your strong body that's a shame it really does we're like the horses huh okay let's wrap this beast up it does oh my gosh it does look like poop now I can't unsee it alright I'm gonna put this in the fridge for hours potentially overnight we'll see alright we're back it is way longer than four hours later it is the next day I've got my lovely gingerbread dough here it's been sitting out for actually a couple of hours because it was quite chilled when I took it out of the fridge this morning so we're gonna roll this out and then I have to sort of figure out who I'm gonna be making out of all of my youtuber friends into these gingerbread cookies I'm terrified for them I'm terrified for myself I don't know what's gonna happen but first let's flower of our surface oh that's a nice well I guess I'll just roll it out so I think the first person that I'm going to make is going to be let's see gonna make Casey nice chat ok so you look great hmm so I'm gonna need to make like a little camera as well for Casey I've got how am I gonna get him off of this thing oh yeah this is not working very well okay oh well sorry Casey next up my friend ro you guys know ro we do tons of fun videos together and ro was like super

there she is that's my girl let's do Lindsey Stirling yeah I don't look bad actually now I need to make a little violin there's a violin looks great like a little a little violin mine's for like the strings next up we're gonna do jenna Marbles I actually haven't seen her in a while so Jenna hello I miss you this is gonna be our Jenna oh oh sorry sorry sorry there you are I'm gonna make your little hamster this is your hamster I don't think I'm even gonna remember like what these are there's the hamsters eyes and there's a smile next up we're gonna do Madilyn Bailey yeah as I go through

and then as soon as they're done we're gonna decorate them alright the time is now it's been about 10 minutes I would say I'm hoping that my cookies are done and ready so we're gonna take a look Oh remember when I was like oh I wonder if these are gonna expand oh my god they have all expanded into each other this was supposed to be my Redemption video for making gingerbread cookies Lindsay's violin is burnt Casey's camera is turned into a Kris I don't even want to talk about Madeline's microphone oh my gosh they're all one they're all one cookie if memory serves me correct I think this was Casey and I sat over here so we're gonna make his glasses he's always got the sunglasses on why do I even bother this is atrocious I think today Casey decided that he was gonna be wearing a red shirt some new fresh kicks he just got back from like a 4500 mile run this morning it took him only an hour let's fix her that a vlogging camera here okay we're drogo we're gonna give her some cute little eyes today ro decided that she was going to wear a very very nice pink dress pretty not all these inspirations for gingerbreads these look nothing like anything that I was hoping it would look like all right well here's Madeline's microphone okay well I think this icing doesn't work Madeleine today she is wearing she's wearing a very nice blue midriff top and we're gonna put some nice little white like a white skirt on her Madeleine also got a manicure today Oh where's Lily oh this was her superwoman oh my goodness can you imagine if I was in a bake-off I'm definitely wind Lily like Lily always wears bread we can't tell I've given up hope and my fingers hurt from squeezy icing so maybe I'll just start writing people's names on it okay this is Lindsey oh I some of these icings work better than others so I will just do Linds okay there's Lindsey we're jennamarbles go I made her hamster Cassie's yoga mat seems like pink is the only one that works so we're just gonna

[Music] Oh God smells like it smells like the fire department should have been here an hour ago [Music] [Applause] [Music] you 
Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and today I saw that Apple announced some new emojis now these will be out in a future release of iOS 11 They did give us a very small preview of some new ones on world emoji day But today they gave us even more. so I kind of looked at them very quickly especially the animals But I wanted to do sort of a reaction to them make sure you guys leave me some comments below and let me know what your favorite old emoji is and also what your favorite new emoji is and the best part about this is you can comment with an Emoji if you guys don't have an iOS device, that's okay We can still see your emojis And you can still see ours so make sure you guys comment and let me know what your favorite is The first one we have is a sign language for I love you which is awesome I was also reading this has been a very highly requested emoji and guess what, here it is. next, we finally have the Giraffe This is Legendary and to go with the giraffe, the zebra I recently went to Napa we did this really cool Safari where we saw giraffes and zebras And I was trying to tweet about it, and I realized, "What?! There's no giraffe or zebra emoji but guess what else there is a porcupine and a dinosaur, a cricket, this isn't an animal I think this is a dumpling or like a we call them pierogies does anybody know what a pierogi is pierogies are pretty famous In Pittsburgh they even have at the Pirates games which is our baseball team They have pierogi races or they have these people dressed up in costumes And they chase each other around the field it's kind of silly. I'm not sure if they still do that It's been a very long time since I've been to a Pirates game. Oh, we've got some delicious takeout food This is interesting. This is a piece of broccoli a little broccoli floret preview of a future video I wonder what type of pie this is supposed to be because this could really be any type of pie it could be an apple Pie it could be a chicken pot pie But let me tell you what it probably isn't it's probably not a pumpkin pie and you know how I know this because I made a really big mistake and you guys will see this in a Thanksgiving ish video I tried to make a pumpkin pie. Did you guys know the pumpkin pies Don't normally have crust on top of them? You think that's something that is very common knowledge, but It's something that I didn't realize. Next up we have this beautiful very very luxurious. Blue hat. I wonder if they're gonna have the option to press down on it and Choose different colored hats probably not, but if they did that's a pretty cool idea Oh and look at this wonderful red scarf. I wonder if they'll do that same thing for this I don't think they will I feel like this is probably a standard-issue color But that would be really cool if they did that. Oops, I lost where I was, some winter gloves, a beautiful jacket I actually like that jacket. It's very chic very Detective like these next ones are pretty awesome And a huge props to Apple for taking a stand and saying guess what we're gonna do this they have Non-gender emojis, so these are amazing so here's one. Here's the next and here's the third I think it's pretty cool Let me know what you guys think I next in addition to all the other heart emojis. They have a new orange heart I'd say probably my favorite part out of all of them is the black one and the purple. Next we've got this a wonderful wizard We have a not really sure what they're calling us But it kind of looks like a little Tinkerbell. A vampire, which is perfect timing for Halloween and a mermaid I feel like this is definitely long overdue. Here's a few of the new face emojis. We've got this one I'm not really sure what's going on this little guy. He's just kind of like This I definitely use all the time. It's the Shh emoji I feel like there's so many times when well probably my sister will mostly use it on me. I'll just be yappin about something It's gonna be the perfect time from one of the Shh emojis this is also very interesting because it's one, two, three, four, five, five character swear word And I'm going through the list of swear words that could possibly be and I feel like most of the really bad ones are four letters So it's kind of a good thing that it's five letters because more or less like you know we're not saying a bad bad word We're just saying I'm not sure I would say comment below with the swear word that you think it is but I do not want you to do that and I have swear words blocked So you can't say them anyway in my comments.This one I like a lot. I love the little eyeglass guy This is one of those things that I feel like me and my sister will use when we're not that we would ever do this But if we were to say you know stalking somebody on the internet creeping on their Instagram or on their Twitter This is one of the perfect emojis for that and we never Ever do that, and you guys probably don't do that ever like come on. This is a little sled This is in kind of like the health and fitness wellness section I guess I'm not really sure I mean I feel like this is one of those things like I don't mmm I'm not really under percent sure I'm just rambling now. We can try to figure out what the sled is for I mean is this like a dog sled is this like a fitness sled where you like put things on and then you push it And pull it and get will fit. I'm something really sure with the saddest thing is that something else for fitness Go like this When you're doing lick push-ups or something? I will say. I probably will use this one more than once or twice This is a beautiful spa emoji and the last one here on my list is a rock climber well Thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this quick little iOS preview I was so excited when I saw that they had new emojis coming out Obviously we've been waiting for this for a really long time Apple has been teasing this for months I mean, maybe even it's almost been a year at this point I mean, there's so many emojis that it takes me longer to scroll through and find the one that I want But what it's made it so much easier is in iOS You can just type the emoji that you're looking for so for example giraffe I can type that What this is actually out the little giraffe mode you will pop-up below in the little predictive text you can click it And then you don't have to scroll through all of them anyway. I will see you guys soon. I have a GoPro Hero Comparison video coming out very soon, and I think I mention it on Twitter the image stabilization is amazing I'll also have a week or I guess at this point. It's two weeks with iPhone 8 video I've got some fun cooking videos for Halloween coming out and let's see I think there's something else too But I don't remember at this point. I'll see you in the next one don't forget to subscribe if you're not already and That's all I'm gonna go out of this video 
the question is will the suitcase closed we're on our way to Austria definitely shutting way more in here than this I think it's gonna actually close well if that's the case I'm gonna put one more item in there one more sweater because why not oh I also had to leave half of the things that I had packed to all the stuff on the floor was previously inside of my suitcase but I said no gotta draw the line somewhere I'm only gonna be there for a few days I don't know what else I have either but honestly we're not going for very long I realize it's the same weekly returns yeah I packed a lot for not a lot of time [Music] step one if one get to the airport we made it okay it might be dramatic but this has happened many times before I usually carry a very heavy backpack that I normally am smart enough to bring a ruler bag because and you tie my backpack is too heavy it with so much pressure on my shoulders that I start feeling light-headed and I want to pass out my backpack so we're gonna be redistributing everything but we made it to the lounge we have how much time do we have 11 hour flight flight a Munich and then we fly to Graz and then that's as far as I know what's happening as well done that I have every single USB cable that was made in the past 20 years so we're definitely set [Music] there is a hot spot up there that means Wi-Fi all blacks is happening [Music] [Music] learning German over here [Music] right [Music] we were traveling last year we were in the Munich Airport so many times [Music] I made a really super silly mistake I thought I was getting regular water but it boxberger water and I waited in line probably like 30 minutes to get this and I had two options I had classic and had natural I was like what classic sounds like it would be classic don't know I'm thirsty so never make this mistake again because boobs are means I'm definitely pronouncing that wrong please with carbonate [Music] it's snowing we don't have dragons could we check that [Music] [Music] Hey hi so I'm in Austria right now and I'm waiting for my sister to come over to my room because we are gonna go out and explore today one of the things that you guys told me on Twitter is there's currently a cold front coming through Europe right now so we kind of chose the coldest time possible to come to Austria but why I am here is I'm doing the launch of the new Jaguar ipace it's a new electric vehicle that they're announcing or potentially when you're watching this they've already announced it but now I gotta get suited up because it's super cold out here we go [Music] [Music] so it's been great because you're here with Jaguar they have a car for us so we have some we're driving us around and taking us some cool destinations now we have picked out on a map but he's not actually from Graz so he doesn't really know the street that well so we're kind of sort of trying to figure this out together I'm trying to find the clock tower I don't think that's right where we want to go we're going inside of a rock is this where we go to die why did we decide hey let's go inside the dark dungeon I don't know the driver said to get on there he didn't live here see the clock tower was up we're going down into the earth it's just good to look real quick because we're here they're all there's a soda machine oh she's wow that really was quite shocked I okay let's go back I don't I'm I feel like this is some sort of archeological dinosaur dig and I know that were supposed to be going up so this is not really restaurant toilets clock tower it's right there yeah we gotta we gotta go somewhere warm this is chilly coming up unto the Clocktower now something that we've been searching for for the past 35 minutes you [Music] we go in it I almost fell how do you say cold in German it's been cold no so we saw a bunch of nice views up here and now we have another place that we want to go it's like this little glass bridge and everyone said that we have to go check it out it's on the way to a museum and there's also a cafe inside so from here that's how we're gonna try to go that's it that's what we're going to go from there and then the other museums over there how we get there I don't know I got walking directions and it basically he said hey be careful cuz these directions are in beta and the walking directions took us basically walking over top of buildings where do you think this elevator goes you need to get tickets or does it take us well should we try it no look English here do tickets but this can take us somewhere oh this takes us to a downhill look let's take it but where does it take us oh no get in go get your camera back this one okay no we don't wanna go junior sneaks we really want to go oh my god I just got instantly terrified I don't know where we're going I bet you they have no right where we showed up woke up this is where we started except I'm not sure if this is I don't think this is exactly where we came out though that's a problem we might be somewhere else in the pictures actually yet I saw this as well so I think room here we possibly could even walk to that place this is actually one of my favorite lenses for this camera it's a 16 to 70 so you can get super super long [Music] he lets you shop who dis back out into the cold we have delicious lunch and now we're gonna go check out the museum they said this is called the friendly alien I have to store over items within bloggers all right see you guys later I'm gonna put you in the water [Music] so I think it's important to look at these things as formative experiment [Music] 
today we are checking out a new Mophie charger this was just released fairly recently but what makes this special is unlike most other movie chargers this one has an AC charging port so things that you would normally plug into the wall you can now plug in to this guy I probably don't even need this knife to be honest with you but what kind of unboxing would it be if I didn't have it USB USB C an AC devices Wow oh my goodness this thing is massive I am shocked jeez I don't know what I was expecting I mean this is kind of a heavy box oh crap this is actually massive it's really bad thank you this comes with two cables normally it usually only comes with one but this comes with actually they're both USB see so this is USB type a and then C and this one is just two USB sees which is quite exciting you can never have enough for USB C cables so here is our 30 watt USB C this is a fast charging port here's our USB a it's a high output charging at 2.4 amps right here is our LED monitor see how much battery life we have left and it looks like we've got a half charge which is excellent and here we have what makes this movie so special this is 110 volts 100 watt AC output this looks like it's just a little fan which I assume this thing can probably put out a little bit of heat because it is a massive battery it's got like a nice fabric finish which to be completely honest with you I'm not a huge fan of this well I don't like the fabric e texture of it that's my personal preference because I don't like this feeling but beside that I do like it because it doesn't slip around on surfaces like this desk does give a little bit of grip so it doesn't move around too much which is nice so it looks like this button will activate your AC plug so unless you push this button this isn't gonna be activated unnecessarily I'm shocked that it's charging like it's doing its job it's not something that I should be surprised about but you can see here the light is on so that signifies the AC is producing an output and with that being said we've still got two more ports that we can definitely use to charge other things so this Mophie being 22,000 milliamps because will give us 15 hours of laptop life eight hours on DSLR cameras 21 hours on large tablets and 100 hours on smartphones a hundred hours do you believe it cuz I just you know I just don't know well this looks absurd I can't imagine this is something that most normal people would carry around but let me show you what I do normally carry around and mind you I almost always have a large purse for a backpack so I'm always fully prepared with my batteries a little baby brother or baby sister too this one is this guy this was one of what there USBC versions this was meant to charge laptops but can you tell the size comparison between the baby this is more than double this little guy what I liked about this one is it had a USBC charger so this was basically made to charge us PC laptops not just laptops anything that was USB C powered like most phones other than iPhones nowadays but it's okay I'm not mad so we have 22,000 19,000 the one that I was using before this was actually twenty thousand this one is fairly old I think it's maybe about a year old the only thing that I didn't like is it was kind of big but I did get a little bit more life out of this and it also has three USB ports whereas this one only has two it has one USB a and one USB see there before this one I was using this one and this Mophie right here is still one of my favorites even though I think this one is about 15,000 milliamps I love the slim form factor this thing has went all around the world with me and what's great is I could always flip it right into the front of the seat pocket it fits in almost any laptop bag any of my purses and for whatever reason I love this one too because I felt like it always charged my devices a little bit faster even though these ports are basically all the same ratings as all the others still just felt like it was charging very very quick also super reliable sometimes I feel like when I use some of the newer movies they don't always seem as reliable as far as like the battery goes thistles it's three bars but then sometimes it'll just drop down very quickly but this one has never failed me ever except for like that sound that's definitely not something that you should ever hear I don't you think they sell this one anymore it was still my favorite anyway these are my current Mophie selections and yeah this is excessive I don't think this is something that I will carry around on a daily basis but if I am at something like CES or if I am going out to fly my drone I can charge one of my smaller drone batteries off of this thing some of the newer drones you can charge just using usb so this is great too because I will have so much extra power I am extremely excited to try this out I'm sure I will do a follow-up on this maybe not a specific entirely dedicated video but I'm sure I will mention it at some point in a vlog or something or on Twitter I don't know I just don't think I can see myself well I could see myself making an entire other video about updating you on this thing about a link in the description where you can check out this one and some previous movies there are some other movies that I do use that are a little bit smaller they have a lot of them let me see if I can find one for you oh wow I hit my foot I'm supposed to be having this video until I went into my Mophie drawer now full disclosure I have been a movie partner for a while so they have sent me some movies in the past this pile they've never sent me usually they send kind of a special edition one like this supreme one which I know a lot of you guys were into they also sent me some of these that I just seen ones which I basically only gave out to some of my friends when my book was released but these ones are so much smaller which is probably better for most normal users like you don't need this but I feel like I'm always charging something or somebody's always asking me for chargers while I bring this out as I just need to show you this too because these ones are great because you don't have to have another cable these have the cable built-in directly so this has a lightning adapter and it'll change to a micro USB so depending on which type of phone you have or what device you're trying to charge this is already built-in which is very very nice and this one it looks like it is 12,000 milliamps so 12,000 that's actually quite a lot that's a lot more than I thought it was in here because if this is 15 and this is 12 and you're 15 we this one I actually broke although it says it's still working but I'm not sure if I believe it this has wireless charging built into it that works voila okay well that's actually working so now I'm shocked because for a while this plug wasn't working because I dropped it and some things happen I'm actually quite excited that this works now how many milliamps are you this is ten thousand I'm Chuck I just reorganized all of my davits this is not a movi this one is my Belkin but I did an unboxing of this before this has a Bolton Apple watch charger so you just place your little Apple watch right there and this also charges this one is only 6700 so you're not gonna get much of a charge but I do like this because it does have the Apple watch charger built-in so as for my suggestions on chargers this is probably one my favorites as far as Portability and packing a lot of power this one is incredible because it does wireless charging it so glad it's working good I love portable power so much like I'm so prepared for the apocalypse well I'm not actually that hurt this might only get me through like a week plus some of these aren't charged I forgot to do some charging it's Friday night and baby I am at home hanging out with my Mophie chargers look what is happening sometimes when I just like stop and think like what did I do in my life to get me to the point where I'm making videos about my loved a portable power some people have hobbies like running knitting this is mine [Music] I think you guys so much for watching let me know in the comments below what charges do you guys use is this a little bit excessive should I get a new hobby should I go outside I think I'm probably maybe we should go outside not right now cuz it's late and it's dark out so I'm gonna go out at this video bye [Music] you [Music] 
Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine, and I am so excited because I absolutely love October, and guess what it is? It's October. I love Halloween it's one of my favorite things ever and I love making Halloween treats I did a whole week long of Halloween treats once, and I'm not doing that again cuz that was a lot of work And that's something that I don't like. But what I do like, are treats. So we're gonna make something really fun today These are little ghost ice cream cone cupcake things So what we're gonna need are some ice cream cones and make sure you get the ones with like the flat bottoms because I've made a really big mistake when I first bought these. They had the pointed tips, and guess what you can't do? You can't stand up the Ice cream cones, and that's not gonna work for what we need to make today. Next we need to make a cake Let me make sure this isn't expired January 2018 We're in business. So today we're gonna be making this cake in a blender I've got a lot of requests to bring the blender back, so guess what? It's back. If you're new here And you're wondering why is this girl making a cake in a blender? Then obviously you're new here. Welcome to the family. I appreciate it So what we're gonna do I'd like to give you guys a tip: when making things that you're not supposed to make it a blender always, put the liquids in first. Those liquids include 1/4 cup of water Did I say 1/4 cup? It's supposed to be 1 and 1/4 cup. Yep, okay. In you go. 3 eggs Two. Noo, there's a shell. Oh god. I gotta dive in here. I'm gonna unplug this because I've seen way too many horror movies. Okay, well we're gonna leave that in there And here we go we're making a cake in a blender. That scared me so bad. I was not ready I need a spatula! The problem of making cakes in the blender is they do sometimes get stuck to the side here So you just gotta get in there real good, give it a little scrape. We're gonna be making cupcakes inside of ice cream cones and it's pretty much the coolest thing ever. Here's our mixture. So get yourself a cupcake tin like this one open up your Ice cream cones. And you just put them in here like little cupcakes Oops so spooky. So now we're going to be pouring in our mixture That's why I decided to use the blender because this is great because you can just pour in the mixture Cupcake batter. Don't fill it up too high because it will overflow. Yeah, I'd say like maybe like 3/4 There's a little line here, so I'm just kind of filling it up to that. So you're gonna wanna pre-heat your oven to 350 or something about that around there 375 (Alexa) 15 minutes starting now Yes Oh boy, do your job. Our ice cream cone cupcakes are in the oven and now we're going to be prepping our icing I'm gonna be using Rosanna's little icing piping bags. I'm so excited this is the first time I'm gonna be using them This is why I use knives. These scissors are worthless So I wanted kind of a bigger tip because I want it to look kind of like soft-serve icing ice cream icing icing I'm Using icing I'm making ice cream. This is super fluffy. Holy crap. Yeah get in there This is so cute cause Ro has these little hearts on here And they're actually functional hearts because you're not supposed to fill it past that. I also thought I would be nice to do a little orange icing so for that we're gonna add a little That's a lot. We'll add some more might as well. A little bit of food coloring to that one, and then I'll just mix it up I definitely don't recommend doing this because I've done it before and it made a really big mess, but you know what? Wowie! That is very orange OH MY GOD! Alexa, shut up! Like I just want to cry Alexa cancel. It's all over my phone like it's all over my phone. Oh my god. Oh my god, it's all over my body! I'm just like I'm not sure what to do. Like when the kids say "Oh I'm shook" like I'm legit shook. (Off camera) It's all over everywhere. It's everywhere, wowie Okay, well uh, I guess I could take my cupcakes out of the oven and, um, I'm gonna clean up a little Hey you can't do I don't have much left. Ohhhh shoot. This was supposed to be the easiest video, this is this is unfortunate Oh my god I'm getting very very upset No Clorox wipe my body it's fine cool looking great Mmm I'm a beautiful girl. Now I see why Rachael Ray doesn't wanna have me back on her show Sorry girl! Why even give a crap now. Oh no, it's coming out Wow oh god, it's still com- oh no. Get out, get back in there I think they're fairly cooled off. So now all we have to do is decorate. I mean, that's should be the easy part, right? (Barking in background) I'm only gonna have enough to make, like, one Aw man this is gonna run all over the place. If you're watching this video to, like, get an actual inspiration for Halloween treats Does that look like a ghost? (Off camera)Yeah, looks like Jabba ghost. Oh, I'll put a little ooooh I'm so spooky ooooh It looks like Madde! Do not fall over Spooky spooky orange. This is really great icing like I really like it a lot. Oh no, it's dripping off the side It's melting like actual ice cream Spooky eyeball number two oh my gosh. I'm squeezing this so hard I wanna make him have a smile Don't ever say I didn't try cuz obviously I did wee! These looks super cute. Mildly impressed, but not really that impressed cuz it's actually not that good. That's a lot of icing I mean like an entire canister for like four Halloween sprinkles that I got at the craft store, I'm gonna do this over the trashcan because I am very sanitary Oh, my gosh. These purple sprinkles are incredible. Whoops that's a lot Good thing I don't have a bake shop because the health inspector would be here right now knocking on my door. What are you doing? And then I'm gonna say I don't know, what are you doing? This one is a little bit, it doesn't even matter This is a little crooked. I'm gonna put some of these on here. These are some super spooky sprinks What is that? I tried Like if you even say that I didn't try I really did. Oh my god It just looks like ants that's ugly don't do that These have little purple ones in them too! I'm literally decorating cupcakes over a trash can (Off camera) Thats so gross. Yeah, normally I like to try my treats, but... To be fair, this is a brand new trash bag I didn't have enough icing for these two, so I could just scoop this up off the floor off this. There we go Mmmmm I'll just add some icing here I'm so sad. I thought these were gonna be so cute. They look garbage Well guys, uh, that's it unfortunately, that's all I have for you. I do think that some of these actually look kind of nice like this one looks kind of good This one looks okay, if you like look at it from a certain angle The ghosts definitely did not turn out the way that I thought, like I just gave up on those. Like, look at this Alright well, thanks for watching. Happy almost Halloween! Look for some more Halloween themed cooking videos in the coming weeks, and hopefully or depending upon what type of videos you like maybe there will be more messes I'm not sure. Yeah, that's all I have to say. Okay, Bye. Oh God Wow. Wowie. It was a solid effort though, I will get myself an A for effort

 I mentioned this product to Jusine about a week or two or three months ago   So I immediately pre-order online. As a result, I received the email they sent me, saying   To send a group with us! So cool!   Hey, we hope it's great because we've used some other AR products before.   Oh! We haven't told you this yet! We haven't told you what this is.   It's a bit like VR virtual reality, but it doesn't have a screen or   Its screen lets you see things in your living room   So we will be here against Darth Gom   We should probably go downstairs. You can't see it, but there's no room here.   Hey, I don't think   Can not put up   It's cool that you can use your phone, but I'm worried that you know that the new iPhone X came out   Do you think it can be supported?   Hope to have   It looks like Christmas   correct   By the way, when you were small with Jenna and other sisters   Think of her gift better than me at Christmas!   Fortunately, because our mother is very careful. She will confirm   Each of us got what we really wanted, or we all got the same gift   We often get American Girl dolls   Hmm, they are the best!   My sisters have Bratz dolls and they love it.   This ~   What a beauty!   It's too much! You see you see! ! !   There is a little taste, so don't get too close when you open it.   Did you smell it? It's a bit like the taste of Teli.   I love!   Hey, you smell really different. Just say   Need to charge it? What is the battery's suggestion? Hey, the switch is below.   My God~   I'm so excited!   Looks like the following Micro USB hole can charge   There is this button, I do not know what it is. But the feeling should be functional.   I'm even more excited than I thought (the box is pretty)   Yes, she was a bit skeptical, but I am very confident.   So if I am wrong, it should be deducted points in our friendship.   No, I think it will be cool. Because I also like to experience AR and VR these things.   Have you ever been to IMAX VR in Los Angeles?   not yet   Cool ~   This is the host. (Not bad. The texture is very good.)   It's light to pick up.   So we can still see around because it is AR not VR.   Yes, this is not VR at all.   Then it has three different games:   There are light sword battles, chess...   Chess! ! ? ?   Yeah, Star Wars Chess   Can we fight?   I also hope so, but I'm not sure.   I remember reading that they were trying to do it   But they are not sure if they will be sold   But they hope they can   I need to tighten my host   I'm just good, really god-ah   I wanted to be a Jedi from an early age   Now is finally coming true!   Your time is coming   I am very happy to be here with you.   I told her that I couldn't get out of the box by myself because I was really excited!   I used to play on the sofa all morning, and as a result you said you wanted to come   But you must give me at least one hour because I'm lazy on the couch.   But you see, she combed herself very cleanly.   not bad   I don’t know we’ll be videotaping, so if I look handsome I’m just lucky   I didn't originally have to record it, but I think it must be recorded.   Because this is really cool   It's true.... At first glance it looks awkward!   You look like it!   This seems to be a control device? Or what action   These seem to be the connecting lines for different mobile phones.   Hey, there is a lighting line!   Hey, you see!   How did you open it?   Just open it. Hey, how did I do it?   Should we look at the manual?   This is not English...   Active-Matrix... Put on the host...   I am really excited now. In the beginning I wanted to say that it was almost the same as the others.   But now I'm really excited   When will you learn to believe me?   Ah, from now on   A lot of words   You see (I just want)   It's pink, if I don't color it   Don't know if there are other colors   Yes, there are two kinds: pink and blue   Download Jedi Challenges   Search Jedi Challenges at the App Store   Great idea   I always forget that you can do this   me too   Okay, so we're going to...Das Devil will appear in ours, or your living room   look!   I will not let Das Goes come to my house!   You can be mixed together   I'm so happy   Do you think he is one, a cool guy who wants to mix time with you?   Certainly, he will ask you if you have popcorn   OK, APP download completed   Oh oh my god! 35% louder iPhone X   God   This is really loud   Touch to continue   Here are the steps you need   Feel there are 15 steps...   Many steps   Then every time I think my watch is going to tell me that my heart rate is getting faster   Ok, you do that   Synchronization: Calibrate Light Saber   Holding a light sword in parallel with the ground   Until the aperture is filled   Synchronized! (This is it) You did it!   Put the tracking beacon on the ground.欸～   Are we going to go downstairs to continue?   I think so   Do we want to bring them down?   Of course!   OK   To start!   It's down. Matty, we want to be Jedi!   We can take this table away   I'm so excited!   We moved the table away   Now we are going to set up   See what happens.   But I'm really upset because it says   I am very happy   it says   I seem to step on you... sorry   No matter, I will not be angry   So we have to think about it. I am a bit worried   Because we have just launched the iPhone X   But it is not in the list of supported phones.   Although I'm almost sure that I can use it   It should be possible, but it may not be possible   If you are weird when playing, it may be because your mobile phone cannot support   Yes, but it should be supported later.   OK, do you want to set yours first?   OK   Place tracking beacons in a wide space   Our space is quite spacious   Yes, this will be put here   Where does this connect?   Face the phone, place it in the phone tray and close the lid   What happened? !   I saw a circle   Oh, it was to watch this thing!   No wonder just can't play   Too big to help me   what! ! ! !   what!   I put the ball here and let me lift it up   Hey, they can see it! See it.   Thumbs up!   They can see   so cool!   It's a bit like in Star Wars, Princess Leia ran out of R2D2.   Just like that   Exactly the same   Hey ~ wow ~ I was in the war ... I just killed ...   I mean, I don't like killing, but I killed a robot   Wow~   So do they want us to despair?   We are really desperate   Most of it was because at first I was afraid that our iPhone X would not work properly.   But later Alex could use it without problems   So we just want to try and see if Pixel can use   We tried Pixel, but Android has been asking some permission questions   It seems that there is some progress   We are about to start   Remember that the hardest thing to do before you start playing with toys is to find out where to put the battery?   correct   Oh, I must stand in front of it.   God   This is just awkward   Give me my one   Do not occupy or give me   If you have two sets of this game, you can use the same ball   This is still a little weight on my head   Is your weight a bit heavy?   I came back again!   Don't hit me!   Remember I'm still next to you   Unfortunately, you don't see our screen (this is really...)   Like when I raised my hand   A heavenly light sword was launched and extended before my eyes.   It's like you see it in reality   He is outside my range!   Don't worry, I will move forward   He is far away from me   God, he is approaching again   Don't! leave me alone!   I'm also in light sword fighting mode   Open light sword   They are getting closer   I seem to be right-handed?   Wait, I'm left-handed   No wonder I can't play well   My enemy is so far away   My right before my eyes   Mine is here   Hey, I seem to have just cut off my head.   Justine careful   I am sorry   Dude, this is really amazing   No need to apologize. I'm trying to save you.   I will never have a kitchen again from now on   We have to keep ... we must throw away the table   Oh, if I'm closer to the camera   You can probably see what I see   see it   Hey, this is only here   We are still playing... are you still playing that one   Yes   me too   Ah, where did this come from?   Dude, this is really great   Why are all my enemies in front of me?   I'm all on this side of the kitchen   Not ~   OK, I'm a bit dizzy   This is a bit crazy and can only be played on a cell phone   Yeah, I seriously think I'm a Jedi Knight.   Hey, Face ID can't be used now   Not ~   Wow, I stopped attacking him   Did you block it? (Yes)   I thought I was playing training   Yeah, I'm on the block!   I have no way to send newsletters on the ledge!   Oh no ~ I was attacked   Dude, this is so fun.   Go away, don't attack me again   OK, I think   God -   He is getting closer to me   You must be crazy if you come to play   When I exercise, it is easy to dizzy   So I'm going to take a break   But this is a long time   I had the happiest time   Really great   so fun   I love so much, so much love!   I don't have a kitchen anymore   Since then, it can only be used here for Jedi training   God, I really have a good time   Who knows when I first played the lightsaber with Justine?   There will be no such cool things in real life.   We think it's even cooler to be dark here   let me do it   Yeah, because I don't know what I'm doing   Let me serve you   If you are darker, you will see more clearly   It's even brighter now! God   Did you meet her?   She told me that my light sword is good   That's it, we have the best time to play this game   I hope I can find some videos on the internet   Let you see what we see   Because I really like it   I am very happy that we have the opportunity to play this group of games   Alex thank you for coming   Thank you for letting me come   By the way, what's your YouTube channel?   ItsAlexClark   Yeah~   Then, see when I put this film online   We also took another very interesting movie together   We played the "whispering challenge"   My God (Saturday will be on line)   That is the only thing... I played different games with many people   That's the only one I can play   really? (Yes)   Wait and see   You can play, but I still... What happened?   God, my... someone called me   Someone called my AR host!   Matty   OK, see you next time!  
Hey guys, how's it going? I am so excited right now. Because in front of me is the new iPhone X, and I am shaking. I am shaking with excitement. And I would say that this is an official official unboxing, but I actually could not even wait until I got home. So I kind of already pre-opened this at my friend's house. So here is my initial reaction of my first moment with the iPhone X. I'm freaking out! *gasp* It's beautiful. Oops, I put it on backwards! Upside down! Oh no, I made a mistake! So now I waited until I got home, and I put it back in the box, but it's clearly already turned on and already set up. But this is a re-unboxing, I guess you could say. Ta-da~ Reveal! So let's go through some of this. I was already digging through here because I had to get the SIM card ejector so that I could immediately, as fast as I could, get my SIM card out of my iPhone 8 and into the X immediately. And I just looked down in this box and it already recognized my face. So~ What do you know? Face ID is fantastic. But more on that, more on that. Let's get into what else is inside of the iPhone X box. We've got our little pamphlet here. And there is the SIM card ejector which I actually put right back in. I re-boxed this thing for this unboxing. I mean would you take a look at this. This is something that I'm sure many of you have seen before and maybe-- *~ding~* Ugh, "Jenny Ezarik tweeted." OK, we need to turn off my watch notifications. SIM card ejector, you get the point. We've got our fantastic wonderful beautiful stickers. Look. At. This. Next up we've got another piece of paper with a lot of text on it. I don't want to be bothered with that, but what is this? Welcome to iPhone. It's kind of crazy when I unboxed the... I forget what it was. Oh, it was the iPod Shuffle. It was brand-new, and it was so crazy. Just to sort of see all the old documentation and the things that they thought were important to include. So now here we are, iPhone X. Here's what it looks like. We've got our face ID setup. What is this? Oh wh- Oh, I thought that was a little piece of some sort of tape, but it is a little arrow that is showing you how to use your home button which is no longer there. Swipe up. What else do we have in here? Nothing. And here it is. Beautiful iPhone X. It's shining, it's shimmering, it's splendid, it's beautiful. It's perfect and it is everything and more that I'd hoped that this phone would be. I just almost dumped everything out. It's already on. It's already set up so I can spare you guys that whole setup process, and I just unlocked it. Face ID. Wow it's incredible. Let's take a look at the back and it really is much more amazing in person. I mean the glass shines right through into the silver back. It has the stainless steel bands all the way around the edge. And it really does remind me--oh yes, actually of the 3GS. This was not what I was grabbing for but this reminds me a lot of the 3GS. There it is. The stainless steel all the way around it. But really you guys have seen that before let's take a look at the X. I'm trying not to shake, but I'm shaking with excitement. This is a perfect time for a slow-mo iPhone X montage. So when you first turn it on it's kind of crazy because it does take some getting used to. You now swipe up to open. Swipe down on the right for your control center, and if you swipe down at the top or on this left hand side, that'll take you to your notification center. A lot of people like to close apps, so to do that you just swipe up and you hold. So you just pause here for a little bit. You can switch to the apps that you want to get to or you can close them. Press and hold, and that will give you the option to delete, and you swipe up. Or you can hit right here up at the top and that will delete all of your open apps that you'd no longer want to use. One of the things that I really like that's on the home screen is they have access to the flashlight and the camera right there. I feel like those are the two things that I'm always struggling to find especially when I'm walking my dog, or if something really cool is happening, and I'm like I gotta get to my camera, I got to get to it, it's right there. So you can just click on the camera or you can swipe over to give you quick access to your camera. So you got two options. Click here or swipe over. Let's see what else is in this box. So we've got the regular power brick. Of course, this is something that I'm sure many of you have seen before. And inside here we've got our ear pods. Right here. Ear pods in the front and your dongle in the back. At this point I've lost so many dongles that I probably could have bought an entire new phone with how much I've spent on dongles. But now that I have air pods, I don't actually ever need the dongles anymore, so it's quite the iPhone dilemma. We've also got in here one of the lightning cables, but you can never have too many lightning cables. Get outta there. One of the things that people made fun of the most about the iPhone X is the notch at the top. And for whatever reason, it really has not bothered me at all. I was one of those that made fun of it and to be completely honest with you, I didn't even notice that it was a thing. It just sort of seamlessly integrates into the phone. And another thing that I like is when I was going to delete apps, there's a little notification up here that says done. Whereas before most people would normally hit the home button. But now there's not a home button so you can just hit right up there, click done, and you're ready to go. I was also very surprised how quickly I adapted to not having a home button. At this point, it's like I didn't even ever have one to begin with. One thing that I was worried about when I would get in my car because I always use my phone for directions, I thought since it's kind of far away because it's sitting on my dashboard that it wouldn't be able to read my face and unlock if I reached my hand over and guess what? It did. And it was dark and everything just worked perfectly. It was quite surprising because it was one of the things that I was most worried about. So I want to show you guys how easy it is to set up face ID. I'm gonna go through here, and I'm gonna delete my previous face, and I'm gonna add my new face, which is ironically the same face, but whatever. So right in here you have the face ID and passcode. And it asks you to enter your passcode. So I'll enter that. Here's the option to reset face ID, so we will do that right here. So I'm gonna do a screen capture so I can show you guys the setup process for face ID. So look-it, the new screen capture is right up here on the top to let me know that it's recording, so you guys can see that's usually where this entire screen would be taken up but right here it's just this little small corner. So let's go into face ID and we're gonna add my new face, which is the same face that I added before. So we're gonna click get started. And, oh wow, that's a look. So let me position my face in the frame and move the phone a little lower. Lower, OK. There it is. So move your head slowly to complete the circle. Continue. Move your head slowly to complete the circle. That's what I'm doing. Face ID is set up. So that's it. So as you swipe up you will see that it's looking for my face, looking for my face, can't find it, but now we're gonna just go like this. Look at my face, and it's unlocked. It is absolutely magic. Now I know that you guys have seen this before on Android phones. I've used it in my Note 8, I used it in my Samsung S8, but it's so different when it's in the palm of your hand and you're using it on an iPhone. And one of the things that I love about Apple is they're not usually first to do things, but when they do finally implement it they are the ones that make whatever it is that they are doing mainstream. So now I think face ID is going to be the new mainstream. One of the things that I found was very shocking is the animojis, and I've seen demos of it, I had tried it at the Apple event when they first announced it, but actually trying it and seeing it in person is kind of amazing. Seeing the expressions of a poop emoji mimic my expressions is kind of something that you really do need to experience in real life. Now I'm gonna try and do a quick little demo for you, so you can see exactly what I'm talking about. So I'm going to go into my sister's message here. So hopefully I can kind of show you guys this at the same time. Let's go to the poop emoji, and it sees me, and as you can see, I'm raising my eyebrows right here. Do you see it on this camera? The poop is also raising its eyebrows, so let's do this. 'Hey, Jenna. I'm just doing another test here on the new iPhone X. And for some reason AH!' I feel like every time I started doing a demo of this my face starts getting weird. I start talking weird and just making ridiculous facial expressions. And watching somebody else demo the animojis I think is even more enjoyable than actually demoing it yourself. So let me know when you guys first see somebody actually doing this in real life. "I'm just doing another test here on the new iPhone X. And for some reason AH!" Another thing that I thought was pretty cool is not only can you send the animojis as a movie file, you can save it. But you can also send them as stickers so if you want to just send a still sticker just like you would send any normal iMessage stickers, all you have to do is make that facial expression, tap and hold on the animoji with that expression, and drag and drop it into iMessage. Just like that. And Jenna is just loving this just as much as I am. So I want to show you guys the size comparison between the X and the iPhone 8. And it's crazy to me because this screen is beautiful. It is technically edge to edge. Aside from the small notch that's cut out. But what's insane is how small this phone is in my hand. To go from using this for the past several years to a phone that is significantly smaller, but yet the screen is actually larger than on the 8. It's kind of messing with my mind because it's very hard to comprehend and because the phone is actually smaller it makes me feel like the screen is smaller, but it's actually not when you hold it up next to this. So it's basically taking this 10 and putting it on top of the 8 and essentially, it's just a screen it is just a screen. But it is a very significant size difference. So if you see these guys next to each other this one is almost the size of the iPhone 8. Not Plus, which I have here. This is actually shocking. This is the iPhone 8, and this is the iPhone X. And they are almost the same size. I'm kind of freaking out right now, looking at this in comparison to each other. Because I had no idea that the 8 would almost be the same size as the X. Very similar in size. The 8 is slightly smaller. If we put them up side by side just like this-- Here's the 8 and this is the X. Obviously you can tell by the vertical cameras. I'll be doing a camera test later, so you guys can check that out, but in the meantime can we just stop and stare? Cue the OneRepublic song. "Stop and stare~" iPhone X in comparison to the original iPhone right here. Started from the bottom now we're here. iPhone X vs 3GS. Can ya take a look? iPhone X vs iPhone 7 Plus. At the time of making this video I've only had it for about half of a day and in that half of a day it has far exceeded my expectations. And that's something that I didn't actually think was possible. Like I was excited for this phone and now I'm really really excited for it, and it's in the palm of my hands. So guys, I just wanted to give you a quick little look of the new iPhone X. I have so many more fun videos for you guys coming out so if you're not already subscribed to my channel, make sure you guys click subscribe. And let me know in the comments below if there's anything that you'd like me to test out here on the iPhone X. Also, I would love to hear from you guys. Did you preorder one? If you did preorder one when is your ship date? But I'm gonna tell you what, this phone is fantastic. And I am so excited for you guys to see the videos that I have coming up. Ah! I'm freaking out! OK, I will see you guys later. I'm gonna go edit this video now, so see you later. Bye! 
hey guys how's it going it's Justine and today I have something very very exciting it is a very very special treat now I posted this on Twitter a while ago this hot mess this is basically blast I don't know ten eleven years of my digital life and all of you guys were like hit up lioness lioness helper she needs help well guess what is in here a hundred and fifty terabytes of storage we are gonna go from that to just this oh my goodness this is very I'm setting this out I'm with these things these are so expensive I know but I'd always travel so I would just like to edit right off of these little guys and then every time they would get fool I wouldn't know what to do with them I mean it's great they're designed by Neil Bolton which is amazing Neil great guy and this isn't even the worst because over here there's another one this is basically 16 terabytes from the past I don't know a few months and then I edit off of these little guys these are two terabyte solid-state drives which basically these are all the videos that I haven't edited yet and so these are all full and then when this gets full I start panicking and then I start taking some files from here and then putting them over to here but then I'm not sure if I put them on this one and then everything just starts getting really crazy and then my computer is full and then I start absolutely getting the shakes right now what is your strategy for redundancy well sometimes if it's really important I save it twice on this Drive and then I'm here hurt no no this is automated okay mind you I'm pretty tech savvy but when it comes to creating servers and all of that I don't really have any idea what we're doing let's take a step back don't I need two steps back I think we can put this anywhere where you have a network plug okay and a power plug that's all I mean so the ethernet goes to my router yes okay or any one of these so where do these guys cat6 that's awesome you have cats expiring in here yeah bored of the go I actually have an absolutely no idea where that goes okay let's go find your mechanical room where's your hot water heater looking for hot water heater it's just it's just a place where it would be likely that all these things would gather I'm not actually looking the hot water oh we don't need the hot water heater for the server you know okay how do you feel about on Lego oh me too I would assume it'd be in here right you just come prepared with the screwdriver yeah of course don't you always carry screwdriver you know I carry knives this is awesome great you are wired up with you have cat6 up the wazoo in this place so if I asked you you know do you know where all of these go no so what are we trying to figure out where we can put your storage server hmm okay with some networking Rika jiggery which would be relatively inexpensive okay like maybe a you know $30 which your solid shopping no big deal yes stopping anywhere where you have one of these jacks in the house was that for a high-five yeah no they're not Laye not labeled okay no there's one more here oh I mean they're they're all over the place I'm pretty sure there's one back here so you could be running all this stuff wired instead of Wireless just like I don't know my server room why did they put it way up on the wall I think probably for the TV Oh every room has the ethernet and this one is up on the wall for a TV why was this house to suck this was made for me no way there's not gonna be one of the bathroom there is one in my other bathroom oh where would you be expected to put this television yeah well I think if anybody's gonna figure it out I think I'm gonna have to have a bathroom TV you know I don't think I want in the closet oh wait I know it's on the wall again let's go find another this house is bizarre okay well we already know there's one here so this there's another one I lost out so maybe you could sit very nicely in that corner yes but what table management wise you're gonna have to come down the wall over there oh yeah we'll use the one done okay I have never seen anything like this this is actually really crazy because like I've never really paid attention to it all right so I'm just gonna kind of tuck it there you know here I'll make it easier to work on didn't make any assumptions about your your networking capabilities and I brought a switch yes but it's only eight port so it's actually not even big enough for this crazy place so we're gonna have to go get a switch but what I didn't bring and this is a bit of a long shot a VGA cable and a VGA capable monitor do you have a chance do you need some amiibo no okay cuz you can't have that okay I found a monitor so one of the things 45 drives does is they can powdercoat any color you want and they can do pretty much any graphic you want now you may have noticed that this is sort of ugly I didn't want to say that but it's definitely not a good look [Music] beautiful so I'm gonna quickly swap that out so so perfect let's do this first okay then let's throw all the drives in it then we'll go shopping deal this is the best day of my life alright what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set it up so that if one of your drives did happen to fail all the data is intact so if one drive fails yes it's still everything's okay so just take it out you send it to Seagate they've got free data recovery service on these iron wolf Pro drives and then you just pop in a new one and it automatically rebuilds the data that was now that's crazy so how does it do that magic do you want the technical explanation I think we do yes if you would like to give it to us it's a method of storing data called parity and what it does is it uses a calculation kind of like the sum of that bit on all the other drives to calculate some parity a bit so then if you were to lose a drive it's like an algebraic equation if this Plus this Plus this Plus this equals this and if this is missing and we have everything else then we can just rebuild it that's pretty awesome and I was that something specific to this whole system the way that it's handled in this system through unbraid is pretty special because most raids will have requirements like if you wanted to expand your storage you have to buy like chunks of eight drives at a time whereas with on raid you just pop in a new one anytime you want more storage that's amazing and I do have a pair of side cutters side cutters Clippers oh it's got a drill and a charger for the drill and a battery for the drill it's still me original package it's kind of like pliers I know what you're talking like a little bit a little yeah a little pinchy there little pinchy pliers have cuticle cutters this may work I don't know what a cuticle cutter is now you do some kind of personal grooming items this was basically all I had to do that's it this is the perfect tool oh my god [Laughter] [Music] okay so kind of a long shot do you still have the box that the big server came in that was a long time ago yeah I kept everything in here though I'm actually I'm missing some screws I don't think you would find that box in this closet sorry this fell behind my friends is busy dress of course you have a Princess Daisy dress it's a really good thing you showed me this before we went to Best Buy the SSDs so we're gonna run them in raid one which means you've got one terabyte of solid-state storage and we just have to get Network stuff okay y'all mr. Kingston Tina we're legit on our way out the door to go buy FSF hey I'm glad you found these okay I still don't have screws though I'm gonna put these somewhere safe and not behind a bunch of Daisy dresses be parents it's only one Daisy dress the other is Princess Peach is this like those weird spider-man Elsa videos so printers we're getting into like we're getting into like pouring stop flames so that's good but now we're getting into Power Bars we need good we need the most compact one well that's real good yeah this looks pretty good this is an $18 cable these things are worth like one dollar that is brutal I really feel like we're heading the wrong way though cuz like all the IT stuff is over there and this is like toys and drones and games this would do everything in your house mm-hmm a very successful best buy trip I feel like this has turned into a reality show yeah got a network switches like pimp my Wi-Fi yeah this is gonna be like a 45 part series yeah looking that way I have something to confess what I've never done a haul video before I've never done one either you've never done a haul video oh I thought that was like a thing but like I think the beauty guru is doing we got this VGA cable oh this power strip okay this is awkward okay let's just put hard drive this is great we've had this for like two months it's been several months and I just like would open it up and I'm looking at it like oh you're beautiful 10 terabytes these are iron wolf pros so the pro means that you get a five-year warranty five years of data recovery service included with the drive and they're rated for large installations like this where all these drives are spinning and vibrating next to each other yeah can be run 24/7 leather spoken from awake yeah I think it's okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're uh it's a bug there's a bird beam the smoke was coming up through the thing I assumed this was like a plastic something and it was it's a bird bug you fried a bug with your light news about this the things that have happened today are just like it's unbelievable and I mean of course this would be something that decided yeah it and now I got to clean this be out of my light because I want to be real lit oh my gosh I can't believe I like my front fire in those houses from a bee okay let's go god i hate bugs I hate it oh god he's so crispy oh well body is fried he is like a Kentucky Fried I think we are look at this wow I mean he is in pieces Wow cut might be empty probably not a lot of flavor left in a minute okay electrical tape on here like is this expose where yes this is not safe that's why I thought that this is gonna catch on fire line is never coming back I did make a joke about you burning my house down earlier this is why I flew out to make sure but it all about assembled yet guys he got on a plane and flew here just for this just for this that's pretty amazing only reason I'm here that was pretty much it we're legit ready to just plug this in oh and do a quick test oh I forgot how much happier these things get little prize I bet oh you want to do the honors yes yes yes barb on right on okay you ready Wow whee so that's it now we get to change a couple more settings so I'm just gonna go into global share settings so included discs all excluded discs none that's the part where I like hope everything I did it's okay it works here we go there it is what did it really yes [Music] [Music] so I'm gonna show you a cool trick we don't actually have to just guess here so you can see these two I just plugged into random ports on the patch panel here can plug in another one lights up we might Dimity yeah let's go fire it up we can plug in now we can fire it up that was the whole thing you just got served I did this is amazing well thank you so much this is honestly like the coolest thing ever like I'm so excited wow I learned so much about my house about servers about life fires this is it you can go connect to it from any machine in your house boom this is incredible guys I am so excited about this make sure you go check out Linus's channel and subscribe and please go on comment on every one of his videos thank you for saving Justine's life on a huge thank you to 45 drives and seeking in Kingston and everybody who made this a possibility because I'm so happy so that's it we're done bye everybody hey Siri play back that thing up and copyright strike for my channel peace out gotta go back my bang [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
hey guys how's it going welcome back to my Christmas cooking segments whatever the heck you want to call these I'm not even sure but today I am wearing my finest target it's higher I'm still got the tag attached and I think I'm gonna leave this on throughout the entire video so hopefully this doesn't interfere with any of my baking I thought I would wear this because today we are making gingerbread cupcakes I'm pretty excited about this recipe because I love gingerbread and I love cupcakes so this is basically combining all of my two favorite things I also love Target they've got so many great Christmas sweaters like I was losing my mind I was cartwheel and up and down the freakin aisles looking for the finest deals and I found them this is not sponsored get all of our ingredients ready and let's bake so for this recipe we're gonna need 1 3/4 cups of flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1/2 cup melted butter 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup molasses 1 large egg 1/2 cup of water we've got all of our ingredients and now we're gonna put everything into the mixer and we're gonna make some cupcake magic but first I need to melt this butter because it is not melted and do the first time that it's actually called for melted butter and I don't even have the butter melted yet I'm so unprepared hurry up this is bad for my brain mmm I'm gonna start mixing it as we go it's not plugged in because I gotta make this mixer move I'm gonna be on the front page of Reddit fridge molasses then we gotta put our a game I'm sweating I'm sweating this sweater is so hot perfect for a winter wonderland of which we are not in because why I'm in Los Angeles I'm sweating we don't have winter these are Star Wars whisk and we're gonna mix our dry I forgot what all of these were so reference the beginning if you need to know you'll just stir this together using our wonderful Star Wars Darth Vader whisk now watch me whisk now watch me nae me I have left the house in a while I'll bake a lot so dry ingredients are not all dry and mixed so we're gonna add our water into this mixture and now I'm gonna slowly mix this into here so let's do it it's really important to scrape the size because that's just some extra gingerbread goodness that you will be wasting and we don't want it to go to waste almost ready let's mix this up just a little bit more okay find it again we've got our cupcake liners they're gonna place those in just like so cupcakes lined now we're gonna fill this about 3/4 full we're gonna bake for about like 20 or something minutes let's go time to fill up our cakes that's it let's pop these in the oven and then we're gonna make our gingerbread of frosting look at this I've got everything all prepped and ready for our icing because this is a professional kitchen we've got 6 tablespoons of butter all right let's mix this up until it's nice and light and fluffy how do I know when it's light and fluffy whoa [Applause] doing its job God okay she's looking pretty good alright hey stuff oh my god this is so good like I Wow now we're gonna mix this up really good and that'll be our final mixture and then hopefully our cupcakes will be done and we can ice them and we can carry on nuts about this just mu-1 everything this is what we need to do we need to never talk about the tag again don't talk about the tag don't tell Jenna all right we're gonna get this icing out of here I mix it up really nice real good I guess I don't really have to take it out of here but I feel like I would like a nice presentation plate of my delicious icing all right let's take our cupcakes out of the oven looks like we're ready now it's time to ice these little babies up we've got plenty to choose from let's just juggle our cupcakes before we put our icing on them because juggling top cakes with icing mmm we've tried that I also made these little gingerbread men the other day using that recipe that I previously used in my making of youtubers gingerbread and that didn't go so well either hey Jen hello you want a cupcake er no but you gotta have one of these did you eat one yet they look they look good try the icing it's delicious I strive for the best year probably the best icing that I've ever made in my life it has another little secret ingredient what do you think is that the secret ingredient Napoleon this is probably not my best icing job I feel like I probably should have put a little bit more confectioner sugar in here because these are very melty and you put one in there now this is my gingerbread pocket okay but see we don't put all my gingers in there well it's literally the gingerbread father yet it's really supposed to go I love and Christmas I've got so many gingerbread accessories this is super exciting this is so festive this is something that you can really make friends or family your enemies

well guys today's today and this is a day that I have been waiting for longer than I can even remember I mean it has been so long I mean I did my first book report I was like the second coming of Steve Jobs and it was a book that impacted me for so long all of the kids that were in my class but like Justine really would know what you're talking about what's a Mac but today is the day and we're at the Apple park campus and we're here for the launch of whatever it is that they're going to announce it's the Apple event 2017 I was in San Francisco not at the keynote for the original iPhone in 2007 I was there for Mac world this is a quick little clip of the moment that I saw the first iPhone and now here we are ten years later I'm getting to go to my first Apple event and I'm so excited I can't breathe [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's go check in and get the day started [Music] okay checked in event didn't start for another two hours but I don't know what I'm gonna do hopefully I could find a friend cuz I don't have any friends right now so step one find it so being honest with you I don't know where I'm going I'm following these people because they all look like they know where they're going this is the path up to of the Steve Jobs theater this is the first event that is being held here it's incredible [Music] [Music] behind me is pretty much exciting the first iPhone and I wasn't actually in the keynote but I was in San Francisco I was at Macworld well the iPhone it was there in 2007 but I laid my eyes on this little guy and little did I know that this phone would change my life and not only has it changed my life but has changed so many other people's lives so to be here today to celebrate the anniversary of the original iPhone here at the Apple of it at the first time ever an event is being held at the Steve Jobs theater the first person that I ran into when I stepped up to the theater was Steve Wozniak and you know it's one of those things like when you meet your heroes we don't know what to say I didn't know what to say but I said thank you thank you for everything and then he walked away so I'm about to head in right now but first let's do a 360 tour of this incredible computer [Music] let's head in now I'd say this was my first time in the theater but I did a live stream entering it so we're here now in the inside and downstairs is where the action theater is so up here is I'm not really sure what they're calling this it's sort of like a bit of welcome area but guess who else I just ran into of course I'm excited this is new everything is very new I mean this is the Steve Jobs theater now you've been to Apple events before yeah but none of them have been here and this building is new all this is new we're gonna go downstairs soon before I was right I couldn't find any friends but the signing of a sentence what are your expectations I expect to see new iPhone but hopefully they do something different hopefully have some new product that one word thing could be cool to bring back the one more thing back to the Steve Jobs my I didn't even think about that one more thing let's hope for it this is my actual first time ever holding the original I thought great places to do that first thing I did was split up to today and it just doesn't look real anymore well it basically looks like a stretched-out Apple watch or the Apple watch is like a shrunken down version of the original phone okay a little bit there an above camera so small eight gigs if I just download the whole Spotify library including games right good I'm really excited are you excited I'm not excited to hear it I haven't cried yet though this is gonna be great [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] we're minutes away from the event started are you hyped I am so excited even though it's not saying I'm like a stone cold right now but I'm surprised [Music] [Music] the event just ended and now we're going into the hands-on station let's head over there and take a look and see what we can see this entire open space was closed before so these walls just opened up to reveal hands-on demonstration [Music] and sometime too here it is this is the iPhone 10 look at this it's my baby this is so weird but though like I don't even know how to just like oh I need your face sorry okay so I had to use someone else's fancy so here I am obviously we're going to scroll up and we're going to be the who emoji this is a demonstration of their AR so you can actually like walk around this person so they're basically right here on the floor natural light spotlight we've been checking out so many things and I just bought it a while Chris tomorrow what do you think obviously I'm excited what about you Oh I mean iPhone 10 love it I mean it looks like X but it's a 10 I mean that's brilliant screen goes edge to edge it looks amazing it's beautiful I'm probably still gonna call it X but you know I gotta yell it at like 50 times on the floor they're like you gotta stop sounds more mysterious iPhone X even though we know everything about it now it's true and I was so upset with some of the rumored colors like that gold color I was not a fan but this gold that they have right now is perfect like I absolutely love it i almost wish the ex came in the gold but it doesn't it goes back to the classic colors true that's true well let's go check out some Apple watch stuff I'm excited about the album rolling in yes a I'm wearing the new app watch series 3 it's is the 42 millimeter and this is the new gold color the blue in color is called spicy orange I definitely want this pink one too it's like a pink leather peel shop it's called fuchsia this just in [Music] should come in too you feel the Rue with joy I shave the world on the side just to see smile so what did you think it's amazing I am super excited for the 10 nice I keep calling it the ex but I'm like no no no it's the 10 well thanks helping me film like the question of the day are you excited yeah I know the option you have to use it but like we got a taste and it's pretty sweet this is the Apple visitor center we're gonna go inside and check it out I thought earlier when I first got here so now we're gonna go inside we'll be eventually open to the public so you guys can come in check it out do a little bit of shopping ever really cool VR station over here where you can take a look using your phone using the augmented reality and do a flyover tour of a papyrus wonderful so here it is you can use your iPad and this shows you a part oh wow my suits even predominant [Applause] this is so awesome so you guys ever get a chance to come here when it's open to the public I definitely recommend it because this experience alone is unreal so this is like the Apple store here at the Visitor Center I feel like I should buy something can i buy something what if I can buy things here can you buy things here can today you can buy things I'm gonna buy some things that can hold my goodness but to set three cars you are running low on a stock 42 we do have I'll do that too well I did a little bit of shopping but a little bit oh yeah just a little which means I'm probably gonna have to do an unboxing on the Apple Campus because that not gonna be the coolest thing ever I think it is so I'm going to do an unboxing right now on this beautiful Apple watch fans and I've been knitting having my eye on some of these bands for a really long time and I thought it only appropriate did I buy it here at this place and I am boxing you too so let's go there's like where's the mom there's the piano oh here it is oh so beautiful they have these really cool postcards there's three different versions and each one a several different postcards in each box here's some Apple playing cards Oh okay these are cool look at this they're very slick [Music] [Applause] looks so great that's Tiffany a boxing I got a few other goodies but I'll wait till later to open those up you want to introduce yourself yes hello I'm Alex null and I'm developing an app for people with disabilities navigate public spaces and find safe reliable services and employment opportunities I'm here at The Ellen DeGeneres Show that is so exciting is this your first Apple event yes I'm so excited to be here yes this is my first one - guys that brings this day to a close we are now leaving the prestigious Steve Jobs theatre it was pretty much the coolest thing that I have ever seen I've waited I'm not even joking more than half of my life I was probably 10 or 11 when I first realized that there was this thing called keynotes where they announced new products and Here I am today many many years later for the grand opening of the Steve Jobs theater I'm so happy [Music] this roll in some time to cry 
hey guys how's it going Justine and today we are testing out the new iPhone 8 plus camera I've got all three colors right here so you guys can take a look because I've you have to show you guys the different colors this is the Space Gray and we have the 8 silver and the beautiful rose gold which is mine now the iPhone 8 is out has been dubbed the fastest phone on the market currently which is pretty excited because you guys might know I'm a little bit of a fan we're Nev testing out the video and the photos and I've got the help of some of my friends back here it's uh ed and Jenna they're getting ready for their slow-mo 1080p shots with a new iPhone A+ camera [Music] so the first thing we're gonna test out is the back camera we're gonna be using something new portrait lighting features so let's test those out [Music] let's take this photo of Jenna and we can go in and I can show you guys the difference here's the natural light switch into studio light adds a lot more light on her face contour adds some more shadows to her face and some on her body as well and the stage light basically removes the entire background and makes it seem like she's in a studio the stage light mono makes the entire photo black and white [Music] these photo filters aren't anything new when you go in to edit your photos in the camera app but one thing that I think a lot of people might overlook is this when you go in to adjust the lightness and the darkness and the color in the black and white if you click this little thing right here this will take you in to be able to adjust even more finer details a lot of people rely on third-party editing apps but really you can do pretty much everything right here inside of the camera app those previous photos weren't taken in portrait mode but this one was you can tap the portrait mode button at the top if you want to remove the blurred background or if you like it you can tap it again to add it back on that little magic wand up at the top will do some auto enhancements for you if you just want to cross your fingers and hope for the best you can always go into any of those portrait mode photos and edit any of the studio lighting to change them on the fly wait see if you can get the look screen though of us taking this you want me to do it armed you know but like this filming this screen cool let's look and see what we've got slides open it's super Craigs slide so let's go get a slide pick one of the new things with a plus camera is this optical image stabilization which also helps out with the front and the back camera so if you're feeling a little shaky and a little crazy your pictures will come out way more smooth and crisp now let's see if we can do some slo-mo down the slide slo-mo playground [Music] today I'm gonna slo-mo you break it just go fast I don't think you're gonna super slow-mo whip your hair back and forth yes [Music] all right yeah [Music] are you trying to be sexy not really just I want more carefully [Music] dad you wanna do a slow-mo hair flip [Music] I got a lot of questions for people asking how do I change the video quality settings it's simple go into settings camera and here you can change the video settings from 4k 60 to 30 to 24 and so on and also the slo-mo from 1080p at 240 to 1080 120 let's first test out 4k at 60 frames and now here's what it looks like slowed down 50% this is normal 240 and now here's what it looks like slow down 25% looks pretty good I think I'm a fan I think my junk could use a little her here's 4k at 30 frames a second and here is 4k at 24 frames a second lets us out some 4k footage from the back facing camera and I'm not gonna touch the audio as it comes out of this camera is what you guys are gonna see next we're gonna hear it this is the back camera and we're shooting right now at 4k 60 frames a second which is new to the iPhone 8 Plus which gives you a very smooth effect I don't typically like to shoot my vlogs in 60 frames a second because it does make you a little bit dizzy but it will allow you to slow down your footage you can also get slow-mo and not have to shoot at 120 here it is look at this let's slow down the 60 frames a second landed it here we are friend facing camera iPhone 8 plus now the problem shooting here is there's very harsh shadows and there's also some very bright lights it's gonna be interesting to see how it handles this Hey [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] bringing my okay so what we need to do now is we have to trust stack these your whole yeah so fan them out sort of like this I think I made a really big mistake by taking this project on now the most difficult thing when testing out multiple cameras is some cameras perform better in different lighting some perform different in different situations so it's really hard to tell which is gonna be the best so we've got here is the iPhone 8 camera this is the Google pixel this is the essential phone Samsung Galaxy s8 Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone 8 plus fairly sure what I got myself into they keep turning off every time I try doing some pretty harsh lighting conditions the shadows are pretty intense places here it's really bright and it's also a little windy too it's a vibe just take the picture and file don't move well I mean it can like move a little I'm just I just need you to be there in one position okay ready that's good now keep that pose ready past romance is worth telling me I just crash [Music] [Music] look like watch me [Music] [Music] so now we're gonna suss out the portrait mode on the iPhone 8 plus and you live focus on the Samsung movie [Music] switching phones let's turn the blur all the way the interesting thing with live focus on the Samsung is when you're taking it it looks like absolute trash like if I don't even know how the pictures gonna look good but then when you go into the preview mode it looks incredible [Music] both the iPhone 8 portrait mode and the note 8 live focus took incredible photos it is really hard to choose which one I like the best but I feel like out of this set of photos I may like the note 8 just a little bit more and you have much more control over that degree of blur on the note 8 than you do on the iPhone A+ but in some of the iPhone photos they looked better but then in some of the note 8 photos they looked better it really I think depends on the situation anyway let's test out the front-facing selfie camera on all of these phones I would have to say out of this set probably my favorite shot is on the pixel it picked up a lot of great contrasts in the backgrounds it also was slightly wide-angle and I found out of all of them the coloring was probably the best now for the back camera no live focus no portrait mode just point and shoot [Music] [Applause] [Music] in conclusion the camera that you have with you will always be the best camera cliche I know but it's the truth I'm curious to find out from you guys in the comments below what you guys thought was the best out of each test that I did I'll be looking out for those comments in the meantime this is a time-lapse from the new iPhone 8 plus with that being said I am so excited for the iPhone Ted baby [Music] 
Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and happy iPhone 8 launch day, I feel like every time There's an iPhone launch something goes wrong. I mess up my pre-order. I order the wrong phone. I'm traveling I'm out of town never fails always something. I'm not sure what it is about my luck, but this time I'm traveling for a really fun project. I've only gone for a day, which means tomorrow I will be back in town to get to my iPhone, but today is Friday, and I filmed this a few days ago And this is something that I've been really looking forward to checking out ever since I saw them at the Apple event these are two Of the new wireless charging bases this one is by Belkin and this one is by Mophie. Not really sure which one I'm going to like more since I got the gold iPhone 8. I got the gold iPhone dock to go with it I was trying to think what case would look best and probably just gonna go back to getting a white case But I thought I would try out this this is the new pink sand iPhone 8 case And I got the pinks and Apple watch band to match of course you got it back to the band with the case Fashion or something the first thing I will unbox. I guess is this iPhone case It's called the riveting unboxing hold on wait for it I love this color. It's a really really pretty sort of like a blush pink. I guess you could call it sand pink That's what they're calling it pink sand. I'm wondering will this fit on the iPhone 7 yes, the iPhone 8 case fits on the iPhone 7 seems like they made the camera hole just a little bit smaller this looks to Me to be about the same size, so Essentially, I think this case is basically the same So it's labeled an iPhone 8 case, but you can obviously use it for your iPhone 7 So that is good news, but in the meantime, Back You go little boy. Let's open up this Apple watch Band see what this looks like on here looks great! Yeah, look at this aesthetic. I also get a question a lot because When people look at my Apple watch it looks like I'm wearing it upside down, but I haven't flipped because I'm left-handed Newsflash most left-handers, I know where watches on the opposite hand the pink sand on the white ceramic face Yeah, this is beautiful I had such a conflict on which Apple watch ticket I wasn't sure if I wanted to get the gray ceramic or the white ceramic or a 38 because this is the 42 and it's pretty big, so we'll see it's a very hard decision I had a lot of conflicts I like the bigger screen But I also feel like my wrists are so small that a smaller watch might look a little bit better I'm not sure. Oh boy. So this is a gold dog. Let's open you up This is a really nice gold color. I'm just hoping that all of these colors do not clash I'm not a hundred percent in love with it. Maybe like 73% Actually in this lighting I'm gonna go with like maybe an 85 percent, so let's just picture this This is where the iPhone 8 will be Tomorrow they might be late upload, but I will get an unboxing up for you guys. I'm so excited I'm basically going to be hopping off the plane at LAX with my cardigan I'm a Nintendo switch and a dream, or is it my dream in a cardigan a dream and coming on the plane and Miley Cyrus party in the USA party in the USA is Miley Cyrus. That's what I said With my Nintendo switch and my cardigan No, this isn't working out I hopped off the plane at LAX with an iPhone 8 in my hand. I've got a lot of trash. I'm losing my mind It's 11:31 p.m.. It is very late, it's way past my bedtime This is the new Belkin wireless charging pad classic Vulcan style That's big, It's a very big pad. So here You've got the wireless charging pad disc maybe And and here we've got this switch plugs right into the wall Directions guess what you're not supposed to do put your piece on the mat This key is on the neck keys on the mat. Literally. I can't charge anything with us yet Except maybe Samsung phone let's take a look I'll plug you in! it just looks like a little plate little I'm gonna falling apart with right of your eyes It's got a nice little group right here That shows you exactly The Way to plug it in so fits nicely to the ground so there won't be any sort of raised cord when you set it Down on a flat surface there it is Is it on are you on? Yes charging wirelessly the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X both use qi wireless technology so anything else that uses that as well You will be able to charge on these wireless pads mats. Do you prefer mats more or pads? I feel like pads it has a very uncomfortable sound to it now Let's check out the Mophie wireless charging base And I've used a bunch of the Mophie wireless charging things in the past There it is, it seems to be almost the same size, maybe a little bit smaller. Oh, it's heavy Wait There's a size comparison I guess at this point it really depends on what color you want I feel like this is definitely very smaller it has a much lower profile a power cable. Just plugs right into the back here This can also be a deciding factor of which cord is longer They seem to be same size. so okay, Good to know. I know what you're saying Wow oopsies. Oh, but Justine Samsung's had wireless charging forever, but guess what your messages are green not blue, so here's the Belkin and here is the Mophie so I kind of think that I like the The Mophie one a little bit more cause it's a little bit smaller So if you have the sitting down It's very non intrusive like I probably wouldn't even know that that was Something that you could put your phone on to charge if I didn't already know that that's what it was But this one's more like one of those USB Coffee cup warmers, so you guys seen those you plug it in you put your coffee on it And it heats your coffee mug up. I mean as a size comparison look at this it's like a little Squished hockey puck. which one Do you guys think that you like more? Thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this quick little unboxing of the things that I decided to get for my new iPhone 8 and my new Apple watch I can't wait to try this out with my new iPhone Stay tuned because all of my iPhone or Apple watch videos will be out very very shortly as soon as I can film and edit them and post them online you guys will be the first to know about it if you aren't subscribed to my youtube channel just hit The subscribe button welcome to the family you can also hit the little Bell button That's a little notification, so you will know exactly what I post a video Well that being said I'm gonna go it is 11:30 p.m.. And just past my bedtime, and I have a flight in the morning And I haven't packed If you guys have been subscribed for a while, you know this is nothing new and I'm losing my voice, and I'm drinking coffee Geez happy iPhone 8 launch day 
Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and today we are talking about face ID on the iPhone 10. Since I posted my unboxing video and my top 5 features video, one of the biggest quetions i was getting its about face ID. Do it work, can you wear sunglasses, can you wear a hat, can you wear a mask my sister, well, I can't even tell you what she says  what she wanted to do to me Basically it involved removing my face and putting it on her face, but she got into some graphic details I'll spare those for you guys. But to answer your question does face ID work? Yes, yes, yes, it does, and it works way better than I expected it to work I'm so used to using the surface studio and sometimes it struggles to find you. It's like looking for you looking for you, I'm like I'm right here Okay. That was pretty quick so for studio facial recognition success I never had any facial recognition issues on my note 8 or my s8 But a lot of people were freaking out about face ID because in the keynote there was an issue. And this issue was misrepresented by many people because they thought that this was face ID not working. In the demo when he went to unlock his phone, the phone had already been reset so anytime you restart your phone, you have to enter a passcode and that's the same for your current iPhone right now. If you restart your phone, it's gonna make you enter a passcode before you can use touch ID. And what happened on stage was that exact thing I haven't run into a single issue in the past few days I've been pretty impressed with the angles at which you can unlock your phone with face ID I mean this is pretty low I just have to like look up and face ID and it detects me like that's that's really it. The first instance that I was like wow this worked really really well was I do my makeup in the bathroom And I had my phone just sitting on the little vanity right by the sink, and I was kind of far away I was just like it's probably not gonna unlock, it's probably not gonna see me It unlock, I just looked over. Its like magic. ~sings~ Another instance in my car, I usually put my phone right here. I use it for directions It's basically like my navigation and it hooks up to car play and sometimes your phone will turn off I didn't want to have to be distracted obviously if you're in the car you should now be texting or doing anything that will distract you. Well the face ID it was less intrusive than doing touch ID because Before I would kind of have to fumble around with it trying to hit the touch ID and not knock it off of my dashboard And the face ID it recognized me And I just swiped up like that was that was it there was there's no struggle there was absolutely nothing I was afraid because it was a little bit further than a distance than when I had set it up that it wouldn't recognize me, but it did so here's the demo This is about how far this kind of an awkward shot because I'm trying to shoot this myself, okay It's locked now pay very close attention. I just look tap Swipe up. It saw me. I think you guys get the point face ID is pretty great It's also extremely intuitive because most the time you're used to putting your finger here anyway So it's almost like you're putting your finger on touch ID but you're just swiping up, and it just works It's just that I just unlocked it It's super fast Now the first test that I wanted to do is with sunglasses on and they say that this should work No matter what the pair of sunglasses on but some sunglasses May have some sort of protective coating that it can't actually see your eyes So that's a very important part when using face ID to make sure that it can detect you So let's see if they can detect me with some of these sunglasses on I have a pair of polarized ones I have some fairly expensive sunglasses, I have some very unexpensive sunglasses, I have some prescription sunglasses. Let's see what happens So the first thing, let's just look at it, unlock, there we go, magic First pair of glasses that I want to try are prescription ones so here we go Let's test this out and see if it will work. I keep getting notifications cuz it's almost time for HQ trivia You guys haven't played HD trivia, you need to HQ trivia.com, this is not sponsored at all, but it is so fun Twice a day there'll I ask you trivia questions It is so much fun, and you can win real money But anyway moving on let's test the glasses okay, there we go phone is locked Oh gosh, HQ trivia notifications, and it just it already automatically unlocked It's unlocked so these glasses check one pair down. This is a pair of DIF sunglasses. Let's try these okay Good, it's confirmed this lock unlocked unlocked with sunglasses stiff sunglasses Worked your baby. Let's see how you hold up confirmed lock. It's your trivia troubies about the start. I'm gonna miss it. Hey ready Do your unlocked? Is it probably one of my favorite ones? mm-hmm confirmed lock Unlocked okay, so I think we get the point that most of the sunglasses that I probably would be wearing will work Let's try these ones these are polarized, ooh I can't see anything. I can't even see the monitor that I'm using to shoot with polarized sunglasses freak me out I'm not sure if I'm a fan. Hope that's in focus because I can't see the screen Unlocked so I guess polarized sunglasses work as well Confirmed lock Unlocked okay hmm all right. Well. I guess that test went well. What about wearing a mask? There's no way that. It's really gonna work with a mask on because using the precision mapping It's basically making a 3d map of your face and three most important things is your eyes your nose in your mouth What if I just kind of like cut out of a piece of paper my eyes my nose in my mouth and see if it? Can recognize me. I'll try it I don't everything else to do I mean I do I have like a million eye home videos to edit Craft on so this is gonna be super silly because I don't have any scissors. I have a knife somewhere Of course I do so my eyes are about right here Okay here we go one. Eye Hey, Justine, what are you this weekend? So that's this is not working out very well like how am I gonna unlock my phone if I'm a superhero I'm gonna be wearing a mask Detect me. It's me It's me you're looking for Tell me that you know. It's me All right making a paper mask a lot of macho It doesn't matter if you put fresh ink in a printer it's always low on ink this is a very important photo You don't understand I need this I need this a test that is also highly recommended is printing out a picture of your face Can you fool face ID with a picture of your own face? We're gonna find out What if I put the face over top of my face of course well now there's no paper? The hardest part of this video was getting a printer to work you're taking it too long I Only got this printer because it was a beautiful walk It's working It took me longer to get this printer to work than to shoot and edit this entire video timeline The missing piece of the puzzle sorry my office is messy Let's see if we can do this. Okay, so I'm going to hold my phone up as you can see and then we're going to Make sure it stays locked Look at my face look at it. I'll hold it from different angles I'm gonna try to swipe up Face ID is not working on a picture of my face. I'm gonna swipe up It didn't work well you can't print out a picture of your face and expect to hack into someone's phone It's not gonna work another question is does it work in the dark. Yes it does That's pretty dark. Okay. Can you see that confirmation of it being locked ready wait for it? Okay, it's gonna happen very fast Unlocked another thing that has been interesting is I don't have all of my apps on this phone yet So I've still been using my 8 Periodically like when I have to order post mates or use my hue lights or ISO noise or things that I haven't actually set up Yet, because they're basically as soon as I got this phone I've been shooting and testing so haven't really had time to sort of log in and reset all of my homekit ass so going back to the 8th It's so strange because the phone feels massive in your hand and it's crazy because I haven't had a small phone and so long so You do get used to that, but when you're using the phone It doesn't feel any different because the screen real estate is actually larger than on the phones. Let's try hat okay Well if purchase tonight work with a hat on like that's a dumb question and a lot It'll also lock on five tries, so if you're trying to use a face five times. It doesn't work It'll lock and make you reenter your passcode so someone who is trying to enter your phone trying to use their face When the face isn't your from they're trying to use your face or they're trying to use your face to unlock your phone It doesn't lock after five tries So they'll have to enter your passcode so if you're trying to sneak up to somebody its sneakily unlock their iPhone It's not gonna work There's another thing that I'd recommend making sure that's turned on is attention aware features so you can click here And it will require attention for face ID so basically what that means is that your phone will recognize when you're looking at it So if somebody is trying to unlock your phone from the side using your face They won't be able to you need to be looking directly at it I'm sure a bunch of future apps will be using that so that you know that you're really using your phone so for example Safari If you're reading something sometimes the phone will dim because it thinks that you're not using it because of inactivity But you're actually looking right at it your phone will know that you're looking at it And it won't then your screen or turn off, but all in all after having it for three days It is a really amazing device, and I'm so happy with it, and I know I'm the biggest iPhone fan girl ever But if there was something wrong with this I have no problem telling you guys, but it really is just it's just awesome, and I'm so happy with it anyway Thank you guys so much for watching I have some more fun iPhone 10 videos coming out very very shortly, so I hope you guys are enjoying them If there's anything that you would like to see me try and test leave those in the comments below And if you're not subscribed already just hit the subscribe button and I will see you guys into the next video 
hey guys welcome to day one at CES I'm Justine and this is Jenna it's me Jenny we are heading to get our uber right now it's really riveting content CES vlog starting now we're looking for a Ford Explorer [Music] Wow hey give it a shot of the flog yeah I'm 40 even have them going the right way [Music] okay let's go to the first place that we're heading down that we're heading to the Mercedes booth that they have a press event right now and then after that we're gonna be heading to Samsung and then in between that I don't know what's gonna happen your guess is as good as mine we have 15 minutes to find where we need to be you guys have to see what Nick looks like right now if you shaved your head we just got out of the mercedes-benz press event a lot of you guys don't even know what car I Drive but I have a DLE 43 I've been a huge Mercedes fan pretty much my entire life my grandmother she drove a diesel Mercedes it was like a 1970 something that was my first car I feel like for me Mercedes has a huge place in my life this is an example of a new dashboard this is the MV UX which is the new interface for Mercedes I love that it's like this huge screen is basically taking over your dashboard they have all new updated graphics and one of the things that I love the most is it has natural intuitive language you can actually have a conversation with your ease [Music] okay we gotta find through two six zero zero two it's in the South Pole no but look at this this way to South Poles no there's an exit over here that takes us through hi how are you good thank you do you know what the South Hall is is it this way or is it this way is out that way as an added bonus this year's the yes there are torrential downpours it hasn't rained in 118 days in Las Vegas we're not even going that far South Hall correct okay thank you even the wrong way I'm laughing I'm laughing but I'm not laughing this is like my 70s you think I'd get a handle on the four hours later we finally made it to the GTI booth they announce two things here at CES the new Ronin s and the Oslo local two so first let's check out the rodent s [Music] single and healthy SLR type system it's so powerful that can carry all have your goalie camera setup present full turn until the indicator turns it yellow compromising okay a sport mode as if that's not one of my favorite features in any drone you've got it here this is incredible how does it work if we want to do a selfie blogging thing you're cool tap this trigger yeah it would instantly spin the camera around to do a selfie that's awesome so kind of just like dog food so this is awesome a local to you guys may have seen I've definitely talked about the one before but there are a bunch of differences between this mostly the price the original last mill was $2.99 this one wait for it 1:29 you can use it vertical you can use it horizontal and another thing that is pretty awesome hold on I have an active track right now so it's trying to track you so much like the original ASIMO give you triple tap it'll switch to selfie mode triple tap we're gonna go back right here on the side we have a zoom which is pretty awesome this is all happening real-time in the app there's also a little joystick right here where you can use that to navigate and you can always hit the trigger which is now right here as opposed to it used to be right here on the front the battery is built into this one and you can get about 15 hours of battery life and that'll take about two and half hours to charge I'm pretty sure up fifteen hours I can probably get a full day of logging [Music] this is something that we actually saw the other day and it was making headline news and people were really excited I've also ran into some people today that said this is so far one of their favorite things at CES this is the DJI copilot can you tell us a little more about it yes so lysse develop this before us it's called the DJI copilot Oracle it has a battery built-in so you don't need a PC essentially to take any data off it so what you do is any camera that you have any drone that you have you're capturing the data you're putting on the SD card you then take the SD card pop it into the new copilot drive so this has a little display on it - yeah so there's an e-ink display and so it's got a six-hour battery you can ingest the data through an SD port through USB C or the USB 3.0 jack and then all that data then you can manage through an iOS device it has a lightning cable you plug it into your iPad pro or your iPhone and then you'll be able to then bring that data over to your phone or device and then you'll be able to edit on the fly that's awesome would I be able to copy data from here to another hard drive you can if your device is running low like your your iPhone there you can actually use it as a battery pack oh my gosh this is incredible okay touch it like so you guys know how many of those the orange Lacey drives that I have I mean abundance but I feel like this is such an incredible solution especially for traveling on the go even like here at CES we've been shooting so much stuff it'd be great to have that as a backup so is there an internal hard drive in here already there is yes 2 terabytes care about the mechanical Drive I think it's a 7200 rpm we want to get that so you can hit yes and so just click it once and then now it's suggesting that's amazing look at this now their specific app that it uses there is an app coming not been officially released yeah so that'll be coming big when the ships in March wow you guys have a release date do it on March 20th that's my birthday I appreciate it I'll let you guys know I like about you to my birthday party just not really great fancy meal here at CES a play to meet some coffees some cookies this is living the dream okay just one bite I'm so happy I was really a good bite [Music] the new Samsung booth here it's a little bit different in previous years because they're not focusing on just one thing they're focusing on the connectivity and interaction of all of the things all together and it's really loud so I don't even know if you can hear me but let's just head in and see we can see this right here I think it's a highlight so far my CES this is the wall it's the new Samsung television that was announced here at CES its 8k 146 inch micro LED television and let me tell you what this thing is beautiful pretty sure this is something that I need in my life immediately can you imagine playing Mario Kart on this thing a dream come true one of the things that I like the same thing it's doing is they're kind of bringing all of these things that you may already have and bringing it into the Samsung ecosystem so they're basically connecting things that you already have that aren't necessarily Samsung and being able to connect them to everything this is like an exploration of my house right now this rear view mirror is not a mirror at all it's a display and there are cameras and sensors all around the vehicle to give you much more accurate depiction of what's happening around your car I'm a terrible driver this is something that I need in my life immediately I'm not talking to myself I promise I look so silly okay so we're here CES 2018 if you haven't been able to tell already and I've had some new friends here at CES and we're going to just go around this lovely little circle here and say what your favorite thing is that you've seen so far the wall really awesome ovaries will say Raisa has this massive mechanical keyboard is quite interesting did you see the razor phone that connects the laptop that looks amazing just mingi did you see it in action yeah really tell us about it oh no that's not my favorite thing okay okay what was your favorite thing DJI and Seagate whoa Laci we've done this whole is called the co-pilot and you don't need your laptop you just copy straight to my memory card school you can just take our game here in the Mayan area of the Samsung booth there is a lot going on there's a lot of food and there's a lot of tech those are basically two of my favorite things something that I thought was very very interesting is you can use bigsby take a picture of your food and will give your your calorie count now not only that it'll take you over here to you're connected refrigerator it'll show you the picture that you took from your phone will integrate into the fridge it'll show you the picture that you took and it will give you suggestions on things to cook for dinner say you're trying to reach a 2,000 gallery goal it'll give you examples of things that you should eat for the rest of the day to meet that goal something else that I saw was pretty incredible if you want to cook that meal you can preheat the oven using your refrigerator this is gonna elevate my cooking videos to some level it'll be a tech level but is the cooking gonna be good probably not so by me is the sampling family held refrigerator you guys have seen similar things to this before I've talked about it I think it's fantastic and my fridge does not look this immaculate you guys have seen inside of it and it's a mess so what's cool about this there's cameras on the inside as you can see them they're right here took out some celery and now the photo is updated to show you what is curly in the fridge takes about eight seconds so you should always know what's in your fridge so that's our Samsung booth tour here at CES 2018 let me know if you guys have a favorite thing what is something that you are most looking forward to that was announced here at CES or that you've seen at the sampling booth that's it I'll see you guys in some more CES videos time you'll see more cool stuff [Music] [Music] 
hey guys how's it going happy holidays I'm back here with my sister hello this is Jenna today we are drinking out of our star laboratories mugs I was watching the flash which I absolutely love season - dr. wells I'm only on season 2 so no spoilers but he was drinking out of one of these mugs and I was like oh I want to drink out of one of those - I was actually here did that happen she's like I want one of those - gets on the internet showed up she's like come on I ordered this cheers Cheers anyway we've got our mugs but today we're doing nothing that has to do with the flash or anything really why are we wearing festive sweaters what are we even doing today the holiday season and we're celebrating all of December it's vlogmas sort of I'm sort of longing every I've missed a lot of day I'm not sure oh the future maker what fortune oh okay so this is a fortune cookie maker and spoiler alert I've actually made these before I'm thinking Jordan made these ones but it wasn't even for a video it was actually just for fun to see if we could make them and now here we are jenna is gonna assist me because this process it's kind of crazy it was easy yeah we burned ourselves as so many times like it's kind of insane and it's really hard to do so I lied to you what'd you burn yourself is that in the instructions burn self you don't want to do it but you do can I make my own fortune yes costing fortune cookies there's an edible marker that this comes with I have to write the fortunes if there's not like a label maker I have so what I thought would be a cool ideas if you made these you could do little gifts for people you could put like a little gift certificate inside of it so like if you get somebody to Amazon gift card you can just like write the Amazon gift cold I think what if they don't open it believe baby song whatever the ink runs then they miss these four questions that are just too in-depth for what I feel like going into it let's open it okay here we go yay fortune fun what's this I'm just here I'm literally just here for the cookie I need a t-shirt that says I'm just here for the cookies dad does it mean what you think it means does it mean something else yes good lit in this kitchen look at this Wow Bam Bam Bam I mean you're in my water Bam Bam so this is the paper trash that is like edible paper I think it's a bit take a bite right yeah no it's not you can eat it but it's like after you prove to put you some edible paper I retract it I retract Achatz I reset it you must be the paper you track my statement okay cool good all of our little goodies we've gotten here that this comes with we've got a little slipper we've got an edible marker look here's a caution for us cookies are hot be careful handling cookies during the folding process so to make our fortune cookie recipe we're gonna need five tablespoons of unsalted butter 1 cup superfine sugar 1 pinch of salt 4 large egg whites 1 cup all-purpose flour 5 tablespoons of milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract non cooking spray know I'm cooking spray with non cooking spray nonstick we need no I'm cooking spray we need spray try to put this in the bowl no yet we have to melt this so get that melted up so can I put on the bowl no melt it put it up don't I don't put it in another bowl and melt the bowl is there a reason yes because yet because I have to put in the dry ingredients and I really have an answer for you I'm getting flustered forgot about the butter oh no super wet that's okay it needs to be melted very melted when combined egg white and sugar you dummy it was supposed to be egg whites I'm an absolute idiot I knew this as well well you said it and I did say it Chloe I like the small sugar I do not like to smell of burnt butter this is looking very nice yes yeah especially yeah we need five tablespoons of milk it might be expired how many nights at five five we need to mix in the vanilla vanilla nila how much shimmy shimmy cocoa purpose cleaner table teaspoon the first mix is the slowest touch that could you imagine if I just cut your hair no it's all I have going for me okay well we need it right out our fortune cookies am I making this for you we can or we can make it for whoever we want no I've got other edible markers in here it's like who doesn't have multiple other than markers okay this is gonna be for Nick he's behind the camera I'm gonna make one for him too okay well I think we have enough just to get us started that's a great that's a good one fold as directed you're not open the fortune cookie maker before the recommended cookie so don't open it before two minutes it is two minutes this smells really bad hey where the hell did they go Oh God oh my gosh that thing that's not supposed to happen oh my god oh god this wrench this looks really bad that's not right I just realized how completely worthless I am in this video it's cool I'm just like here and then I'm here and then I'm over here this is going not as well as it did before it could just be the first couple that needs to get that yeah we need to have to crack off with the true we gotta warm it up I think I should check on them you can okay okay okay this whole thing like that's not what's supposed to be happening holy moly oh gosh is it hot and then you just like pull it up like you're gonna make one out of my way you're gonna spray it in here no I might like make my own practice this is a practice this is horrible it's whoever thought this was gonna work out well oh wow yeah give me another hit of that oh yeah look I couldn't break it because it Oh work hard are we gonna fortune in it yes okay this looks it so far it's so hot it's so uncredible hot okay so about this ready nailed it hello-o burned into my finger oh god I can't get it out okay oh wow okay that wouldn't need a little more batter maybe this difficult slay do you want to melt off our chocolate I'm busy I just about an email half hour three minutes check on it every minute no see you have to put in the minutes first and then the power level I made a want on why I messed up my favorite thing is when you made a pumpkin pie oh my god oh oh my god who in the world was I told you is too much that's right so upsetting it's not ideal if a little me don't want is it hot I don't want to touch it oh it's so unbelievably hot okay here we go look at that did you see that perfection this is absolute fortune cookie perfection do you remember the simple instruction that I gave you also we have to check on the chocolates at every minute well I already missed two of the minutes I know put your hand I'll give you 10 bucks 10 $10 we think about it so even worth the hospital bill at that now that I've got this technique down is to Bari we okay well that looks good I'll put that in there I was cleaning I pushed the fortune cookie machine and I burned myself so bad like my finger is actually burning right like it hurts it doesn't you can't really tell my gosh hurts

ok [Music] [Music] 
hey guys how's it going today I'm doing something really really really exciting I know you guys have probably seen a million and a half iPhone videos at this point but guess what here's another one I just met this fine gentleman behind me hi my name is Dan Gilbert I'm a special effects makeup artist in Los Angeles California I can't even make this up I met him last night we did this really cool thing for another shoot I said what are you doing tomorrow can you please come over and destroy my face to see if face ID will recognize me as whatever it is that we're gonna do maybe we'll give you some prosthetic lip enhancements then maybe I don't know maybe had an accident he broke your nose can we end up looking like a zombie is a real question I think we absolutely can okay cool well let's get started so I think the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna see what it looks like if I get Botox in my lips here it is this is before and I'm gonna show you guys that I can unlock my phone are you read well it's already unlocked okay great that was a great demo turn it on unlock that's it and if you guys are wondering what that sound is that's the time-lapse so what's the first thing that's happening well I think we'll start with your lip injections it's gonna hurt only for like six or seven hours it's basically gonna stick down not like a sticker welcome back he was called a pro Z transfer of a prostate transfer a prosthetic transfer it's the walk look you really have to commit yeah literally our phone I don't know if you heard that she's been doing it for the oh you got some serious lives man oh God hello how's it going okay I'm just hurting you zombies I'm used to but plastics you didn't go to like the high end these are my lips now this is what I look like now we're gonna try to unlock the phone it unlocked so clearly if I wanted to get Botox and have this be my new look I could let's do it again for the camera ready unlocked did you see that just just let's get the shot unlocked uh what should we bust up your nails and maybe this is a nose job in common wrong okay here we go don't go on in now what's this this smells like glue tell us this a feat to work so what you're saying is I shouldn't ever put rubber cement on my face probably avoid okay it's that's not how we apply prosthetic makeup yep No okay that's too close I don't want to see it like I can see it in the reflection I'm terrified yeah cuz I don't know like I can't see anything so I don't know what's happening so everything feels very very dramatic like yes very intense that's my mom so potentially and nose I mean I might have just got a nose job like I feel like this is probably what it looks like after you get it done right yeah so I've got a broken nose I've got the lips I'm just trying to look the best that I can look will I fell in recognizing unlocked Oh God oh this look like so layer number two of fooling the phone have it fooled it yet this is pretty severe you look quite a bit different man everybody's enjoying their food and I know I want to just fully enjoy it but I'm just so nervous so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna drink my soup I can't how this is weird do you love mommy mmm-hmm it's so uncomfortable I just wanted to talk to the lips cause it feels so strange I can't even Olive this turn into an ASMR video so now we are getting like a side something yeah this would be a really swollen cheek okay what we're trying to do now is just sort of build up to see at what point does face I did not work I was chatting with that earlier and he was saying that face ID actually will learn your face which is kind of crazy because it is slowly learning my face every time i unlock my phone so we're worried that now once I take this all off that it's gonna forget what I look like oh wow this looks good we go to the bar after this name this is what I need of course we're going pretty fast on this so excuse my hedges and thanks guys but we would do this a little bit more detailed if we were doing it for a major motion picture this minor minor motion YouTube video [Music] while we're still a lot of guys we're still unlocking with this look [Music] [Music] okay so this is what I currently look like I mean we have I mean I don't think I look like myself anymore do I I'm looking at it I'm pressing the button it unlock yes this is not okay watch side like you get not straight up yeah but like I'm holding it low and still a lot how do you know it's me oh oh it's it feels like my skin but that's not my skin Oh guys if you've never felt this before it's freaking nuts this looks so real I don't that's in focus I mean everything about that that's so good I think spend a little more time if we're gonna do this for a major motion picture but it's for a mind emotion YouTube video major motion YouTube but right now we're just trying to unlock my phone yeah it's like all this just to see my phone will unlock but can you believe that have you ever done anything for such an insignificant reason but I think it's insignificant I've done worse things for less significance I'm in it okay so I'm kind of in shock that this is still working like my phone is unlocking with this look like it has now learned that this is my face so we're gonna try to intensify it and we're gonna go fools on the full song [Music] this is just regular old KY jelly and I put a drop of my product it's called mouth effect this is makeup for inside your mouth just seeing what you do some farming we stick your tongue out your head back ah all right now lick your teeth click the inside lips button the corners taste good I can't see her it looks like one tooth pressure do I need a new tooth loss it's so crazy very okay as you can see it is locked can you see it is a lot yeah how does it 11 o'clock meant my goodness but how is this recognizing me what does that mean does that mean that this is what I look like that's my guess yeah okay what's right again okay just like I'm looking at it I mean it's got into the eyes but see there's a video that we worked on that we can't talk about yet but what we did is we had like this crazy what was that it was like a hole that was a foam latex prosthetic brow piece that was real severe and it is still somehow recognized you even the bone structure was completely there like this is so good [Music] the final look is complete and I to bring this all to a conclusion the iPhone still recognizes me like I try I can unlock my phone just like this but now we got to take this off the removal process is it scary it's not scary okay you're scared huh yeah I guess so I can't see myself so it's like I don't even know [Music] [Music] so this is the real test I'm back to normal me as much as we can be normal man that was it was a process to get off but like it feels fine I feel good yeah we moose why go slow to save your face yeah well it's already unlocked I didn't I mean it's not even exciting it's like okay cool looking my phone oh it's unlocked that's it well that's it damn thanks so much for being in my video this was summer so awesome where can they find you you find me on instagram and e FX damn I'll put

hey guys how's it going this is gonna be a very quick video but this has been a very highly requested question that I get all the time not only do I get this question online but I get it in actual real life out in the wild that question is where did you get your backpack I'm using this backpack for almost a year now and I am obsessed with it now not only do I have this backpack but I have another one as well these two I have pretty much had in rotation over the past two years there by lounge fly this is not sponsored and actually bought me this one for my birthday last year and then shortly after I got this one because I loved this one so much this one has cartoon baby star wars characters on it and of course this one has a beautiful stormtrooper pattern on it I'm obsessed and I'm making this video mostly because people have been asking me so much where I get them one of the things that I've been struggling with for a very long time is trying to find the perfect mini backpack one that I can fit all of my items in it not be too big but not be too small this is the perfect size one thing that I do wish that it had it was some sort of a pocket inside because right now you've only got two pocket you've got this big one and then this small one and because I'm paranoid I don't like to put my wallet inside here because someone can easily just open that up if you're walking and take it right out so I like to have that hidden inside so if there was an inside zipper part that would be so incredible is that I wouldn't have to be paranoid I mean right now all someone's gonna steal this chapstick if they get in here so because I've been using these for the past year I wanted to see if they had any more and guess what they have so many this company I feel like has bought the rights to pretty much everything Marvel Pokemon if there's something that you're into they probably have it not only to give backpacks they have tiny little purses and clutches they have so many things it's kind of overwhelming but for me I'm a backpack fan and I gotta show you guys the two new ones that I just got oh well wasn't the best reveal ever what here they are this one specifically when I saw this I started freaking out this one has to be fairly new because I never saw it and I've been searching probably the past year just for something else that I liked as much as I like these two I really like this one this is the Darth Vader backpack because it's all black and it pretty much matches anything but unless I'm wearing Rebel Alliance gear I don't really think I'm gonna be mad as much because this color scheme is way easier to match I mean clearly if I'm wearing Star Wars backpacks that probably I'm not really that concerned with if things are matching or not but either way you guys are probably gonna see these and instagrams you're gonna see them on Twitter and now you know if someone Google's where to just even get her backpack this video will show up and I will have all the answers and all of the links in the description again not sponsored but honestly you guys have been asking so much and I feel like these are so perfect for all of you I love the new Pokemon one that they have it's black like this but it has a little pokeballs all over it I had to draw the line somewhere so I put these two and I feel like I'm set for quite a while so let me know what you guys think do you guys have a favorite I'm not really sure which one I like the best because I feel like all of these are so different it really depends on what my outfit is I wonder if they have a bb-8 one wait a minute is this a mini backpack they do have a bb-8 mini school backpack as well but I don't think it's as small as this one is though I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it you don't need it you don't need it well thank you guys so much for watching I will see you in my next video let me know what you guys think of these backpacks do you already have one do you have any of other lounge fly products if so let me know in the comments below and I'm so sorry if you're gonna go shopping now but don't worry it's worth it you [Music]

your like every one of those advent calendars like the path Alba Christmas but this is like the countdown to my Christmas and that's iPhone announcement they have an announcement to make and I'm not sure how to make this announcement without freaking out [Music] usually when packing the best advice is to pack the largest things first I didn't in here do my own advice first person that I ran into what I stepped up to the theater was Steve Wozniak and you know it's one of those things like when you meet your heroes we don't know what to say I didn't know what to say but I said thank you thank you for everything and then he walked away here it is the iPhone 10 it was officially announced today and I've got it the white version and there's also a space free version and this thing is absolutely [Music] I was trying to stop it look at this I am crying in my own paper with my face I'll make my eyes big I kind of look like in the Moriya brothers movie the goombas I just take like a normal picture oh my god all the effects are still on don't want large eyes I want mine they seem to be the same size so okay good to know this is someone who is genuinely enthusiastic about iPhones and everything is bigger if I'm kind of just eyeballing this I mean you can sort of very vaguely tell that it's slightly more raised oh this matches my knife so right here is the little eject button when you press this it prepares your device before come here for tablet mode what apps cannot live without No clickbait hello only clickbait if it's not true starting off here from the top I've got my calendar which one looks the most like us where's the boating thing I'm uniting down that does not look like pumpkin to shut up what do you think it it is encrusted on top you guys I have ever had we're like just did you make apple pie but I completely messed this up from the beginning I was wondering what the plan was I've never seen it done that I've never even maybe you're onto something hence the name Platinum hello baby [Music] the only thing that would make me happier as if I could eat this cookie while playing cookie GM while my cookie is in the game I feel like that's some crazy inception nonsense doc right on and back to the future this is so bright so I'm definitely gonna mess around with this because I feel like this isn't the ideal setup I don't like where this microphone placement is you think I could make it no no no this you didn't even hit the backboard it is Super Mario cereal it's just like Lucky Charms yes sir it was a one-person job I don't know how much I was like yes I'm very excited we are alive like very soon as I'm kind of scared things just got so crazy from the simple maybe it was a long way down I just feel a thing behind the city reason [Music]

large range of emotions right now these are my youtuber gingerbread cookies and what's great is as a youtuber I feel like we've got a great community and here we are all unified hi around the tree

Hey guys, how's it going it's Justine and today, I'm hanging out with my friend Ro, Ro: hello, and this is a very very interesting video. You know This is one of those things ( Ro Laughing in the background) We're in the comments below you guys are gonna be saying you guys have run out of ideas! Do you not have any video ideas!?! and the answer is actually I didn't have any and this was the best that I could come up with but Ro: Justine isat the store, and she's so creative and she's going through the store aisles if you text again What about this idea and I was like yes I show up to Ro's house with 4 potatoes, some Barbie dolls, a stapler and some lipstick. She's like wait I've got a way to elevate this idea wait. I didn't tell me idea yet. Ro: Oh, oh oh ok what what are we doing? Ro: What are we doing today? We are going to carve each other's faces into potatoes and the best resemblance of each other Wins and you guys are gonna be the judge of who wins because we won't be able to we won't we're both such artists Yes, so we won't be able to tell I will have to put one of the YouTube polls So you guys can vote on who you think is the best so this is going to be very very very exciting and the winner Will not get baked in the microwave So, what do you got over here all right? So I have some fondant tools that I thought would be helpful when sculpting a potato and I also got some clay Sculpting tools. This is taking it to an entirely other level. I mean I was just picturing stabbing some eyes I also got edible googly eyes We have large and small have some chalk if we want to draw stuff on us pipe cleaners Fuzzy balls gems hot glue guns, so we can really get creative with these potatoes I look down check my email in two seconds later Ro has bought an entire craft store it had this table well I guess we should get started. I mean, which one do you think would look most like me okay? Well, let me pull them up. We got a friend one. That's most like your face now when you take those quizzes online What do they say the shape of your faces? No there's like around the square or heart an oval I think I'm a moon face That I don't even know what I am like when you see a moon and see it cheesin I just think mine's a circle isn't it or is it a square? Not a square. Let me look at you Lucy which I feel like this is little it's a little tater. It's maybe that's me yeah This isn't to be you know this is lopsided. Just steam so this is not you not you This is more you it needs to be rounder. This one's real lumpy hmm, but it's nice and round Yeah, what do you think we can also gonna go with this one this one's the most cuz you have very symmetrical face That's so I think this is your potato this is you this is you because it's little cute And we have another potato which we can use and cut up and add to our other potato so this is Really, I don't know what's gonna happen at all. I don't know how to sculpt I don't need something I'm sorry I can barely even whenever you're presented with a pumpkin and then like carve this pumpkin I'm like have see those competitions online where it's like long carving competitions I'll carve you yeah, they take like a stump like a log and they And they do art I mean, it's it's really impressive, and I'm wondering can you do that with a potato? Do you think people do that actually let's look at potato Carbon? Ya

hey Siri I'm home palm sweet home this is home pot with an a8 chip six microphone arrays high excursion woofer seven tweeter array home pod is more than just a speaker Siri to have any new messages you have a new message from post mates hey it's post mates I'm on the way with your food would you like to reply yes what do you want to say thanks can't wait for my meal your reply to post mate says things can't wait for my meal ready to send it yes I'll send your message hey Siri turn on my teapot okay this thing is so fast it's actually shocking hey Siri turn off my teapot okay she'll not only read write and send your messages but she can control your entire home from lighting security garage doors thermostats even outlets basically anything but as home can enabled well the teapots pretty cool but one of the things that Apple is most known for is revolutionising music the way that we buy it the way that we listen to it the way to be experience it and they're doing it here again with a home pod you guys might remember back in January of 2001 at Macworld is when they first introduced iTunes we're gonna change all this today with something we call iTunes and then a few months later they introduced and we were introducing a product today it takes us exactly there and that product is called iPod iMac iBook iPod hold on wait a minute dramatic reveal this this is the original iPod and this was released hey Siri how long ago was October 23rd 2001 it was 16 years ago 16 years ago it's actually kind of crazy to just hear her say that I mean I knew how long ago it was but to really just hear her say that that really reiterated the fact that I'm getting hold this is the home pod my sweet boy would you like it oh this is our theme song honey you can also control home pod with touch one tap to pause double tap to play the next track and triple tap to play the previous track instead of saying hey Siri you can just press and hold to activate her and you can adjust the volume by pressing the plus or the minus or they say hey Siri turn the volume all the way up that's very loud are you sure yes I'm all about that yes but what's crazy is there's a six or a microphone surrounding this entire home pod so this thing can hear me from very far distances hey Siri do you love me do you love me would you like me to search the web or what I was skeptical when they first announced the home pod but now after using it and experiencing it it's pretty amazing if it's placed in the middle of an open room it'll give consistent 360 audio throughout so no matter where you are in the room it'll have the same perfect sound the microphones listen to the reflection of the sound off of the surrounding surfaces so even if it's next to a wall it'll adjust appropriately for its new environment to make sure you're getting the best sound quality possible I really want to demo this for you guys so you can actually hear it but it's gonna be really difficult because you can't hear what I'm hearing in real life you guys are on headphones you're on your computers but I'm gonna do my best to give you a little demonstration just know that this thing sounds amazing hey Siri play me some Lindsey Stirling sure here's a personalized station of Lindsey Stirling my friend this is my friend she's on my home pod right now hey Siri who's the song bye this is Lindsey Stirling with the track Mirror house hey Siri text Lindsey Stirling and tell her that I love her your message to Lindsey Stirling says I love her ready to send it no I think Lindsay might have been a little bit confused getting a message for me that says I love her anyway hey Siri play me some imagine dragons alright let's hear imagine dragons hey Siri play another song with this album playing believer by imagine dragging off of this one hey Siri skip forward thirty Seconds hey Siri I forgot what I wanted to tell you hey Siri who's the drummer of imagine dragons Dan Reynolds and Daniel Platts Minh played drums and imagine dragons my mech Pro just arrived while we were shooting this video and we captured it all on film and I actually started crying oh my god I've been waiting a really long time for this okay I'm just gonna I'm just gonna push it in look are you able to focus on these years I'm not this good of an actress this is real emotion oh my gosh I can't believe it it's here early look hey Siri a place of music for doing yoga hey Siri find me a yoga studio in Sherman Oaks one option is core power yoga about seven point eight miles to your north as the crow flies on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles which averages four and a half stars according to Yelp hey Siri is there any traffic to Sherman Oaks right now traffic to Sherman Oaks Los Angeles is light so I'm estimating 22 minutes by 405 North hey Siri add to my really good video ideas list to make a home pod cake okay I added video ideas list to make a home pocket to the reminders hey Siri let's go play some video games okay let's see your video games by Lana Del Rey huh not exactly what I said but okay [Music] hey Siri turn on my lights hey Siri text my sister and ask her why she's not playing call of duty with me right now okay I'm slurring my speech I apologize I'm getting real amped about this game hey Siri stop playing so one of the things that I do like about the home pod is you can actually use it as speakerphone so I'm gonna call my sister because she's clearly ignoring my text messages right now which is very upsetting hold on Jenna hello hello hi it's you Jenna II hey do you want to hop on call of duty why are you ignoring my text messages alright well I guess I'm gonna go back to playing then it's not only I'm able to airplay my speaker phone calls but I can also airplay from Apple TV so my Apple TV's up there I get airplay what I'm watching here to the home pot now it's not available yet but you will later this year with a software update be able to get to home pods and use them in stereo depending upon what voice you have set for your Siri home pod we'll take on that voice for example here's the Australian male is the podcast what does this all mean also not available at launch but really cool with airplay to you'll be able to put a home pod pretty much in any room any corner of the house and you can control her by rooms so for example we're upstairs hey Siri play heavy metal upstairs now playing metal radio hey serious stop playing and if you have one in the kitchen you can tell it'll play 90s rock in the kitchen or played something else in the living room but you can also sync them all up and play one single thing throughout the whole house play some Slayer all right that's your Slayer please be ready hey Siri turn the volume to 20% look she can still hear me over her loudness hey Siri play raining blood yes you guys might not know but I listen to heavy metal a lot in high school hey Siri when was the song released granny blood by Slayer came out on October 7th 1986 1986 okay I was most two so I wasn't listen you just play her when I was 2 hey Siri stop playing how got such a hit well thank you guys so much for watching I have so far been enjoying the home pod a lot more than I really thought I was going to I have ordered a few more so I will give you guys a full update maybe you know you know how I roll a week with home pod video I'm gonna keep playing some Call of Duty and I will see you guys later I also did an unboxing video so if you want to check that out I'll put a link in the description and an end card here and if that's that same with the video I will see you guys on the battlefield [Music] [Music] [Music] they attend his lectures upside down oh no it's okay it's not a big deal bake a home pod cake if you have one in the kitchen you can say play jazz in the kitchen or I don't like jazz what am I talking about it's not that I don't like jazz if you like jazz that's just not something I listen to or maybe I should start oh my god sir how many days is 5,400 didn't so I forgot what you said already so days ago oh she just told me what I really couldn't say hmm you know what me either could say hey Siri let's get the sparked I started good right now why am I on why bro can you pick up a cake tomorrow now it was for the video it's okay alright bye she's never sure if like I'm actually filming a video or if it's a real life question anyway [Music] 
hey guys how's it going it's Justine and today we are gonna be talking about how to make the GoPro audio not suck now this one specifically is covering the GoPro Hero 5 and the hero 6 I recently did an unboxing of the 6 and I've been doing some camera comparisons over the past couple of weeks the one thing that is the biggest complaint from me and pretty much anyone who has a GoPro is how awful the audio is side by side each should be fairly the same quality our GoPros are now filming each other now GoPros are great for what they are if you have perfect lighting especially bright outdoor lighting you're gonna get some really incredible shots and they've been dominating that action sports market for pretty much as long as I can remember but the biggest complaint that I have ever since my first GoPro the audio is terrible and I never realized how bad the GoPro audio is until recently when I tested out the sony RX z row and it may be a little bit unfair to even compare it to the RX 0 because the sensor that is in the RX ear it was the same that is the art 100 mark 5 [Music] we are zero outside right now it's actually pretty dark out there's a little bit of light up above me from these flood spotlights here but the lighting looks pretty great I'm mostly curious to see what the audio sounds like in comparison to the rx100 so here rx100 we're testing out the audio to see what it sounds like and now here is the RX zero audio I'm not sure what's gonna be it's gonna be better but all of that aside the rx0 is waterproof already the audio on the arc zero was so good that my mind was blown and I couldn't believe it in any small little tiny compact camera the biggest complaint is the audio so because I'm still trying to make this GoPro relationship work yeah just keep trying I just keep putting more effort into it and this is where we're currently at do you see what I have done to this GoPro to try to make it work I've looked at so many different solutions on Amazon and this seems to be the best setup that I could come up with but there are so many different issues that I was running into but first of all let's dissect this and let me show you what we've got going on here the number one problem is I couldn't find a nice housing that had a little shoe attachment right here I needed a microphone that was high enough because this is so wide angle I didn't want the microphone to be in the shot looks high enough to me one of my favorite microphones is the rode microphone it's the road goal mic let me grab it this one wouldn't work because these little furry hairs are so low that this is definitely in the shot I also wanted one where I can adjust the decibels which this one has just kind of absurd because do I really need that this is crazy the other issue is where are you gonna plug this into thanks GoPro why didn't you just make an audio no of course that would make things way too easy instead this is what they sell you another 50 $60 attachment it's USB see which then plugs into here it is so heavy this is absolutely insane this isn't this is unacceptable to be honest with you and yet here I am trying yeah this is a good idea GoPro no actually I'm mad now I'm mad making this video this was supposed to be a nice little helpful tip to help you guys get better GoPro audio and now I'm just mad anyway moving on you need this and I was also reading reviews that you can't use any other third-party ones that you have to use the GoPro one I have not tested out any third-party ones so I cannot say from firsthand use that they do not work but from some of the reviews that I have seen and read a lot of people are saying that they don't work this one didn't work right away so I had to do the firmware update and then I ran into firmware updates while I was updating me here six you know Mike's just sitting here like man what have I done why do I care at some point you gotta let it go you gotta say let it go let it go I can't have this copra anymore the one thing of all of us is this case is actually really cool this little shoe is removable so you can take this off with a screwdriver you can put it on the side if you want to put the microphone there or a light or whatever it is that you're attaching to this each piece came separate this tripod actually it was from the Samsung 360 camera the first edition is actually very perfect for this scenario this bottom part oh I think I cracked this tripod mount huh always something guys it's at least something this little tripod mount isn't a gopro tripod mount it's from Amazon basics but it works really really well now I'm giving this GoPro a hard time but after this whole set up it cost me about 200 extra dollars to try to make this thing sound good because I'm asking myself is this worth it because when am i realistically going to carry this around like this and now I've completely made it not waterproof because I had to take a side door off of it just access said port anyway this USBC adapter allows you to have a mic input there you go I'm loving it loving it so to make sure that you have the proper settings I would definitely recommend testing out some different scenarios so when you go into the audio input there's a powered mic there's a power bike plus so depending upon if you have a microphone that power to self or if you have one that powers through the 3.5 millimeter jack then you're gonna need to make sure that that proper selection is selected and let's see the difference between having a microphone and not having one hey guys it's Justine how's it going all right we're testing this out now what do you guys think what does it sound like oh boy so this is what it sounds like with the microphone attachment on I'm still questioning why I've done what I've done but I really wanted to just you know try to make it work and here we are and now let's test it out without using the microphone and here's what it sounds like using the onboard hero 6 microphone it basically it feel like sounds very similar to the 5 I really couldn't hear much difference when I was doing a comparison between the 5 and a 6 but the one thing that I did like about the 6 is the image stabilization when I was walking with this thing I was actually quite blown away at how stable it was that is the one factor that really made me absolutely love this thing so all things considered I know I've been given GoPro a hard time but I do really like GoPro and I keep saying this but it just makes me so upset because they really could have such a great camera if the audio was a little bit better and then I know people were like well I'm outside doing action sports I don't need audio but yeah what about the rest of us who are not doing crazy action sports this could be a much more widely marketed camera for everyone I took the GoPro Plus the microphone outside to see what it sounds like in an outdoor condition and we're here at the beach so there's a lot of wind actually right now as you can tell with my hair so let's see how this microphone handles the wind [Applause] now I'm testing out beagle pro audio just on the GoPro the microphone is not attached here's the cable that it should be attached to there's a big difference I already know I don't even hear it and I already know I'm still trying to make the GoPro work Jen I know I'm up on the dream the dream give it up okay but later this is beautiful really I just wanted to show you what I managed to do to try to make this work and I was really impressed with how good the audio actually did sound after I got everything all hooked up and working so this is the microphone that I got it's just a basic stereo microphone I got this on Amazon I will put a link in the description I feel like I probably could have gotten a much smaller one but my concern was if it wasn't high enough it's still gonna be in the shot so this seemed to do the trick I feel like it's a little bit too big maybe a little bit lower it looks crazy I just wish this would stay still I mean there's a lot of things that I just wish it would do and it doesn't well thank you guys for watching hope you guys sort of enjoyed this video if you didn't I'm so sorry I just I don't know I have so many feelings about GoPro and I guess I just have such high hopes and then I hear horror stories of them stealing like people's content and they're not giving them credit and it's like why would you do that you guys are so cool you don't have to do that just be nice hopefully this was helpful if you were trying to find out how to make your GoPro audio not suck and if you weren't looking for that then thanks for watching until the end anyway we'll see you guys my next video bye bye [Music] 
hey guys how's it going I am so excited cuz I've got a special guest who she's gotta sneak around to this little area that I shoot in it looks a lot bigger on camera okay I did not expect for it to be this tight what's up guys oh my gosh see I never shoot with an external monitor do you look so now I'm like oh did you look at it don't look at it don't you can't no keg I know I'm looking at well this is Sarah DG rhymes with PG and today we are gonna be I was gonna say unboxing but it's got an envelope on enveloping yeah it's something like that what do I biggest complaint from the new Apple watch it has a red dot I completely agree with you I did when I saw that I was like okay this is a good differentiator to show up to your friends and you got the LTE version but it's been interesting because a lot of people have said oh you have the new one which basically this is what it looks like when I tweeted about not liking the red color you guys sent me this as a suggestion it's called cheilitis watchdogs that's exactly I don't really like the black but guess what I have you can have wait first we discussed the fact that now you have converted one side so I've gotten that 38 from from the gang I told you guys which Apple watch I ended up with and it is at the 38 white it I was actually touched since I was likes me by the way what size watch do you have because I was curious yeah I was like oh my gosh I did not realize that the 42 was too big I mean it took up my entire wrist and like it would did not fit at all and I didn't even know it so I've been doing that for like two years sure you go so we do it here let's show that first but it would be cool to just have solid white it really would actually I'm pretty sure I ordered solid white so we'll see I don't even remember I ordered the Salonika look at this unboxing it they have a special gifts cool so apparently what I did originally order was for this for this so they included free ones to cover up the red which is what I wanted wait is that there I guess the job nigger I don't know there you go look at that okay that looks clean once for the power button -

a street fighter - Castlevania oh my gosh well here it is Mario Kart baby so this is kind of cool because you can add a CRT filter you can play it regular four by three or pixel-perfect which i think is how we're gonna play it look at this you could pick different frames oh this is cool okay let's see which one are we gonna pick a place Mario Kart this is beautiful 1992 should I play 50 cc I guess sure why not I'm having flashbacks this is so insane started from the bottom now we're here oh like oh holy crap the controls this is insane this is nuts oh my gosh I'm trash I'm trying to I'm trying to power slide but clearly power sliding is not the way that used to be [Music] power-sliding is very different is not working I need to I need to get my bearings if you guys better played Mario Kart before you know the way that you power slide well it's not how you don't do it here there's no it's just one single power side it's not that the boost oh my god this is Sol I am freaking out I'm doing such a bad job I mean I might be first place but like it's embarrassing what I'm driving I was swerving all over this course so when you power slide in some of the newer games you can do like multiple bursts so with those multiple bursts you're able to get power-ups so I'm trying to do that but that is not a thing here in this Mario Kart let's see if I'm a little bit better on this one I cannot get the hang of it [Music] it's so weird I'm doing so bad first place is not deserved of this performance yeah definitely whoops now I'm a little teeny-tiny mushroom [Music] yeah might as well knock him out he's not my competition like these are mobile games now if this is something you'd be playing on your phone like back in my day this was a revolutionary game oh yeah we're getting the hang of it now don't know I hit [Music] if I hate that stupid mushroom one more time how many freakin mushrooms do you have this is okay come on now you can't realistically have that many that's absurd chef like 150 I mean I'm not doing well clearly the skills that I'm displaying here are quite embarrassing we let's go let's go princess get off of my tail yeah this turn is always such a struggle [Music] I'm focusing now I'm trying to play trying to play my best best that I can be here in Mario Kart I can't believe what trash I was those first two rounds like I really it took me a good while to get the hang of these controls again and then because the new controls now it like everything is so different I can't wait to play this with my friends like it's gonna be so much fun [Music] a coin a lot I can barely focus on this screen the graphics are like seriously hurting my eyes all right give me my trophy okay I need the race the best of my abilities here we're gonna take these turns like freaking champions that we are and we're gonna get this trophy and bring home the gold [Music] stupid powers live and it's not happening Bowser yeah on my way get out of my way get out of the way no everything is not awesome like these races feel so sure it's insane [Music] [Music] I am champion me my trophic you my trophy you my trophy oh my god pop some champagne [Music] flashbacks thank you guys so much for watching hope you guys enjoyed this unboxing and a little bit of gameplay huge thank you to Nintendo for sending me this early to check out I am so excited because I feel like the Super Nintendo was what kind of crafted my adulthood love of gaming the NES is what got me hooked but I feel like I was kind of a little bit too young to really appreciate it by the time the Super Nintendo came out I was a little bit older and I also remember switching games with my friends so was one of those things where we would coordinate what game are you gonna get I will get the other one so that when you're done playing that one I can then switch and train and then we can all play all of the games anyway thanks again for watching and I will see you guys in my next video and that's it I have got nothing else to say except a slow-mo montage [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

(Christmas music playing) Happy vlogmas So right now it is 7:54 am December 1st Welcome to Vlogmas This is not a promise that I'm going to vlogging every day But this is the promise that I would try my almost best to post a video almost every day in December Vlogging every day but trying to make high-quality videos It's not an easy task. So I am not planning on killing myself to try to YouTube guys videos every day while trying to live my life But what I will be doing is I already filmed a bunch of really fun Christmas videos similarly fun collabs And today will really respond my Vlogmas videos Because of this It's the STAR WARS advent calendar!! My friend Ro gave me this present. I'm sweared to you, probably like, it feels like two months ago. She's like it gotta open this on December 1st. Say basically had my calendar December 1st open Ro's present BB-8 is freaking sliding down a snow bank And this snow is being pumped by a storm tuber on like the snow blow like she's everything about this box. It's just perfect. Oh, boy!! I'm also got my STAR WARS pajama pants that my mom got me like last year for Christmas Man, STAR WARS, I'm so height to the new movie, like, I absolutely cannot wait And I'm also just gonna apologize 'cause I'm kind just still so sleeping I have a little slap much this month at all, well, last month 'Cause it's December!! It's not like Vlogmas But... it's, whatever, I'm doing... I don't know. Welcome my channel. Let's open this up Oh my gosh it's so pumped, is so pumped Oh, shoot! I did a wrong! I just opened up a whole, an entire thing and not to suppose to do that I gotta close this backup. If you guys have this, and is this spoiler? Stop watching now, and skip to... a few minutes later. And technically the time is spoiler because a whole of... what is on here is inside of you here There's a little face I am so hyped for Christmas!! ♪ have a holly jolly Christmas ♪ ♪ It's the best time of the ♪ So I got some mini figures Here's all setup. We gotta put him... I don't know. Putting by the presents. Well, this setup over here, in my kitchen office Wait a minute. I am so confused right now because after father inspection of this set, clearly these numbers are out of ordering even think that I would be something that I would be noticed when I first opened it up, but I did not. So clearly, Oh my gosh, I mean I don't it makes this sense. Why of the all the out of order? I don't understand. But leave the way. That means now I get to open two today because I actually open up 10 and the 1 is still... now open. Wow! Oh no How do I put together? Okay, alright. Well. now everything that I thought that was new is lie. So guess now I've two days now open my calendar So really this is just a quick little vlog, just say hello and welcome to December It's kind of crazy because this is entire year just flow by so quickly. Editing an entire video, this is gonna take me probably like 4 hours to make this video is gonna's like I wanna 2. So that's what I decided to make a quick vlog, just to say hi and a lot of you guys have been missing my vlogs and I apologize. and it's been kind of hard to disorder do everything that I wanna do Well, also trying to vlog Now we're back here my office Let's have a quick check Hi!! So a lot of saying going on We've been filming 800 Christmas videos and tons of collab videos But then most I proud of editing all videos, probably I like 15 or 16 videos I edit. I like get super overwhelming And said I, "Wow, unbelieving!" that I posting my 'Who am I?' video that's gonna be first of my vlog in December And I looked at the timeline and I realized I probably had another 7-10 hours editing to do on it As a quick preview, this is my current timeline And that brings set about 5 minutes and it feels like y-vlog which is probably bounce of about 40 minutes. And I'm editing out something, but I've locationed with my family. It was so much fun But during the vacation, the Mario Odyssey came out, so instead of vlogging or vlogging and editing, while all of the trip All I did was hanging out Family, it was about that, but I was playing Mario Odyssey. Goddam look at the game! look at it, absolutely is fantastic So if you guys haven't played it and if you get holiday wishlist,  great choice! This is what I guessed the more  destroyed was is was the easier to film and an entire new vlog. And the setup is going tons edit to finish this one There was more posting if you guys to realize that's gonna probably take me at least 4 hours So I don't figure out managing bunch of many people you guys suppose to be today I just woke up I just gonna talk to you guys for happening And here we are. I should show you everyone. It's very very nice. My friend Susie got me this. She knows me. I need some ChapStick. Is there any here? SD cards It better me here Hair crips. Steve Jobs mini figure. Benny. Me. More hair crips. Philip small. I need CahpStick! Oh yeah that's great. That's a lot. So, in a few videos, you guys are super sneakey Because you pick out the small details Think that I'm like, "Oh, they will ever notice it. A few videos, the pumpkin pie video in particular, and spilling unboxing with Ro I posted those after I got the iPhone X, we shut and before I had the iPhone X So, you little detectives you all of the comments I knew this gonna happen to Well like, "Man, yeah. Maybe they noticed." There's no way I gonna see. You guys see everything. It's actually insane. There's no editing video then before as I'm filming this, I totally as this listen. I can't have filmed this video because I know every single comment when I post this video (Your comment) is going to be "Why not using iPhone X?" or... They plan so far had advance for videos. Also like, "Man, iPhone 11 might be about time post this video." I've been loving the phone so much. If you haven't been updating videos in... I don't know, like few weeks, just kind like crazy. I know, I know I was planning on doing a week iPhone, two week iPhone, three week iPhone. Most like a joke, maybe I still should do that, I'm not sure. Either way, it's been really great. I had very very minimal problems. And the problems that I have had sound like my own fault because that drive me crazy. It's the middle of the night. I reach over to get my phone. And a half of my face isn't scanned by the pillow and tried to unlock it. It does not unlock. And then I'm trying to type my passcode. So I not instant definitely do miss having the home button and being able to use  touch ID. Before the most part, I think it's great. I did similarly iPhone videos that we get dropped test detected the 21 cases. That was so much fun. But I was so afraid because the drops redoing again, pretty intense that I have to do over and over again. So there're I have to say about the iPhone dropped test which was very excited about because they said me the space gray one and I have this over This is exciting. I thought to get have both phones for like, well, the real course of a day of my iPhone those. They're all small, if you should kind like have a space gray, it reminds me a jet black phone that we have previously. I'm so happy with my decision to take this over. I love that has stenless too the around the edge, it reminds me the first original iPhone, so there's... that a little bit throw back. Man, it's a just really great device. Now look at the recording itself. Let's get There're a bunch of renders of the iPhone SE each you and this looks really really good, like you guys check this out. So it's a full screen of the iPhone SE. I mean gut is the people who get iPhone SE, I feel like it's getting because it has the cost of effective. But to put in a full screen and to put in all of the future iPhones does make that work? That's gonna at least cost significantly, so I feel like a kind of the SD cards the purpose having the SE phone, I'm not sure, I don't know. This is not an apple video. This is just me, my having a chat with my friends, you guys being my friends. And I do apologize. I'm actually, really really tired today. Anyway, I work for to you all of the videos that I have coming up this month, so I hope you guys will enjoy them. And I hope you'll have a holly jolly Christmas! I've been singing that song probably for two months because I was trying to film the Christmas videos I feel like back in October. So at this point, for me, I think my Christmas has already, already ended. Well, see you guys my next video. I will be definitely posting a bunch tomorrow, so make sure you come back. Be sure to subscribe, if you are new or subscribe already, and of course I have to tell you the hit bell because I don't think the subscriptions really work. I'm not sure.

hey guys how's it going it's Justine and today we are unboxing the sony RX zero I've been talking about this camera for quite a while Sony gave me a couple of them to test out while I was in Hawaii on vacation because we're in Hawaii these weren't out yet but they are now officially out mine finally came in the mail and I'm so excited because this thing is awesome my current favorite point-and-shoot vlogging camera is the Sony rx100 Mark v I've been using this camera for the past couple of years the rx0 is basically the rx100 mark 5 but fun-sized mini sized GoPro size whatever you want to call it it's tiny the real difference between the semi rx100 mark 5 is that this one will not shoot in 4k it will shoot in 4k if you record externally but I feel like for most of us we're not going to be bothering to do that but the audio on this is great it still has high frame rate most importantly it's waterproof you guys may have heard me making references to the RX 0 and a bunch of my GoPro videos because one of my biggest complaints about GoPro is the audio is trash it is absolutely terrible and I feel like that would be something very simple for GoPro to fix but I'm not sure why they don't do it it upsets me but it's ok clearly I'm over it so let's try on boxing this rh0 I cannot wait to show it to you guys I've been waiting for this unboxing for so long well that's it there's the whole unboxing this looks like a little something got our sony charger it just charges through a micro USB we've got our battery and unfortunately this battery is not the same as the rx100 mark 5 which I was really hoping that it would be it is much much slimmer in case you're wondering and you wanted to get an extra one it is the NP v j/1 it's a little cute little guy got a wrist strap which is very important because this thing is so small if you hear out there vlogging and using this you could easily just misplace it well it's so awesome it has a decent weight to it it feels a little bit heavier than a GoPro but there's so much packed into this little bag here is our beautiful this is ice lens here's the little door right here which houses micro SD card has a little microphone jack micro USB for charging and transfer and an HDMI port and here's your menu system this is where you put your battery in and this is very exciting there's a tripod mount already built into it pop this battery in make sure you guys don't lose this little backside because it does kind of pop up very easily and another thing to note is the SD card when you put it into here it actually seems to fit both ways so you may want to double check whenever you're inserting a SD card that it's going in the correct way there is a little notation that'll show you how to put it in the menu system is like a very very micro version of the rx100 and salsa very familiar if you've used any of Sony's interfaces before it was a little confusing at first but once you master it it's super easy and it's very intuitive let's see if we can power this thing up hopefully we have some battery and yes we do like I said it is so small like the menu system is just incredibly tiny it's very very similar to what you're used to on Sony 60 frames at 50 30 at 50 24 50 120 at 50 so it's kind of crazy that this little guy can still do 120 frames a second and here's our high frame rate settings you can shoot up to 960 frames a second which is pretty insane coming from this tiny tiny little camera well now that you've seen the unboxing I'm sure you probably want to see some test footage so let's go back to Hawaii where I was hits of Kosh it's probably like a month ago at this point and check out some of my underwater footage we went shark diving [Music] there's the shark-cage and we'll be in there very very shortly I'm kind of scared okay so are you happy now things just got so crazy from the simple maybe it wasn't wait enough to almost make me still [Music] flushing up like this I met you [Music] like you guys so much for watching hope you guys enjoyed this quick little unboxing and some footage from the rx0 this thing is awesome I absolutely love it and I think one of my favorite features really is how small it is but also the audio is incredible one of most difficult things I feel like in a lot of small action cameras is the audio sucks and this audio is almost identical to the rx100 which is amazing granted it doesn't do 4k I'm still very very impressed with this camera and this is definitely something that I will carry around with me quite frequently when I'm vlogging I'll also put a link in the description where you can get more information about this camera right here and I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music] 
hey guys also gets Justine welcome back to my kitchen I'm so excited because today we are continuing with the Halloween theme and today we are making wait for it are you ready alright murder muffins first things first we're gonna make the murder muffins they are gonna be like a red velvet cream cheese something or other I'm not really sure I found a nice recipe online I looked up murder muffins and weird there wasn't anything let's get all of our ingredients out and start blending this and making it because the muffin texture is definitely not blender friendly everything I tried I tried the prep it all 1 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour the purpose is for all one done with flour 3/4 cup sugar put a little more baking powder and salt I think I mess something up already like I just freakin started - oh shoot that's not accurate alright we're gonna whisk this together it not with a whisk Wow then whisk in the butter milk cocoa and food coloring oil in a separate bowl I don't have buttermilk either that matter it's on the menu I've been recipe it's on the recipe that's expired I'm just gonna use regular milk don't tell anybody that's a very small bowl I think I probably should get a bigger one but I'm not going to oh no I need a cream cheese and it's not softened Coco get away from me you freaking fly make me very upset I live in a barn we created be really good just have a horse in here like that all right we could read it probably for like a dinner box get away from my meal here don't like he's so loud that in here okay food coloring oil and egg that's just very little that's a lot actually Oh get away from me fly you're ruining my meal don't talk at all oh my god he just went in the sticks I'm my body's not working half cup oil these are measuring cups for people who really can't measure because it legit has every single possible measurement let's whisk this up let's get good [Music] now I gotta mix this wet in with the dry look at that promise you I will treat you all right so I'm supposed to beat the cream cheese in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar in a small bowl I did not save the sugar I guess just dump a little sugar in here like why is it doesn't even matter no it doesn't it doesn't this is clearly not a very health conscious meal or a snack we need 4 ounces of this which i think is probably like this much I don't know half fold this cream cheese mixture into this cake folding not into that I hate baking I hate baking like I like it like I hate it I love it it's a love-hate the love-hate relationship that we have hey can I use your arms could you hold my bowl there's sugar everywhere Wow yeah thank you now the next step is to fold in our mixture in here because you kind of wanted to have a little bit of like cream-cheese stripes but I'm not sure if this is gonna work very well so I'm not supposed to do it like this either so I'm already doing it wrong this is folding oh god I'm not doing it right go too fast very slimy super slimy let's get a little folding action yeah looks folded to me then we're gonna line our cupcake tin with some black liners because it's very festive for the holiday season black cupcake liners which you can get on Amazon it's a really new website just came out I'd recommend filling up about 3/4 of the way so you know like a nice scoop or do [Music] all right no they are our lovely murder muffins are ready for the oven so let's pop those in and then we'll get the icing ready Alexa set a timer for 17 minutes 17 minutes starting now yes oh I'm so excited about these look at these things they are so great they're little edible knives and you guys know what I like I love knives so we're gonna do is we're going to use this it's cream cheese whipped frosting and this actually looks really good so we're gonna use this for our icing I thought that's real good with the red velvet bean we can put some crumbly little cream cheese Oreos on it because why not where's my blood where's my blood oh god my blood we're gonna use gel writing icing for blood these look incredible so let this cool off and then it's time to decorate oh my god is this good you all like yeah it's probably don't want to like us it is good though I don't like this isn't white though just kidding we're gonna be using this thing because it's a nice bright white just what I was going for and let's start decorating cuz I'm super excited about this this whipped topping is so great I just started using this so we're just gonna ice these like basic cupcakes just a real nice little you know do whatever you want I don't care it's shot I swear to God like these things this I did not mean to do this like I'm actually trying and I think that's the problem is when I try hard to do things like I start failing but I'm so stupid okay I'm gonna try really hard this time like this is not even a joke come out of here once one thing goes wrong then I just start getting really upset yeah I mean this is kind of boring but I have to ice them so these are so cool I'm super excited about this wonder what they taste like [Music] [Applause] there's edible oh god I forgot something no I'm not sure if this is gonna work or how this is gonna work but I'm going to hope this is gentle some jello in a very upset it's not gel okay this one's gentle [Music] Dexter was here miss Dexter that was such a great show the hall is not really good Alexa cancel put a little of this in nope no crime scene here officer nothing to see here move along time to dispose of the murder weapon shh-shh there's no crime here there's no crime here there's no crime here I watching wait to us credit dramas there we go Wow these look so cool here we go so this is dirt because they tried to hide the murder weapon OJ and then they couldn't hide it Oh J and then they actually did they never found the murder weapon but where was the bag like there's literally no one else that could have done it like ogee freaking did it but of course if you pay like fifteen million dollars in lawyer fees yeah better freaking it off [Music] [Applause] [Music] what I'm most excited about is cutting open this we gotta get the murder weapon it's been hidden and we need to cut it out could this potentially be it [Music] oh yeah check that out that's something something doesn't taste right it's just coming down to see if there's anything edible yeah I mean these are okay thank you yeah okay yeah I think I messed something up why are you so chunky oh well fine it's okay chunky yeah it's just okay all right guys thank you so much for watching we hope you guys enjoyed be making these murder muffins these are super cute I'll also put a link in the description where you guys can get these little knives act I plan on recreating these for Halloween party that I'm having hopefully whatever I did wrong for these ones I'll do right for the party because I really want my guests to feel very happy about eating these I'll see you guys on my next video bye happy almost Halloween [Music] 
hey guys how's it going it's Justine and today we are unboxing the new Mavic air this is the latest road by DJI and as you guys know I'm a huge drone fan this pneumatic air falls between the spark and the Mavic and we are about to do one of the first unboxings and yes I label my drones manager comes in three colors as you can see it right here there's a black a red and a white don't be fooled there's white on the front of the box which is actually a black version I was so excited to try this out it also has smart captures you can use hand gestures to control the drone it'll recognize your bomb you can make it move around more on that later Oh what this is it it has a little carrying case oh boy before we get into that I want to see what else is in this box I'm just taking everything else so let's start with a controller this doesn't have the LCD you like the Mavic does these just unhinge like that and this is right where your phone goes one thing that I'm so excited about is it has a removable joysticks because when you travel it's so much easier to travel with these off so it's pretty awesome that they have a little tiny place here to put those so if you guys can see in there that's right were these little joysticks just unscrew and you put those right in there things were going so well you travel a lot with you drone be able to take these off and have a secure place to store them is incredible so previously I got this little 3d printed controller cover it just slips right over top of those little joysticks and then you're able to travel but this still is kind of annoying that it's still kind of elevated but I want to show you guys the differences between the controllers so this is the Mavic air controller in comparison to the mapa controller as you can see this one has the LCD on it this is the sparked about the same size and has a glossy or a little top right here here we've got our Mavic air accessories charger we've got extra joysticks cuz says you know you're probably gonna lose one or two extra adapters for your controller the first thing behind the box is the power bricks what you have here is two USB ports and here is the plug that goes into your Mavic or your charging dock Oh everybody this is a groundbreaking we have got a USB C charger it looks like DJI welcome to the club we have a little converter and this will convert from USB C to micro USB and we've got our extra joysticks which is perfect I'm so glad they included these depending upon what type of phone you have they have two additional accessories there's a micro USB and a USB C these are easily swapped out right here on the side and on the other side is one it's currently ranked for your iPhone so it has a lightning cable there's also prop guards extra propellers so because the spark in the air both can be gesture controlled with your hands it is recommended that if you are doing that sort of behaviors that you do put the prop guards on just to protect yourself or if you're a terrible drone pilot definitely recommend doing this as well because if you hit a tree or something like that this will protect your propellers and your drone from any little injuries here is an extra set of propellers thankfully they give you four of them Start Guide oh wow we I'll look at that later I just realized I didn't even open a drone yet what am i doing [Music] this is crazy I'm just doing like a quick glance comparison between the Mavic and the spark and it really is a sweet child of them both so upon first glance one of the things that I like is that imbel is extremely protected as with the spark one of my main concerns when I first got this wonder when I'm traveling with it is it doesn't have anything that is protecting the gimbal like this also on the Mavic it has this little dome that keeps everything very safe and secure in transit so before unfolding this thing going over the size this is the matte platinum it's the latest release from DJI and this year is the Mavic air that we just unboxed so as you guys can see it is significantly a smaller than the Matic it seems to be about the same width but as far as height it just kind of looks like the Mavic if it got squished the Sparks body is very very small but the only issue that I ever had with this one other than the unprotected gimbal is these arms did not fold in powering on and off so it looks like the power button is on the bottom now our battery is dead so it probably will be flying this tonight so unfold the rear arms first and then the forward so back legs front legs fold out something that's different between this and the platinum and the SPARC propellers is these ones do not fold in so these just stay in this position as you can see with the Mavic they fold and they move so you can just quickly put those aside like that oh this whole thing just comes off this is like entirely newly designed and I really love the way that they're going here's the thing gimbal looks like inside with the cover removed it kind of just sort of folded out into itself I always get so scared when I'm putting on the gimbal protectors on the Phantom drones because it's just kind of hanging there and then if you've ever done this before then you probably have the same feeling I always feel like I'm going to just break something you guys have a maverick this is also a big issue too is I always get so afraid because there's this little plastic thing right here that you just pull out which will free your gimbal let's see what this battery looks like oh I was really hoping that this would be a compatible battery with some other drones that I already have and it definitely is not this is an all-nude battery it's in here they're gonna be a USBC yes there is so right here in the front this flips down and there's a little micro SD card slot and also a USB C port right there in the front now that unboxing is complete I'm gonna go charge this thing up and then take it out for a test flight who's ready for a drone adventure it is very windy so there may be a chance we can't even fly we'll see what happens beta it is a really really nice day today we are out here about sets out the pneumatic air he's come in two different models the fly more package is 999 which comes with two extra batteries a traveling case the controller 2 extra sets of propellers whereas the normal drone starts at 799 which is pretty much in between the spark and the Mavic Pro you'll get about 21 minutes of flight time so depending upon how skilled you are how windy it is all those traditions will affect how much battery life you guys so test out a couple of the shooting modes first one they're gonna try out is 4k 30 this will also shoot at 2.7 60 frames a second and also 10 80 120 let's test them out and see what we can see [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so now we're gonna test out smart capture so basically smart capture will allow you to control your drone with the palm of your hand so when you place your palm up it'll recognize you and enter into follow mode when you raise your hand up or down left or to the right the drone will follow you even if you put your palm down and start walking around since it is in follow mode it'll follow you wherever you go you can also control the drones directions if you wanted to move forward or backwards you just drift your hands slightly apart or bring them back together to bring the drone closer to you there's a few different gestures that you can do if you hold up the peace sign your drone will take your picture if you hold up a little picture frame just like this it'll start recording video you can also land the drone using the palm control but I got a little bit worried because I was in the sand and I didn't wanted to get sandy so I just landed it manually [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] bring out we were flying with both of our drones in the air so Nathan's phantom4 is holding my Mavic air it's a drone inception Wow wish I move somewhere you gonna do something or like shejust not move okay how's this you see me oh my god you were scaring me it looked like you were very close to me this thing is super industrial 22,000 milliamps so we've got the new Mophie it's the AC adapter so it has an AC input so we recharging this battery now for the Mavic air through this movie I'm ready for the apocalypse that concludes our Mavic air flight test I had so much fun flying this thing let me know what you guys think of the footage and let me know what you guys think of this sexy new little drone I'm so excited to play with this thing more I'll see you guys later yeah let me fly oh shoot I didn't know you didn't let me fly this is this is complete bull crap wait I can get the flying I only have one battery you know Jenna I'm sorry okay tomorrow morning we're gonna go fly somewhere so right [Music]

hey guys how's it going it's Justine that's me welcome to ask IJ hashtag ask i j IJ short for iJustine for those of you who might not have gathered that over the past eight years that I've been doing this show welcome to the first episode of ask IJ let's get that first question out of the way what's your favorite animal question before we get into the questions I wanted to show you guys this commercial that I did for wicks I know you guys have seen a bunch of other youtubers do these commercials you may have already seen them running as pre rules on my video well this is gonna be an ad inception because there's probably a pretty good chance that this ad has run before this video that you actually watched but some of you have YouTube friends so you may have never even actually seen this yet I had so much fun working on this so I wanted to show it to you guys you've been tweeting me pictures of I'm so glad that you guys have enjoyed it you can check it out I just seemed calm but first let me show you the commercial cuz I love how it turned out and I'm also so excited because my dear sweet baby Maddy made a cameo on set hey guys how's it going today I'm going to show you my awesome new Wix website it's got everything I love all in one place oh of course that means you too Maddy let me show you guys how I did it I'm gonna get started by choosing one of these amazing templates let's just drag it right over here nice so I make videos and I have hundreds of them online which is why I'm pretty excited about this new video gallery of mine everything's synced up to my YouTube channel so you can watch them all right here let's change the text up a bit now I want to add some photos they'll all appear an amazing high resolution which is super important because everything has to look professional Instagram Twitter Facebook chick perfection everything's got to look great on my phone phones okay are you ready for the big reveal I love it you guys think go to wix.com and create your stunning website today so one of the things that was kind of fun as I did get to bring my dog to set and it was insane because I was like okay Mady is coming in he's right to perform can everybody make sure that all the doors are closed to the outside there was a door that was left open sorry we forgot there's a through the door that was left open back here Maddy's outside okay [Music] we could like close that door also is that possible so I scooped him up brought it back inside and then he performed and here he is in the commercial now wait wait wait wait good boy good way very good wait so if you guys want to get your own website check out Wix calm I'll put a link in the description and also if you guys want to check out my new website go to Augustin calm I've actually been getting notifications of any time anybody signs up on my site so it's kind of cool because I basically have seen real-time as you guys are accessing the site the reason that you guys are all here is because this is an ask a jean episode and judging by the title we're talking about the home pod because that's basically all you guys were asking me I'm like searching through the ask IJ hash tag I was like home padang padang padang padang padang padang but okay you guys want to know if I'm gonna buy the home pod and yeah of course who do you think I am I live and breathe for new tech especially when it is in the realm of my sweet sweet apple so the whole plot will be available in two different colors there 349 it comes in the white and the gray it's gonna be really interesting to see how Siri and the home pod fits into this whole ecosystem because it's already been so built out by all of these other companies we've got Samsung with Vicks be we've got Amazon with Alexa we've got Google with our Google home we've got Windows with Cortana and if you're a Mac user obviously Siri is a huge part of our daily lives whether you like it or not sometimes I actually hit that freaking Siri button oh my MacBook and like no it was an accident again I don't want to turn her off because I sometimes actually do use it so it's a fine line that I've got a walk with my girl but Apple seems to be coming into this very very late because I would be very interested to see people who are super tech savvy don't already have one of these things integrated into their life in some way whether it's through their TVs or just the device themselves and that doesn't even take to account how many people have so no systems in their house but now Soto's has alexa integrated into it now launch the home pod isn't going to have all of its capabilities available will people buy the home pod immediately or will they wait until the software update actually allows although the functionality of the home pod should be having at launch then will they get it after the update is out but that is one of the things is yes you have this piece of technology but with a simple software update you can expand what it currently is shipping with I wanted to say to infinity and beyond both I mean honestly that I couldn't say it better I mean that's really what it is I mean the only limitations are really the hardware itself so in a long-winded sort of rambling answer yes I'm getting a home pod at launch I think I'll only be getting one until they unlock the feature where you can use it in multiple rooms the functionality isn't hundred percent there yet but as I said that's a software update so that will be something in the future realistically what I'm thinking that I'll do is that we'll put one in my office and one downstairs in my kitchen right next to my Amazon Alexa mostly because I use the Alexus show and what I love about the Alexa show is it has a big screen on it so every day I walk downstairs I glanced at Alexa I see what the latest news is and then I asked her some questions and what's the weather can you review my news no I'm actually asking you for news was I actually I wasn't even talking to her right now Alexa stop I completely forgot that I have to Alexa enable devices up here I have the GE sole light which is powered by a and I recently got one of the a spots did I even answer a question I don't even know I'm not sure I'm sure some of you guys are going to ask have I been using my massive Mophie yeah I have been and this thing's amazing I've been using it to charge my drones on the go I use it a charge my laptop and now I'm just charging my phone with it yes it's massive and very heavy I need to plan accordingly if this is coming with me Nick wants to know why Adobe Premiere is the best editing software in the world forever and he's trolling me he's a hundred percent rolling because he knows that I love Final Cut Nick has been shooting a bunch of videos for me lately and knows that this is a lie and I've been trying to get him on Final Cut for a very long time and it's gonna happen I think I should do a video about it and no actually that would be very funny to see us going side by side him trying to edit a video and final cut me trying to edit one in Premiere but to be fair I did start editing videos in Premiere even before I started on Final Cut but this was a very long time ago that was back in college so a lot of things have changed since that jimin wants to know what is the most favorite video that I've made it during my 11 years of being on YouTube and actually this is kind of crazy because my favorite video that I ever made was a stop-motion video that I did in partnership with Google they were like what kind of video would you like to make if you can make anything but would you want to do for the holidays I was like this is what I want to make [Music] no one wants to know if I can tell you about the movie that I worked on in Pittsburgh oh you don't even know if I can tell you guys uh I should probably ask I shot a whole vlog about it which I haven't posted yet obviously either but it was a really fun movie and I had so much fun being able to be home and shooting a film in my hometown so hopefully you guys wait to see that soon Melissa says what do you suggest if somebody wants to do YouTube but but is scared because they think everybody will make fun of them here's the truth you're gonna get made fun of you're probably gonna get made fun of a lot and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it you're gonna get made fun of in real life you're gonna get made fun of online but you also have to take into account that there are people who are going to absolutely adore you they're gonna love the things that you're gonna do but they're also gonna have the people that disagree that's just life like there's nothing that you can do about it and once you realize that I'll tell you what life gets a lot easier you're able to brush things off weight easier cuz you're like okay cool you're gonna hate me well guess what somebody else is not gonna hate me and even after 11 or 12 years of being online it is making YouTube videos it still is crazy to me it's just like why say anything at all it just it really just doesn't make sense but then you do have to think of what is this person saying and what in their life has made them get to the point where they need to hate somebody else for something that they love no but if you want to make youtube videos do it find something that you love make content about it and the nice people will come eventually unless you're making hate videos then you're basically gonna be cultivating an audience of making hateful content so I guess to each their own I suppose is asking why so much hate for Android I'm not really sure why you're even asking the question because my secondary phone is always an Android phone and it has been for the past question I can't my first Android phone oh my god it was like whatever Google first had theirs it was like the HTC something I don't know but it's been a long time so since then I've always had a secondary Android phone they loved being able to try different games or apps that may not be available for the iphone so there's no hate at all with a constant YouTube changes what's your best strategy to remain authentic and avoid burnout and still evolve with it constant YouTube changes that's just something that you have to deal with not only in YouTube but in life things change and it happens that if you don't adapt you're gonna get left behind so it's not easy you just gotta do it sometimes that's easier said than done that strategy to remain authentic just keep making videos about things that you love for the past couple of weeks guess what I haven't felt like making a cooking video because I totally burned myself out over Christmas I made so many cooking videos that guess what going into your next question to avoid burnout don't overdo it I overdid it in Christmas and now the thought of making a cooking video I'm just like shuddering at the thought of it but don't worry I know a lot of you guys want the cooking videos back so I have seen your cry for cooking videos and they will be back I've been planning a couple out and I think I'm almost ready to film them again but as far as avoiding burnout it is inevitable it really really is because there is gonna be a time really I can't do this anymore I got to stop clicking mom's know if you Jetta Matt Edie and ro we're surrounded uh-huh no I wouldn't who would survive okay so here is the order of survival I'm definitely gone first cuz I'm completely worthless I'm sure of that the only thing that I would be able to bring to this party here I'm an over-packer I am so prepared for any situation I've got extra clothes for the apocalypse I've even got coffee in my survival bag amongst many knives and weapons but I still think I'd probably be the first to go then Jenna would probably go actually you know what I think Matt would probably go first cuz I just realized that he was in this so it would be Matt and then me and then Jenna and then unfortunately it would be ed in row to duke it out and I know row and I think that she would probably fight ed to the desk method to know if I would ever adopt a little brother dog for Matty or his sister yes I would I know my sister really wants to get a dog but it is such a huge time commitment and I think when the time is right or when we find the perfect dog for her we definitely will get him a brother or sister what do I do in my free time I'm probably watching Netflix or sleeping to be honest with you Jessamyn over my high scores in HQ trivia I think it's 10 that's not very good well thank you guys so much for watching this ask IG episode I apologize if it was a little bit rambling and all over the place I feel like I haven't done one of these for a while so I love getting a chance to just just gonna say sit down but I'm standing up so I love standing up and talking to you guys so thank you again for all of your support thank you for watching let me know if you guys have any other questions in the comments below and I will probably see you guys there so that's it fine [Music] 
hey guys it's Justine and today we're unboxing the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 kill the music time in the comments and on Twitter fighting with Android users and it's silly because I'm not sure if they realize that they're not trolling me I don't care that you think that Android is better than iOS I don't care that Apple fans think iOS is better than Android it's never-ending dilemma it's a fight that I just don't really care about fighting I like what I like you like what you like and guess what that is perfectly fine no one's gonna be criticizing you for your favorite color I mean this shouldn't it I mean my favorite colors black and then I get criticized because black is not a color it's the internet I don't know when I will learn that you can't ever make everyone happy I'm sure many of you are confused because the iPhone is coming out tomorrow so Justine why are you on boxing the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 I did an essential phone of boxing and a lot of you guys were like well where's the no date unboxing and I was like I don't know here it is I plan on doing an extensive test between all of the phones that I have now I can add at the Galaxy Note 8 to that test in the essential phone unboxing I did the s8 the pixel the essential phone and my iPhone so now let me I've owned a comes out I will have an arsenal of test footage from all of these phones to sort of go through and pick what I like the best let's hop right into this unboxing and get this thing all set up so I can start to test it out so before the iPhone comes out unfortunately I'm going to be traveling the day that the iPhone is released but put on your calendars for Saturday and some and pretty much every day next week I will be putting out a bunch of iPhone videos all next week so stay tuned and follow me on Twitter Instagram and whoever else it is that I post that stuff like that Facebook too so I love having a second phone as an Android phone because I love that everything integrates incredibly well with Google YouTube email I love doing email on Android because I feel like the Gmail integration is always extremely seamless so I'm going to be looking forward to testing this out in the coming weeks here it is it's got a nice feel to it so the size is not that much bigger than the s8 but I do feel like if you have an essay you're probably not gonna be switching to an O date unless that's the type of person that you are so let's turn this guy on the Nonie is a little more rectangular where this has very nice curved edges which I think I feel like I do sort of like this look a lot more setting up facial recognition all right so here is the setup screen and what's interesting is this is very different from the setup screen on the new iPhone X my face has been detected okay setting up facial recognition on any iPhone X is kind of interesting because you will be looking at it and it makes you go through a series of motions rotating your head making sure that it gets the entire view of your face I'm doing it like I'm actually doing it right at home I'm just remembering at the Apple event what the setup looked like look at this pitch that's something you can't unsee kay facial recognition swipes screen to unlock it's unlocked just so excited I love technology so let's take a picture of you guys now let's try to live focus and this is something I'm really excited about it's basically the same thing as portrait mode on the iPhone so I'm gonna take a picture of you wow this looks really good actually so here's the picture that I took this is kind of a really difficult photo to distinguish between what should be in focus so here's the background focus so you can turn it all the way down or you can turn it all the way up if you guys can tell the background is completely blurred out just have some kind of like filter on cuz why is my skin look nice oh yeah it definitely does I was like I'm a bad skin or anything but like it looks real good oh my god well if I was on any of those dating apps this would definitely be my profile picture look you can slim your face I can make my eyes bigger but what's wrong with how I am I mean look at all these options it's basically like you're not good enough let's fix you all right so let's turn everything all the way discern the skin tone all the way up that looks good I'm so blurry you can't even tell slim my face I'll make my eyes big I kind of look like in the Moriya Brothers movie the goombas I just take like a normal picture oh my god all the effects are still on don't want large eyes I want mine I'll take a normal picture hi I'm normal but I love a lot about the Samsung phones is the front-facing cameras are very wide angle okay let's do a little video test before I end this unboxing video image stabilization looks nice you see Mike while this is very smooth like when I move this it almost looks like it's on some sort of glider I wonder if it looks like this when I watch it playback now let's flip it around and see what the front-facing video looks like hi it's Justine you didn't know yeah my si filming this little video on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 it's already taken a fall I don't think there's any damage but it definitely took quite a tumble and the sound that it made I thought it shattered if it was but it didn't still here and I've only had it for 24 hours we're gonna test out some of the photo and video features so Jana would you like to be a model for me or what sure sure Wow alright it's much like the iPhone 7 plus this has dual cameras we're gonna be using live focus which allows you to blur and D blur the background while taking the photo and it post and it's windy alright are you ready for live focus yes what's that mean don't move my focus is available okay wow this is struggling a lot because of the background we have fun no my eyes are watery does the wind yeah yeah it actually looks really good looks like I'm going to school my school picture it does look there's a little bit of non blur right there so okay that's a little much but to be fair this is pretty good so here's what it looks like with a blur all the way down all the way up mid-range the only the mid looks pretty good because it blends it pretty well with your hair third so that's what the picture looks like without we need healthy background blur look how much better it looks with the live focus yeah way better it's my school picture okay let's see I'm Jason oh look at that - you're a really skilled normal picture oh my gosh it's crash very lovely trash lovely now let's try out the portrait mode on the iPhone 7 plus and see what the comparison is between the portrait mode and the live focus oh yeah the note looks better I'm shocked you made me take a few more maybe maybe you just got to take it a different way so there's one looks pretty good around your hair background background it sometimes struggles with my blonde hair but I feel like on yours did a really good job look at that I'm having so much fun today yeah definitely struggles with blonde hair Skrillex now let's do a quick little video test oh gosh Oh No Wow my phone's recording notes recording there's Jenna here's my feet boat this is real fast on this one no like look at this I'm filming my phone what are all the audio is how do you think the audio is did you like to tell us a story it's not in front of me that's on the screen yeah that's a good story but it's a great story how about the ice cream and today I don't want to talk about that look at this dog which what do you like the best one of the biggest difference between this and the s8 of course other than a price the screen is a little bit larger but it has a stylus have you seen my stylus probably four people are gonna get that joke this is cool you can do a bunch of different things screen right I'm gonna do a live message it's basically like the app will watch live messages yes okay you're so close like at you hit anybody oh god I screwed up already delete what's that gonna show up on my phone has I don't know let's see okay it's preparing its preparing preparing that compression looks like trash here's what it looks like it looks really bad like why you bother the actual live animation looks incredible but then it turns it into the chip which is very very low quality not sure if there's a way to change it to make it look a little bit better that looks bad right I'm not impressed frankly your condo if this is not my hanok a disaster another thing that I like is if your phone is locked and you take a stylus out it'll automatically open up this note says little memo screen so you can basically take notes without unlocking your phone and then save them it's what I wrote [Music] well this is the note that I wrote Jenna it's a real piece of work I'm sorry let's try a screen right so this is art all right I'll save it no and I accidentally move my pen over here who was I doing mean I'm gana I'm Jana I didn't set up the iris scanner cuz it told me to take my contacts out and I was like well then I can't see so I'll just maybe set that up later [Music] okay oh it's such the Reds why they look so bad ruins of a moment I was really impressed with the no take camera the live focus feature is incredible I was really surprised how well the photos turned out especially in comparison to the portrait mode on the iPhone but but that being said I'm gonna be really excited to put this thing up against the iPhone X and see how the photos turned out so it's got a lot of stuff we've got a USB to USB C adapter and we also have a USB micro to USBC adapter I lose these every single time nice fast charge this one is just a regular USB which is actually kind of nice because I have a bunch of regular USB to USB C cables this I don't know if this is a kg headphones these headphones are pretty good I got a pair of these with the SA and what I like about them is it's kind of this graded material which I feel like helps this last a lot longer when you kind of are abusive to things and you travel a lot and you throw these in your bag I carry these as backup headphones I use them a lot when I'm playing right into the switch so I know I'm kind of a hypocrite because I have a clear case on my SAT and that's one of the things that I have said many times that I do not like I don't like clear cases because crap gets stuck inside of them but so far this case has held up pretty well I think because it's a very very tight fit on this phone that nothing is really getting inside of it so that's a very similar look to the note 8 except you can tell there is a very big difference with the cameras the fingerprint sensor is in the same place 11 just like the unboxing the node 8 because I wanted to let you guys know that I'm checking it out and what I have planned for the rest of the week and to not be alarmed why there's not an iPhone video it's because I'm traveling but I do have an iPhone video plan for tomorrow it's just know the iPhone 8 yet I'll be unboxing some accessories for the iPhone 8 and the Apple watch so come say hi check that out and hopefully you can be patient until the next day when I return home to my new iphone 8 let me know in the comments below what phone you have what you guys think of the iPhone 8 what you guys think of the note 8 what you think of the iPhone X I'm sure there's going to be a lot of fighting in the comments building it's marijuana I look forward to reading all of the wonderful comments that you guys are going to have about everything so I'll see you soon hey does it [Music]
