#TeamTDM. So in Clifton  New Jersey  I had a police escort to leave my book signing.. CRAZY!!

Thanks to everyone that came to my book signing events over the past three days in the U.S. You all made me feel right at home :). My first US event in 3 years. Huntingdon  NY were awesome. Thank you guys :). Thank you for all of my birthday messages yesterday. Lucky enough to be spending it in the amazing New York :). Thank you  Poole! My favourite photo of the tour so far :)

Just one UK tour date left then moving on to new countries next year!!

<3. This is one of my favourite Instagram pictures I've ever been tagged in. I've met a lot of children with Autism and Aspergers over the past few months on tour and all they and their parents need is your patience and understanding. Don't stare  don't judge  appreciate what that child and parent go through every day to do normal activities and day to day tasks.

I've had a lot of feedback from parents that my videos help their child with Autism by keeping them focused. I'm glad I can help both children and parents with my silly videos even if it is just that little break they need each day.

And parents  I have the utmost respect for you all.

Just my thought for the day :) Thank you Lisa.

For those that waited after the show  I am so so sorry that I couldn't come out and say hi. If there is ever a time that I don't come and meet you guys  whether it is at my own tour or other event  please be assured that it means there is something in place that is completely out of my control that stops me from doing so.

Milton Keynes Theatre - 28th August 2016. Dear Parents and Fans that attended Insomnia 57;

For those of you I met at the event  thank you so much! It really was an amazing time  but there was one 'incident' that definitely needs explaining as I have been receiving a lot of angry messages  like the one below.

I tried to explain this in a video  but I'm aware that many parents won't have watched it  so I'll do my best to explain it here.

A situation arose right at the end of the convention where a lot people were waiting outside the door I was using to get to and from the green room so that they could meet me. Security told me this and I asked if I could do a meet up to end the day and meet as many people as possible. I was told that I WASN'T ALLOWED as it was a health and safety risk since the venue was tearing down and building a new convention taking place the next weekend. Also  security were about to leave.

This meant I had to walk past a large group of fans without stopping for pictures and signing stuff which resulted in a few parents swearing at me  shouting nasty things and then sending me angry messages after the event. Some of you were also misinformed by security that I didn't stop because I wanted to go home because I was tired  THIS WAS NOT THE CASE!!

If it was my choice  I would sign for hours and hours and hours on end until I get through every single person that came to that event to meet me  but I was told that I could not do a meet up and that is the one and only reason why I didn't stop. This also applies to all of the stage slots and other situations where fans were turned away. Security is extremely strict at these events so that everyone stays safe.

From the bottom of my heart  I am really sorry that I couldn't stop for you guys in any situation  but especially right at the end and I understand how bad it looked  but I had no choice.

You guys are the reason that I am where I am today and I will never forget that  which is why I go to these events to meet as many of you as possible  but that also means that a lot of people will also be disappointed as I only have a certain amount of time where I can do meet ups. I will continue to work very closely with the event so that we can avoid situations like this in the future and also meet EVEN MORE of you next time!!

I completely understand the disappointment of missing out on meeting me  but I try my absolute hardest to meet you all.
Sorry this was long.. I hope this makes sense..

watching live as this is a live stream then on the top yeah on the top right hand corner of your screen I have added a thing where you can super chat and you can also sponsor the channel big warning they both cost money and it can only be activated during a live stream you got some cool benefits you can go and google that and find out what they are but just want to let you know that that is there and all the notifications will come up on your top right now let's get just straight into this game because I don't want this to be a boring video but we're back in subnautica now today I don't actually know what I'm going to do first I kind of need to wait I need to go to that new biome don't I though I set over here but I also want to find out what other blueprints I've got I've got some blueprints down here haven't I I had one that I was trying to finish and it was we have a laser cutter that's pretty cool propulsion cannon I did not know we were trying to find that this the seamoth I really want to find the other ingredients for that the rooms as well I guess are gonna be pretty interesting too and also I want to know I want to know one earth is going on with where as it were as it were is it let's go to yeah my oxygen so with my oxygen I really wanted to find out whether if when you created another oxygen tank whether that gives you more oxygen so I just want to quickly do it with the stand one but I'm not sure it does just because you have the standard one here oh wait a second wait a second I haven't even crafted the better one is that for real where is it where is it where is it I can't find it I need the other oxygen tank here it is the high capacity I swear I've made that already but it doesn't say high capacity hey we got some stupid shots already who do we have we have Harry one two three down I'll have your bits thank you so much Gonzalo its donated to thank you so much Sascha mr. pancake gamer blue King and Yves life thank you so much really greatly appreciated hopefully you saw your names on the screen that would be good because that means that I've worked it out I think it's got a little bit funny if your name is too long it's gone a little bit funny but hopefully I'll fix it for next time anyway this just said standard Oh to tank I feel like I have another Oh to tank that I've crafted before I'm not 100% sure no I don't do that I want to go down into here I swear I've got one not in here I always do this it's annoying here no I need to craft that then like desperately I don't think I have any silver left though so I'm gonna have to try and find some of that we need to go on an exploring mission anyway I can t remember what silver looks like but quartz copper titanium gold which is pretty cool with some more gold in here actually some creep fine series a spade fish I think I'm good for water and stuff and energy so I guess I'm just gonna head out what do I need then to craft myself the better oxygen I thought I already had it we need a standard o2 tank which you got two glass titanium and silver so we just need more glass and a piece of silver let's get exploring shall we there we go I love this thing man it's so cool it's really cool how do I turn off that middle thing that I completely forgot oh my guess I'm missing so many I'll catch up on the Super chats in a moment don't you worry I just want to make sure that I've got I need quartz don't I spits away I need quartz to make glass I think I've got a lot of quartz already yes I remember in here this is perfect but this thing is gonna get me no stay away from me stay away go go oh wait good as that thing is terrifying absolutely terrifying I need those better Rockstone i because there's like better rocks in the middle I'm worried about my oxygen though I do not want to die down here and literally just leaves down here okay that was that was unexcited wasn't it let's just go up thank goodness right where do I need to find you know I could go over to the new underground thing and see if there's any caves there but I also feel like this cave right here is gonna be pretty good too let's have a look shall we Ang's one of those things no no no no no no no I hate those things so much with the C glide though it's so much better you guys oh geez there's another one this is going badly he's already going badly where do I need to go I just lost that cave that I was in you know I'm gonna head out towards yeah the new underground thing and then we can sort it from there let's just go this way oh jeez those things - I don't like those I can hear them they're regressing they're regressing we're going to the drop-off there's also these things that we discovered as well isn't there they're like these horrible looking things that go into the into the sand they're pretty aggressive look in there we go right we've got our oxygen back we're on the search for a piece of salt no we're not we're on the search for a piece of silver actually this is the underground thing here isn't it but I think we're gonna need some extra oxygen yeah look at this this is crazy it is actually like a purple biome it's kind of scaring me we definitely need more oxygen to explore this which is why I need the silver does anyone know the best place to find silver so I'd love to be able to sit to find it let me just catch up on super chats real quick I don't want to drown or get attacked at the same time you also need more power on RC guide soon to have a little bit worried about we have ourselves who's a super chat's whether I get up - oh my gosh there's so many

I just want a piece of that that's all I want we could go a little bit further so we need to find the special rocks that have the gold and stuff in I'm pretty sure we do anyway oh geez oh geez what is that what is that it's a terrifying beast absolutely terrifying oh wait is this it I think this is it right here yeah sandstone no that's not the one we need the other one it's limestone yeah there's limestone I don't know what I got from that my sea Glide is running out of power as well also we didn't discover we discovered these last time but we didn't actually we didn't actually see what was on them so I think we're gonna do that right now as well kelp forest is where you find it I guess we could try it out then what is on these I want to see what's on these papyrus let's grab some of that I

that first off though I feel like I just need more oxygen and a Power Cell is a battery times two which is copper and acid mushrooms and silicon rubber I desperately need to make like a base as well I probably should have done some research before I came on but I desperately needs just more space there's not that much storage at all in this game so far at the beginning anyway I need acid mushrooms actually feel like I've already gotten rid of my acid mushrooms I might just need to grab some more let's just grab them from here shall we one two three four I think that's what I need for some more

really dumb way right water please bladder fish I think I call it three there we go right panic over one two three we got it we got it right I've got another tool that I can craft as well which is the stasis rifle required magnetite so we need to find that battery titanium laser cutter propulsion cannon habitat builder fabricates habitat compartments and appliances from raw materials so to build well what's this the graph trap the grout trap would be good wouldn't it copper and titanium use artificial gravity to attack light objects and small creatures I'm gonna build one of those actually I have copper and titanium I'm just gonna build one of those quickly it takes one battery but that's fine batteries are quite easy I just want to grab this just so I can get some fish attracted to my grab trap let's put it in the hot bar there we go five let's go right so if I put this like down here well it just sucked them in Oh oh yeah well okay that's pretty phenomenal I like that a lot that's

because I've heard of this guy dantdm and I'm a big fan of him on YouTube you might not have heard of him but I've heard there are some really crazy apps out there that allow you to cool dantdm so I thought we would test them out today and see if they actually work so if you saw its dantdm a cool on the Google Play Store there's apps like this one that allow you to get a professional and beautiful fake call from dantdm in the Android Market 10,000 people have downloaded this let's give it a go shall we let's see if we can call him make cool here we go it's loading it must be doing all the who is that ok cooler name wait is that me let me put in down TDM and see what happens call it number let's just make something up completely random use proximity sensor that's a little bit freaky with a photo in there as well let's save the call oh haha it's actually working um I'm gonna answer it hello hello dance EDM is that you I've heard that I can get through to you on this app hello oh just even working this new speaker cool ended fantastic what a quality app oh he's ringing again let's see if we can do it here we go press green I can't hear anything hello hello nope nothing what if I click keypads the cool just ends okay well this one does not fake what other ones do we have all actually this one says fake call from dantdm I'm an idiot this next one though says real cool from dantdm so let's check it out again 10,000 downloads why have they put that image of me why they've made my hair like bright green but a fake cap on me and fake glasses on both pictures that's it's really odd again with the fake glasses and stuff oh my goodness look at this start cool are you ready guys we're gonna cool down TD I'm here we go hello is it working oh I need to press the button here we go guys I'm excited oh hello he's not picking up yet dantdm oh wait is he calling me let me see oh yeah oh yeah dad TDM is that you you for them okay no I can't hear anything I think he's gone that was uh that was something special uh let's try it one more time to see what happens oh yeah oh yeah no I'm hanging up on you you're weird well that's definitely not me is it said real cool from dantdm as well what are the comments the ratings are horrible it doesn't even remotely sound close to his voice and the dude just says oh yeah three times in a row hates it I don't know Dan sound see my fans got my back this one has a really good rating and has a hundred downloads let's see what this one's about it looks pretty cool let's see hold on a second dantdm songs and the damn TDM button weeds check these out guys this is getting a bit out of control isn't it oh here we go fate call from Dan TDM prek wader seconds that looks exactly the same as before how's a good rating low so let's see what happens when we click starts okay cool a name Dan T don't give a damn TDM for both I don't know what time means but let's uh it's cool now oh it's like it's literally counting down the seconds okay this better this better sound like me I mean it's better be the right person because I still haven't managed to get through Tim which is a little bit disappointing oh it's samurai that's answer it hello anyone there no dantdm I really want to talk to you I love your videos if you're there say yes he's not there guys is he what if I tap a speaker mute keypad ad cool none of these buttons work this whole thing's fake I've got no voice I mean that's the best-looking one that we've had so far but it has so many good reviews what's going on oh it has two good reviews that's it so the rest of the apps just don't speak to you apart from that creepy guys saying oh yeah so I want to find out what the the dantdm button is because it's a little bit weird ad she has good ratings 105 ratings at 4.3 stars and it says dantdm sings to you which worries me a little bit but hey it's got some good who's got some good reviews let's see what the dantdm button is and then we'll check out dantdm songs because why not there it is the rant EDM button it kind of looks like a cake don't you think let's see what happens when we press it [Music] stop stop stop oh stop can I stop this I need to stop right now just a button it's done so weird I was literally listening to that song earlier that is another new remix by end ago to remember the guy we reacted to before that's his brand new song it's just a button that literally plays that song that is insane what about this one oh this is made by the same people so I wonder if it's the same thing just with a different skin okay it's presented us with a very different and much smaller button to press so let's see what happens it has like all of them why there's so many snow glows white on the mountain tonight not a experience for you see Oh No let go let it go can't hold it back anymore let go so weird so basically they've just taken everything on YouTube oh hey he wants to say hi it's basically they've taken every like remix on YouTube and just put it in an app I mean inspired whoa guys okay so this leads on to what I'm gonna talk about in this video as well so check this out I've just found another prank and Cooling app but look at what it needs access to your contacts your messaging your photos camera microphone and cool information that is insane so one of the messages I wanted to give you in this video is to just be so so so careful with what you download online because even if it's got my name on it doesn't necessarily mean that I've made it there's only I think maybe two apps that I've actually got online actually I think only one yeah there's only one now which is the dantdm AR app which is this this is the only real one by BBC Worldwide and it's combined with my DVD to make the AR cars look super cool like this yeah that's the only app that I have the other ones just be so careful I will never ever ever put my phone number or call anyone or just give you the ability to contact me through an app that's weird its dodgy and pull please don't trust those apps just be super careful they're also riddled with like a ridiculous amount of ads which you can accidentally click on it will lead you to weird websites and just be careful with anything that's fake concerning my name's unfortunately there's a lot of things out there that even stretches to merchandise as well I see loads of fake merchandise out there which is just poor quality and I don't want stuff out there that makes my logo and images and all that stuff does look terrible but unfortunately people are out there that do that so there's only one official dantdm app out there at the moment which is the dantdm AR app on both Android and iOS as well and the only place to get official merchandise by me is in the description below at dantdm shop calm all the rest apart from two heroes are fake please don't buy them oh wait a second dantdm is calling me duh see you might have to move a little bit hold on hold on why are you mad at me I wasn't trying to call you I was just really come on you okay I was trying to call you you know what he hung up turns out dantdm is mad at me great guys I hope you enjoyed this silly video I don't know how it's gonna come out but I hope you enjoyed it and please again just be super careful with all these fake apps out there I don't want you guys to get in some weird situations because of people that just want to use my name for apps and downloads and sales and stuff like that so um yeah please be careful apart from that if you do want to pick up some official merchandise Darcie likes it especially the brand new advent calendar because it's coming up to the 1st of December already then please do go in the description below if you enjoyed this video please leave a thumbs up that'd be greatly appreciated and if this happens to be the first video you seemed I mean please do consider subscribing to join same DDM today apart from that guys I'm gonna go and snuggle and then edit this video but I will see you guys very soon I love you very much and good bye [Music]

Let's remember a few days ago when I sold the neighbors things well that had some knock-on Consequences and today we're gonna find out exactly that by playing another brand new hello neighbor mod called The Subway i spawned in the world, and I'm locked in out! Definitely in I'm guessing the neighbor's house is up here Squidward's door is right there. so we can ask for him help if we need any but from that we need to get going because. This is the subway. Looks pretty intense not going to lie can I open these I? Can there's literally nothing alt is a keycard? I'm gonna take this these look like those magic boxes! You know when someone like you know and someone saw someone in half. That's what these look like oh it. Literally told me the key cards are down here. Okay. That's fine Do I need to check my belongings at all I don't think I do. I think this is the first puzzle You know can I use it on here? Why do I always do that okay that works? That works too now. Can I just open it? Yeah? No security required. I can also get something from the vending machine as well. I'm gonna grab some Whatever, this is I guess it's tomato juice and a picture of the neighbors mouth! But I can't actually grab him unfortunately :( right let's go and see if we can find the neighbor anywhere Welcome to the first station. I believe there are four stations in total and oh Here he is! I told you the neighbor is now homeless. And this is all my fault because I I sold all his things I'm gonna throw this at your head It just bounced off. I'm so sorry!!! I actually feel terrible the guy is all brown and it's like he's jumped in some kind of gross ness :(. He's crying He's got a can for a pillow that I've now just thrown, but this is crazy. This isn't just a mod This is like a full recreation of a brand new like hello neighbor level. This is crazy right let's go over here I spotted a door and it has a giant clock above it, right There's a book a pipe a key and a key card, okay The key card have done, but now I need a book a pipe and a key well. What does this? Do should we pull it let's do? Okay, I can hear noise Did something open down here somewhere or did this open? I'm like underneath the ground What is through here so oh? I thought that said TDM it says tube. There's like a massive library. I need a book I Definitely need a book, but how do I open it? Can I remove these planks? This is this is really cool I didn't think it was gonna be like this open Did it work no?   The exit is there What are the other things on the list a book a pole and a blue key, okay? Let's oh I feel like this turns something off, so let's turn that back on and let's go and see if we can find Oh It's literally that well. That's not good Is it I'm looking at all the trash cans and stuff But I can't find anything looking in all the vending machines - but I don't see anything suspicious. Just yet Anything up here No, I'm so confused neighbor. I need to talk to you. Can I take this bag off of you, please? I just need to see if you've got anything that he needs to get out of here. I will get you your house back I'm so sorry. Maybe they're up here actually. No these are all key cards. What about in here Nope don't like people watching me get out of here. It didn't even break ah Is that all I needed to do, but I swear this wasn't open before All I need is a single book. I believe it was blue I think I also need a pipe and there's a giant levee. Let's see what happens secret door Dude But this it's like some secret parkour cause this is crazy dudes We're actually doing we're actually doing hello neighbor parkour. Okay. This is where I could fail badly I'm guessing there's something at the end that we need Let's go this way No, I mean the running is bad enough in hello neighbor it doesn't really need any help to get any harder Could I just go up this way. I can't okay. That's good. Oh, we need that big book do we can I knock it down? That was a terrible throw I need ammo gimme ammo. Let me see if I can get it from here We can do the super powerful, throw Like stuck to it and crashed no, okay the thing about this one. It doesn't actually save so if we mess up We mess up proper, and we have to do the whole thing again Or if it crashes either one as further that we can go I didn't realize we could go through again So this is for the oh my goodness. What is this? More parcours will flooded can I I can walk in it? Okay? That's good spongebob snow Squidward's door is here Compress this and that does something that opens this or I get a crowbar So I can open this okay? This is a little bit easier this must be where the other key is because we've had the book, but this one is different this one is a Ramp okay, okay, you know three two one launch me Thank you look at this insane thing so if I fall Do I literally just get ground up into meat not sure if I'm a fan of that to be honest Oh is this the pipe that I need I think it is it's absolutely huge, and I can do some parkour bits This way as well to get something else Maybe I need a specific Pipe oh my goodness. This is actually crazy You know I hate parkour guys, and this is just this is just the next level be careful Be careful because otherwise you've been ground into burgers, buddy. Oh, oh it's a golden one Is that a golden one it is it kind of looks like a gun, but I think I've got it I don't really want to I don't really want to go in there to be honest that seems like a bad idea Let's see if I can get out the other way no Okay, we're fine. We're absolutely fine. I could've been bad. How do I get back over there though? Can I jump this way? I can okay? That's much better. This guy's actually got a really good jump on him actually right? It's all good. We have the we have the golden pipe, so we don't need the giant one Where did the giant one go there it is BAM? This is like disguise as a key is so weird right onto the next one where we need like literally a blue key It's all just completely blocked up and here are some that's my pants that we know so well He's got a little garden down here How cute is growing boulders as well right number four we can just open this door? But what's behind the painting there is oh? This can go outside this can just live out here in the garden there is A giant hanging house my mind is blown My mind is actually blown do I have to do this whole thing I could just jump this right? There we go, but how do I do this? But it's like drew those puzzles where you have like the hoop And then you have to put it round the ring, and if you touch it it zaps. You kind of like that This is creepy super creepy, but also Amazing, this is this is fan made a fan made mod level Oh almost fell almost fell okay these up bits are actually quite difficult You have to jump them go yes. I've made it to the new house look at this. It's got vending machines all over the place Who are you you're someone different? I don't want to get in there I don't want to spend more time with you than I have to I can't even remember what I was looking for look There's a tiny little the tiny little train That's cool, and here's the big security desk that we all know of sorry Jer let's go upstairs I can't go upstairs. How do I do this there must be a lever a switch somewhere? What's that? Oh? It's just that this is the wheel easy? I'll poke you with this. Can you tell me um you tell me? What's going on? You kind of look like a superhero? Have a cape to this guy, and he's looking pretty super there must be something I can press What was that? What was this a? Box with a a one on it, it looks like there might be a secret door here, actually yeah, there's definitely something secret there But how do I open it? Oh, maybe I can put this in here? That'd work. I don't even think he could fear actually no icon. Oh Okay, let me grab a plate and let's smash this What's in here? I feel like maybe I need to throw more things at these paintings Yeah, okay, right let's get throw in this is so odd. I'm guessing we need to get to the big one at the back Hopefully there's enough things for me to throw oh Did it did it did it is it open it must be the top? I thought that was a secret door there, but no there is The annoying door here is the key the golden key? Oh, this is phenomenal I love that these mods have golden items in but how on earth do I get out of here I'm gonna jump it and see what Bunz That was magical they're cool. They're cool Yes, okay, right we need to go back to the other parkour bit and try and get the golden book now And then we've done the first station which is so cool It's like a full Herald neighbor act in itself also worth noting that the neighbor was homeless at the beginning But then he got himself a house, but wasn't the same guy who knows they had different outfits on so it could have been Completely different open police. Thank you open open out of here right we need to do some parkour I love this giant room opening It's so epic and he's like Don't don't don't don't kind of music right how on earth do we get over there I think that's the book But I don't know as long as it doesn't crash this time because I'll be mad if it does I'll have to do the whole thing again right okay. Can we just run and jump and grab it? I kind of don't want to throw a book again. Just in case it crashes. Oh, I can't jump over oh, I can I'm Literally on the edge of the level hey here we go. I don't want to touch the thing that crashes though Let's go Yes Yes, cigarette. Yes. I don't know if that's the way you're supposed to do it, but I don't care I've got all the items check out the down how much for all these items. We got the book We've got our self the key And we've also got ourselves a pipe look at these things these things probably worth a fortune More than your golden apples sir, right? Let's go so we should be able to do this yes And then we've also got the book yes And what's last the key of course are we done, yeah? Okay, this is a little bit weird, but not what I was expecting It's still half past two in the afternoon or in the morning It's probably in the morning because the neighbors that weird we have a phone as well It's at the end Was at the end why is it playing the credits? What are you doing that can't be it's no wait it might be He said four platforms those were the four platforms. Oh I am an idiot. I really thought that there were four separate platforms But no those were the four separate platforms I don't minds though. This is actually the craziest one that I've seen so far and this came in was his second place Yeah a second place in the mod competition. I was talking about and it's interesting that it provides some kind of like weird backstory on to neighbors maybe just one maybe he's just a victim of the train crash or Everyone in the world of hello neighbor looks exactly the same. This is impressive for a fan-made project. This is incredible It's got creative parkour. You don't actually have to run away from the neighbor It kind of makes you feel sorry for the neighbor which is quite cool It's got new golden items that you need to use to be able to complete things as well. I'm also curious Whether you can open this all the beginning look at that. It looks like the tunnel to heaven it looks great No, I don't think you can open that at all there's no electronics attached to it so even though It looks like the mother of all exits. I don't think we're gonna make it up there Can I just throw this let's see what happens? No, put that properly about stuff a happy free dustbin you could do it go You've let me down. You've really let me down I'm kind of curious to see whether you can actually throw this to knock the book off So I know you can knock the book off with the gun and stuff But obviously we don't have the gun it might crash. We're gonna do it anyway here we go yeah, I I crashed it don't throw the book at the big painting Everyone will die look we are kind of in a city. There's even buildings outside That's cool detail and the turbines are crazy as well I love how quirky is it still as quirky as the original hello neighbor. I love it. No no I Was trying to I was trying to go ahead and see the other neighbor again, but I can't do it Nope, it's not gonna happen. We don't need to see him again anyway It's fine all I'm worried about is this guy right here let me just build you some kind of house the best I can do is a Pyramid that that's all I've got. I mean we probably could build this up quite away with all these boxes You know the boxes don't like behaving themselves though, so you know what I'm just gonna leave it here See that's terrible. He's got one box on him already We could just like layer him up with boxes, and if this works But the box is literally don't even want to help you out even the boxes Don't love you right now Society time to be the neighbor, but anyway guys That's pretty much it for the subway of hello neighbor Maude. I thought this was awesome I love this and this was second place so in theory first place is gonna be even better Which is the hello Doctor mr.? Doctor the neighbor turns into a crazy doctor which sounds amazing so if you enjoyed this and would like to see that one very very Soon then please leave a big fat thumbs up a big like that'd be greatly appreciated And if this happens to be the first video you seen by me, and if you haven't done so yet Why don't you hit that subscribe button to join team? Tdn today full of daily videos pardon that guys. Thank you again so much for watching have an amazing day You're awesome, and I'll see you next time good. Bye 
okay this is it this is really at this time the escape is to the final prison I will ever escaped from unless they make an escape is three which would be great but today we're doing two HMP offshore which is one of the prisons that didn't get your vote previously which I then forgot about so today we're here last prison I've heard good things about this one so let's just hop straight in I'm not wasting any time we've got everyone wearing some kind of hats apart from you Jess the man I think we've met just before but let's start the game let's do this I'm excited this looks like it will be a traditional prison so I'm even more excited let's go I'm wearing a nice yellow outfit as well it looks like the sea is behind me so it's a dolphin ok if we can use the dolphins to escape I will be a very happy man again the music is a pop it's so good please don't disturb the local dolphins that's not gonna be my plan I want to use the Dolphins to escape I hope we can hey look there they are I think they're hinting towards it look there's a platform there was a platform with a dolphin that's my first place I'm gonna go at least we've got ourselves a screwdriver that's pretty impressive and some toothpaste that's really impressive the prison doesn't actually look that big apps allow it I'll wait hold on there's 7 floors are you kidding me look all these floors that's mad ok this is gonna be tricky but first thing we need to do gain some money do some jobs and find Paul Soares jr. some music instruments because we need to go to the payphones I've already got myself 75 coins so um you know I could feel like I feel like I get the speedrun this game now it's insane this prison doesn't seem to have too much of a bad layout because it is on different floors of all the floors are very small so should it be too bad I need to find myself a payphone that is not a payphone there's 10 floors that's insane the pay phones are on floor 6 so I need to go down ok right let's do that here they are right let's see what we've got so airy dolphins ok that's good we got a trash talk escape tip and the recipe for a super cool just arrived suma dolphins it has to be some crazy fools said they befriended dolphin down below by the water they said they made a connection with it or something how does that even work can humans even speak dolphin that's actually a terrible terrible clue where is this dolphin I saw it on the preview it must be down here somewhere it's there look the Dolphins right here I need to go down wait you can't get down without a red key that can't be right surely know you legit can't get down there with our red key so we definitely need one of those and then you need to go down and down again this is where the Dolphins going to be but we need a red key to get through to things ok this is gonna be trickier than I thought whoops looks like I'm gonna need to do some study in some collecting of things and I'll see you guys in a bit just gonna sit here and read for a bit oh this sounds horrible bye escaping on a dolphin though that sounds insane oh that's weird why is that got a dolphin tooth he must know more about these dolphins ok might be in trouble I've just found out something pretty cool so I have found 2 circuit boards on a juicy worm it looks exactly like the ones you get from worms it is made by the same people that published the worms game so that's cool at least err egg but I like grabbing the items are a little bit weird just in case they're to do with the escape for some reason also found the generator here as well which I can power down if I want to but I don't know if I'm gonna get in trouble I've got myself I bought some talcum powder so I've got enough for putty now which is goods and I just need a wire and then I can go ahead and grab myself one of them stun guns which is beautiful no he's gonna come and get me I need to get to roll cool by also need to get myself back to my cell to put this stuff away while avoiding all of the contraband detectors I go some 174 they gonna beat me down any second now quick quick quick put this way put this way I am ok I think I just need to not miss roll call come on don't miss roll call come on don't miss it ok be good so we can actually craft some stuff now we can craft some putty eggs I don't think putty is actually against the rules so let's craft that it's actually green so we're fine we've got the juicy worm I've got three batteries all I need is I just need a wire and I'm good to zap people to find this key that's all I need and then I can find out the secret of the Dolphins ok selling a lighter I'm gonna grab one of those even though it's super expensive just because I need one to make the molten plastic and then I'm good I just need I just need a wire here we go let's craft this there we go and pop that in here beautiful no I just bought a lighter and there's one in this chest and the wing oh yes a wire ok that's great we can start knocking out guards now and we've got free time which is perfect there's also pearls which is interesting but we need to do some zapping ok so your batteries and a wire oh do we have enough intelligence we might not have enough let's see that that that craft no ok what do I need I need oh wait I need duct tape and a paperclip as well I've actually got those ok that's good I need 60 intelligence I have 56 ok we definitely can do this ok got to 70 instead which should be more than enough to be able to craft anything so oh another lighter go another paper clip as well but I don't know if I need it now we should be able to zap some peeps right let's see if we can do this here we go let's grab ourselves wire battery wire you know the other way around even and then craft an energy module and then it's the duct tape and paper clip as well gives us a stun gun which is actually really really lucky to be able to craft that we've also got our water putty as well and we should just be able to just straight up zap some people we need to go to our job first then we just got zapped random people and see if we can get the key we need to be super lucky cuz apparently it doesn't even matter if they walk out of a red door as we learned in the previous video it's just completely random so we just gonna have to keep on zapping I keep on open for that red key I think our first victim is going to be Monsieur Eccles let's see what happens he's gone up here I Echo's has been on our radar before oh no this is outside I need them to go inside because they can't actually shoot us out here so hello how that's happened I don't have to find this stun gun again well wait a second wait a second zapped him okay this might work he's got the yellow key I came out and bouncing don't shoot me don't shoot me okay I messed up I messed up I messed up oh my goodness quick put this in the desk well almost messed up properly you are lucky that you do not get zapped sir always gets my heart racing no matter how many times I do it I'm always like wow what am I gonna do if I lose everything that cause did not have the key you had the yellow one and we're actually seen a yellow one before I don't think we have sorry I cause I'm really sorry so is this technically outside I guess it's not I just got shot before right let's see who we can choose to to take down next there's someone down here who is it it oh there's a couple there's towel and Simmons we kind of need them to go away from each other otherwise we're gonna be in big trouble there's there's Echols as well he's gonna snitch on me definitely there's three guards on the same floor that's outrageous Austin might be going up he's definitely going up we might be able to do this come on Austin taste your poison buddy right he's got these got a lighter which I'm gonna take and a green key that's not good enough but bop bop I actually have so many lighters it is insane sorry buddy I didn't mean it God knock me out this is so annoying to have to do this just literally randomly choose people and before I said the stun gun ran out but I haven't any run out yeah and I don't want that to happen anytime soon coffee got you red key okay when you do this quickly let's crop this there we go and let's put back the red key got him that was a complete opportunistic thing I did not think that was going to happen I just randomly got him I need his guards outfit as well actually so let's grab that there we go just in case he's left nice and naked and oh I need to get rid of one of these things I'm not gonna need the circuit board so let's put those away and let's flush this just to flush the evidence away I am so gonna get beat down but I've got a red key molds I'm good I'm good god beat me down buddy gone haha you got me just lying in a all of toilet water so we need to get downstairs so when you go bottom left and this is how we get through I just want to see how many times we need to use our key once twice maybe is that twice yeah and there's gonna be guards down there as well so we need to be super careful right let's see if this works officers outfit all we need to craft this still so let's corrupt ourselves this key what's good is we almost have enough stuff for the for another key and we know who has the key so we can still use our stun gun and stuff so it's not too bad if we get caught but still kind of sucks a little bit what's our next period it's free time perfect there's actually no guards down there at the minute so I just used my thing twice by accident put the clothes on perfect oh there's a desk here let's see if there's anything in here we can use timber I'm gonna take the timber the duct tape could be fun oh geez okay just keep on going keep on going act like it didn't happen I just need to avoid these people as much as possible keep going down and look out for any other desks right so there's another desk there we can get on the way back up dolphin I would like to talk to you please this is gonna be weird hey dolphin how's it going snooty okay so we can talk to him but there's not really anything Oh start fishing wait do we need to give him a fish okay guys we need to go back I have no idea what I'm doing this is slightly terrifying okay let's go through here let's grab something from the desk there's just dolphins stuff that's not good for us let's go back let's go back okay I need to figure out how to craft a fishing rods and then we need to do some snoopin right here we go get changed out of the guards outfit back to what we had and we're good 50% used that's not so bad okay that went well need to do some fishing though and then I'm guessing I need to give him a fish to get him on my side okay let's put this stuff back the lighter can stay here we've got duct tape as well oh my goodness ah way too much stuff right let's see if we can find a fishing rod I've never seen one before we've also got a spear sledgehammer that's not going to work all fishing rods we need a timber string and a paperclip we've got we've got the string that's goods timber we just need a paper clip dude who's got a paper clip I hate it when you're looking for like the simplest thing in the world a paper clip and then you just try and have to find one but you can't find one anywhere it's it's horrific well I'm gonna have to get rid of the screwdriver I think because I don't need it I'm not gonna go through the vents today so let's flush that real quick and just go and you lads got a paper clip oh my good is he knocked out guards he actually not Blau a guard so officer towel does have a red key just for future reference there's so many people what happens I leave you for two seconds you're all beating each other up you guys are nuts fire - what a putty that have been great so officer towel has one - that's good just in case we need a new one that's bad oh thank you buddy I'll take that now let's get back to myself before I get beat down that was luck they don't usually they don't usually sell paperclips I don't think so anyway right we need string timber and a paper clip to craft this let's do it fishing rod boom there we go right is there anything else we can do cuz you can't just catch it let me try this out to you I don't know if this is gonna work but let me give it a go it does ready fishing rod okay because you can't catch a fish without a flippin worm so we've got that that's good let's sleep it off it's good that the fishing rod is not a I'm contraband item that's really really good let's wait for free periods and then we're gonna go and catch ourselves a fish which should be fun right it's free time after this so we are going to and do this here we go let's see if we can catch ourselves a fish hopefully there's no guards down here because that will make our time a little bit better because free time is definitely after this we've got 30% on our red key that's actually fine we are gonna need another red key if we need to come back down here though so let's see we can fish here we go we got ourselves a fish now I'm gonna give this to the dolphin which is really random I just do this I can and now he's giving me a quick quick quick eek eek eek eeeek reward escape ok except find a way to understand snooty okay there's something appeared on our little map here where is it gonna be I need to make this quick floor to floor three four five six seven oh my gosh where is it in the library okay we need to go to the library guys we're gonna need another red key aren't we mind you how did it Bradley get down here up there floor five yeah Bradley you need to get through there with the door as well that's insane all right let's see what's in here anything magical nothing magical just a sock and a few things right let's get changed again and that's not so bad but now we need to find out how we talked to a talk to a dolphin and we also need another red key which I'm a little bit worried about if I hadn't have messed up that first door opening because I opened the door twice with one key I'd be absolutely fine I'd only need just to go down see the dolphin again but I guess I'd need to get back up which is weird is it in here get out of there no no I'm trying to understand the dolphin how to speak dolphin book that's great let's grab this call of snooty it's giving me another mission get flour milk and sugar okay ah snooty wants a cake is that right it's new - you're a little bit weird buddy I mean I'm not complaining I would want cake in return for a ride on a dolphin as well let's see after we collect all these things what he wants this is great okay I have all the things let's see what happens when we craft them together it's all we need to do yet craft the cake all right let's go boom boom boom crafts we got a cake deliver the cake too snooty okay so we just needs I literally just need one more red key usage I can't believe I messed up so badly before what's wrong with me we need to make another key which means I need to zap someone again but I don't know if I'm gonna have the chance to I needs at least I've got enough to make putty do I have enough to make myself some plastic a dog I literally needs just some Fulmer plastic give me a sec guys I'm gonna try and find the stuff I need come perfect thank you George you're the man all right let's make this plastic right now and then pop that index we don't need that what we do need though is to go to job time and then see if we can zap someone that has the red key this is all I need and then I'm out of here as long as the dolphin doesn't want anything else I think cake for a trade for an escape eh too bad buddy oh geez are you really hitting me now why I need to go to job periods oh okay that's fine right here okay someone's coming up now but there's I need Echo's to disappear like instantly Echo's go away I need to give towel a little bit of as a pin let's see if this works here we go and zap here we go let's grab the key let's craft it with this and then give it to him back there we go done perfectly did I just yeah I just put my old geez give me give me give me all I ran out my zapper ran out okay that's not so bad I've got everything I need I just need to take the cake to the dolphin and then I'm outta here I think it's get beaten up first those two lose all my heat we've got free time this is perfect shoot me I don't even care shoot me right now right in the face there we go I'm dead we're out here boys on a dolphin right let's make the key boom-boom craft I only need to take that one with me and then a guards outfit and I'm good right I think I'm fine let's get out of here I'm taking I'm taking the cake and I think that's all I need I hate getting so close to an escape because I feel so nervous right let's change to this change into it perfect I'm a guards let's go feed this dolphin his cake and hopefully it was allow me to escape on his back it's the perfect crime actually the perfect crime I have a fish for you oh man there's a guard right there we should be okay though I'm not plotting something I'm just talking to here snooty I've got a cake for you buddy is that all is that all you're allowing me escape yes oh my goes oh my goodness I thought you was gonna I thought you'd properly done me over then right then I did my part now do yours what's gonna happen am I gonna be on a dolphin I'm a dolphin is a guard as well best day ever I agree that's a dolphin I'm riding it another matter yeah yeah that's the last prison that's bad to be gettin a though we did we've got so many a's now that's crazy oh man I don't even know how you would get out of that with a perimeter breakout I don't even think you can I think that's why there's two special escapes that's mad guys we have done every single prison they have all been completed every single one even the DLC and that's it that is finally it until they bring out new DLC or a new escapist game that's me done for being in prison unless I get put in prison in real life but then I could just cool on the Dolphins and then they'll help me they'll help me get out one night hey guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please leave a big fat like let me greatly appreciate it as always thank you for the immense support on The Escapist 2 series as soon as any kind of DLC prison drops I will be straight on it

hey guys we're back I am so glad that you guys love this video so much because I did not expect honestly to love playing this so much because I just randomly picked it I had no research behind it whatsoever we did a lot of things if you aren't caught up yet you can go back and watch that video or you can listen to me right now me and Travis here who's lost his googly eyes but the dog oh right here has the googly eyes they must have switched that is that's hilarious we spawned into a new world we started a brand new adventure where the trees are almost round which is a little bit weird out and the bee sting but we spawned in the goddess rights here and she is allowing us to continue or she allowed us to begin our journey now I cannot remember what I was doing let's speak to you nature is really beautiful isn't it tell are you gonna say hey my darling how have things been they've been fantastic oh she can say what the weather is tomorrow the Sun will be shining all day you'll be beautiful I can actually remember what voices I used I have no idea we also died in here which was fantastic we have a thousand gold which is amazing we gained a dog I think we have another one but it died and we also build the carpentry we didn't build this by hand you lift the man here he did it by hand and he opens a he opened a shop so that we can buy things now I have a thousand gold which isn't a lot but I want to I want three thousand God's to build a general store we were surprised I creams and stuff as well which is quite cool and just a load of other stuff as well right uh Jade how's it going the hard you see while I'm talking to people is how much they like you they like your lot you can get married to them wow I didn't actually know that that's that's pretty impressive you live in in state I'm not sure but I'm hungry so let's see a pork job so last time I put Surma turnips inside here so that I could get some money I'm not sure how much money is gonna be made from these so let's go ahead and sleep because that forwards today because you can actually sleep in the day in this pack so let's see what happens  boy we got some money I'm guessing 27 we got one gold per turnip that's that's really bad I thought water these ones hopefully make some more money from them right so I actually need to make some shears or I need to drink something I named a bottle of water so in here we also have thirst we have to earn our hearts as well which is pretty crazy we can level up our items and stuff too so our sword is level 2 what else we haven't got emeralds we've got an achievement book what does it actually do bill with the blacksmith bill the cafe oh wow there's a town hall and mining huts build the goddess pond oh you have to you have to take him off yourself okay buy a soul cage oh my goodness is so much fish up a message in a bottle there's so many things here Oh table wolf and equip of diamond wolf armor that's cool it's a shame we don't have anything to show the recipes otherwise that would be really really handy right I need to collect some flowers coz I need to get some more turnips and I think it's five flowers give you a turnip okay so I should be able I think I've got ya got five of these so let's just give her these five thanks for the flowers here have a bag of seeds thank you thank you so much turnip seeds perfect I forgot how many this gives us i holly gets us nine so every five flowers gives us nine gold but how do I get more gold that seems really low okay I've just done some research and apparently these ones have I got five I definitely counted wrong oh no I do have five let me see if she will take these flowers off me just a friendly reminder if you want some okay oh she took them she took them so these take five days to grow with they're worth sixty gold each that's right this is a gold mine now I'm not actually sure what the sickle does because I messed it up I accidentally oh geez accidentally just broke that denying excuse me guys you need to you need to get out the way excuse me no don't trample come this way oh my goodness yeah upon reading this pack is really deep you can actually sell a lot of different things I don't really want to sell the goddess flower that'd be a bad idea can I so like pork chops no um what happened to you yeah I really want to know what the sickle does okay let's read some documentation the first achievements are to give you a helping hand in the beginning of this pack get some glass bottles and fill them with water to stay hydrated done that mine some iron and craft the buckets Mota doors do not spawn in the world you buy those from the blacksmith okay we've done that summon the harvest goddess we've done that talk with her again and she should begin to tell you how to begin your town done that logs we've done carpentry we've done harvest goddess against continued tutorial we've done this we've done this we've done this we've done this we've done sell your fish and crops by right-clicking the shipment box on the ground and then sleep to get your money okay right it's about a fishing rod we have one string now I think that means we need to go back down there oh wait actually we just grabbed it from here this is perfect haha what actually happened to you did you um did you fall in something brown or black I don't know I don't know I don't even ask right apparently as well lots of stuff like chicken and sheep but don't actually on earth my craft a fishing rod there we go but yet chicken and sheep and cows they do not spawn that well at all and they don't respawn which is why we're seeing so many pigs so that's good to know doing tasks like farming and stuff reduce your hunger which is also pretty crazy well I'm gonna do some fishing and see what we can grab which is boots message in a bottle there are any of you here do any of you want to be real knitting sold for gold no literally nothing is happening I just want I just want to fish or to just to sell hey right I'm gonna break into this because I'm bored of fishing already oh my goodness what has happened to these horses but no way stay there stay there I need to get a picture of this this horse oh no that's not quite how it's supposed to don't don't smile about it buddy it's not quite out the googly eyes are supposed to work that's too funny has it happened to you no hasn't happened to you oh my goodness that is so funny I am very much amused right I need to I'm gonna break into this and see what's going down I kind of need some or anyway just because I need to make some more tools apparently ores are really hard to get hold of in this as well from these generated structures all this loads there's so much in here it's like an egg of iron all right that should be enough my plan now is I really want to buy the store like desperately because that's how I'm gonna start getting things how much is its weight what are you closed no you left pop these in here that's not gonna be enough ah the normal stuff is so hard to get in this weight this is wooden fishing rod I wonder if you can craft any better ones maybe that's why we're not getting decent things I have no idea right let's fill this up let's go ahead and water our crops cuz these these are the money makers guys they may take five days to grow but these are gonna earn me monies because for every ten if they do sell for sixty for every ten that we sell we'll get 600 gold that's crazy choice okay so I desperately need the recipe thing just because there's not much documentation on how I can do things so I'm gonna get the recipe thing just waiting for you left shop to open and I'm just gonna keep on sleeping until my turnips are ready because I need the money what's also worth noting is your hunger goes back to normal every time you sleep which is quite nice oh yeah check this out I got myself it's are there fireworks fireworks everywhere for the turnip well let's see how much these get us because this is gonna be pretty intense actually I'm gonna sleep once more and then get all of these times they think what where did that come from let's surround it right let's sleep and then we're gonna sell these turnips there they are it's raining I don't know if that helps us at all but actually it does look it's keeping all of our turnips watered cuz these shouldn't be watered right now give me all the turnips give me all the turnips there's one that's missing this one's taking its time that's absolutely fine you know what we've got 34 turnips this should give us so much money it is unreal let's pop them all in here and then if we sleep we should get loads of money and worried that it's raining as well this guy is still a little bit I don't know why but let's sleep and see how much money we get we got 1027 I'm ready give me the gold yeah we made like we made 2,000 Gold's that's insane and we got this one that just didn't want to grow for us right I just need to wait for you lifts to open so I'm gonna go and get some more flowers just so I can get some more turnips cuz we can make so much money just by selling these pink little turnips normally you ignore like regular minecraft flowers but these ones these ones are making me so much money I am I'm so excited oh no I'm thirsty I'm thirsty no where's my bottle of water quick I can't take too much damage because I've only got five hearts fixed it that's a rabbit wearing a tuxedo oh my goodness how do I keep this guy how do I keep him look at him look he's wearing a tuxedo um I need some string I need a slime ball to make a leaves don't I uh where is he there he is word it succeed oh oh that's that's hilarious I'm amazed absolutely amazed right you lifts should be open now which means where are these rocks moving which means I should be able to buy myself the general store 3 K I need a hundred and ninety-two wood and 64 stone Oh No how much Woods is a hundred G I'm just gonna buy this quickly justjust one you you charge me $100 one piece of woods are you serious right now I'm gonna square up to you if you ripped me off again buddy right I need to sell you some flowers right 5 turnips I think we need to make our farm bigger so this is it 1 and then where's my ways me Oh 2 3 4 and then we need 5 s we need one more I know are you thinking this is looking like a real mess right now and I'd agree with you but it's making me money so it's gonna have to stay like that for now is my iron done it certainly is let me put some of this stuff away cuz I just don't need it give me this I need it I'm going to the wood that I just put away and I need an axe and I also need what else do I need you live you know if I can't even speak to you I'm pretty sure I need three stacks of wood which is madness okay I'm getting there with the stacks but I've also found out that these birds nests are actually quite good so let me just quickly crack these open because they can give apparently they can give fish your bones breads okay I wonder if I can sell breads that'll be awesome I'm just gonna crack all these open and see what they give oh gold nugget that's actually amazing I got way too much stuff right now reckon I could uh let me just try and tame this dog come on buddy come on buddy yeah I got two dogs now one with what my Google eyes and one without about you what about you what about you nope I've been taking down these massive trees and I mean like absolutely huge trees right we just need some more dark oak and then I think we need stone which is gonna be annoying if it has to be smooth stone that's gonna be frustrating where I'm just gonna go and see what materials we need just before you have closes his shop but hey how much do you need shop you need 64 yes smooth stone I think that is so we're gonna have to smelt lap but that is definitely three stacks which isn't so bad right I'm gonna see we can sell bread we can let's see how much it gives us 3027 we should probably make like a list of how much stuff is worth goes up to 197 okay that's actually 170 so that is 85 each I think that's pretty good though and these bad boy is almost ready the money's coming in guys we're doing well there we go three stacks of wood actually the iron axe did that whole thing by itself I am impressed I think I saw a um the bird's nest down here there it is let's see what we got inside don't even know sticks sticks Archie pretty Goods now we just need the weed the stones let's start grabbing this there we go a stack of stone which we now need to smelt and then I think we could buy ourselves the store which is great great news I wonder if he'll let us buy it with normal stone let's have a shop general store buy no land stubborn has to be smooth so this is gonna be awkward isn't it I need some coal hey check this out I've got bird's nest atop BAM I got myself some sticks a flint is pretty goods as well in another bird's nest how do I get all these birds nests I got some golden nuggets that's actually sweet right let's uh let's harvest all these bad boys oh my goodness this is like just harvesting money it's beautiful so this is basically the premise of this pack you harvest as much as you can the better crops that you harvest the more money you make and the bigger towns that you can build and the goal is to make as big a town as you can we've got 43 of these bad boys let's put them all into the shipment box and let's make some moolah here we go 3197 up and two five seven seven seven we're rich so rich well I guess we are rich trellis we also have two dogs now one is looking amazing one not so sorry Oh two more of these don't mind if I do I'm literally only waiting for these to smelt yeah I'm using woods and then we can buy the store so missus wait this is the last one come on yes okay I think that is everything that we need three stacks of woods stone if this has to be awkward I'm gonna punch you square between the eyes buddy I swear right looking for a new building let me help you I certainly well right bye yes it worked ah yeah right oh my goodness this thing is massive I started clearing out an area but I didn't realize it was gonna be that big I'm so excited so excited Oh Oh what's that what's that what's that achievement I got sky at the beginning pick up a mystical flower from the Worlds oh this we saw them last time okay that's fine I gotta achieve for it and some fireworks all right Charles excuse me um how big is this thing I kind of want it to go here let's see and we just need to go back a couple of blocks actually way more than a couple of blocks this thing is huge why is it so big for I'm get rid of this go away go away oh no these bees are horrible Oh ours is getting stung by them bees go away go away I think this is a good place to go it's so tall as well I kind of want everything on one on one lane I swear these bees we just go back to just before the beehives stop that oh my goodness what are these bees doing stop it stop it how do I get rid of this beehive are getting stung because I've only got five hearts and I get killed by bees I'm gonna be so mad no their proper hurting me oh we've got some more fireworks forgetting some berries I'm guessing where are the berries areas Domitian food returns start after eating any food what I don't even know what I'm saying I know it's getting dark and I want this thing built I think that's it if we just put it down was it here I think we've nailed it I think we've nailed it yes we've nailed it okay so I need to sneak and right-click and you live is gonna get building go you magical human being I probably shouldn't have allowed you to build this in the water should I actually I'm gonna help you out buddy don't worry

here I don't know why it keeps lagging by the way it's kind of annoying I try and fix it for next time he's been a proper cellar down here I think he's also getting battered by the bees as well so I should probably sort the bees out this is crazy though I should probably get out before he starts caving me and the bees start attacking this is mad right let's leave him to it and then see what he builds this guy is a complete and utter crazy man how can he just build this with his bare hands it's impressive no this is like proper updating it as well this is cool it's the star of our village

Right so here's the deal, Fortnite Battle Royale I have put 66 hours and 38 minutes Into the game and currently I'm on eight wins, which I don't think it's too bad. The problem is I've never caught one on stream Plenty of second places, and I've never caught one when I've been recording either so today. I'm gonna sit down I feel like I'm getting better at the game. I feel like it's just *Snap* Snapped inside my brain, so we're gonna try it today to get a win on camera by any means necessary Today's loadouts is the brand-new red knight which was re-released and also the ax caliber axe these Combinations are so good and you get Excalibur from level 35 of the battle pass which I've now completed So that further ado, let's do this actually know what first thing to show you something. This is something I did by complete chance, so we'll set up on my route of choice, and I'm chasing down at this particular gentleman over here He's just behind the house. I build up. I start taking some shots, and then he just like Disappears so I go back take some cover and I decide to throw some grenades because he's put up a wall And I know where he is and watch where this grenade goes look at the top of your screen That's right. That wasn't even him I throw a grenade up to go over that wall it lands perfectly in the house and Killed someone yeah, that's one of the craziest things I've ever done by accident, but enough of that Let's play here. We go attempt number one am I here by myself That's freaky. No. There's someone already landed on the floor Oh my goodness right they're gonna come in through the front door. Let's Surprise them come on come on What what they're definitely around here guys? I don't think there's any chests, but there's a shield potion okay that I don't medkit Oh my goodness. Oh, there is a chest in here. Okay. Close the door, please. Thank you alright. We've doubled shield heads Let's grab these and let's go can we just admire how good this looks by the way with the red knight in the red? Excalibur look sweet gunfire. I hear it. Okay, so over in those trees over there I reckon I could get a good hit on these guys. Hi hello. I'm coming in. I'm coming in Hahahaha Gotcha Okay, that'd be when well. I think that might be the only other person here though rings on us as well So we're doing alright so far. It's too quiet It's way too quiet here. I just spotted another person. They are in that tree there. They are can you see them? Oh my goodness, oh that was a long shot. Oh my words that was cool for with a green AR as well okay, no Chester, Rooney's in here I'm gonna gonna loop that guy I Wonder where he was running that seems really random guys the triple medkits star And I got myself a sniper from this guy - yo, that was some good looting jeez Pourings on us again now that we've got that um now that we've got that sniper. We're in a way better position I don't know what to do. I think I'm gonna hold the minis just cuz I've got full shield at the moment This is weird glitch - with the building at the moment. I'm not sure why well you accidentally builds flats pieces? Which is super annoying guys? I can't even explain, right? I'm gonna go up to the top of here build a little oh geez oh geez oh geez oh geez oh geez Yes, oh Dude, that felt good that felt really good also another random glitch by the way if you um if you kill someone The aim-assist still kind of homes in on their dead body. It's really weird right now I can actually grab this and let's quickly jug this Super dangerous area, but it's fine. Could you I remember that heart he crept up on me though I was like I have footsteps. I definitely have footsteps and there he was BAM He had a lot of brick as well, which is cool right this is our base for now This is going for the win. This is first attempt remember the only people that can be higher than me are over there There's someone coming up the top there. They're going up. They're definitely going up here. We go here. We go snipe of the year was terrible oh We're in the next ring as well, okay This is actually sweet now the other hill is also in the next ring and there's still 15 people left which is a lot So we need to be super careful But I think we'll be okay Woah Yes, that was powerful right this guy is coming up, and there's someone shooting him What okay they're down there perfect right? I am going to See what's going down I? Just jumped. That's why you jumped guys that is why you jump so something. I'm desperately missing our explosives No, I am being sniped no don't let it end like this, but I'm so well so far I don't know where that snipe came from aha aha Yeah, buddy snipe number 2, bro. This is getting insane So there's two people there, or there's one Nutcracker. I'm not sure Where is that coming from it's at this bush? No, it's not a bush. Okay rings not too far from us. Actually. There's like annoyingly a tree in the way of us sniping that guy - wait Wyatt Someone is trying to grenade us. Where did it come from? That was close, okay, it's coming from down there somewhere. I feel like I'm a prime target right now Okay, I am getting sabotage by two angles right now So I'm trying to work out what my best bet is this is gonna be tricky There's seven people left which is actually quite a lot Okay things are about to get crazy Yes, yes yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, so we've got decent kills This is the craziest game so far, and I've kind of blocked myself in because I had my ramps the wrong way round There's decent loo over there. My goodness. Okay, we need to go I think I'm gonna die here, but I need to at least try it out I've got a chug chug going on as well not so bad a scar a campfire Grenade launcher oh geez I don't even know what to take grenade launcher. I'm taking you all right. This is gonna. Be risky I don't know if I should be doing this right now, but I think I'm doing okay. Okay? There's only three people left Where is everyone there's got to be someone in this house right I'm gonna chug this actually because I've got 15 seconds This is nerve-racking first game's takes forever it already does, but we're in the next ring. I didn't realize All right, let's do this anyone inside good. It's definitely someone around us. You ain't coming up how can that be three people left, dude That's two people left. That's one people that's one person left, and I'm pretty sure That underneath yeah, they're right there Yes, oh my goodness Yo! Ah dude That is literally I'm not even kidding you some of the best play I have ever done what we got chug chug in there as well finishing with 100 100 Oh my goodness You don't know how long I wanted to capture a victory royale in a video or in a stream and there it is Yes high five high five Shh Yes, so about the skin choice you see it's all about you know the right night It's not like we didn't even try either. Seven kills isn't the highest, I know But we got some sick Snipes that bit at the end was pretty cool where I opened the floor. I've never done that before *oh hi bird* There's a bird trying to get my window. We have a scale that mountain as well, which was pretty scary oh my goodness I don't know what to do now.

Right. What do I need to do next I need to do the cash register. I'm not gonna use my flashlight unless I need to You can hear him picking up those pennies. You know Mr. Krabs always picking up those pennies. Wait what's that sound? Oh, those are notes. I thought that was the slash slinging blasher coming in oh no no no quick quick quick Ah, ah no Oh that was close I think all I have left is to take the money, I think that's it We're actually done here. Are we done here already? I'm a little bit worried that we locked in though from seeing that earlier all objectives complete find the key in the basement lock up And get out No of course it makes it harder shall I um at least it's actually 3:00 a.m.. This is no click bang I'm gonna wait for him to actually appear and we'll start aware that one time He was actually in my office, which I'm - There he is. Which I'm not too happy about He's so creepy. Let's go. I'm guessing. This is the basement right here. Oh man Wait the key is somewhere in the basement you must find it are you kidding me You actually kidding me is he down here Is the dude actually he's actually down here. He's actually down here. No no no aah, aah Leave me alone buddy leave me alone. It's okay. I love the music. I actually really like the music Oh geez he's behind me is he faster than me though that you have no idea. Oh this chase Music is so retro but I absolutely love it. No oh no, I'm dead, I'm so dead I'm so dead run Run he's right behind me okay. He's disappeared. That's good. Where is the key It's got to be around here somewhere. I can't jump so it can't be on top of any boxes hello I actually can't see anything right now all I'm gonna be able to see are the Reds of his eyes sir All I want is to go home count my money and go home where where is this key. Mr. Krabs how could you forget where your own key is? Don't want to get stuck anywhere, so I'm gonna leave my flashlight on until the music goes ha ha I Feel like I've been some kind of old school cartoon but I'm actually in spongebob ok he's gone I think as long as I don't have my flashlight on when the when the lights are flashing They should be ok I also feel like I'm running around in circles, which isn't good. Uh oh. Did I have my flashlight on I don't think I did. I Did just then though that was a bad idea. oh Oh, I can hear his feet there her is. No! No, I didn't have a light on when the things are flashing Where is the key? Where is the key is it gonna make me start again if I lose? I'm just a hide here. I'm gonna crouch behind a box. I can't see anything But I think we're OK I can hear his footsteps. Why can I hear his footsteps, No! Haha Forget it I'm just gonna run around and see if I can find the key by accident because I literally cannot find it anywhere I think I can - Oh is this it this is it. Yes. I found the key now get out of here, okay? I'm gonna do my best slash slinging blasher ah he's always touching me ah He's so close Geez please go away. Please go away. Please go away. I need to find the ladder where we came in Is he gone? Okay, he's gone right we need to be super careful now because if we die now I've no calves able to get my key back, and I don't feel like putting the Krabby Patties away again Where are SpongeBob and Squidward when you need them? Ha the ladders right there as long as he's not around. Okay. He's there He's there. Let's go. Let's go exit the basement I know where the key is supposed to be. You have the key now go outside and lock up. I don't trust this though Is he's still gonna be here. No time has passed. We're in like some kind of Space-time continuum if this is as nice as you thought it was I was about to say this is nice of it, I think it is so we're gonna be fine, but obviously not okay it stopped Let's just get out of here. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go Unlock the door Unlock the door Unlock the door What are you doing? Do I have to go out the front door. Okay. I think I have to go out the front door. There he is.

hey guys how's it going down here welcome back to Saturday hangouts also known as the subnautica hangout because today we're continuing with another that the another not another another subnautica episode last night we hit dry land which we are on at the moment and I just wanted to start this stream by saying this is the first stream of March which I am super excited about because again as always as we've started doing we are now donating everything that I make to charity and I also then match the donations so big announcement last month that we did our first month of this we meant well you guys managed to raise over 5,000 British pounds which is about seven thousand dollars so I matched that and we've managed to you donate over ten thousand US dollars nah I got it wrong over 10,000 British pounds which equals fourteen thousand US dollars to make a wish so um thank you guys seriously that is amazing I'm so proud of you guys it was awesome so thank you but I'm today we are now moving on to another charity for this month we haven't chosen it yet we're gonna choose it together at some point go ahead and follow me on Twitter because that's where our announcer at some point but for today let's just focus on subnautica I'm super excited I love this game so much I know you guys love this game so much so let me just get set up I'm all like untucked iknow and hopefully I can sort this out right so where do we leave last time we were on this island I'm pretty sure I was trying to make it up to that which I I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make it up to also a really cool thing if you are a sponsor of the channel then you now have a little diamonds next to your name in chat so if you're a subscriber or sponsor whatever it's cool you can try that out which is super awesome we also have a most emotes lots as well I'm not sure what they call them on um on YouTube I know why they call them on Twitch they're pretty much exactly the same thing but um yeah you should have some of those now as well I haven't made them yet so we'll get to those later but at least I had a little sub thing going which is gifts with be really really fun to try out okay let's get back on track I need to get up this mountain I'm not quite sure how I'm gonna get up this mountain but let's see the mo you know vlogs hen hen Bailey Gardner cheesy potato oh my goodness you're turning up

literally just walking up it right now okay let's see if we can get up higher okay okay this is working this is working it shouldn't be working yes oh my gosh watch it gonna make it yes Oh or on the lower on the wrong bit let's try going up here I'm not sure I have any food by the way guys hopefully we can find some it's decomposing no no no no no that wasn't supposed to happen I think I'm gonna eat that now I'm gonna eat that now just in case I can run short on foods there must be an easier way to get up there surely this isn't looking too too safe is it we're gonna try it anyway there must be a way to get up there I wish I was in Minecraft so I could like literally just literally just build up that would be amazing come on come on it's literally just that we can make it come on come on come on around the Koala nut throat bolt oh jeez I don't want to die I don't want to die I just want to get up here is there a way you can build up I don't really know maybe if we have actually let's try it where is my habitat builder let me see if I can do it if I could just build something just like a platform tonight Oh actually it might let me and my let me build a platform let's see if we can do this this is gonna be completely stupid but it's gonna be worth a try I have no lead on me all I have is titanium and then I can just get rid of it afterwards and I rotate it yes I don't know if I'm gonna be able to jump over to there this is gonna be so stupid but let's try it I don't know if I can do it no is there an easier way to get up here I'm not too sure there must be cuz this is like this is just not safe at all there's like no pathways I'm just falling down the mountain oh look at the aurora from here that looks insane I'm gonna guess that there's actually no way to get up here safely because there's no pathways I've literally walked all the way around the mountain and I can't find any pathways this is so weird don't die dan says the more you know vlogs I'm trying not to I'm trying not to write I think I might have to make my way home we have found a lot of cool stuff right now which is good we scan a few things we need more blueprints last time if you oceans should not have done that last time if you didn't see it we actually we encountered three ghost leviathans which was interesting to say the least what is going on I can't even get off this island if I wanted to but it was it was a pretty scary experience but you know what pretty fun at the same time to be honest I don't think we can make it up there there is a pathway use a platform I'm just gonna get back home cuz otherwise I am not gonna make it alive let me see if I can grab oh geez I think I need to grab some of these things I mean blood what did we grab I'm gonna grab those definitely what does

where is seamoth where are you oh jeez it's looking a little bit rusty here I'm gonna have to grab ourselves our repair to zap this bad boy there we go shiny brand-new and awesome right then let's head towards Cray Island I'm pretty sure that's where it is and let's see if we can continue this story I'm actually scared but at all one second I remember someone saying in the past that you should go ahead and grab those you know the purple tablets someone said that to me before so I'm gonna do that right now yeah I feel like that way more maneuverable way more fast as well which is good where

we're gonna do it anyway I'm excited actually because I completely forgot that we didn't go in here now I will warn you it could become a little bit laggy up here just because it's new territory and I seem to remember last time it got a little bit temperamental but let's go let's see what on earth is in here and let's do this oh my goodness is massive we have our rifle you know I'm gonna unequip the see glides go stasis rifle but if we've got a full-on aggressive loadout right now here we go this looks like something from Zelda you know what I mean well what's this oh it's so laggy I don't know why I think it's just cause it's generating new things do I put the tablet here let's have a look does anyone wait to find out oh you can't put them there there's something here though I'm just gonna walk it let's see what happens if it gets laggy I'm super sorry alright let's have a look down here this is exciting so exciting is vents it looks like there's something over here actually oh it's massive absolutely massive okay it's catching up a little bit it should be okay when we like inside the question is how do we get inside does anyone know bored toady's thank you so much for your donation as well and trying to catch everyone's names how do I get in here not in here is it down here I kinda don't want to go down there because I get killed right let's do it anyway switch to RC

son Sam thank you so much for the tent really appreciate it you know I'm gonna do guys at the end of the stream I'm gonna oh I'm gonna try and shout out as many people as possible just because I feel so bad that I can't catch up with them right now right what's this it's a Minecraft block we found it guys minecraft was creating this game we've got ion cube whoa whoa high-capacity alien energy source oh that's crazy oh my goodness I wonder what it is Esther and the brother Elijah hi how's it going nice - nice to see you guys hope you're enjoying the stream we're inside an alien base right now it's insane wait wait is this a teleporter this looks like you know if you've seen any sci-fi film this looks like a teleporter right definitely looks like a gel Evora let's have a look here wait does it go in here oh my goodness what do we do where is it right I feel like we can use the ion cube here okay maybe not we use any of these things here well maybe the iron cube is just you literally just grabbed the iron cube and that's it does anyone have any tips of what to do in here oh wait wait wait wait wait wait we found something is that a black stasis rifle that's insane it's like a it's like a crazed weapon this place has loads of floors as well I didn't realize this I'm just worried that we're gonna come across something that might kill us oh yes look purple tablet pick up purple tablet why do we have three of these now I'm so confused so confused let's keep going ninja jellyfish thank you so much that's I love your kind words and thank you for your 20 that's insane when it lags a little bit I'm like is generating something crazy that's definitely gonna kill us look at this hello are you gonna hurt me I don't hurt me I'm running I'm out of here I don't know what else to do I'm just gonna follow these paths around and see what we can find I'm sorry there's a force field up ahead that we might need to get rid of I saw some of you mentioned in the chat something about force fields okay so yeah it does ahh insert tablet let's do it instead I'm glad someone told me to take these with me yes yes you can get infected here I have already infected here so don't worry if I do the self Scout real quick look what's this I'm infected okay so hopefully there's an answer to our infection in this if not we're gonna die it's it's plain and simple oh my goodness this place is freaking me out okay can we set another tablet here interacts oh hi it's got me what is this I'm not touching anything it it's ejected me okay I'm gonna scan oh my goodness okay so I need to uninfected I can interact with this okay let's have a look at this oh dude there's more than one there's more than one of these scan the things in the glass things okay I'll do that on the way out thank you for that that's really really helpful okay so in the event of an outbreak quarantine procedures will be automatically enforced with immediate effect the quarantine enforcement platform will target all incoming and outgoing craft to prevent the spread of infection offworld so there's a disease on this world and that's why they didn't let the person land because because they would have potentially caught the infection and then got killed and then tend to like to send it somewhere else okay intercepted by Carlita disease research facility depth 800 meters location cave system with extensive fossil record southwest and enforcement platform inside an extensive natural rock formation in an area of intense volcanic activity there's also another sanctuary two other sanctuaries an off-site laboratory at a primary containment facility y'all there's more of these places that's Mads let's see if can we go can we interact again oh no we shouldn't done that we to find a cure 100% making some kind of alien noise right now right let's grab our scanner and let's scan things what can we scan why is he being so jittery sorry about the frames guys I don't know why it's doing it I should be running fine I'll fix it for next time oh my goodness you need to go to the Disease Research Facility is that wait 800 meters yeah we need to go there the cave system it's an 800 meters depth so we definitely need the prawn cave system with an extensive fossil record southwest of the enforcement platform whoo look they've they've named it as well the bacterium designated Cara so they do live specimen study that's us we're a specimens now we're specimens now what's the enforcement platform though is that this are we an enforcement platform there's only one way to find out right let's go scan some things just so we don't leave without that I think there's a couple more floors we can check out as well alien device let's see what this is it's a what a doomsday device scans indicate this device contains enough potential energy to destroy the entire planet however fortunately it has malfunctioned okay that's pretty intense that's very intense actually let me see if I can just change this quickly everything is on low let's do that just because things are lagging I don't know why it's fine unless I'm in this building I'm gonna blame the aliens ah there was more stuff to scan where was it yeah let's grab this this looks like a pretty insane alien rifle right here there we go alien rifle strong resemblance to human rep reduce design has been designed with a humanoid user in mind whether the aliens that built this structure wear themselves humanoid or otherwise employed to use human eyes is unclear there is no obvious way to remove the rifle from the case okay that's cool to know as well is this where we came in I don't know actually yeah this is the teleporter suite what I'm guessing it - teleporter we can't activate it unless we're we run bacteria we have no bacteria in us is there anything else to scan we got the big ball the rifle don't think there was anything over there no okay let's keep going I think that's as much as we're gonna find in here we've been up we've been down we've been around okay I think that's all we're gonna find we needed the location we got the location let's grab our c glide and let's get the bots out of here there we go that was amazing oh yeah I need to change this there we go we also need to be careful with any kind of aliens I just want to see what this is as well this looks like what is in the other room goodness yeah this is definitely like the other room but it's like outside the room so weird right where's my C glide I think it's around the other side that's cool though right that's super cool Bethany and Blake how's it going thanks for the five your dog pink puppy goes nuts for Dan no that's cool okay that was a definitely a teleporting guy I just want to be careful to not get killed around here there are some cool like minerals and stuff but I just need to get it back to my steam off there's also nasties down here so what I want to do next is getting our C glide I think we've got enough food and water to be able to try and find the bacteria Research Center I'm fairly sure whoa okay okay no problem buddy no problem I just want to it just fired something at me did you see that he just fight some crazy ball at me no I just want to go to my seat glides stop firing things there's no need disappear go away I wanna see more I want my steam off don't fire things at me oh geez quick quick quick quick quick get in get in I'm out go is he following me okay he's gone perfect right so yeah I wanted to go to the alien facility locations cave system with extensive fossil records southwest of the enforcement platform if this is the enforcement platform then Southwest is gonna be this way I'm just guessing that this is the enforcement platform it might not be it also says something with extensive fossil extensive fossil records Southwest but the enforcement but let's just see what happens I know there's gonna be scary things around here but let's at least try I feel like we the the Cyclops thing so that we can we can bring us Nazi guide we can bring the prawn over here I feel like that's what we need cuz this can only go down to 300 right now the prawn can go way higher these things after me I'm scared oh geez oh just a fish do you see that southwest southwest okay keep hitting fish if I go any deeper the seamoth is gonna get hurt how do we know if it has lots of fossils well the good news is if this is the right way to go then it's in between the crazy island thing and also our home so we should I'm just trying to see if I can find any fossils that it's talking about oh okay let's try well it's gonna be a see what's going down there are any fossils in here that'll be fantastic oh geez don't touch those got a diamond perfect always goods it doesn't look like there's anything I can go much deeper as myself than in the seamoth for now let me see let's go a bit deeper we've got a little bit of breath left I'm kind of just looking for cool stuff as well this looks like it could be cool I think we've got the propulsion cannon let me scan it anyway yeah we have got it at least we've got some titanium oh geez it's gonna be hard to find this thing without using the prawn but the prawn is like it only goes along the seabed wait this is a big gold thing I need that um I comment what it's called I need something so I can cut it open these islands let's try and visit these islands there they're like there's something that could be on these they're protected like crazy though look at all these um knees nothing up there these guys attack yeah that yep they attack okay let's not do that I'm trying to see if there's any kind of fossils on here cuz that's what he was talking about right okay okay means to be super careful hmm let's keep going you can tame stalkers that's cool re McDuck thank you so much for the donation I just saw that in the chat I really appreciate it trying to find some other cool stuff as well there's lots of metal salvage around here I just want to find as much cool stuff as I can I need some more blueprints as well oh man things are getting tense real tense Oh a wreckage I don't know if we've been here yet but we're gonna try it anyway nothing in there nothing down there [Music] have we been to this wreckage cuz I need to find the Cyclops bridge but I don't know I don't know where it is that was useless I'm trying to see if I can find any parts of it it's in the Lost River or Jesus guy is shooting me how'd you know what each biome is is there a way to tell need the pawns to drill army I need that - I just need loads of more wreckages because I don't feel like I found enough to scan enough blueprints actually what is this wait a second what is this seamoth fragment I've already got that you don't need it you define as many wreckages as I can this is another seamoth fragment I'm pretty sure oh bioreactor I think I have this I'm gonna scan it any way I can get the titanium for it yeah we've got that there's nothing in there nothing in there bioreactor again metal salvage I don't really need right now shut up Molly called Cassidy I've just seen that in the chat as well thank you again guys if you've just tuned in we are raising money every time as we do all the time with our streams were raising money for charity Weiss is getting hurt so much is it because I'm hitting the fish that we Alerus wait a second this looks promising I'm good for fuel and stuff as well as good oh yeah we're raising money for charity which is awesome Adam oh I'm getting so many donations that unfortunately I just can't read them out right now but I do appreciate every single one I promise you yeah it's so crazy I mean so many donations I just can't catch up with them otherwise I wouldn't be playing the game which would be insane so what by a million right now it's like someone told me that the mushrooms are important buy the mushroom biome there's something important down here I don't feel like we've discovered this that much Walda I'm just trying to see if there's anything interesting around here we have these like crazy glowing aliens but I'm not sure they're aggressive because they don't seem to be bothering with me right now which is fine I don't mind that oh okay let's be careful don't to destroy this do I know yet anyway oh what's this I think that's just a desk piece oh no it is exactly what we need yes we got it Cyclops bridge Cyclops bridge let's not do this in the open let's get our CMOS and take a look Cyclops bridge is exactly what we needed what does it require plans for building a cyclops Cyclops engine oh no we need the actual thing what's the difference between a blueprint oh we need it for our we must have to create it in the what's it goods I can't remember the names of these things we need to create it in the vehicle the vehicle thing you guys know what I'm talking about I'm trying to see what else we can craft right now the mobile vehicle bay that's what I'm talking about it is kind of like some weird vehicle let's see if we can find the blueprints for the actual Cyclops though cuz it says zero out of one I'm not quite sure what that means let's keep going anyway well I let me have a look here there's a sea Emperor and eggs hatch and the baby poops cure you what no way did you get cured by pooping this game that's insane thank you out of my shell gaming that's cool right I feel like the mushroom biome is actually really important because you guys have mentioned it a few times before I've just never found it that much where is the way home Spencer do more for Knight videos I will I'm just kind of practicing for tonight at the moment let's go this way and try to find some wreckage on the way mangle fun time foxy with a 50 thank you so much really appreciate it gonna have to repair this thing when we get home as well she's done a lot of damage to itself well technically I've done the damage I guess man I guess so lost in this game it's been 40 minutes already that's crazy right let's go home let's see if we what we can do with this Cyclops blueprint and then we need the actual Cyclops research but we could get it if is there how'd you get the Cyclops I'll do a research in a second oh my goodness oh lordy Geordi gamer says helpful advice Dan stay on an island and look at sea for a while the sea Emperor will talk to you someone said that's me before you might have but that sounds pretty insane little pump thanks Jodi Jodi game ins Ethan the happy gamers Spencer jayleen s/m hunter zig zag mangle you leo mike mins dark crow I keep hitting fish Oh apex get my bring an extra air tank you can switch between the two I did not know that that's good to know thank you alright let's get on to our little base over here and let's see what you can do we can't sleep as well which is handy don't really - just yet actually I will let's sleep Ari McDuck McDuck oh my goodness do you remember him oh gee fans will remember him oh my gosh I thought I don't know what happened then I thought I was having a nightmare happy wolf gaming mushy man Casper and poopy butts my goodness your names are so just outrageous sometimes right where are they gonna go what was I gonna do I was gonna go to here I did not mean to pick it up funtime foxy 100 thank you so much buddy I do not mean to pick that up pop it down let's climb this thing and let's see what we can do I don't know how this works Cyclops ingredients unknown see I'm so confused so with the Cyclops what I've got in my blueprints is the Cyclops engine blueprints and the Cyclops bridge blueprints but I don't have the Cyclops what is the difference I'm gonna have a quick research psycho subnautica let's have a look Cyclops is a player control submarine using it's a quick with a vehicle bay able to store a single thing the player can customize it unlike most other blueprints the player must find and scan three different sets of fragments in order to craft so we need the engine which we've done the bridge which we've done but you also need the hull it's in the sea traders path the floating island and the mushroom forest so we need to go to the mushroom forest again where we can find it we can also go it's on the floating island as well and it's also in the sea traders path all the sea traders look terrific like really horrific let's go back to the mushroom place and see if we can find it I might need a couple snacks real quick because what we need to do is when we get the Cyclops what we can do is take the prawn soup with us so that we can try and find so we can try and find keys in picking up these I don't need them we need to find the cure for the alien disease station I think it's called something like that I'm gonna grab Gary fish come here I'm gonna grab some boomerangs to eat as well to cook up some lunch keeping things whaling and I'm like what is that what is coming to Evie this time all right let's create some food better boom Gary fish tasty go to the Aurora's find a cyclops fragments okay I'll take a look it didn't say it was there though I've got some of them connect the scanner room to the multi-purpose room together with a t-shaped tunnel and put a door in it so you don't need to have the two doors okay I'll do that don't worry gonna eat some things right now let's eat this this and this I'm just gonna cook one more boomerang there we go I haven't creeper thanks for the sponsor buddy eat right do any new things in crafts tools no don't need any of these things right now I think we're good okay we've got some water I can never remember the recipe of for this bleach let me just look up bleach real quick I know this is annoying I have to do it there's so many recipes coral tubes samples do I have any of those there no in there this we could grab some quick I just want to create some some bleach just to get as much water as possible slice like I have only have one salt I swear I picked up more now hourlies give us to water anyway we can store the rest thank you alright let's make some bleep start give us two more waters there we go the shark chased you I know it's sharks are always chasing me right now Libya Sherwood Laker s Caesar been the guy of good nice Jordan diamond creeper and QL quo quo I think that's your name thank you so much for the donations Slash's subscribing / sponsoring whatever it's called thank you for doing it it's all going to a great cause we don't know what the cause is yet because we'll decide later on in the month but for now it's going to a good cause okay so do we go back to the mushroom place and guessing we do just to try and find more of that wall the wall it was in between our two things was an Aurora island and the red one there we go Cray Island it was in between our two little bases 100% I need to repair this as well just because it's getting a little bit a little bit damaged which is fine polemic play Garry's Mod there's new more than I like the super old video when you played it yeah you know I've always been meaning to go back to Garry's Mod I just never have for some reason Spencer when will I do unnamed minecraft thanks for the 1999 buddy I will do it at some point probably it won't be today it won't be tomorrow but it might be the day after it's not this is it pretty sure it's not any of these things it kind of looks similar to that other piece though it's gonna check them all because the Cyclops would be amazing to get in this in this session what's this a trash can don't need a trash can I think we've already done that Audrey huh God thank you so much for the ten really appreciate it I'm trying to shout out as many people as possible I promise you okay so the enforcement platform is where we were a moment ago that's good to know we just need to make sure that we can get the prong suit over there go to the depth that we need to and then we're gearing we've got a plan we've got a plan we're gonna master plan I'm just gonna increase actually I'm gonna save it's gonna increase my draw distance real quick it's here somewhere you know I'm just gonna leave it for now let's keep going there's more wreckage over here which I feel like we've definitely looked over a lot of times and none of it looks like the Cyclops is a trash can actually have we this looks scary let's have a look this might be the one we died in actually I say we I died in I currently see anything new oh wait a second I'm saying that just metal no let's keep going that's gonna go to the mushroom place and then if we find anything on the way there we'll do that can i play Terraria again I will at some point it's a it's a long game though takes a lot of something that's firing at me again takes a lot of concentration to low concentration it takes a lot of time to get through right we made it so we definitely know where the mushrooms are just kind of quickly you know what I'm just gonna quickly repair this there we go let's get out let's repair this real quick no I don't wanna get in I want to repair it just in case I don't want it to yeah I don't want it to explode how it be horrible there we go our repair tool is almost broken now though it's a little bit scary right let's go to the base floor and let's see if we can find ourselves this last Cyclops fragment I don't know how many will needs for some reason my depth of field isn't that great right now we turn it up it's annoying me that's not it I want the render distance calibrating off water quality bloom there's a dirt depth of field motion blur I guess it's just as it is right guess it's just as it is okay that's for him which is gonna have to go low and slow craftable gaming for the 50 thank you oh look it's one of those fans when those alien fans let the people went in oh jeez the people just got sucked in oh what a shame what a shame and just wait something blue by the way what's a creature egg no I don't want to those just yet oh what's this moon pool do I need this I think I might do yeah we got it this is a good place to be we just got the moon pool perfect it's down here somewhere here it is vehicle docking bay with high energy and structural requirements okay that's cool there's another moon pool fragment we don't need that now now that we discovered it I'll take the titanium though see this is the place we needed to be we haven't actually staged or discovered this part that often if it's Hall I think we came across it once but didn't actually explore it that much I'm gonna get as much solace again I think it's go right on to buy my own steam off as well which is cool ah this looks promising that might be the bridge though I think this is the bridge yeah we don't need the bridge I'm gonna scan it anyway just in case lucky the scanner doesn't need power so we're good it looks like these are kind of peaceful aliens which is also quite nice and refreshing I'm looking for like it's like a grill kind of shape which is what we're looking for scan the area a little bit whoa look at this that's a big old hunk of something that's a big old hunk of salt that's crazy right let's see if there's anything over here we needs moving pool fragment Cyclops bridge that's not what we needs creature ergo in one of those look all the bridges around here it's a lot of bridges there's also a lot more of this mushroom place so we're gonna do a little bit more exploring don't worry the diamond words pack I think that was your name thank you so much for the donation really appreciate it buddy well these creature eggs do you imagine having a habitat must be really cool we will work to that at some point but for now come scour seamoth on and try and find these pieces that's all I need to make the Cyclops and then we can go looking for the diseased place it's kind of a weird thing to say oh wait a second is this it I don't think this is it no that's not it that's a shame it looks similar to that though it's like yeah like a vent or a grill something like that we're finding pieces though we're finding a lot of pieces my goodness it's like a vault yes garden this is what we need how many we need of them three I came in need two more of those yes I'm so glad we found it ah there we go there's a lights we'd find two more of those Caleb Ayla thank you so much for the 20 just sweat it out in the chat as well thank you so much let's find these hull pieces I'm feeling confident now that we found one I know that we're actually where we need to be trying not to run over the aliens as well I don't want to make them mad hmm where are ya where are ya I know you're around here somewhere these giant like balls we definitely need the prong drill arm I think we've researched it we just need to know how to craft it is it it yes number two just need one more one more a jelly right I'm gonna scan this yeah I'm trying to scan you try to scan you buddy scanned beautiful right we just need one more of those and then when our mission is complete which is awesome come on I said I sensed you around here somewhere and then one popped up what is this the Cyclops bridge okay we don't need that we need the hull come on come on just one more it's so frustrating when all you need is one more piece you must be around here somewhere it must be I think as well we care and go a little bit higher to the right and then we should be able to find some more bits I'm just gonna keep on going see if we can find it we're so close it has turned to night time as well which worries me a little bit but don't worry jayleen II got to go bye thank you for hanging out thank you for the tent as well really really appreciate it as always hope you enjoyed your time here oh there's swing over there I just hit another oh what's this so I cops howl we did it guys we did it we found it I did get run over by my c glide again but it was worth it so worth it we did it thank goodness right mission accomplished let's get back to base we did it I'm so excited or I can read some more of these now again I'm so sorry I can't get through these donations guys there has been literally hundreds possibly even a thousand in the previous stream where I also couldn't keep up there were over a thousand donations if I spend one second that's a thousand seconds there's a thousand seconds when I'm not playing the game it's it's nuts I can't I can't explain how crazy the support is I thank you so much guys I'll try to get as many messages as we can ed davies spencer super ashe spencer asked what i do more roblox videos $14.99 thank you so much for the donation buddy i went in the future i tried recording a few roblox videos recently but i just wasn't feeling it there aren't any great games out there at the moment plc I will play hat in time at some point I did record it recently I did a stream on it but that was a stream where I just was literally reading our names the whole time so I didn't upload it so we didn't get that far Alex mr. diamond Caleb Baylor I've already said Kelly Lynn and Grayson blocks gamer jettster creeper Queen diamond swords pack ninja jellyfish Jalen a meal or meme lord thank you so much Kelly Lin sisters can do it Helen the cool ed Davies Spencer I think I've caught up with everyone so far right let's do this this is not well supposed to do I want to go to my vehicle Bay I think it said we did research the Cyclops oh let's have a look shall we here it is we need play steel ingot enameled glass advanced wiring kit lubricant and lead so the thing that's gonna take us the longest is the play steel ingot we need 30 I think we need 30 titanium for that let's see we might be okay you mean craft at least one yeah that's one so play steel requires lithium as well do we have six lithium I fear that we don't one two three we only have three that's worrying right we need let's go get the titanium actually let's do a sleep let's go get the titanium let's see if we can craft the Cyclops before the end of this I don't know if we will we're gonna give it to the we're gonna give it a go though I feel like we're making decent progress with your help as well which is awesome right we need as much space as we can get and we're running out of locker space I might need to craft another Locker let's do that actually more lockers less problems alright let's even grab one a bulkhead provides structural support and prevents flooding ooh vehicle upgrade console oh yeah we have the moonpool now don't we I completely forgot quartz and titanium do how many quartz diamonds I think we do more diamonds that's magnetites we actually don't have any court so let's grab some courts and then we can get some more stuff it's gets more titanium as well let's do this and then we can get the prawn commissioned properly so that it can actually take us to the deep deep depths we haven't gone further than like I want to say 300 maybe 300 meters down but this means with the prawn we can go I think to 800 maybe even more as the courts we needed perfect should be some more metal salvage down here I'm not gonna take my um seam Arthur just gonna stick with a glide for now I can pick up two more metal savages which will be able to create us our next thing we also will need to find some lithium at some point right here's a metal salvage just grab another one should be around here somewhere they're pretty common so we should be able to find one where are they where's the salvages I know there's a lot around here it's kind of hard to see in the red though I thought that was something I know there's a wreckage along here so there's definitely gonna be some down here somewhere where is it Oh er what about this wait a second what is this we should go down here at some point I don't know if I have a beacon door knock but at least it's closed Spencer thank you so much with another 20 buddy really appreciate it metal salvage I'm gonna drown let's not drown we've done that before I think we've only died twice which is goods the diamond sword facts says what's the progress of the grow-your-own park if you go to a video like two days ago I will show you the progress that's as big as it's gonna get right here's the male salvage down here I can see it there's at least some metal there should be some Salvage near it got salt we got the limestone crop no Salvage though what a vending machine we scan the vending machine I want the vending machine I think we might have scammed one actually you know there we got some perfect right let's get out of here how far are we from home actually pretty far I don't know how we made it that far gap can I be in the long dark I've heard of that I've never actually played it though so I will do at some point Pina plays James McKellen's the bro squad MLG pugs alive cool dudes no worries every little amount is awesome Kelly Lin cool strong and Nicolas Aragon literal LD DJ Thomas crinkle tube Sisters can do it expert gamers cloudy tube leo LT n shiny XQ Kelly Lin and sister can do it again thank you so much for your donations guys and your sponsors really appreciate it alright we should be near home now and we've got our first little bits to be able to make our Cyclops the Cyclops is actually well expensive not as expensive the prongs ooh actually I take that back they could have been way more expensive right here we go titanium and then we can make a big old fat piece of titanium here we go need our lithium for that everybody that's why I need so how many of those do we have now we have two right well two of those I think we needed three please steel ingots for it my mum where is it where is it yeah we need three pretty steel ingots enamel glass advanced wiring kit I'm not actually sure the advanced wiring kit needs silver we have that we have I'm pretty sure we have everything we need for the wiring kit that's gonna be fine the lettuce find the lubricant is fine it's just the place steel ingots that we need to find which means we just need a little bit more lithium and that's all we've got lots of lead salts copper golds what else do we have diamonds yes see we've only got like two lithium which is crazy how many more Titanium's we need 10 more Titanium's and we're good let's make another locker while we're here yeah I'm gonna need titanium so I can put some stuff back I don't need these tablets anymore let's put that away thataway actually I need some water diamond salts quartz all that good stuff we found some silver out and about as well that's good let's drink this up and let's go I would need some food at some point but for now I think we're okay let's go this way I feel like there's more metal this way see one finds them down here I don't know if there'll be any in here do you want me to find out we do need some courts though so I'm gonna grab that probably worth looking in these anyway if I tell you me go see can find them anywhere drop some acid mushrooms down there before probably worth looking at these guys - they go after the metal salvage see they're gonna drop in a second I'm gonna grab this tooth as well oh wow please don't do that again put some copper we are gonna need copper at some point I'm glad we got that - if that's good we will need some of this as well because this creates lubricants I am aware that takes up a lot of space there we go metal salvage how much is that if we can find one more piece of titanium just out and about not from the salvage we should be fine for our titanium that's silver I'm gonna take it anyway so I can drop something else come on just one more piece of titanium that's all we need can we make enough space for four I could put the eye on Cuba way I could have put the stasis rifle away as well you know what it's fine we're gonna find titanium in this Brock all right you ready copper okay maybe not there's one here as well ty take me up yes got it let's get rid of quartz and pick up titanium boom right we got the titanium we need next up we are gonna need lithium not sure where lithium is gonna be but I will quickly wiki it and see where it is feel like we're making good progress guys we're very very close we've got the lubricant as well which is goods I'm good at this game I'm only good because you guys helping me out Lucas Evan MLG galaxy cat elesia BC a me Paul it's Harlem boy galaxy game a red shy Sarah is dark Odette knows I don't know who you're talking about dang bro its Spencer you won two times in fortnight awesome bunny well done well console this is this isn't actually a constable tool this is PC I don't even know if you can get some notes grumpy C not 100% sure let's do this right we can get ourselves titanium ingots right we now needs just two more pieces of lithium I think let me see where you can find lithium let me just quickly search it lit the so lithium is found in many biomes uh you can find it as a large resource deposit as well it's found pretty much anywhere to be honest in like any biome so we're just gonna have to quickly go out and try and find as much as we can well make some new book rentals well right so we have a lubricant I'm gonna put the eye on Kube away we don't have any spare titanium which is annoying because I want to make a locker iron cube can go stalk a tooth can go apart from that I think we're good probably worth finding a little bit of food real quick and then we can go find some lithium which I just run into you know alright let's grab this dude says so you can find them pretty much anywhere you can find them inside these you can find them near these you can find them in outcrops literally anywhere alright we haven't eaten a peeper in a while so let's grab a peeper it's also grab this people yeah thank you buddy it's getting dark so I'm gonna have to old jeez what are you doing you stuck this dude stuck real stuck I am NOT gonna budge you out it would have been nice to me but I don't wanna be nice today especially cuz you keep beating me up titanium I'm gonna grab that I think we only need one titanium to make the locker do we let's cook some food let's sleep let's make it daytime this may get a lot nicer 5 boom laka quartz and 2 titanium I kept me one more tight a neom that's fine here we go let's do this barking Ram thank you so much for your kind words your Tanya Smith and David's hi how's it going you could put the prawn and the steamed off in the Cyclops moon pool only one I thought yeah I know you can't put both in but I'd only need to take one with me I think so it wouldn't be too much of an issue there you go fully sustained feeling goods one more titanium would be great actually that's sleep any pool thank you so much for your kind words and the 499 Mac plays Eli white-haired French fry the kid awesome name make me what was that I had a nightmare I had a legit nightmare oh my goodness guys what was that does anyone know what that is I wanted to put the battery in there there you go what was that I am so freaked out right now that was insane let's go find some lithium let's not crash I seamoth oh my goodness guys did you see that that was creepy it was like a ghost and then said who are you that's the Empress okay I need to bear that in mind I don't know what for but I need to bear that in mind all right we're gonna go this way are we heading towards the Aurora because I'm not sure I want to do that I just need to find some lithium it can be found pretty much anywhere so I'm gonna see if I can do my best to find some lots of salt I mean we could Oh actually there's a few deposits here we need three copper grab its gold grab it's nice to see what's about need lithium and then I'm pretty sure as soon as we find the lithium we're all good for finding ourselves crafting ourselves to Cyclops I think we can do it I'm pretty sure we can do it if you guys stick around we should be able to get this Cyclops bill let's get back and see more so much more reliable this dude just chill him looks like he's having a great time I don't wanna get eaten by him though that almost happens LEDs okay don't need actually I do need LEDs so that's kind of helpful and you try and find a deeper place because I feel like oh what's that what's this so just a C fragment metal fragment seamoth fragment okay that's one of you guys when you explode let's not have that I don't experience that they'll be upsetting hmm we're just gonna have to annoyingly just wonder and try and find it I know that's kind of annoying to do but hey we'll find it don't worry let okay cool silver okay even cooler but not exactly what we want right now sounds a little bit like ungrateful titanium I can take two that's enough for our locker so that's good made some progress copper as well silver oh geez we're fighting like good stuff right now but not the stuff we wanted let again gold oh my goodness there's sort of stuff in here silver copper I don't know which outcrop they're in but I feel like especially now they're super rare but we'll try and find some maybe we'll go deeper titanium infantries full ready my goodness of all the stuff we found we still need to find space for three of them for three lithium does anyone know the best way to find lithium shale okay let's find shale shale is a bit deeper I think thanks for the help guys that's really helpful we're gonna have to go deeper for shale outcrops but you know what that's something I'm prepared to do I got over the edge here I'm just gonna keep on going see we can find some shale which you mean grab some lithium so I feel like lithium would be pretty common from the shale don't really want to go down there right now shale is like the ball kind of one hole dude look at that that's that big wreckage we can do this thanks for help guys I have found some good stuff though so I'm not too upset about it and you share no shell these people gonna need to go deeper well there's a big hole down here should we go down here okay there's not the biggest hole I thought I thought I was gonna be way deeper this is more like it okay this is way more like it what is this yo I have not been down here this looks a little bit terrifying we're gonna go down anyway this looks like electrified do you know what I've been looks like a good zap you at any moment I'm just coming here for shale outcrops that's all I want okay there's these guys down here that's fine excuse me sir do you know where the shale our crops are or any lithium okay let's not do that again that was a little bit scary oh my goodness stop that stop that right now it's annoying no no no no leave me alone leave me alone why there's so many down here I should not have gotten down here I should not have gone down here why didn't you guys warn me why did you guys not warn me he probably did like don't go down there that's so stupid I didn't realize we're going so deep as well my goodness Oh risking my life for this lithium it'll be worth it when we get the prawns to up and running a little bit scary we're pretty deep right now I feel like we've been round here before with shale so I feel like this is a good place to be I'm in the wrong spot and trying where is is there like one spot where she'll could be I'm hearing some crazy noises right now I feel like we found shale here before go a little bit deeper there's no more psychic teleporters around here read the super chats I'm trying there's so many super chants let's read them real quick and then I'm gonna research where on earth I can get the shell outcrops are um I left click stuffy steam goldfish craft W funny as he read selves on squirrel man typical wired teaming and ham Nina's world Spencer how many times by one fortnight solos 13 currently lark games I think she's questioning me there's a violin life-forms in this area no I'm good you know I'm just gonna go this way absolutely fine she warned me to go away so that's what I'm gonna do I'm out let's go back to to see four times yes I feel like there's one place where we found loads of Mishael at one point use the scanner room that's a good idea I should probably do that let me quickly have a look and see if it's in any type of biome shale outcrop subnautica so the shale outcrops they can be on earth by sea traders okay so then a blood kelp zone a bulb zone Oh blood kelp zone was where we were you can definitely find them there bulb zone is where the purple bits are oh we have definitely been to the purple bit before a hundred percent I'm not I keep I keep hanging fish I'm sorry I'm not sure where it is though it's around here somewhere but we can find some shell we can definitely find some shell it's the mushroom biome again there wasn't any shell in the mushroom biome was there as well I don't want to go too far because that's where the goose the goose the well they called the ghost of Athens that's where they eat chill out so I don't want to do that if I go too far you do get attacked by them I realized that's what I was happening last time if you go too far out that's when you get attacked I feel like I found loads of shell before maybe I've just used loads of lithium before where are you it's gonna be hard to see them as well cos they're so dark I don't know if they're in this biome I think I'm in the wrong way let's go up I feel like we're gonna go this way Lucas Jacob pug lover of course I do the Minecraft master you need to get lantern fruits you can have an infinite amount of food they're found at the floater island okay I'll head there soon galvan Gardner 20 thank you so much more tech out of my shell gaming remember the cure is Emperor baby poop yeah I remember not too sure I find that confident and going to grab some right now so I'll do that in the future don't you worry not yet where am i heading I went ahead I need a different biome other than this this one's way too difficult I want that biome where we found these it's like lots of like purple bulbs not sure where they were though it wasn't the Aurora island was here I don't think it was the Cray Island either I'm gonna go towards the crow Island let's do it can we down some more super chats Daniel Hicks it's on the islands really I mean I'm going towards the island now anyway feel like I need to be deeper I don't like this biome this biome is really difficult to see anything minecraftgamer dan nice name thank you I think I've got everyone on the page at the moment I must have missed a few earlier which I'm really sorry about okay here we go this is the kind of stuff we need to see this is the edge of the biome this is better show me your shale punks I still not getting deeper just keep on going keep on going at least I know it's safe over here all kind of Elise actually it might have been the crate island where we found a lot of the shale it was like around here because he gets really deep around there doesn't it yeah this is it this is the stuff keep your eyes peeled guys looking for like little black shady rocks probably the worst description ever but we're looking for him they definitely wander around here is that like a massive chunk of it let's go deeper I know the psychic things are around here somewhere so we definitely need to be careful we can go deeper I feel like that's where we found it before here we go I think we made full circle in this video it's also nighttime which doesn't help Oh buddy is that a shale oh geez something's attacking me go away please I need to get this let's go let's go let's go let's go shale gold no the inventory is full as well indefinitely - oh geez okay I could die here repair tool repair tool there we go repair tool is actually dying it's running out of magic that's exactly what powers it yeah okay shale is definitely here we just need to get lucky you listen you to dump three things so that we can pick up whatever it is and also there's some what kind of dump out of here titanium I kind of need titanium quartz can go but I have to do outside oh my goodness it's so dark let's dump the quartz real quick diamond oh my goodness I'm finding better things than I need geez need to be careful not to go deeper than 300 as well.these some big rocks but they're not quite the rocks were looking for as aliens all over the place which could teleport me at any moment but that's what I'm doing to try and get the Cyclops guys oh look at this I think that's something we've scanned before oh okay he likes to do that to me now okay uh stop this right now whether it teleport me is teleporting me quite far away oh geez whereas my scene watch my scene with his air geez these guys are like they don't play around do they they're just teleport you for no reason at least they don't damage my steam off doing that they only damage me and I can make a me yeah I can't fix my seamoth anymore okay I've got another message yes lithium quick get rid of copper lithium that's one right I need two more of those I know there's Reapers but I have to suffer for my craft guys there's another shell outcrop down here let's go let's do this that's gold we don't need gold you know what I'm just gonna go around here a little bit magnets I I'm gonna pick up I just what don't I need what don't I need uh LEDs let's just get rid of LEDs I'm gonna pick up this because it's rare lithium yes one more this is it this is when we find it we're good we're good lithium those literary one piece there copper goodbye lithium hello we did it we did it it took a while but we did it right I think we can cross this thing now we need to get home though where is home home is this way let's get outta here right stuffy steam can you get a pug on the screen they're sleeping I'm afraid I'm so sorry arctic static for the $9.99 to charity and beyond thank you so much Daniel never what charity we're sending this to I don't know yet we're gonna choose as a whole as a team later on but the the amount that we're collecting now will still apply Brendan Kane can I shout out Jonathan and Henry I certainly can and do real Owen please put the seamoth something I certainly will hug leather a stone milk I did not steal your milk that wasn't me lucky park oh one bendy lover gaming new pug lover I didn't steal your milk a promise a promise Colin's key the quacky game a brady game a minecraft game at dan i am caught ah that's what I'm talking about yeah I know I sold the UM I solved the goldfish didn't I in my minecraft series I'm so sorry I completely forgot soup oli here oh I see you there buddy see we a brand new badger rockin it I like it the dab is dead finally finally we did it guys Aiden save fraser drink water that's a cool last name I like that I'm so desperate to get back now Dan fan man thank you so much buddy Winnie Mohammed Ben Sam films and stuffy I st. stuffy steam already we got this I think we can craft the Cyclops now would be a great great way to finish I'll be perfect in fact Aidan Steve how's it going we're close we're close I think at the end I know I'm not gonna say it I'm not gonna say it I was gonna say I something I think we can build near the end which is calling subnautica what I ever changed my hair color I think I will it's getting quite light at the moment so I think I might change it to like the you know the pink and blue that I did it one one time I really like that that was my favorite so I might do that at some point too right here we go today we've explored an alien base we've also hopefully managed to build a brand new a vehicle but hey let's see if we've got enough for it I will connect these rooms at some point but for today we need to prioritize making a new vehicle and then we can go to the disease place right we've got a lithium chillin let's craft what we needs play steel ingots hopefully I thought my maths right otherwise we're gonna need to find some more I think I've done it though just for the dog how's it going buddy please do what you can get right lithium lithium lithium please say I have three more boom-boom yes I do let's drink this water to free up a space lithium perfect right weed craft a two more place kill ingots just for the dog could I change it back to blue of course I can I think that's one going to do next why also needs into a different color at some point right magma would I play slime rancher in the future and more geometry - possibly buddy I'm not too sure at the moment though right we've got a three play steel ingots they'll go to a whole load of craft in we need our enameled glass what do we need for an hourglass I thought we need quartz right now and that's the stuff they threw away oh no means stalker teeth oh we do need glass as well - quartz we need how many of those three enamel glass we need six quarts to make three glass I'm just seeing if I have any there I've got one stalker tooth and there's another quartz I need store qatif now fantastic I don't eat glass two quarts for one glass yeah I need some more quarts actually no we can make now I don't need this I need the habitat build up there we go five let's craft a locker is gonna lose one of you use one of my quartz is but I desperately need the extra space right now what can I put it there where I want it let me put more in can you only have a certain amount all you have to put on the floor there we go let's craft this and there we go more locker space thank goodness what was that I did not want to do that right so we can put some of this stuff in here magnetite as well which is awesome we need some quartz I don't know if we're gonna have time to get it today though actually those tons of quartz in these things where is the big one that's near here there's one that's close that normally has a lot of quartz in well there's like there's a big cave nearby that has a lot in as well we'll try and find this I don't know if like do you know if stuff respawns or whether when you grab it that's here so feel like in some instances like with a quartz round here I just haven't it hasn't respawn so I'm just wondering I guess there's so much anger you know the anger trying to find like a decent cave I'm pretty sure that's well we were out of place a minute ago where there was loads of quartz and I Carmen where it was my bin this way let's go down here come on show me the quartz show me the course neither cave near the cave neither cave near the cave we need such easy materials now I think I dropped some courts earlier which is even making it even more annoying this is a cave kind lg's is a glitch cave there's no caves around here this is a bad choice unless I'm attached to this shoulda bought my seam off with me shouldn't I jog Steffie upturn it die zombie oh my goodness almost forgot I had to breathe crazy cat repos laser BL see this the real Owen huh Glover the hunt that's funny thank you okay Stacey y ed blaze barber Kristen is Stefanie Parker magma Dylan wire apex gamer coin flips Hartman how are you guys doing let's even find ourselves from quartz oh there's a PD a down here have I not been here before or I've just not picked up there oh I have picked up this okay I have been informed good to know you can't get caught in these can you that's led I'm gonna take it anyway come on there must be a cave out here somewhere I definitely should have bought my seam off with me is this the year this is the mushroom biome this is not where we're gonna find quartz guys maybe though it could be attached to this I swear we were in a place where there was absolutely tons of it copper I do need some copper so that's good to find as well that salt is salt I'm gonna grab this titanium I know there's some around here I can sense it and when I could sense the lithium last time we found it all we need these as well stalker teeth he didn't drop one that time let's find though they didn't roll that one that time so we need to keep an eye on those as well because what they do is when when they bite the metal they sometimes lose a tooth so that's what we've got to try and do as well yeah I can use this kind of room to find them I do find the scanner rooms like really difficult to use for some reason I need to add the thing so you can get it on your like heads-up display that was so much more useful so now we're working with this there must be some around - I think I need six as well maybe I've just looted it all yeah I've just taken all the courts from this land I'm trying to keep well on him and see if he's gonna pick up any metals I still need two more of those oh jeez Nucky Zion me come on pick up this metal here it's okay you can do it he's gonna try to get me no we're actually near the crazy island already we are ventured far no courts in there I'm glad that we can breathe for so long now and say that wait did you drop a tooth no come on guys I need your teeth desperately if he picks up that up again he might drop a tooth no they're just kind of coming after me they just don't like me guys the building on the island is an alien habitat I know we went in that earlier it was absolutely insane I promise you is crazy right go on buddy pick up that metal you know you want to he's gonna do it did he drop a tooth he did not drop a tooth what a shame whoa okay he's got me for me now it seems like a good place to get the teeth actually because there's so many of these metal stalkers around I just need to try and not get their attention so they can go and get some metal instead but I don't know if you need to be close enough so the the teeth can spawn there wasn't one there either are they rare I feel like they're pretty rare okay this is a good cave this is a real good K let's not touch those though quartz got it two three four oh my guess anymore anymore anymore I don't want to die right at least I know there's a cave here with quartz in I need two more let's go get some breath and then we're gonna do it again go straight back down and see if we can grab it I think it's gonna work bloop hi I'm Alfie and start a channel Congrats hope you like which I go as well buddy Wagner you have blue hair insane Turtles Tristan king of all creepers pug lover oh if you scan caught you can locate it at the scan room that's actually really handy to know I need to learn how to use a scanner room a little bit better right let's scan this one then they can't scan it okay maybe you can't I need one more piece dudes and then we're out of here this is the perfect thing to find is it gonna be nice to me or is he gonna leave me with one hanging neon dog cat thank you so much for the 10 that's a bit of light no you can't leave me with just one left that's not very nice there must be another one down here it's impossible no no come on come on give me one more just one more that's all I'm asking for one more spikey piece of quartz I can't believe it that's it that's the last one no there's no more little holes around here right no guys I'm gonna head home and I am going to search for this off-camera I so don't want this to be too boring I want to try and find it and then next episode we can craft the Cyclops and then we can take it straight out on its first expedition it's going to be awesome I'm gonna try and redo wait the infection kills you after five weeks I've definitely had it for way longer than that I've had it for a long time it's maybe it won't Aelita beast fire heart and calling game at die zombie turtles hope you get your tooth thank you Nyong'o dog cat I've already said blue 42 I've already said as well I think I won't pull it up again sorry if I missed any of your donations right at the beginning of the stream just because there were so many it was insane to keep up with I couldn't physically read them out fast enough so I'm really sorry I just there's been so many donations today are easily hundreds so we've made a really really good start on all of our charity total for this month this is only the first stream I'm gonna plan on doing I don't know if I'll be out stream tomorrow but hopefully I can stream once on Saturday and once on Sunday every weekend of every month which means there'll be eight streams which is eight chances every single month for us to build up that charity amount which is gonna be insane I need to drink I don't have any fluids get in here I had some water somewhere one one to celebrate so I need to get some more resources next time guys thank you so much for watching the stream I very very much appreciate it thank you for all of the amazing donations and stuff - it's been absolutely incredible and yeah I hope you enjoyed if you did big fat like would be greatly appreciated if you haven't done so yet then please do consider subscribing or sponsoring whichever one subscribing is absolutely free says please do do that I have got another video coming out 25 minutes if you're watching this as a video it would have already come out well thank you so much guys you are awesome and have an amazing day good bye have a good one guys see you later 
so as I'm recording this video I haven't actually uploaded the first video yet so I hope you guys enjoyed it because whether you like or not and playing it again and the reason why is because I find this game so fascinating and upon editing the previous video that you saw yesterday I've learned a few things so hopefully I'll be better and quicker this time right first up we need to get past the pizzeria simulate a bit give me all of the toppings you have kids eat up real nice there we go just getting real glitchy just like last time I'm guessing you have to get past this but every single time but if you're annoying if it in the save that's all that'd be really annoying but we're back and we need to go through this bit again I guess can I fast forward it I can't fast forward I'm just gonna play and then that's it okay we go I'm ready to start this again we're gonna do some different things here just because I didn't do it right last time or we can just do some different things anyway how much cash they're getting of us hopefully 100 again ding yeah we got a hundred perfect first off let's do the sponsorship deal just like that and then we're going to I guess I like the ball pit and I'm kind of better at the ball pit now so I'm gonna buy one of those we are gonna buy a stage but I'm not gonna mess up and buy the wrong stage for the wrong thing I think actually would it be better just to wait for a stage I think so I'm gonna do the duck pond as well so I have believe that might be a mini game so let's put the four the duck pond there and let's put the ball pit there our risk is four I didn't actually look at what that was going to be the risk for this is zero revenue 1 and statement - nice this one is our risk 1 maybe I shouldn't have done that right let's play the duck game I have no idea how this is going to work but I'm gonna take it anyway I've got a hundreds oh I get two picks three picks in toad so when I just get points depending on that I want to go for this duck a hundred again okay is there anything different about any of these ducks absolutely nothing has got this guy a hundred okay 300 not so bad and the better you score in the minigames you get a higher faz rating right let's play this as well now I don't know if you're play tokens regenerate at all that's something we need to try out when we actually get past the first level there we go straight into the pit let's see how many points we can get on this one 600 points around five let's do this yes that's in yeah 800 so that's actually gonna bring us over a thousand I think in-phase rating yeah but it got a performance bonus as well dude we're doing well right how can we reduce risk cuz our risk is 4 right now we have 375 dollars I don't know what else I want to spend right now just because last time we became bankrupt very quickly I'm gonna buy these yeah let's do that let's go back to blueprint mode check out how our restaurant looks I think this is fine for now we don't need anything else just yeah cuz our risk is pretty high or did that bring down our risk our risk is only 3 as a know it went down anyway that's pretty cool I'm gonna finish with some money left and see what happens I mean I think we've got to do all of our chores like last time but I'm pretty sure there's no way that we could at jumpscares I'm fairly sure I'm pretty sure anyway but how this works is you need to complete all of these tasks before oh my goodness that actually memory jump get out of here reads complete all of these tasks while managing our temperature and while listening outs for other things in the vents you could do motion screening audio or you can do silent ventilation but you can only do one of those 3 things at a time so if I do silent ventilation it will keep us nice and cool when I've got sat the fans off but it doesn't seem to be working very well right now does it or we can play audio but that will turn off at the ventilation which means we can stop people coming in from around or we do motion sensor which means that we can see when there's movement in the vents obviously now I don't think there's any animatronics live in our restaurants we should just be able to pick through all of these and get to the next part there's only one way to test that theory and that's by doing it see no motion detected and I can log off day one done thank you right we're back here so we need to do this a little bit better we need to be on the ball with our zapping so we have to do if this one is they play the sound and if you hear any kind of reaction then you need to zap them otherwise you can fill out this sheet and just hit no yes or whatever that's how we did it wrong and it was it was scary now if you do get it wrong I'm pretty sure that they then have the ability to then go into your restaurant and start to scare you when you're doing all your daily tasks and stuff which we definitely do not want so you have the option to either just store it away and forget about it the only thing is if I click that I feel like you'll still kind of haunt us a little bit so you want to go with the salvage now with the salvage you get three chances to zap them anything over three means that the salvage value will go down by don't think that's too bad let's proceed unless listen it's gonna be steady that one's good let's press no need to listen so carefully for the audio Hughes I think we're good okay we're good this is the one this is the one what got me last time I need to listen for cues though I don't know what they are I was gonna zap let's see what happens okay what happens now hello please play well you can play employs it so you can listen for the cues when it's pause maybe I don't really know I'm still kind of guessing at this okay we could uh I'm sure this is freaking me out this is so freaking me out I don't want him does that me I just want to stop him documentaries okay we good we good we got no reaction begin audio prompt in three this is number five one oh this is a weird one I think we're okay I think we're still okay I kind of want to zap him because I have like two zaps left I'm just gonna zap him I'm just gonna zap him because I'm too scared I still don't know what audio cues I'm looking for though oh there's like a weird hum I feel like we're really close to the end though there's only this is the last one and I have one more zap before the value goes down this one's so long why is it so long come on come on you know you don't want to react to it it's fine this is not a reaction video it's gonna be okay document yes you have completed the maintenance checklist we did a proceed with the salvage we did it okay we got five hundred dollars okay that's a little bit creepy we did it twenty-six new visitors 26 total twenty two hundred and fifteen a food revenue oh my goodness no we got a lawsuit as well okay this happened last time I'm not sure how to do this last time I had like no money to even do anything this is what happened he fell from a ride stood up and fell down again I've got one thousand and seventy eight dollars so I'm not quite sure to do all he did was fell from a ride is that really my fault it's just a ball pit took stuff over 30 minutes to care okay that's bad and the lack of responsiveness on the part of the staff has caused him to become secluded in his home afraid to go out in public again a fear of being ignored oh no I kind of want to click next and see what happens I'm doing it nothing so you just you have to do one of these things to fight it or settle oh man this could be really really bad I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna fight pending oh geez okay at least you got past it I hope it saves as well man right we did it okay so I've got another sponsorship offer Marty's plungers nothing goes down the can't come up Marty's plungers LLC is offering to pay for advertising in your establishment so this is gonna mean we're gonna get some kind of ads but I'm taking the money I need it to see case they get a lawsuit our play tokens come back as well okay so we should play more minigames but first let's buy things I don't apply the stage just yet I want to increase our Health and Safety I think we should do that by it there we go just to unlock the new tech because then we can buy I want myself a big stage but a how much in the animatronics oh they're on sale but they have a liability risk he's 66 but purchasing a bulky item in this condition comes with a slight risk of something undesirable hiding inside which isn't that great they're 190 ish 200s he's not an animatronic I'm gonna buy this stage and then I'm gonna buy just one animatronic and it's going to be it's going to be mr. hippo welcome to the team buddy let's see what they look like when they're here all right let's apply mr. hippo he looks fantastic almost up to 2,000 as well and he doesn't give us any risk or risk is zero dudes that's good let's play duck one a hundred duck two hundreds what is duck three gonna be a hundred that's a really rigged game I mean wow got a performance bonus though things are going much better this time I can even upgrade to get a larger floor plan but I don't think I need to right now I want to buy all the things first is there anything in this set that we can play on the fruity maze okay the midnight motorists arcades yeah we can buy two more games let's do that we need I'm gonna buy this one midnight motorists so we should be able to place this here and can we play it though we can let's go w a s and D let's do this it's just like just don't hit anyone kind of game I think so the music is absolutely horrific that's how it might is I can't even hear myself speak it's horrible oh geez okay so the score that we get increases our faz rating alright could I could do this pretty well you know huh oh I did a lap okay I was about to die then this is actually quite difficult my eyes my eyes my eyes are hurting but it's gonna be fine this is worse than geometry - oh wait I've got more lives oh sweet I didn't know that does it not matter if we crash all we do is keep doing laps over and over again I mean our fast racing is looking pretty amazing right now no I hit I hit it twice hey okay so you just do five laps I guess that was so loud look at our rating dudes let's go out to almost 5000 do I just want to keep playing games over and over again our atmosphere is not looking very good so we need something for atmosphere novelty traffic light gives you five bar boom let's do this where do we place this that goes in front of the stage I think everything's looking pretty good right now actually I might add safety straps to this just cuz the risk is high let's do that - one risk okay that's cool doesn't know like he's got a safety strap so let me complete this and see how many coins I get and by coins I mean faz rating hey every single one the big old 1000 that's what I'm talking about this is insane guys actually insane I still have play tokens left I'm guessing you just play the games over and over again until you run out of tokens and this one's the best one which I really really dislike okay you only get score over a certain Mars power in this game so you can crash as many times as you like but it will slow you down which isn't so bad because you just get so much score the ball pit only gives you a thousand if you do the best whereas this one is way especially if you get a good run I feel like I found a secret as well on one of these laps there is a gap underneath in one of the barriers I wonder if you can go in there let me see if I can show you the barrier as well there it is there it is I did it yo check it out I actually found a secret minigame already I don't know what the game is though it's like raining and I'm a car bro I just assumed that's just my five nights at Freddy's world knowledge coming out there I wonder if we could we go down here we can't go down there we can only stick to the roads let's see what happens this is freaking me out a little bit this is more trees at the top this is the easiest racing game ever haha we've gone off-road in our little car which is cool all left or down I'm gonna go down okay can we go back up we can go back up I mean let's try it oh hello who are you can we all look we're outside the car now yo this is so freaky so freaky hello I am yellow man you are green man let's play let's see what's going on here buddy can you let me in he's not gonna let me in I can't actually do anything right now I'm pressing left but it's doing nothing that's so weird Green Man doesn't wanna talk to me at all can I get back in my car yeah I can't get back at my car I'm out of here Green Man I don't like you I prefer purple guy for this road is getting thin um this worries me it's getting really thin and the music's leaving I could be in big trouble here oh no don't get out the car I guess you've got no chance no other choice but to go in oh oh this is weird I feel like I'm just about to play ultimate stick fights hello hello how are you leave him alone tonight he had a rough day okay that's fine you're just watching TV that's okay watching your favorite episode of Adventure Time that's fine I'm gonna leave you alone wait is this where we get the little snippet of the boy like the original boy that had the accident I told you not to close your door get in I want to go in this is my house he can't ignore me like that come back here open the door please can you open the door please sir I'll find a way in from outside oh I have no idea what's happening here okay I'm around the back of the house now the corner of the house now the back okay yeah it's got smashed window could we go in I always run away wait look I'll zoom in for you guys look there's um there's Freddie's I guess an animatronics footprints and then a kid is run away and smashed his window ran off to that place again he'll be sorry when he gets back oh that's weird so is well we got some story there so we actually played as the dads to the son then and it seems like he always escapes to go and play at Freddy fazbear's which may be this one I'm not too sure yet but he definitely escapes to play at Freddy fazbear's I still got loads of play tokens left I don't actually know what to do here right my bass bear rating is 1,600 which is crazy I have one thousand nine hundred and three dollars and three play tokens left so I'm actually gonna buy the next games machine which is fruity maze I'm gonna buy this one just because it increases our rating and stuff doesn't mean that we have any extra liability buts I can play another game so go three tokens left actually my fazbear rating 16,000 that's mad right what do we do on this one we've got 40 seconds to just gather as much fruit as possible okay that seems like oh geez that was creepy yeah it's like an animal girl that's so odds yeah look see she's creepy what is this as well it's like a superpower yep double your superpower oh my goodness oh my goodness okay that's very very quick whoa whoa whoa oh did you see that there was a bunny there's an actual bunny there's a slug as well which allows us to dodge all the walls this is mental actually crazy Oh No I hit the out-of-bounds so can you not touch the walls that was weird there was the weird rabbit as well I don't know if we could go back and find it or not but that was super creepy okay there's a timer on the powerup so I can't really mess it up I got another one as well I've got super speed too and I ran off the screen whoops - so far the car one is by far the best it's just harvest phase points see I didn't really bad on that one I got two thousand four hundred and fifty three points almost at twenty thousand boys but we've got no play token step you have two thousand dollars though can we buy anything else just to see if we can unlock the next catalogue let's buy this just because I don't think we're too bad in terms of if we get sued and they look really nice we can even afford these giant speakers I'm gonna buy them and we got the new catalogue as well look at this star curtain stage for heavy animatronics look at that guys on sale guys look at that terrible condition though there's a ball pit Tower a ladder tower the liabilities are crazy high on this carnival hoops riding Rockets lemonade clown a fruit punch clown neon jukebox medical stations security doors rock star Freddy Bonnie chica leads are the originals and foxy as well they all have a liability risk that's mental right I'm gonna go on to the next night I think it's good the next day in this game and let's see what happens next time we could upgrade our restaurant but for now I think we good I don't know if there's any animatronics on the loose but there's only one way to find out let's order our supplies let's do what we need to do and I guess try and survive the day is there any motion doesn't look like there's any motion which is goods also while you're ordering something you can't come off this screen otherwise it will cancel what you're doing and it's gonna keep flashing my flashlight into the into the vents and do the tasks it looks like we're absolutely fine I'm guessing there's no animatronics but hey it could just they could just jump us I'm gonna turn the fans off just in case but I think we're okay this old internet makes a mad amount of noise as well no that's a enticed by the dollar it interrupts our tasks to write we also have the opportunity to buy equipment like a faster printer I am going to buy the high-speed uplink just cuz I think that might make it much quicker to do our tasks and doesn't actually make any noise which is goods that was a good investment a real good investment the prints are though will take forever oh there's motion bro there's motion oh my goodness there was actually motion who could that be is that the animatronic that we salvaged surely not I am oh man I'm freaking out I'm freaking out I thought we were fine I really thought we were fighting always 97 degrees turn the fan on oh my girls I'm gonna melt right audio is playing let's go from motion scanning is there anyone here there was definitely some motion up in here oh my goodness I thought I was okay we've only got maintenance to do just unclog those toilets super quickly please oh man Oh what do I do what do we do you play audio there was something right there play the audio just get them out of here so that the motion only works if you haven't got the fan on dude I did not even know that I heard shuffling actually heard shuffling no that's not nice that's really not good I've only watt bulbs left to do oh my goodness track motion and track motion track motion real quick somebody's dry edges play music oh my goodness how do I get them to go away how do I get them to go away it said you could shine your flashlight down there right oh my goodness go back go back go back I just want to replace the bulbs just go away it's absolutely fine I don't know if I should to be staring down the barrel of an animatronic right now oh dude we're gonna have to salvage something after this as well which is so scary task is daunting task is to unlock off ah oh that scared me whoa that was not nice seeing that in the vents was horrible before you is an animatronic in the back alley yeah we are unsure of its origins okay it is your job to complete the maintenance checklist before claiming it and salvage or if you choose to you can throw it back into the alley where you found it enforce it payments okay to make your choice now what do I want to do it's a thousand and it's still only five I'm gonna go for it I've chosen to proceed with the maintenance checklist yep remember use your company as you taser to return the animatronic to a neutral state if you feel that it's becoming unstable or aggressive I will do begin audio prompt in three two one I have to say so quiet for these guys because I have to keep playing and pausing it to try and find the cue so don't know what the audio cue is yet document results okay first ones done no Road no response begin audio prompt in three two here we go one I don't even know if they've got any like any visual cues either I can't see anything I can't hear anything I don't know I read oh no that was the noise there was a knocking I sapped him there was a knocking definitely haha document results okay document results none sure he'll mess it up got a rubber I don't think that matters anyway I feel like I heard knocking by not sure I can only zap a man I can only zap three times in total did his teeth change as well his teeth changed I'm slapping you as swears his pose has changed look it's changed oh how did I not notice that before no way is it just visual cues document I never noticed that before there was definitely response is that twice as wary - there we go there might be both like audio and visual documentaries yes okay this one's done right we're close to that money guys I'm scared of him though I could zap them because I have one zap left I think I might disapp them that's good yeah cuz that's it I'm just gonna snap and this one's so long though oh man I'm worried I'm worried [Music] document results yes yes no respond completed the maintenance just and may proceed Salvage don't scare me well done don't get me down babe stop oh my goodness he moving drinking oh wow let's see if we get a lawsuit today got loads of returning visitors we turned away loads because our place isn't big enough we definitely need to expand I've got a thousand extra me $1,300 dudes and no lawsuits we got this we've mastered this game already what's the previous lawsuit though we won yeah that's so you get for falling out of your rides this wasn't my rides okay we're doing amazing guys like really good we go another sponsorship offer from floss I don't know I'm gonna say yes I mean why not it gives us $1,000 to spend maybe why not he's a cute little tooth so the issue I'm faced with now it's like don't know if this game saves or not it would suck so badly if the game doesn't save but hey I'm gonna have to leave it here today anyway I hope you enjoyed this it's been so much fun don't worry if it doesn't save I'll just go through and repeat what we've done already but yeah I'm really enjoying this game so much it's really interesting and we now got two animatronics in our restaurants causing mayhem so please leave a big fat thumbs up if you want to see some more guys this game is so cool especially since we didn't expect it to even be out yet but hey yeah if you enjoyed it thumbs up would be great and if you want to catch up with the story all you want to also view content from me every single day then please do consider subscribing to join Team TDM today a full daily video as part from that guys thank you so much watching and I'll see you all next time goodbye [Music] 
today's game is said to be one of the hardest games ever made and it involves you playing as a very muscular man holding a mallet stuck inside a cauldron of water yeah hey guys how's it going welcome to getting over it as I've just mentioned in balls you are playing as a man stuck in a cauldron and you just have to get over it the controls are literally just this you just have to kind of make your way around the map by pulling yourself around with this mallet seems pretty simple but then you're presented with this tree you have to use this mallet to get around all of these crazy obstacles but apparently it's really tricky and I have I have no idea how to do this do I need to whip this round I don't know what to do I don't know what to do the controls are so awkward I'm I'm not kidding you yeah oh that was sweet so you can kind of propel yourself but how on earth do I get up here like this okay be careful be careful and we have arrived at our destination now don't mess this up buddy just hook yourself round oh my ghostess is so weird so weird no I can't get over the tree yes yes I did it and I go over to the next bit I have no idea how but you know what it doesn't even matter let's just go over this next bit yeah we're doing good so why is this game played to be extremely hard because the controls are absolutely insanely awkward and it's a game where you can't die but if you get like higher up the level than you fool you'll end up back here right at the start okay so it seems like launching yourself is actually gonna be pretty handy let's do this shall we let's see how far we can get today there we go now the thing is you can kind of do things by accident like the momentum of him in his cauldron with his crazy muscles could just give you this momentum that just fires you in the opposite direction it's in Shane I need to swing him all the way around here we go yes see what I mean nah just fires you in the other direction here we go yes okay that works that works slowly does it little man why did anyone think of a game like this this is uh this is a strange one guys I've played some strange games in my time but this one this one's up there with one of the weirdest can I reach that I don't know if this is gonna work I would go slowly does it slowly does it is that a lighthouse in the backgrounds come buddy there we go there we go yes haha this is a beach hut as well beautiful what what more could you want out of a beach hut than try and get over it let's see if we do it fast here we go nope don't do fast I don't even know if this is physically possible but we're gonna know this might be an occasion where I need to propel myself let's see if this will work huh why see what I mean one one foul stroke and you are you're done for pretty much come on there we go that's better kind of you kind of messed yourself up but that's fine I think the faster you can get your motions maybe the better I'm not 100% sure if that's true but we're just about to test it out let's see if we can launch ourselves here we go yes no I think that's the strike is that's definitely the strat here we go launch worst lunch ever but hey we'll go with it okay this one I don't really know how to do I think I just need to flick him round but I'm not quite sure how to do that or is there a way we can do it super slow so that he can just pull himself round come on buddy nope no why I'm stuck on like the first bit this is bad I think I didn't pull yourself up pull yourself up all the way yes I did it okay this bit doesn't look so bad here we go slowly does it I think we're gonna need to launch ourselves over that pipe here you go master class in three two one huh that works or does it let's see there we go here we go and he's landed yes this bit though I'm not quite sure how this is gonna go down it's good up it's gonna happen it's working well I don't know what I'm doing but it's working this hammer better stay in place yes yes is that a coffee cup because I could sure do with some of that right now God so do we have to get all the way up to I'm guessing that tree isn't included no no see what I mean one false move and you are absolutely flung to the other side of the screen this is an awful game at punishing you for your mistakes okay I did it I did it I don't know how but I did it I can't explain it though it's like it's it's difficult but it's oddly satisfying when you finally get over that obstacle I'm only at the beginning but it's really really satisfying yes I'm not sure that's how it works but it's okay with me can I collect the coffee let's do happens when we touch the coffee cup no no no coffee almost betrayed me guys that's why I drink tea bam bam bam we're safe we're safe no I just unpause the game and it flings me up are you crazy I could maybe use that to my advantage I'm not too sure but I'm not gonna try it here we go we've got to go up and in that gap oh thank goodness I'm just gonna go for it you ready what are you kidding me dudes I'm all the way back here one false move and I'm all the way back here problem is I don't know how I did this bit before okay like that that's fine okay this but I definitely launched myself at this too incredibly wrong but uh okay that's fine that's fine just chill out relax and launch yes yes come on come on come on is that I'm gonna test the launching method okay pause the game and then I think your mouse resets to the middle of the screen unpause nothing nothing happens what if I move my mouse to here and then do it yeah it works guys I found a hack let's do it that's actually amazing there's that coffee cup you tried to ruin my plans didn't you buddy but you're not gonna do it today not down there anyway right I need to launch up there so we're gonna go like this and this gives me the maximum power I know this is weird but and possibly cheating but I'm just trying to get back to where it was that's that's all like this man is trying to do launch grab and be careful no no no where you're going where are you going do you think that's you think that's okay do you just kind of rock off the cliff like that now here I could use the little little trick that I've just found out but I'm not that kind of guy I'm just I'm a legit kind of guy oh this could be it guys I do not want to mess this up but if I hit my hammer off the top I'm going all the way back down need some brain juice and try and do this okay here we go three two one please take a break is okay I've saved your progress fine thank you thank you saved the progress down the mountain okay okay I'm back I'm back I'm back and I don't know if this is gonna work it won't no please one of the hardest bits is actually getting to that little slot there but you know what I don't even know if you need it no you don't okay that's fine get up in there buddy this is actually perfect because unless you mess up properly we are not going to fall back down I probably should have said that should I like at all but we're making it and there's a bin we've been rewarded with the bin guys we did it we made it which way do I go I'm guessing I don't need to go the way of the bin not that I have anything against you Ben it's fine I'm just gonna head this way seems a little bit more attractive than a dead end I'm just ignoring all the words by the way I think he's mocking us so I just turned this slider all the way down okay I'm not quite sure how to handle this I'm gonna go for a Big Bounce and almost ruin the whole thing oh oh I got up here by accident okay that's fine let's see if we can do this you have to be so careful with the momentum the momentum is unreal because if that momentum goes too crazy you're out of here buddy now how on earth do we do this bit do we have to grab the light maybe let's see what happens launch please be careful but how am I supposed to swing my axe inside this tunnel surely that's impossible no you see this nonsense you see this nonsense that's the kind of nonsense you get from a man inside a cauldron trying to get up a mountain I feel like this rock is being a little bit suspicious so I'm gonna try and no no no I'm gonna try and get on top of this rock there we go and I think and I think you can launch yourself up but your hammer needs to be on the right side to grab the lights and there's another light I don't know I'm gonna do this guy's but I'm gonna give it my best shot just for you just for you not for this guy for you and kind of myself let's go oh oh that was close this rock is definitely the key but I need to launch myself fast enough to be able to get up to that light I held my breath I actually held my breath hoping they would help him to stay inside that little cavern there and it just it just didn't work yes yeah drag yourself up drag yourself up now let's think about this I don't actually know what I need to do on this bit but I'm gonna I think I messed it up are you kidding me I need to flick my mouse from that light to this light before he pulls down let's see what happens I knew that was gonna happen I knew that was going to happen don't do it don't do it no I hate this man with only being you just kind of need to launch yourself and hope it doesn't really add any logic it doesn't use any logic I mean of course it uses logic because otherwise it wouldn't be a physics-based game well come on in come on then don't fall down don't fall down don't fall down what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing and now we're back here oh my goodness okay that almost went really really badly I almost threw myself over the other side of the map that would have been ridiculous you know what's crazy it's this bit right here it takes so long to get yourself back into position because this part of the mountain is so steep frankly it's really annoying look it's just gonna it's just gonna drag me off the rock isn't it oh okay I feel like I'm in a good position let's just try it that's this is try it come on come on come on yes yes that's right I'm just gonna launch it and see what happens Oh stay that stay there you absolute Punk oh my guess we need to be so careful here because if I chop over the edge of this tiny tiny little spike my games over I go to the other side of the map oh oh stay there stay there please stay there do we have to make this jump now okay okay this is not gonna happen is it that's so far okay I think I'm in the best position I'm ever gonna be for this one jump oh I don't even know how I'm gonna do this I'm just gonna do it oh oh okay I thought that was the shadow of a rock that jump was a lot easier than I thought it was gonna be let's not ruin this now though come on come on yes I could actually cry I could actually cry that was yes I did it guys I did it now there's a rusty fridge that is my rewards this game has the best rewards a dustbin and a rusty fridge what other games can you claim have those kind of rewards huh none of them now I feel like I'm in a pretty safe position to just kind of carry on the the consequences of falling down aren't as bad as before I can just kind of concentrate on you know having fun Oh check that out here we go we're gonna have to launch ourselves up and be careful not to launch ourselves the wrong way ah slow and steady slow and steady so I'm actually in a much better mood now because I feel like I'm doing okay and whoa I'm close to the top let's just be careful that works that does not we are I'm in a better mood because as soon as I get to the oh oh what are you doing what are you doing are you crazy man what what what I need to keep this guy under control is just saying I was in a good mood this guy just doesn't want me to be in a good mood right he wants me to be angry he wants me to be flustered what is his problem it's not my fault you got yourself stuck in a cold room full of water sir is it really I just need to launch myself far enough no that was so close there's like a building at the top too I feel like I'm kind of getting the hang of this a little bit mind you saying that I'm gonna come messed it up in a second I nya but look at that skill look at this skill okay I don't know how I ended up here but I'm good also where is this game set why is this guy inside a cauldron I kind of like to know some backstory maybe that's our reward right at the end we get to find out what happened to this poor poor guy oh I got high okay I think I just need to go like to higher and then I'm good but this game aids me I think I did it I think I did it please just chill in here please please don't mess this up now did I make it yeah oh my goodness my back I literally just played that bit for about 30 minutes in one go that is insane we made it

along and if you fall I'm gonna be so so mad at you oh my goodness how am I supposed to do this oh no this is not nice this is really not nice okay here we go that's the way you do it that's the way

yeah welcome back to trap adventure to the game that wants you to hurt something I haven't played this for about I don't know I want to say like almost the week so I'm a little bit rusty but I think we can get even even further with this game we just need to take our time remember what happens and not die like that how do I forget there's literally a spike wall at the ends jeez there we go much better and this guy duck hop we're all good here it's this bit that we all love now I think we just do this and then jump oh if we spam them and then jump down that didn't work oh no I don't know how to do this guys I thought I had it all figured out but I I don't I really don't this is gonna be the hardest bit to get past because it literally doesn't even make much sense 1 come on come on come on come on yes no yes okay right we have just oh no lives game over fantastic the best stage that we've got to is stage 9 so I guess I'll see you when I get there which might be never yes okay okay we're good I think I remember this bit just like this go up yes no what I've never done that before in this level ever oh my goodness come on come on up here there we go there we go Oh what what even was that how I'm so confused by this game so confused why do I keep messing it up oh wow come on go on here we go yes it makes me panic because the the breath is so low there we go right let's not do that again take this bit slowly and you can survive no yes yes yeah okay this is the bit we got to before I don't actually know how to do it because you know there's a the submarine dropping bombs I'm not quite sure what to do um any guesses there could be a secret compartment somewhere you never know the problem is as literally sores that kill you after you go down that's the purpose we've got so far can I trigger this yep yep I can okay good bats great we can trigger it and then go around let's see if this works there we go there we go come on get out of that no one more chance though so I'm good yeah okay I'm making progress guys this oh geez I forgot about the wool how can I forget about the rule already there we go that's it that's it to the submarine little man I don't know what to call you you seem like a Mitch maybe a Harry maybe a Duane I don't really know but I need to be super careful not myself up so no mal what if you drop a bomb on these things they're going to kill you I think this way is the best way ha ha ha that was it you just need to not let the bombs touch the spikes and then your goods there we go No why would you do this to me stupid submarine anyway I got one life left already it comes to this okay so I think you need to drop the bomb then go for it drop the bomb here then drop the bomb there yes I made it but still dropping bombs why is this why is this a thing oh my goodness come on stage 10 that's what I'm talking about let's go that's just not fair I was so happy about stage 10 and then he does that to me I don't think that's fair not that this game ever was advertised as being fair I guess so how do you avoid that do you go on the the bottom right is that hit let's find out I need to get back there first though and it says my best stage is 9 when actually it's 10 actually no it's not that's not stage 10 is it that's that's that still stage 9 oh man guys look how many lives I've got this is the run here we go here we go yes yes yes oh my goodness right I think I know how to do this one so you need to wait for the bomb then go around drop one here drop one here and go yes the perfect run okay sweetie three ready ready okay start the beginning it's fine absolutely fine I I see what's going on here I need to not drop the bomb on myself that's gonna be tricky isn't it especially when you get to the bit where it literally falls on you so we go down here there we go no that's definitely it though you just go down why would I not just turn off the bombs why is that not an option I just need to go down this way yeah I'm hurting I'm actually hurting I've got so many lives and it could just all mess up from this point we're going down here and then it comes back up I mean I don't know I think go down the bottom and then it comes all the way up Oh made it no it can't be this hard how is this level so long stage 9 is ridiculous down here all the way up to the top and then we go this way I'm guessing there's there's just no way there's just no way to complete that it just goes I came here with so many lives and now I have you know one now which is fantastic down down up up up boy falls dead then down how how do you do this game that I feel like I made so much progress yet I'm still on stage 9 about to lose my mind guys I have lost so many lives already it's outrageous but at least I know how to do this bit drop the bomb and die yes no a simple mistake causes everything to go wrong I'm literally losing my minds I'm actually losing my mind come on up simple down simple there we go much sped up now my theory is I don't actually have to go down to the far right I can just kind of chill to the side so let no I can't just be losing cheap lives like this stop it I hate this little guy is so much and he's not even doing anything wrong how did he even get in this situation we just hover yeah we can do that okay we go up this way as well nice for now why where can you even go this is unreal over here all the way up to the top he does doesn't move fast enough oh oh I think you need to go down to the bottom right I've got this come on a man if you don't want me to hate you then you need to do this for me come on do it for me do it for the rest of everyone watching and do it more importantly for yourself okay I'm making this work I've got many many lives and I feel like I haven't even got past as bit properly it's unreal how difficult this game is guys how simple this man looks he's not so simple after all to hover in here we're going across there we go and then we're going down oh that was close of a hover over make your way across and then down yes no I let you have no comments just weird noises to be able to display my anger for this thing it's crazy how like how can this be so hard when there's weather like 26 levels there's 26 versions of this it's horrible yes I made it I actually made it now what what do I okay we have to blow that up going going to the one there we go yes yes no I did pretty way so what is happening what is happening I'm dying over and over again what is happening No okay I need to do that that's fine okay uh yeah this is gonna be super tricky how do I even blow this up without blowing myself up I can't believe it guys this is going to be super difficult and there's spikes what is happening please explain to me what is going on ah so mad how could I hate such a little pixelize demand so much yo what has happened what has happened what was that why is it telling me it's 4:00 p.m. I don't need to know the time that means I spent too long on this game already why did that just happen it properly put me off North I needed any more distractions but it's also telling me what time it is that's so random more importantly it cost me two lives so okay I can't really remember how I did this but I think it's over here and then straight down no I'm dead yes I made it I made it okay right over to the next one I just need to blow up this there we go and then what yep made it made it made it made it made it okay blow up this that's fine but then how do I do this bit blow up that and then blow up this okay this is working this is working this is actually working okay what do I it's okay you're a level 10 you almost made it you know what to do at the ends now okay okay you got this I'm probably gonna die as soon as I press Continue but hey it's fine there we go yes see I know what this game is plan is it's its plan is to just make me rage so much I've just realized I've got one life left literally one life how am I gonna do this how am I gonna do this I'm gonna try I'm gonna try I could do this I can do this yes yes okay move out the way slam No ah another bomb comes out how is that possible I just held my breath so much that my head almost burst but at least I've got one more chance yeah buddy I just did that level first time first time guys right let's do the explosions and it kills me great fantastic I get I get it first time and I kill myself twice this game has me psyched out to the max I am losing it watch this perfection are you ready there we go across then down then we get or saved all right let's not mess this bit up again there we go much better how do you do that fuzz bit without dying and dying again come on come on now right I've got it from here 100% there we go there we go there we go right Oh nope once dropped on myself right we need to time this well and remember it will explode us and if we wait too long you'll probably do something else ridiculous so let's explode let's go down let's go up yes how do you even avoid that I don't understand I just don't yes yes yes voice cracking everything I've done it it's only level 11 guys that is absolutely crazy right let's uh let's see what other nonsense this game has prepared for us I don't like waiting too long because it's obviously going to do something to disrupt us there we go platforming skills maximum and the ice melts at the ends that's great isn't it why does the ice melts how are you supposed to do that so quickly than the ice doesn't melt I'm dead I've lost game over again how I will get back there and I will defeat you I feel like I'm playing a budget subnautica so now now I got to this bit I can't actually do this explosion bit again which is fantastic I just keep blowing myself up go go go go yes okay right pipe banks I don't mind blow myself up there I do when I do it twice though that's a little bit upsetting right here we go to the ice level go drop and then go yes yes yes berm how did I do this one it doesn't seem to melt until you kind of like go I keep just falling off the edge and wasting lives why oh that's what you need to do but way quicker than that there we go over the top I get it I get it I totally get it yes okay right I didn't actually do anything then but I figured it out I have one life to do this here we go let's do it Wow I'm pretty much done pretty much the Sun's up this game doesn't it okay I'm back with many lives so I need to do this the quickest ever used to do that that that's it that's it I need to do it as quickly as I can yes oh there was so close so close oh my goodness no it's that yellow one at the top how does that get me every time my lives go down so fast on this level no that was it that was so it oh my goodness one life left no it's been so long getting back here then dies no mine lives is not gonna get me past this is it like at all I just don't know when to jump this it's so difficult it's like something that looks so simple and then when you try it it just destroys you see I'm already down to five lives this is mental oh no I found a secret passageway and then it kills me kills me Matt you did it that time though pretty much anyway is when the thing is halfway around you need to jump and then get over that it's just I've got it wrong I've done it wrong no I haven't no I did again again there's got to be harder than even getting in the flippin thing I'm dead don't you died again it's so annoying because I feel like I can do it if I didn't just press right again I've got +10 lives that's crazy okay okay this bit is so triggering especially when I do that why would I do that to myself I'm just running out of live so quickly I don't understand I really understand oh my goodness I've done it so many times like just God do it again why why why me why me I'm so bad before my phone suffers I am done here I hate this tiny man I hate the ice level I'd much rather him in his stupid little submarine but no he had to go to the Iceland so guys I hope you enjoyed this video let's leave a big fat thumbs up for getting to level 12 okay it was level 11 let's let's see if I like forget to level 11 and only two levels more than when we started haha if this happens to be the first really seen by me please do consider subscribing to join save till yesterday I'm never gonna see this man again and I'll see you next time yeah fine [Music] 
Oh My Goodness! Check out my eyes! *slight chuckle* I didn't know I could get the googly eyes! Thats amazing! * chuckle* Welcome guys, back to winter. Which I hate, as you guys found out in the previous video. If you haven't seen this before welcome to... Hold on a second, we've got 11,999 at the top right, thats pretty cool! Yeah, if you haven't seen this before welcome to our little Minecraft series where We try and farm our way, to richness! I was gonna say the reason why I'm failing at the moment is, but I don't think we're failing that much when we've almost got twelve grand in the bank! That's not so shabby, but what is making this super difficult is winter, nothing grows, like literally nothing. So I tried to start building myself a house, but um... I got this far basically, so I decided to change the kind of wood that I wanted to use, but as it's not actually that bad in terms of snowfall, I think we might be able to get away with this for a second. Also I am wearing a bit of a crazy skin, just because I used it for my thumbnail last time. I didn't realise that you could use it with the googly eyes. I had no idea. Right, this is perfect! So my Sakura trees, Sak-oora trees, I'm not quite sure what to call them, but some of you guys were saying I don't know how to say it properly. But hey, its one of those things! I need to grab as many of these as possible. 'Cause this is what I want to build my house out of. I know its gonna be annoying, but I really really want to build a house out of this, It looks so good! and I'm ready, I'm so ready, I just don't have... wait, where where's the last piece of wood, what's going on? There it is! I found it! Get out of here! I just love how it does that, its so cool! I do also need to be really really careful, because it's going to get dark a lot sooner, thanks to the amazingness that is Winter! That means nasties are gonna be all over the place. Luckily though, I'm getting a lot of saplings, from these trees! Like I mean a LOT of saplings! It's crazy! So, I should be able to put up a lot of Sakura trees, Sak-ura trees, whatever they are called... *chuckle*. Oh, oh! Oh, it's like a white spider! What is that? N!o No no no, this is not happening, go away! Stay away from me, ow! I've only got 5 hearts! My sword's leveled up, but I am not doing too well! I think I'm going to steal, some leather, to make some armor because, I'm not feeling too great right now about my exposed body to the elements, and also all of these nasty animals! No, what was I just saying! What was I just saying! Get out of here! Stop! It's gonna kill me! It's actually going to kill me! Stop! NO! Don't kill me, I've just thrown something... What was it? *you died music in background* NO, so angry!! Why is this happening to me?! Wolf, why is this happening? Now I need to collect all my things again, and I cant even see where they are. You explode so much, in this mod pack, when you die! This is crazy, just absolutely crazy, and it doesn't help when the is a zombie chasing me down either! Where's my sword? Yeah! you want some huh? You want some? I think I was actually dying of thirst, at the same time so that death actually helps me out a little bit... Oh my goodness what is that? What is that!? WHAT IS THAT? *baby zombie noise* Its a zombie chicken! It's actually making noise towards me! What, and a, oh no, it's a baby zombie! That chicken was definitely killing me though, right? I got an achievement! The fireworks are ringing out which is perfect. What just happened? I'm so confused! Is it me or was there a killer chicken trying to kill me? Ooh, I just got a prismarine shard from a birds nest, and blaze powder, this stuff is amazing! Winter though, i'm not a massive fan of it at all, we've also got Maple wood! *studder* I really wanna grab some more stuff, But I don't want to die, I just want to build a house! Thats all I want to do! 'Cause loads of you guys, and I mean, I mean tons of you guys, really wanted me to sleep through the winter, because I found it so scary! I don't think you guys enjoyed it either, and I think thats a viable option, but only really when you have a house... Cuz I don't have one right now, and its a little bit terrifying, and where have all the pink trees gone? There's not that many of them, let me see how much planks I can make... A stack and a bit. This should at least get me some of the way there, right? let's light this up a bit just so that... Oh jeez, A BABY CREEPER! WHAT!? Since when are those a thing!? Are you kidding me!? What does this even do?! AH, no! Spider as well! Ok, I'm gonna die... I'm actually going to die... i'm running, I'm running, I'm running! I'm trying to get up on high ground so they don't follow me! There we go, will you stay away from me? Why are you molten?! Did you see that?! He was literally firing out fireballs! What is happening, spider get out of here I don't want- I-I'm on a tree and I'm scared! What am I supposed to do!? Slice, slice, there we go perfect! Right, I should be able to- Acually I can't remember- oh it's this, look I can do things, with my experience On my swo-RD, you again! You again, and I am very aware there's a baby creeper down there as well. No, no, no, NO! Why, I hate this so much! You're gonna make me cry, is that what you want? Is that what you want? You want me to cry on camera? Do you? Stop this, Stop this nonsense, I- Straight away! Straight away, go away, go away, go away! Get him dogs, get him! Kill him in the pool, heh-yes! Thank you, I'm gonna sleep but I dunno if that's gonna help me, cus I'm abandoned out here by myself... At least my dogs got the googly eyes. That's fine, I wish I had protection. I- I guess I should do with these dogs, but they're not doing a good job are they. My goodness! You know what? The idea of hibernating has gone a little bit more attractive, I'm not gonna lie, all I want to do is build a house! Also, where did the baby creeper go? Oh my goodness there's two! Ha ha, It's kind of cute but also very very weird, there's a baby creeper, and a mom creeper... You stay away from me, right now. I am gonna pop you in the face! Look at you though, you're so cute! Is he going to explode me? Yep! Wow! Okay, he set me on fire as well! Who does this guy think he is?! How are the baby version more powerful than the normal version?! No wonder he was like set on fire, or something crazy! Alright! lets see if we can get something done, because when we are underneath the tree or underneath the darkness we do have a lot more vision which is good. The only problem is there's literally, so many nasties out there, that this is gonna be ,this is gonna be difficult! I also don't have enough materials at all, go away! Go away, you can not blow this up, out of all the things, NO! ARGHHHH!! ARGHHH, why?! But yeah i don't really have that much materials either, because I need the Sakura trees to grow, can you tell that I'm Stressed? Can you? Part of me wanted to use the Sakura trees as part of the build, like shave the top off of them.... .... and have a tree house, yes! I'm gonna, I'm gonna do a tree house! It's gonna have a base point at here when we go in, and then it's gonna be flat on the top. This is gonna be perfect! Guys, watch out, things are about to get impressive.This is also the way i can get more materials, because I can just shave the top of this! This is gonna be amazing, it's gonna be incredible, and most importantly, it's gonna work and keep me out of the line of sight from all of those nasty punks that want to kill me! Which is- Apparently I'm not that popular because everyone wants to! Yes! I can place this down as well, this is great. I'm just gonna need to make more shears. Do I even have- I don't even know if i have enough iron to do so, but who cares when you've got a pink tree house and i can make it open as well so i can look upon my kingdom! This is, this is gonna be great, okay, I have definitely lost something. I have lost my... pickaxe, which was an iron one, which is annoying. So i've had to make this, and I'm gonna head over to a waypoint, which is risky, but i need to do it. I need some, I need some torches as well. So.... arugh.. good bye coal! Oh yeah, I forgot I need to look after these guys as well, otherwise they will die which, which isn't- it's not gonna be ideal is it, when they have literally the only thing that can make me money right now. *chuckle* I'm buying cow treats again, as well just to see, if I can milk them more then once, because I read that if you give them enough treats, you can get up to like, five a day, but i don't know if you have to leave them for a cool down or anything. I have no idea. I've got myself some milk, so I can actually make some money today, so those should pay for themselves, and an egg, perfect! Why did you just hit me? Okay here we go I'm going into this cave uh, probably a terrible idea, but I think it's gonna get me some iron which I desperately need for more shears, 'cause I don't have any right now at least there's coal down here that's a good thing and iron, yes! I knew this was worth it! There's actually a lot of it down here, this is great! Ah, Trayaurus is wearing the googly eyes too! We are a right pair today, this is exactly how i feel, as well so, this is perfect. Okay so, I have some vision, like me, I'm gonna put glass all the way along the front, so we can look over our kingdom. This right here is going to be, I'ts gonna be like, let me show you. Oh jeez! No, no, no, no, no... *sigh* This is why I want to place, up top. It just, It just keeps on happening, it's funny, It's real funny. Why so many creepers? I get it there's creepers, but why so many? So basically, this is going to be, like a.... like, a tower where you can put the ladders up to go to the top of the tree house. I think I might, I don't know, I kind of don't know weather to put them, as Sakura trees, or to keep it as wood. For now, it's gonna be wood, just because it's easier. I need to make a lot of ladders right now. That was stupid. Perfect. alright Trayaurus, this is gonna be amazing, I promise you. So the bits, in the middle are gonna be glass, which is something I also need to grab in a second. Just need to make sure I've got a quick get away. in case anymore of those creepers come up. So where are we gonna put this, we're gonna walk in the front here, and then we're gonna go straight up. Can i put ladders on here? I can't put ladders on here. Okay, that literally decided it. It's gonna go up like this, and the you enter through here, and then glass on the front, which is what i just said. So, I think this is gonna be cool. Right, next thing I need is sand, I think we're gonna have a lot of sand 'cause we need a lot of glass for this frontage. It's gonna be cool, I promise you. It's gonna be awesome. Right, sand has been acquired. Let's put some in there, let's put some in there, and some in here as well. Got myself a load of iron too now, which is good. So while that works its magic, Uh... Let's go back up top... Actually you know what, I'm going to take my bed with me! I don't even care, I'm taking it! Today, I'm going to sleep in my treehouse! I think I can put a bed on this, right? 
hey guys how's it going welcome to The Sims 4 yeah I know I know haven't played this for a very long time but something big happens The Sims 4 released a brand new expansion pack I was gonna say it's cool pets but it's not it's called cats and dogs it's pretty much the same thing but what is amazing about this pack is that you get to literally create any kind of pet you want including pugs pugs yeah that's right it's going to be epic so I thought this is the perfect game to stream I haven't played Sims 4 in so long so I thought we'd hop in crazy some cats crazy some dogs and you can get wacky with these things as well so I wanted to create like one pug and then we need to get to Trey or us from myself in here then I also wanted to get a cat as well just to see how they behave so let me just witch over to game mode there we go and here we are in The Sims 4 look how sad this dog looks he looks so upset oh that's he's so excited to play this cuz I haven't played it in so long I'm gonna go for I don't actually know I'm gonna go for a guest new game because if I load a game it will be I won't be able to create my own Sims and starve on be able to just stretch she's shouting I won't actually be able to create my own cats and dogs so let's quickly go in here and here it is look we've got our very own wait an occult sim I haven't played this in so long I don't even know what a cult sim is I can add an alien yo that's pretty cool I did not know you could do that that is actually mental alright let's go into this so we can create a mixed breed just a pure cat or a pure dog I'm gonna go for pure dog for now oh my goodness look at it look at it it's actually it's actually a dog in a jumper I mean Alma no puppet can you get well I'll tell you how a more powerful you can get I'm going for a pug you know what that super cute is wearing a jumper as well that's so close doing like it's stretching and stuff too we can make him super fat which you probably don't want to do we can make him super muscly which pugs definitely are nots right what else can we do body tails coat and color pattern so this is where it can get pretty crazy because you can literally paint whatever you want on it and I haven't even tried this yet but look if I switch you around I can literally do this draw TDM on the dog and it just I read how crazy is that alright I'm gonna undo that obviously but yeah you can let you create whatever you want you can make the whole dog pink I mean we could do a pink pug that is unreal the the creator sim tools for the creator pet are actually incredibly powerful it was a grabbed their body parts and do whatever you want meaning that you can just literally create if you have a picture of a dog like your dog your own family pet next to you you can spend a good amount of time actually making your exact dog which is crazy but for now it has made me a pink pug check it out pretty insane we can also add some it has a color wheel as well we can actually add whatever colors we want check this out we can go for like a turquoise headed pug that's a little bit freaky isn't it I mean geez look at that in the st. we can then make its tail like orange you can then add oh wait check this out so we can add yellow all my goodness yellow flowers look at this is insane this is actually crazy we can go for some green what else should we add this this just like weird random grassy bits that's a little bit weird isn't it our pug is now beautiful absolutely beautiful oh my goodness how do I start again I can make him sit and stuff too it's a really cute pug as well so basically what I want to do I think I'm gonna make one normal pug and then I'm also gonna make a crazy cat and what this stuff it could do our roll over you'll Punk there we go right I need to start this again how do I start this again I don't want this pug I'm sorry let's delete you let's start again and this is not the simply gonna be using by the way we import one I want to import one because I'm sure there's a tray or us on the gallery somewhere there must be because you guys make so many Sims and I think gem imported like someone that had made me in here so let's see if we can find doctor tray horas sorry I haven't played Simmons for so long yeah there we go we've got both of us we got the blue hair going on as well I think I'm just gonna do tray or us at the moment can I just add him to my households see if house what's in my library I just want to import him place households I don't know how to do this there we go done it right in my library doctor tray horas and okay I don't know I'm doing I'm not even gonna try could I yeah I'd seen from the gallery I knew you could do it so now we can add doctor tray horas so I'm gonna add tray orison here which one's the best one I think this is direct from my series household already saved I know but I want to adds him I want to add him in my library at join a merger the house what you're currently editing merge yeah there we go he's here I worked it out right now we could delete you I'm sorry get out of here and we're gonna give him some pets so let's start with let's start with a pug first oh my goodness that is not a pug as an interesting hairdo though look at its hair that's phenomenal right let's get ourselves a pug up in here ugh here we go right we need to just kind of go through all these options changes body type oh oh no because skinny that is oh that's bad I'm gonna go for this one that's actually really stocky maybe that one's best I think we can I think we can put click-and-drag oh yeah we can we can click and drag the certain stuff anyway that was horrific ly horrific ly skinny bug I feel like its neck is it has too much of a neck bugs don't really have neck so I'm gonna bring that in a little bit what else do we want we could change it we don't really need to change its color pattern unless we change it to a black pug oh it's so cute so cute what's why is it got pink it's its toes we could give it like quite a quite a light toe which is quite cool look at this this is cute I don't think I want solid black though oh that's kind of like it's brown so pugs this color don't actually exist by Hawaii so we're making a unique breed up in here let's go for I actually quite like the colors on that though it's like a kind of like a silvery Pug I like that or what kind of tails have we got we can do a little stubby tail pugs have curly tails but that's not quite oh my goodness you make it really fat well really thin it's not quite a pug tail I mean I'm not sure what I can do about it I can make it smaller but none of those other ones are pug tails as for patterns I think we're just gonna keep it as it is we can change furs as well Oh what did I do oh my gos look you can literally merge all these oh that's cute that's really cute so let's remember this one is like normal pug I want to make him a bit shorter as well look at all these options it's like a furry wolf pug that's great oh my goodness this is amazing I could spend ages of doing this that's actually pretty cute this Soviet oh my goodness look at the ears on that what happens what happens all right we're gonna go back to normal pug there was one that's a little bit fluffier but you can't really change it that much aside from just selecting the presets that's fine we could try out clothes as well we could put a sandwich on its head I mean we'll do this with the cat in a second just because I feel like cats might actually look a little bit funnier with this stuff on and give it a unicorn horn this is nuts you give it a dog outfits and I think you can change these any way you can you can change the colors and stuff - oh man oh it's so cute so can you can make it into a dinosaur as well oh my goodness a pink one look at this it's so good so goods right ok let's let's put this back we don't want that we don't want that we don't want that there we go walking oh you can add collars yah that's cute so cute yeah we're gonna have that can we change the color of it though do we want like a TDM blue I actually like the black the black is the best did I curse no I did not curse guys I must have said something kind of weird accent yeah I wouldn't do that you should know that by now that's cool I like that right let's go for paint modes I don't think we need that I'm actually happy with the way it looks I like it I like the color I like everything I might make his chest a bit I can't make it any smaller oh I can what about when he stands there we go that's better I'm trying to make him just a little bit stockier and a litte smaller just because he's not looking he's looking a bit tall can I not change the height we need to we've got the name pug we need some names I'm gonna call him I'm gonna call him dusty Dusty's a cool name just because he's like a light gray let's go for we need to set some trades because each of your dogs or pets your dog or cat's I shouldn't say pet who's gonna get dogs and cats each one of them each one of them has three three traits that you can choose we've got couch with natachu Perfect's I think that comes with the pug I'm not you can't even oh you can't change it okay we're kids we're gonna go cat couch potato we're gonna go they are hairy dogs you get hairs all over the place let's go for troublemakers quite goods glutton is good I'm gonna go for adventurous it can't be active because it conflicts with couch potato okay and loyal I'm gonna go for loyal as well so there's dusty a little pug it's so cute oh my goodness it's so cute there we go right let's go for another pet we're gonna go for a cat this time oh my goodness what's happened to his eyes are you okay buddy you okay you can actually make it cross-eyed why that's odd look this is a crazy-looking cat right I'm gonna press the randomize button and see can we randomize the whole thing we can okay let's see what kind of cats we can get nice sy amis I'm not too good with my cat breeds so I'm just kind of shuffling up a little bit and seeing what we can create I wanna create kind of a crazy one so I guess is this like a it's like a tiger that's quite I just want to take its its outfit off I want to go from kind of like a light color just so I can paint it I'm gonna make a super crazy one fluffy what's the fluffiest kind of cat you can get this is white that kind of looks like oh it's got different colors wait wait did you see that did you actually see that ha ha oh why would you do that cat why would you okay we're not choosing you just because you did that so rude so rude right I think we should make like a unicorn cat just these cats are disgusting oh my goodness these cats are so disgusting I've actually seen that you can make kind of like robots as well but I'm not sure where that would be or whether it's just dogs that you can do that with there's definitely a way you can do robot dogs oh my goodness they have different style you can make a shark head with angry eyes how can I even the sea how can I even see that's great though a little a little lion a toastie or a sandwich dinosaur this one doesn't have the unicorn horn though does it it has a shark instead that's unfortunate you can make cool hats too I think it's good it's got the onesie on there we go can that can that is here we have to make it red for that though what should we do I kind of like I want to do crazy but I also want to make it sushi oh this is too much fun we haven't actually made our cat properly yet let's take up all the outfits and we still need to choose I think this cat's fine I just want to kind of make it a little bit more more white just so I can paint let's go for a stubby tail just because they're super cute I mean why not we need a coat collar let's go Queen if we make it all white with a look weird I think that's too bad what did that change okay I like that adds a little bit of dynamics to the coat I mean go for a pick oh my goodness look at that that's awesome that's so awesome I'm gonna keep the pink cap I like that a lot and should we make you super fluffy as well what's the fluffiest cat we can get oh no it's a skin it's one of those cats that just skinned I've actually have you ever stroked one of those before it's so weird they're like really warm skinned animals right what's the fluffiest one I think this is the fluffiest no this is the fluffiest definitely right when you choose some clothes I think you can change the clothes afterwards I'm pretty sure we've got tacocat up in here we've got samurai cats dinosaur cats and sushi cats I mean what more could you want guys what more could you want it's not I kind of like this but I feel like it's a bit much the sandwich is definitely a bit much it can't see if it wears the shark could wear a bow tie the bow tie is cool go white red purple the white is nice or just pink yeah let's do that we can also put a hat on it it can wear jumpers as well oh look at that it's like a Christmas jumper but not gone sub me cat there we go look at it it's so nice got a hoodie as well oh my goodness this is great let me sit down sit down please I like the hoodie it makes it kind of like a little gangster cat our prisoner ha ha ha oh that's that's cool I think I like that one the best we've kind of made like Hamburglar into a cat I'm not sure how but I'm gonna keep that for now I think make you super skinny can make you super yeah let's make you super muscley this is the American long-hair cat but we're gonna call it something else we're gonna call it I think we should call it hamburger just because I mean why not I think it's beautiful I might be it gets but a little bit smaller just I feel like it's a bug I just tell smaller as well but so you can see look you can literally just click and drag any kind of parts but I want it to be super fluffy a little bit skinnier I like it I like you're right let's see what traits it's got its got fluffy they'll hack up hairballs more often is he gonna do it again that's so gross no take that off that's gross let's go for curious cuz kind of like cats are all curious well we could call it something else if you got any other names put them in the chat from you guys and then while I've picked this you could choose something else let's go Oh what else there's so many good ones playful and then one more ah clever they can even understand Simlish when spoken to that's pretty cool I think that's quite actually like the name hamburger though I really do and we can make the Pug a puppy somehow it's kind of like an adult at the moment I think I don't know you can change their their state so to speak I believe as is for now I think randomized the gallery no I think gonna leave as it is cuz we could adopt a puppy as well hammy fluffy fluffy scarlet or strawberry is a good name pinky sprinkles mittens Fluffy's Pink Panther poopy no I'm not poopy pants cotton candy we could just call it cotton let's call it cotton because it looks like cotton candy that's a better name you guys didn't like hamburger and then trace is chilling over here he is the he's full of knowledge he's also a genius is he clumsy as well is that what it is yeah clumsy and all he's already got genius oh it's nerd brain he wants to both be smart and handy that's cool dusty cotton and dr. Troy Horace I like them we're gonna send them off into the world oh wait did I not do I have to call it Drakken named it twice oh is this the breed name I think that's a breed name I'm gonna go dusty and then I guess it's last name is tre Horace what's Travis's last name yeah let's trace and then we're gonna go cotton Troy Horace hopefully this doesn't mess up but even if it does we can go in and fix it any way I like it it's so cute nuggets nice - I'm happy with these guys let's send them off look haha look how he's posing with that Pug its licking him it's so cute so cute let's randomize the portrait oh look he's super evil down the bottom as well this is cute my guy my little cat here is definitely some kind of I don't even know like a burglar a robber some kind of cat version of a gangster it's one of those things I want the first one there we go right we need a house though but I think they've added a new town into the world oh wait hold on a second my game is not properly stretched let me just fix that there we go much better so there's a new world it's called brindle tun Bay I'm gonna go there just because we don't have much money actually we have 24,000 that's not bad I don't really want to start again I can't afford this lot no sporting space can we only choose blank Lots we've got this house Bedlington boathouse it's right next to cavalier Cove Sables square so we want to have oh this is Christ where they've changed this I'm just gonna buy a premade house just we can start playing like straight away if it's unfurnished we get ten thousand if it's furnished we get four let's go furnished let's definitely go furnished because then I'll just save time I want to get into playing this and seeing what our cats and dogs do yeah this is this is gonna be fun really fun so the unique thing about this cats and dog expansion is you can't actually control you can't actually control your pets they just kind of do whatever they want so that's exactly what they're gonna do you can influence them to do stuff but apart from that they do whatever they whatever they please that's fine I'm not gonna cheat guys I'm just gonna play this normally also this is a pretty place to live I mean they've got a the giant house look over there got a swimming pool sweet roof but we're right next to the beach which is amazing for walking the dogs have a quick look at our house as well we've got ourselves we need to buy some means buy some pet stuff but a house is actually looking okay I don't mind it so much this open is once and stuff I haven't played this in so long by the way guys do for me a little bit rusty just give me a chance I haven't played it in forever good old bedroom upstairs little desk I like it I like it let's put the walls like this the wolves acting a little bit weird I don't know why I mean I guess we could extend to this at some point as well we have four thousands I think we should upgrade we haven't really got any things so let's buy some stuff shall we let's definitely buy some stuff because otherwise we're gonna be in big trouble with no TV no pet stuff can we sort by pet stuff I think we can packs and cats and dogs and by the way I keep saying pets but what I really mean is just cats and dogs I don't want rooms own items so these are all the new items which are pretty cool it's made this bigger we've got I need stuff that's just for them to play with and to live with let's go for comfort so apparently there's not that many dog beds at all we've got this one which is like different ones just a pet beds pet sleep station I mean they're not great but they're okay I don't even know where to put this so we come in the front door we've got our kitchen down here got a bathroom here and I feel like moving the bathroom along I think I want to move the bar from along let's get rid of all this stuff forgive me while I just fix this I don't to move that I want to move this wall I move this wall I want to actually do I just want to get rid of that wall because I want to just have the kitchen in with the living room and then just have a dining room around there with some pet stuff I just want to move dish I guess I could do that yeah there we go just put it into the corner a bit then we want loads of space if we just move this move the light as well perfect now I just need my dropper tool I just need to make this all the same and then we can fake itching in which is much better I don't really like these lights that much but I don't think I really have a choice because we don't have much money can I afford to bring this wall out a little bit $12 of course I have enough money for that now we need to buy a kitchen though should we just go for pet stuff I guess we can't we can only afford certain things I think we should go big on the the oven because that's going to affect our mood quite a bit let's go further White's just because it looks alright let's go for the fridge is quite a decent choice an important choice even its 1,400 I think we should go big on the kitchen is there a better color scheme for that not really that's the lightest it goes okay what else do we need you just need a few counters we don't need to go big on these we just need like a simple gray that's pretty nice I like it I like it I guess we just need a sink as well but part from that I don't think we need much else let's get a little bog standard sink there we go what else do we need apart from that guys I guess we could add somewhere where we can sit by just I'm where you're spending too much money right now we got 2333 we need to buy a TV as well TV and television so we can buy a penguin TV we can't really afford that much I don't really want this could I sell this it's a fireplace it's 480 that's fine TV stands we can afford a better one now I kind of want to put it on the wall why can't I put this on the wall you can only put certain ones on the wall okay this one's 2600 we do not want to spend that much we just need like a little table coffee table down and say well we go coffee table this is buy something nice and simple it's called the mega coffee table but you know what it's not that mega is it I just want to change the the color of it actually I like this one better yeah I like that one a lot better now we can get a TV we go for this one you seem to spin this round there we go beautiful actually that is really expensive as a TV let's go for that one goes on the wall this one's 1,000 okay let's go for this one instead there we go TV done I'm gonna buy a better couch just because I can afford it right now wasn't going to put the lamp in the corner and trying to use as quick as possible so we can play with the pets so far and he's doing real simple that looks beautiful try us it's gonna be amazing for you buddy what else do we need I think that's pretty much it we've got toilet we got shower we've got some money to spare we just need some pet stuff let's filter that by cats and dogs I just want to see everything really gradually let's go for weird dog beds what color do we want when he's throwing lights this is a terrible bed though I'm just gonna keep it like that whatever better ones do we have that one's not so bad that one's not so bad that one's got a cool pattern on it let's go for that one pets so we also have litter trees which we definitely need this is a kitty litter laser box which allows the poop to be zapped by lasers which is pretty cool so we're gonna do that I don't know what else we needs I guess a feeder would help let's go for actually like this style I'm gonna put all the pet stuff in the same place let's go for anyone with a dog bone on it there we go I don't know if they're gonna be good eating together or not but we're about to find out and I think that saw how it's done we've done the improvements I guess we need some toys got little balls it's a bird let's do the bird ball let's put that down here we've got hoops we got the cat Dazzler I mean what could go wrong with a cat Dazzler let's get a green ball as well unless just hop in and play I mean what could go wrong let's try and interact with these suckers I'm excited right get to know let's get to know our little look he looks so evil so evil I don't even know what gender my cat is that's really bad can you play your cap least rarest need

gained 21 Sims to Graham Fuller's amazing absolutely amazing what else can we do offer friendship I guess we want to do that because it is our pets play of laser pointer I'll get to the Pug in a seconds and then praise and then we can get to the pot right lads offer friendship let's pet as well and let's all we can train them to trained commands it can do he'll go and walk us go potty change outfit leash and pickup that's pretty cool Dusty's a lower dog they like to stay close to their owner okay that's fine I don't offer friendship this is you play and see what happens look at this just try to get it funny just play with a laser pointer that's so cool I like that so and then they gonna become friends so cue guys I like it they've been missing pets for a long time from this game it's good like what is that on the end of fish it's a mouse it's like a mouse laser pen that's cool I like that I like Travis's outfit by the way whoever made this tray or US made a good in a real Gooden okay you can stop playing that laser pointer now come on buddy show some show summers appreciation for your pug okay he's just like just chillin by himself so cute I think it to him anyway I don't actually know how although he became friends with cotton as well I don't know if you can see that it's behind my FaceCam but we did just become friends and now I think we're getting to know our very own little pug cotton is a curious cat try asking them what's that I'm watching him investigate around the house I just saw them bowl off Cotton's gonna be the first one in the house look at him go haha what are you doing you look like you're up to something it's gonna chill on the counter I mean that's fine you can do that if you wish looks so awesome I love the eye colour as well we should have chosen a different eye color maybe what are you guys doing you need to play with your dog why are you not doing why are you not doing that wanna see what happens it's a little question mark Hey what who are you sue what's your name Supriya dongho what are you doing here I'm trying to entertain my dog let's see if we can welcome to the neighborhood thank you thank you for something asked to go potty so obviously an incredibly incredibly important lesson is to teach them to poop outside I mean there's no other way to put it is there can you do it dusty yeah dusty that's what I'm talking about you did good can I praise them now good job dusty thanks for walking through my legs come praise Him praise them well what's this welcome to the neighborhood people are coming to visit get to know you maybe and bring you a fruit cake no pressure just let them get to know the people enjoy the company okay it's pretty cool well I'm gonna focus on mostly the pet stuff just because that is what we we're kind of doing in this stream slash video where is our cat gone that is a that's a sneaky looking cat guys if I ever saw one look it's prowling around and stuff too alright I need to figure out how we actually feed for this I'm going to fill all the pet bowls I'm sure dusty will come in at some point I just don't want them to go hungry of course and of course we need to get us a job but I'll need to really give him money he doesn't really need anything else oh we got a picture got a picture of dust no we got a picture of cotton let's have a look at that real quick there we go looking good looking good cotton so when we seems to gram our pets we can actually put them on the wall which is very nice yeah okay dusty why store another dog ass or another dog quit is this someone's dog or is this just a stray that's a cool dog it's blue hey blue how you doing where you're going huh is it a stray or is it this person's dog because you can get strays in this game so what you can do is you can actually per friend strays and I'm pretty sure you can put them into your household you just go in see you later blue see you later buddy it's a bit stinky as well oh look it's playing with the ball I knew we should have got this does here's a couch potato they really just like running and prefer to be lazy chuckling go yes cotton it matches you perfectly that how cute is that it's so cute it kind of makes what the ball just went do you see that the ball just went inside Cotton's neck that was a little bit random right tres I forgot that I need to buy you a inspire your bookcase or bookshelf I think there's a really cheap one that's a kid's one I just want the cheapest one hundred seventy five yeah this one looks okay just so we can actually learn things I want to read no I don't need to read any of those I want you to study cooking how do I do that Oh purchase books that probably helps oh look he's holding the cat's came of groans that's actually hilarious skill baking Volume one cooking there we go $75 for a book though that's so expensive so expensive objects purchase can be found in the bookshelf thank you just so that rurus when he does need to cook doesn't set everything on fire I don't think we have that's a good point actually we don't have a fire alarm can you get one of those you can so no they took out burglar alarms I'm pretty sure they did anyway well they took out burglars completely Oh you okay there dusty oh my goodness look at its teeth dusty is so cute I saw open his mouth a minute ago so dusty really is a couch potato just like chilling out and do noting things having a really nice dream as well so cute right Russ I might need to get you a job as well just because you don't have a career right now which is a little bit worrying but apart from that I think we're pretty much set I just need him to quickly research his or what's this laser silliness he got he got an achievement from that that's nice choice we didn't read long enough you need to read buddy come on you need to get yourself a cooking skill otherwise are gonna be in big trouble on you here's a bookworm so we should be able to get some decent skills I just need you to go up and up and up and then we can check on our cats and dogs it takes ages to go up oh my goodness no wonder he's getting boards Wow dusty ah Dusty's awake should we take dusty for a walk guys I think we should here we go let's do go on an adventure together and that's cool from an adventurous dog yeah let's do that try us and dusty into the world by themselves that's so cool the seasoned adventurous dog watch out there might be they might return from a night out on the town of more than they had before so they can make disappear is that that's a little bit worrying isn't it they can just disappear and adventure oh where you going her she disappeared Adventure is out there is time for an adventure dusty sniffs the air picking up three distinct paths distracted by sense in all directions dusty need some help deciding which way should doctor take them should we go to the town square the lighthouse or whisker man's Wharf I'm pretty sure whisker means Wharf is just behind us I think oh so a lighthouse on doctor's okay dusty takes off the path looks like it's going to be the old brittle tube a lighthouse there are rumors around town of a malicious looking ghost dog that haunts the bay old lady Crabtree says he can be found late at night howling from the top of the tower I'm sure it's just superstition doctor thinks oh that's creepy let's go onwards so annoyingly we can't actually see them on the adventure because that's just how Sims fool works the two entered the brindle tonight information center and gift shop where an elderly white-haired man is selling postcards he sees them and bright up the top of the lighthouse is always open for the best views of the bay but I'm about to go on a break next time I'll take you through and teach you some interesting history with that he shoes them out swear doctor looks up at the lighthouse once more before heading home what a great adventure what a terrible adventure I mean we didn't even grab anything from that we didn't do anything or what's this don't only the businesses oh yeah guess you can be a vet I completely forgot that's one of the biggest things in this in this game and I completely forgot so looks like Cotton's ad using the the cat bed which is good I don't know if they can share it but that'll be quite cute too right I want to go ahead and train them let's train them at you roll over see we can do that well let's get a bit dark the stairs a little bit weird pet training skill so we gain skill as well as the dog you can do it you can do it dusty I believe in you oh oh just do it just do it straightaway you got this gone dusty roll straight over or don't I mean you can if you want to I saw you just do it here we go yeah oh that's cute I like that a lot do it again do it again do it again do it again why are you opening your mouth like that you barking at me now go on try us convince it to do a roll over the cat bed actually has a use I know I think cats and dogs can pretty much just sleep anywhere which is good but they're actually oh I said they were making you to the cat bed but you know Cotton's just playing with that ball good job we bought that ball because this is loving it absolutely loving it and now dusty knows how to roll over perfect let's give it a treat a five-dollar treat I don't know there's no like progress bar so I guess they just learn it maybe and you can't check on the dog because oh no any means do that give treat you I want to give tree stop because no progress box when you click on the pet it doesn't give you the stats on them which is weird but hey I guess that's you don't have control over your own pets in real life so I guess that's why they've done that to be honest all right give her a treat here at a treat it is a big treat no wonder it costs five dollars my goodness yeah why have we got hatred already why did Justin and Supriya not like us because we didn't actually say hi sorry I had myself some pets I'm so sorry but it's do some more kind of bonding things go and walk yes we gotta walk let's do that let's go for a jog me and dusty go in onwards what game is this this is the Sims for cats and dogs look how happy what does this mean leash Oh so we can just automatically leash them up here we go dusty and Trey are us out for their first little walk the lead is going through the stairs and the house but that's absolutely fine oh my goodness dusty went through the dusty read through as well oh no I didn't mean to do that Troy vs. Troy is benefiting from this walk as well are you just gonna go backwards and fourths is that what we can do you're dragging dusty through bushes it's not very nice yeah this is cute though it kind of gives like a really cool atmosphere to the game just having oh my goodness having just extra animals and stuff around just because because they are because they work by themselves as well where did you go they just kind of do their own thing oh hey this is a bit buggy isn't it there's a dog in the floor I think what is this guy doing hello hello sir are you okay I want to see what he's walking and when when it's gonna appear it looks like he's just walking the sand aisle there you are okay that he does have a dog attached to that lead that's that's good to know look how cool this is a lot some good relationships going on tourist needs to go to the toilet but trust this isn't about you today this is about the cats and dogs so they just kind of run infinitely oh this is a lot that we could have bought as well so we're just running on other people's I'm just running on other people's lands that's fine I guess that's a cute dog as well there's some treasure down there let's remember that let's head home go home with your dog tree or us don't leave your dog out there though please don't it's a really nice place to live there's loads of people around it's right by the sea there's dogs around there's cotton what you're doing where you're going cotton you okay just going to explore I like that I'm glad we gave them that trachs it just means that they're just gonna just gonna chill that's pretty that's a pretty cool picture if I do say so myself cotton you're a natural an absolute natural let's go home now how do we can we unleash so that they can just do its own thing I guess all right I was wondering white roses spinning around in a tornado but he's just kind of doing doing a little change right let's use this Rose is gonna have to cook for himself as well he's gonna have to get a job I'm gonna have to get my job now on I join a career can we join the vet career without actually having to run the vets ourself I'm not too sure but I guess we're about to find out what job should we give him this have a look is that mods no this is like an official expansion pack no mods required to be a detective a doctor and a scientist and these the ones we have to play through yeah so we need sir well we don't have to we don't have to go with them a tional athlete business criminal critic culinary and sane a painter politician see Granger's social media tech guru or writer what do I want to do I guess he should be a scientist but I don't want to go to work with him every time can I make them go to work by themselves of these careers I don't think I can what could I I'm gonna make you me an astronaut Space Ranger yeah actually I've done I don't know I'm a tional before she make him a criminal definitely criminal active entered the criminal career doctor is now a tough guy at Mob Wives he starts Monday at 5 p.m. what day is it today I'm just gonna find out right now I'm clicking the wrong thing he's got working 23 hours that's not so bad you forgot to go to the toilet trailers come on now buddy come on now it looks like it looks like Cotton's having an absolutely great time just chilling I think they can go on top of the fridges and stuff too which is quite cool why you uncomfortable just go to the toilet terrace oh there's no door no wonder that's hilarious we actually took the door out let's just grab some daughter Sally we're talking we have Fords I just one like a normal door that's hilarious I was trying to make him go to toilet when he didn't even have a door we go gray there we go try us now you're free to pee to your heart's content there you go I guess we should make him get his own food as well what should he cook let's try grilled cheese and I guess should we adopt as well because when you adopt what happens is they bring over three and then you choose between them you can choose between nine bring three over and then you can choose from there so I'm gonna do that too I think when you do the phone for that move our households buy a vet clinic I don't want to do that take a selfie take photos of how do we adopt there is a way to do it open up a change phone cover collar hire a service I guess let's do that after he's Kurtz we once small pet no cost no puppies or kittens in your household oh that's so pet I do not want to do that adopt a care adopt a dog it's I would have enough money we have to go to work today I'll do that first gene stress you spent too much money on your beautiful kitchen don't mess this up don't mess it up you've got this oh look at these two just conversing over a grilled cheese sandwich beautiful don't burn yourself though call and that would be bad when they're you okay dudes you okay you can't really tell them what to do I'm not sure what this means cool over just go over and chill so I don't like him chilling out side by himself or herself I don't know what gender that that the dog is did you do it don't put that when you put in the Guinness troche you're a mess eat the grilled cheese sandwich actually think I did okay with no cooking skill or one cooking skill yeah she did all right yeah she did okay dusty how you doing buddy you doing good ah Sookie I like the white little paws we've done as well I think you can sniff the food can you see that it's like properly sniffing and licking the lips that's that's detail right there well let's speed this up its getting to 850 he's not actually that tired considering you went out for a run earlier and these two are definitely conspiring against us definitely I can like because of the outfits the because the outfit that cotton has I can definitely take my pet to work I would take my pet to work day that'll be great right clean that up buddy you don't need to read what we what can we teach we not teach cats anything lecture about jumping on counters or not you mind that too much I don't think we can actually teach the cats anything Pam put on the couch let's see what that does wanna see all the interactions let's see what happens I'm just gonna chill together oh look how cute yep she said exactly the same thing ah oh there we go how cute is that guys I love that we got a pink cat as well imagine if you get those in real life without having to dye your cat's cuz that's that's probably not that's not legal definitely not so cute right I think I was gonna say we could probably give I can probably give dusty a shower but I think you need a bath to be able to do that Dusty's not really doing anything by herself he's just kind of chilling just kind of stands doing nothing I guess that's a little bit weird oh we can brush them - that's cool brush I just want to keep the I want to keep the love separated snow what's it cords I'm gonna deal it out equally not separate it I'm sure I should probably go to bed soon there we go brush in the little puggy it's sticking its tongue out nice what else can we do get to know I guess we can converse with our dog we can also take them to the vets as well also I'm wondering what happens if you don't encourage them to go to the toilet whether they just do that I don't know just randomly are you okay to us why can't you do that I kinda want to take them to the vets but it's kind of late you know what let's go upstairs and I think cherish would call it a night what times is work 5:05 p.m. okay that's not so bad that's actually not so bad at all we're just gonna chill on the sofa with cotton until it gets to bedtime look how small our TV is you can't actually make things bigger but I can't remember the shortcut for it it's like : plus I can't make it bigger there was a way to do it shifts control I'm trying to figure out I did it in one of my videos but I can't remember how there is a way to do it though pair up sessions like most pets conquer get and explicitly obsessed about things around the house keep it on their furry companions to discover their unique interests white chairs why are you sleeping on the couch you have a bed upstairs go to sleep buddy it's fine right what we're gonna do now is we're gonna get two hours to sleep hopefully go to the next day and then I'd square brackets okay thanks for the help guys I just wanna make this a bit bigger when my square brackets there we go who needs to spend loads on a TV when you can make it absolutely massive that's what I'm talking about definitely can you make it even bigger than that y'all biggest TV in the world we don't need to spend money on a TV when we've got one this big I'm gonna put this I move it that's gonna move up here need to take way more pictures of our cats and dogs and when we earn enough money we're definitely gonna adopt one just because it gives you like the random ones look wait wait wait ah sleep it down here why are you getting up why are you getting up go back to sleep it's 4:00 a.m. it's not even 4:00 a.m. come on you don't wake up cuz you're stinky oh is it because the dog was barking is that why and I want to make sure that I want to make sure that Rose gets sleep cuz he's gonna work till late have a sim do nothing social for 24 hours whoops sorry Trey horas I was way too busy way too busy playing with pets and stuff look at cotton cotton is chilling out my goodness I love the hoodie so much should we get um should we get dusty an outfit - I need a mirror I think I can do it here change yeah yeah I'm gonna do that I'm gonna get dusty an outfit just because I feel like the sillier the better and look at the size of the TV it looks so funny it's glorious he's feeling fine now maybe the dog had to pee maybe but I feel like they can kind of operate the doors and stuff themselves oh look at the dreaming Dusty's dreaming amazing that's so like natural-looking considering they're like in The Sims 2 pets they weren't I don't think they're though this natural looking they just kind of have really good movement and stuff and really nice natural behavior apart from dusty you kind of just sleeps and does nothing but I guess that's from his traits right just a couch potato well I want to get dusty and says he loves the ball give dusting outfit I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna go and then when we come back from work we should have enough money to be able to adopt just cuz I wanna see what other cats and dogs are out there right let's change your outfit duster Unni I saw how you can tell their gender yeah you can so cotton is a female and Dusty's a male I think we knew that already just because oh this is what you change the puppy as well I guess we can do that later on we can adopt a puppy instead right I need to give you an outfit sir now that I know you're a sir we need why can we give you these items I don't here we go I just want all of them we give you a bow which isn't that manly but fine I like the unicorn horn I also like you know what the dinosaur outfit pretty much clinches it we've got pink already real oh look it's so cute okay we're keeping that that's amazing we've got like a rainbow dinosaur pug there's not many games where you can do that guys there's not many at all I don't wear anything that looks pretty nice though what are you eating yogurt okay nice and healthy starts in the day he wants to buy it other pet toy box we don't really have enough money buddy play fetch okay we can do that I think dusty is sleeping hello just he's awake there he comes haha where's your outfit though don't see your

fonio is that easy to train a dog that'd be incredible wouldn't it oh wait corns going near where the food should be is you're actually gonna do it you're walking really slow there we go I never thought I'd be so happy to see a dog the peas in a game but you did good dusty you did good let's praise them what else could we do we don't electro out barking because or do winged let's see what happens we'll have well trained pets guys we can only take them on a walk before we go to work and I don't know why I outfit hasn't changed did I not save it properly I was learning let's see weapons when we walk okay go on a walk go for a medium walk I just wanna see if it changes outfit dusty hasn't got the dinosaur why why have you not got the dinosaur hey this guy's got more than one dog this

that before guys I want to play fetch [Music] requires having a boarding the imagery our one seconds we definitely got one at home so if I put this one in choices inventory now we should be able to

you're brushing him but he's wearing a costume you can't quite do that can you all right here we go let's try and fit as many pet interactions as we can before he needs to go to work goes to work at 5:00 until midnight that's so unsociable throw the ball throw the ball yeah dusty you got to come get it buddy only thing he's gonna get it you're all right buddy we need to teach him to fetch it's just we just threw the ball he's not doing it yeah he's like you know what no no I'm not going to get your ball how dare you keep trying though he will like are we doing it and there's another random

oh no because he's not doing the is not doing fetch properly yeah there we go God bring it back dusty ah no dusty just ain't bothered ain't bothered so they will do it Kahn dusty I believe in you there's so many stray dogs there's Wallace there's miss male whiskers who's a cat there's a stray over here there's a stray over here called Zoe why are so many people giving up their dogs that's a little bit that's upsetting dude so I've said we've got like a beach full of dogs outside our house you're cute as well look at him what's your name again what's your name show me your name Wallace really cute I think we just missed him dusty just did it do it one more time go and dusty you've got this vegetable there we go is he gonna bring it back no we missed the only time we did it come on dusty doctor is a genius genius seems more focus for mental pursuits yeah but this is not your pursuit buddy this is Dusty's pursuit I don't think that used to be wandering birds around either in the sim so that's quite a nice addition it just feels like the world is just a little bit more alive can dusty bring it back oh yes yes dusty oh I guess I need to get a shot of that look at this can I see mr. graham that I need to do it but I want to I want to take a picture now look how cute with the birds in the background in the beach that's a beautiful shots want to Simpson grab my pets holding the ball in its mouth like that I don't think it's gonna let me know it's not gonna let me now I have been amazing though this is gonna be a perfect picture for Simms - Graham this doesn't get it doesn't get followers then I don't know what does look at that pub on the beach beautiful can we change I swear you can change filters and stuff as well small photo I think actually depends on or we can get this scary dog in the background I think it depends how good the photo is depending on their um photography skill as well well that's moody I like this actually like in normal that's a good shot yeah let's do that I'm gonna take five just because you're more likely to get the one you want that's cute I like that ah you gained ten followers nice right we should leash you up buddy because we need to take you home I'm still trying to figure out where it is can we just click the leash button hug ah cute oh no maybe not can we hug and then take them home I want to see oh man that is so cute isn't it look at yours his face that's so funny right you need to go home buddy not real quick cuz you're hungry and you're feeling a little bit tense for some reason you're gonna have to quickly grab yourself you got y'all get still it won't actually let you eat have dinner you just want a quick meal though you just want like some cereal or something well let's say we can find the best photo from this and put it up somewhere sure we put it up just here let's have a look see how is that picture looking it's actually looking pretty good I like that that's it that's a pretty cool picture considering he hasn't got that much photography skill at all I'm impressed really impressed well I think choices got he's got no time for a meal and the humor and hijinks fester was in town click on any of the dynamic signs around time to find out more okay maybe later look at this size this TV AIDS massive absolutely massive right choice you need to go to work I don't know where the car is or do you just walk there's a car over here I don't know where we catch the car to work guys unless we do just literally walk I just want him to eat a little bit and now you can go to work work we need some money so we can adopt another cat or dog depending on which ones turn up he's off to work right let's wait for him to get home from work we can probably check up on what cotton is doing just sleeping on the bench okay kind of like a straight that's fine oh geez holding the second one is going on here what happens did you make a bed out in the wild can they not open the door if no I hope I haven't left them out there while I've been at work that's a bit worrying isn't it there we go what are you doing like dusty doesn't really do much $63 we can afford a cat guys but we probably won't be able to afford to eat I'm gonna do it anyway let's get you let's get you in the house for starters let's quickly have dinner let's have a mac and cheese just so you're not hungry before you go to bed and then let's go to bed Oh although no there's just no quick quick quick quick go here go here go here you're on fire trousers no no chairs pat yourself out oh my goodness extinguish self this is bad this is bad this is bad no oh no what happened please don't say trash died what are you okay buddy are you okay I think he's okay but my goodness that was scary ha ha ha I thought our only sim was gonna die and then it's a straight-up game over I'm glad none of the pets are in the house but man we need to replace theirs all he was trying to do was make some mac and cheese oh dear oh dear oh that's me that scared me guys that actually scared me how much is it to just replace this cuz I got a thousand that it's not good I'm gonna have to keep my counter as well I can't even sell it for anything oh my goodness that was a bit scary I'm gonna have to go for this and I think actually that works out better because we got some insurance money which means we're actually better off which is goods I'm glad none of the dogs in that were in the house though I think I think he wants to become a stray he's just kind of living in the bush sends pet to explore requires pet training school level 3 what are our skills I didn't realize we could get a pet training skill we want both cat like cats and dogs to come home cuz you're acting like strays right now you've got a perfectly fine house right here I mean I say perfectly fine but really I set fire in my house which is bad the pets coming inside I thought they would just automatically stay inside and wander but it seems like they just kind of do whatever they want right let's change this food on to empty that ball on to empty that bowl actually want to refill it so you don't on the eating nasty stuff I need to be a good pet owner here we go here we go here we go I can't believe we had a fire it's rare that I have a fire in the Sims but my goodness what time is it my my 242 that is not good and trace still hasn't had anything to eat I'm just gonna send you to bed buddy because today is not your day let's just go to sleep let's forget about what happens oh my goodness I actually set a fire a legitimate fire it's not good oh look maybe I should move the pet beds upstairs I do that at least one of them because I think I bought - I didn't buy - I am gonna move the pet bed upstairs though just because it seems like they like to sleep up here actually to save money I can just get rid of that and then oh I didn't mean to do that no no no no no where's the pet beds I didn't mean to delete it let's delete this first can we just get some money back and then we should be able to fill it up here there we go much better and we got $751 right when she wakes up I need to see if he has work he does that's fine I need to adopt a cat I just need two hours to wake up first oh no oh no you're stinky did you wet yourself you're sleeping your own pee oh no right I need a bath as well this is stressful looking after pets is stressful I'm gonna have to mop that up trice you're gonna have to wake up buddy things are getting real stinky up in here Kwan's doing okay though I guess you have to help your dogs more than I thought you needed to it's kind of weird because you have to continue can't control them but you kind of have to you through your sim so it's actually quite high-maintenance to try and keep them I don't know what's this where did that come from what is that is that just dog sick that's gross - why did that just appear a dog will not do it - well here are we I mean I don't know where the dogs stick came on but you need to wake up it's not going well all right clean up these things just mop over your Pug that's fine clean up this can we give them take it we can't give them a shower because it just doesn't work like that we need a bath we're gonna have to buy a bath can we buy a bath / shower I'm pretty sure you can let's get rid of that get out of here let's just have a quick look and it's goodbye room I choose to do it this way we need a bath a bath the works as a shower though do any of them do that my secrets part up we can afford both actually if we just make this room a little bit wider considering we don't actually use this other space that's not gonna be too bad and he's gonna cost us not too much because then we can fit a tub in just here cuz I want to wash my bow we probably should do that right now let me see if it works give dusty a bath yeah buddy it works I know trust Traer us to Starfire I mean what's wrong with him we're gonna give dusty a bath guys cuz you stink look at him he's all stinky this is gonna be super cute I don't know if they're gonna like it but I don't think they have a choice you just look in real your flies around you all that bad stuff I wonder what happens if you give a cat a bath just because cats no tourists so you do not like water and they can't actually swim in this expansion pack either are we giving them in a bath in that outfit that's a little bit oh wait wait a second do you see that there's something on Dusty's mouth I think I think there's nothing wrong with him I think we might need to take them to the vets should we do that we haven't done that yet but he's got like dribble coming from his mouth if that doesn't disappear now I'm gonna be a little bit worried dusty I think you've got fleas buddy that's what happens when you sleep on the beach he's got something wrong with him no how do i oh look what's wrong I can actually find out what's wrong let's see what happens I think he's got fleas all up in his coat and stuff he's got something wrong with his mouth as well is everything okay nope he's not feeling kids just ear sick and probably should see the vets geez how do we go and visit the vet cuz I'm confused by a vet clean out I don't want to do that alright rubble here we go on a travel of dusty and I will go to the vets this is bad news guys my dog's sick shouldn't have let him sleep out on the sleep out of the beach dusty will see you there great alright so you can actually in the Simmons cats and dogs what you can do is you can either own Evette or you can visit the vet which is quite cool I like that a lot where is the vet though there we go bring Dalton post pour spittle it's quite awkward to say quick get to the vet that's gonna cost me money he's sick we're gonna give him pills shots and all that good stuff but this is a good this is a good thing to find out what it's like if you're interested in getting this pack and you haven't got it yet you can see what the the vets is like cherish you're hungry but your dog is sick look at him look him square in the face he's sick he's got something on his mouth can you see it it's so weird right I think you have to go here sign in dusty for curing sickness that's we want to do here we go oh look there's a stinky cat down here as well actually that's not stinky he's like all iced up that's weird but let's have an experience with the vets guys the vest isn't too busy which is good a vet will be with you soon to examine and treat your sick pet please be patient perfect right dusty dusty need to come in buddy I know you don't like the vets but you're gonna have to you're gonna have to grin and bear it for today oh wait the vets over there the vets found dusty before we can I reckon he's got multiple things wrong with him who's our vet for today Jimmy Bustos sought my dog out please he's a little bit sick this cat's got a red nose look can you see it that's crazy that's gonna be a sickness there's loads of like unique choice where you going choice you need to go it's going with dusty can't leave dusty by themselves in the vet that's so unfortunate okay it's poor Mouse oh no we're a bad way bad Peto and his guys really bad / owners we just stood on him as well it's not good right let's see what is wrong with Duster Rooney I love these by the way they should actually have these in vets watch it it just goes up

so confused guys this game within an hour and a half is broken can you see on the left it won't do anything I want to see what's in this present I can't look after my pets I can't look after Troy ORS ah that's all I could do or like I said all I can do is laugh but now all I can do is scream found by a faithful pet companion but what could be inside put in inventory you know what I can't even put it in my inventory this game's gonna make me cry it's actually gonna make me cry what is wrong with you I got dust he's upset he's not in his dinosaur outfit at least you know what Cotton's back I

home I'm gonna put this here this is what cotton found look at this how amazing is that that's the moral to the story I mean that's the that's the good thing that happened I don't even know what to say guys my mind is actually blown as to what's happened today huh and he's gonna sleep on the bench because he literally just feels like he is homeless right now you can go home you know and our dogs just my brain my brain is broken tre horas is broken but hey at least we found ourselves a really cool blue gem well I say us it was all cotton good job cotton guys this has been a next-level stream I don't know what happened today if I hope you enjoyed it if you did leave a big fat thumbs up that'd be greatly appreciated if you're brand new to this channel and once hanging out with me more every single day then please do consider subscribing to join team TDM today the greatest team on YouTube I've been dantdm this has being at the craziness that has been the Sims for cats and dogs check it out if you want to but bear in mind it is a little bit crazy thank you guys so much for watching you have them best see you next time gay why because we've happened so nuts so nuts 
the last time we got eaten by a bathtub the slithery Oh snake ate of fishermen and Tomb Raider got fats today we are back of the second half of trollface quest in video games - we have already done this level please don't make me do it again okay here we go this is more likely what is this this is Frogger like straight-up Frogger oh okay it's like Frogger but with blue counterparts so we can change their colors that's fine that's gonna be a fail as well but what else lies within the lake there must be something there must be as long as they don't all change to the same color I'm assuming we're safe I'm swiping I try to tap the clouds I'm trying to tap the reads anything want to jump out the water and eat these guys something came out the water and ate me in my bathtub last time so I'm not convinced that it won't happen here oh oh what I only tapped him a few times why is he the king now can someone explain can someone explain what happened Here I am I'm very confused very confused hey you know what we completed the level let's get out of here before things get even weirder speaking of weird here's the Sims I'm guessing and there is a jar of pickles but in front of that was a saucepan we've got 6 out of 10 that's good going right let's get these Sims to interact first up I think you should clean that toilet it's a little bit disgusting oh he's going to the fridge and is absent ok we have killer sim in one single tap I'm not sure if that was the goal but she she laughs to him mean lady okay not the fridge how about the toilet let's see what's going down is this gonna zap you - nope oh whoa okay don't tap the toilet don't tap the fridge tap there pickles the pickles don't do anything what are you doing what was that I'm trying to grab their plumb Bob's just to see if anything happens but it's just making them talk all kinds of nonsense oh yes it was the plumb Bob's I thought so have you ever wondered what happened if a plumb bob got too heavy or now you found out the secret to the Sims everyone okay this is going back to retro this is obviously Tetris or pong I'm not sure which one I think it might be pong yeah there we go and also look at these guys afro is pretty incredible I know he lost whoops I was paying too much attention to his hair I think there's something in this afro right here definitely come on grow the afro grow the afro grow the app throat okay so these controls stopped working at some point how do we save the game ah okay there's no pinching that I can do so I'm stuck I reckon is something that you can do while the game is happening but I literally have no idea what it is he just like panics how would you get better at pong I guess just by practicing but what kind of cheats could pong use maybe that's how we can solve this maybe we can make the ball bigger nope don't maybe use a hint here I am super stuck is there anything to do with the posters maybe these little aliens can help us out no how do we do this how do I do this is make me panic no no no lose again yeah the simplest of all games and I'm stuck on it I'm using a hint you have to touch his butt wait what there was no way I was gonna get that how is the money gonna help do I have to bribe the pong thing reiben bribe em use your money you still lost okay so you have money now what what do I do with the money buy a new games console so that you don't have to play pong anymore oh okay okay yeah okay so you can pay to upgrade it's like old school mix of new school pay to play okay put it in here how big can we get that's what I'm talking about keep going keep going we've got two more notes after this one yes one more look two more yes you need that surround sound for pong you need to hear those beeps in Ealing Krispies 7.1 stereo oh geez okay did not know was gonna do that see you later bye I think we've just potentially put the world in danger what game is this that is a giant terrifying looking spider that's a frying pan that's a very obvious frying pan thanks for making it so easy what game is this is this like is this limbo I've heard about the game but I've never played it before you're just gonna cry are you the biggest crybaby we've ever seen I think so mind you if I was in that situation I might act exactly the same oh oh oh it's so evil what the spider disturbs him I think how would I kill a spider this big can I control this to like squish the spider oh he's taking his shoe off okay not sure why you did that there we go you just made the spider angry no no what are you doing why is that option oh wait a second how can we make this shoe bigger I think the clue is in the shoe what do you use to kill a spider most often a shoe there we go the old reverse pinch squish that Punk squish him yes how to kill a trollface spider that's what I'm talking about I feel like logic happened then scary okay so this kind of isn't a video game we're just playing an ATM that's fine I guess you can win money that's kind of your own it kind of works there's a king in our way what is the king laughing at you're shifty buddy real shifty this guy does not look you impressed he's like just give me my money King give it I have the choice of three cards okay I will choose this one the card of spades go and put it in see what happens did we win did we win our own money back I don't know yeah I got money okay we win and I failed hmm there must be a way to rig this machine so we're playing as the king we need to find out how he can steal this beautiful man's money if he takes the same card out how can we make it so that no no no I want I want the money I want the money if you can't have the money no I kind of want him to take a different card out I need to be like super precise of my pressing that was not it Hey yes yes I had to rapidly tap it it's like solitaire of course when you get to the end of solitaire this happens so now he has I don't know why he's upset he now has like 40,000 bank cards which is great but I guess you have to remember the pins of all of those yeah not too great it's still going it it's it's still going look the king is so happy we did it guys let's move on oh I remember these kind of games they do machines for this where you can win something to get all the way to the top but it is always always impossible here we go but okay but there we go we made it let's do the next one okay did not mean to do that I don't like the troll face skulls in the backgrounds okay it's like it's pre determining this for me and I failed okay this is not what I thought it was at all [Music] what what even was that I need to I need to question whether I play these trollface quest video games ever again moving swiftly on we have an old man and his son who looks like he should be some kind of mechanical mole is this like I feel like I want to say biohazard I'm not 100% sure though let's see what this grandpa is telling his son about oh he fell asleep he's not even interested in how amazing his son looks no is he still alive grandpa grandpa oh let's try it again he's tried again come on wake up grandpa wake up no no okay grandpa fall asleep / pass away oh yes swap him out for a nothing don't bring the poop back oh okay Space Invaders something he actually understands what oh my goodness a titbit dead wait so he did actually die no that's weird you can't die in a video game you always get unlimited continues right orders chief these levels are getting weirder and weirder I say that as I'm presented with the silhouette of a man sitting on the toilet this is and what game is this something of a ninja and a toilet is it a fighting game looks like it okay this guy isn't interested in hitting you whatsoever he's just interested in oh he passed out haha good choppin I like it good good punch in as well I like it good skills and he's dead okay weird game this like the terrible bad graphics version of Tekken there must be something we can do here that doesn't involve both of them just dying for no reason okay yeah let's just tap and see what happens just get sucked to the face this game is so weird I knew it was weird before but it's just gone to another level wasn't it it was what eight more levels to do let's hope that we can keep our sanity but first let's watch an ad that was enthralling loved every second okay this hits me as a no man's sky kind of vibe I like it or it could be Spore you never know they could be cooking what you've made what unfortunate guy he's got a fire and all he has to cook is a shrimp and look at his hairline or is that a bruise did he hit his heads that's an unfortunate hairline oh I'm zooming into the shrimp what's not shrimp do you want to take revenge on this guy is that what you want to do take it away oh oh I thought was gonna come to life we'll do something spectacular it has died right in front of my eyes so you can zoom in and then it just burns but how do we get the shrimp to not burn and die oh wait yes transformed into a space alien I told you it's the creature you created now destroy this man who tried to cook you buddy haha that's terrifying stop I don't even get to see him eat someone I was a little bit crazy wasn't okay this is definitely the wolf among us which is a game I have never played I've watched people play it though that he has all of us see the wolf and this is a beautiful little lady I think okay he's gonna howl I get it he's a wolf man he's gonna have ice I get it he's a wolf man is he gonna do it three times he is and nothing is going to happen I think we need a full moon up in here is there a moon oh wait wait what those do she she fell apart what oh okay i undid that and she fell apart so you under her neck and she's like a puppet away and now she's rebuilt into a monster okay I get it that's called nothing to do with the werewolf at all moving swiftly on surgeon simulator there's a frying pan right there look at the posters he has on his wall if you walk into your surgeon and he had posters on the wall like that you're entrusting would you mind you I guess you'd be just knocked out anyways it doesn't matter so here we are the intricate operation of extracting a booger it needs to be taken very very seriously and here is our trained professional let's use the tweezers there we go just grab the little booger right out grab the little sucker okay that did not work he has now got a brain full of metal he survived though good job Bob I take it we're not supposed to let Bob live under 100 cynosure let's try the scalpel next there we go see what we can do with that we cook up some food fantastic and the pen are we gonna just draw on him yes we are fake tattoos fake mustache great choices sir well done look how angry is my goodness okay the obvious does not work where does the unobvious come in because that is how trollface quest works you need to find what no one else can see except I can I can see that booger it's so big I can't get any of these tools to make sense I feel like it has to be something to do with the booger right we make him pull harder there we go yes you lost his friend up there that's amazing that's the best one so far I like that oh what's this it's like life is strange oK we've got a new variant of the pan there's number 9 out of Tanks we need to find the last one to be able to do the bonus stage that is a pots of gross Ness right there go and drink it drink it drink it I don't think she liked it keep drinking it keep on going keep on going it's good for you they say there we go good job what is happening trick again no it would help if I knew what game this was there's like loads of stuff around can you not find a recipe to be able to make this look even better I legitimately have no idea what game this is I'm just gonna tap and hold you have to do something different Oh Oh No oh that's disgusting level failed wait what's what do I do afterwards I feel like I shouldn't have left it let's see what happens so she drinks the whole thing whatever it is and why does that mean we win is that like a gross version of Cooking Mama ill I think we only have three levels to go I have no idea what this game is either I'll wait wait I recognize this guy but he's never usually in this situation he's like a dragon slayer or something I have no idea but he's not usually slaying toilets I can tell you that oh geez the biggest boss fight he's ever had is a toilet there's six up on him come on you can slay dragons you have to be able to do something better than this surely Oh zoom in the old pinchy pinchy worked change face what are you doing oh oh I see he's channeling his inner dragon master come on let's go zoom out and take this guy on with both your toilet brush him plunger is that a toilet brush but to be honest this needs the most extreme of treatment go big boss fight I want to see a boss fight [Music] worst possible ever seen we did it though so you two go and I still need to find another frying pan it's going old school with a pinball machine and oh geez twister prestes no I always hate it when that happens oh okay I've zoomed out again the old pinch or reverse pinch comes in clutch now we can press the button and it acts differently I don't really know okay yeah it's happening differently I like it no don't go down the middle don't go down the middle no zoom out and then do something that stops it from going down the middle what do you do sir is that just a tiny strand of hair coming off your heads it's beautiful wait can we not the table that used to be something that you could do in like on old-school pinball machines you can literally just push the table and the ball would go wherever you want no okay why would I need to zoom out there must be something that I can do of this dudes to be able to affect the pinball right come on help it out buddy help it out no you saw you don't even play in this dude needs to hit this as hard as oh it was it wouldn't have been just bear if it fell down the middle wouldn't it you don't want a pinball to the eye my goodness right two to go let's do this okay is this is that a pot can I take it no I thought that was the pot oh Jesus hello neighbor this looks like hello neighbor I don't know if it is though it kind of looks similar it's got a similar bath setup to the neighbor they must go to the same store ah man I feel like he tell her neighbor who I'm not sure okay he's gonna do that that's fantastic and now he's out of here where are you going sir what are you doing he's gone into the next room yeah what is going on why is he just farting in each room and leaving oh is he trying to get to the bathroom be careful don't let the bathtub eat you what is happening this game this game confuses me just use the toilet buddy you got this far just go there we go don't leave fart around the house when you have another room to do it in now he's dead rest in peace I failed wait what I did pretty well okay I feel like we definitely need to do what we didn't afford to get to the last room so let's do that then see ovens okay let's zapping really hearts yes there we guys see that already need to do oh hi but wish I understood well game that was well I know what game this is this is a big fat Mario Kart to the face is there a like a pan here though cuz I feel like I'm missed one I

watching someone else play Mario Kart genius okay so we're actually missing one single Panna to unlock player unknowns trollface grounds let's see if we can find it guys it took me ages but I found it it's here you had to zoom out first so annoyed alright let's get to that bonus level shall we player unknown in his natural environment I think he's gonna stick this on I think he's gonna grab himself a weapon and I think he's gonna go into battle there we go okay let's try and be a little bit more majestic than that I feel like there's something over here there should be tapped like here no no he's just gonna hit his own face you know just take all this yeah see god I was gonna say can you not take all this sweet armor for himself you definitely can and I think those are all the pans that we collected throughout the game that's hilarious we fell just shy of the 300,000 we needed to unlock the next level but hey you know what I'm not gonna ruin it all for you why don't you go ahead and

deployables waterproof Locker a small storage solution that maintains position in the water oh nice so we can put that on the surface and then go dive in right I can currently do a Oh to tank extinguisher pipe and floating air pump I'm gonna get a Oh to tank which means I can breathe for longer I think yes 75 and I got a new blueprint as well this is not the school high-capacity o2 tank standard o2 tank glass titanium and silver okay we definitely need to find some of those I need to find some silicon as well oh okay it's uh it's night time I don't like this look at that planet this is crazy my powers going down I don't actually know how to do it there's nothing to do with solar power cells what have three online I see so we need to craft Power Cells flashlight is a battery and glass a battery is acid mushroom and copper so I just need some copper and then I can make a flashlight what happens if we go under here when it's really dark is it super dark that's not so bad it could be things that kill us though whoa look at this that's so cool creature egg oh I don't know if I should have one of those look at this pretty cave as well this looks awesome right what's this see quartz okay I'll grab that these are all acid mushrooms right don't actually need right now cuz I got way too many oh no no oh this is the guy that was telling me before I'm out of here okay it's daytime it's gone back to normal look I can make glass with quartz let's do that real quick the fabricator is awesome by the way and I also need silicon rubber which is from creepvine seeds so I need to go and find some of those that like glowy seaweed this tunnels got loads of quartz in it it's probably already got like monsters in as well so I need to be super careful it's a little bit creepy but you know what if I've got all this I do not mind I need to be worried that I can only carry a certain amount of things though lime stone whether I get copper yes so you need to break all of the rocks the limestone so you can get random ores from them I don't have anything in particular they just have random things that it's dark okay there's some big fish in this new section but I think that is what I need right there so I need to be careful I don't get bit but I need these can i grab them with my hands please say I can yes I can perfect inventory full fantastic let's go about it by the way you can play this game in VR which would be insane because you actually feel like you're underwater but I should now be able to make myself fins I know I need to make rubber first there we go rubber created now I can make the fins right yes yoram okay so enhance his swim speed by 15% that's great so I just need glass and silver to be able to make this so I'm gonna go back down and see if I can grab some then I could make another oh to tank which be perfect all I need is the silver oh okay I just accidentally made a waterproof Locker but you know what I don't mind that too much I'm gonna go back over to where it was a minute ago and then put one there cuz I think it puts it on the surface oh jeez look at this guy hahahaha no he doesn't like he has teeth but I don't want to argue with him this fish is eating metal he just dropped the metal that's so weird oh right let's see how this works so this thing can just be used wherever you want but how do I pick it up again can i yeah pack up waterproof Locker okay so let's put it down let's put some stuff in it let's just put these mushrooms in for now and then if I pack it up okay you can only pack it up when it's empty that's fine you'd have to forgive me I am super new to this but I feel like I'm doing all right dude check this out what are these it's not gonna tell me they're floaters I can grab some of these floaters on this giant rock so what's weird is stuff doesn't stack I don't think no it doesn't stack at all so I'm gonna have to get used to that a hundred percent oh I see and then this rock was picked up by the floater that's awesome God Gary fish ah that's the best name for a fish ever guys I desperately need a piece of silver but I can't find any although I can build a knife now so I need some silicone and I can get a knife okay so apparently you can make a titanium ingot which is a condensed titanium bar now I don't know if you can make that back into normal titanium I think it might be a storage thing let's see okay you can't make it back but I've got myself an ingot why I'm running low on storage right now I think I can actually make a battery right now I can it's for those acid mushrooms to good use so I can now make a Power Cell as well and I can make a flashlight awesome okay I make a progress so it just also started telling me about the alien eggs so it's impossible to calculate the species of an egg from the exterior but you can stimulate a hatching response if an egg is relocated to a suitable alien containment unit so you can actually make it so the the eggs hatch which is crazy I've just remembered as well I need to make myself a repair tool which needs cave sulfur and silicon rubber so I need to find some cave sulfur and quickly can test out a new flashlight here we go yeah awesome where can we get cave sulfur I'm gonna guess in the deepest darkest of caves but I mean there's also gonna be nasty stuff down here too detecting sulfur deposits in the local cave systems as the realtor okay so it started detecting them ah this guy yeah I need to I need to leave I was meant to make a knife as well a completely forgot but I need some creep vines yeah look at this mobile vehicle bay fragment that's cool okay we need to remember that that's there cuz that's right here but the ingredients are unknown which is interesting so we might go to craft that later I did get myself as some a silicone rubber so I should now be able to craft a knife which hopefully will allow me to just stab nasties basically haha check it out I got myself a knife oh yes don't eat that cave sulfur guys I think it was this way what is gonna blow up is that what that means nice timing can I stop him can I stop him I don't think so it just explodes that's kinda like a creeper they come out of these things oh that's where you get it from it's kinda like creepers and gunpowder it's so weird I got gold as well wait what is happening to my pod why is it on fire I'm a little bit worried what happened why are you smoking but I need the repair tool like as soon as possible I think so I have enough let's make it sweet right so let's see if we can use this right now so repair this yes it's working it's actually working this is really cool we're making some kind of some kind of progress okay so there's something to do of an escape pod the solar cells are working better is there anything else I can fix I can fix this as well there we go we've got radio as well I think that's all we needed to face oh look Oh to your location emergency transmissions from other lifetimes okay so we get messages from here and that either was a stutter on the nine hours or that means that we are you know gonna be here for 99999 hours I mean I don't know but it sounds bad I'm also worried about my storage situation right now it's uh it's very bad right I need to make sure that I keep bladder fish because they make water really easily so we to make sure I keep getting there my hunger isn't so bad what was the thing that we just repaired was it this yes is escape pod that sounds pretty cool but mind you actually that's just fixing our own escape pod everything looks good and we also have this thing so this provides like a med kit every I don't know I think it's 1% a second or a little bit slower so that's pretty cool too so can we put this locker just outside here or would that not work yeah we can just put it here but I don't know if I want to do that it's a little bit risky next thing I want to try is going over here because I want to see what happens if we get close it said something about two hours to explosion I don't know whether that meant our little pod or this thing I'm a little bit worried this could also be a terrible idea but I haven't actually ventured this way yet so I'm just gonna see what happens I've got a knife and I ain't afraid to use it well this cave is Dave oh Jesus willing fish nope nope nope nope nope nope oh boy it gets really deep around here like crazy what are those oh no those are those fish there's lots of metal down there ah what are those they look like giant alien whales I don't really think I should be going near those yeah I'm not gonna touch those those look scary this is the deepest we've gone so far look at these it's like loads of cargo around here I can't stay down here too long because I will die scans suggests this biome supports extensive biodiversity and connects to a number of small cave networks okay that's kind of cool I can't pick any of this stuff up though a quantum destination is our cure okay and what what has exploded oh geez oh geez oh geez let's get out let's get out let's get out what is happening what is happening is this gonna explodes yeah yeah exploded it definitely exploded okay Wow that is insane what does that mean for us not too sure but I need to get out of here a radiation suit I see so this is causing radiation which is gonna make all everything go alien and stuff no everything's gone dark look at this - okay I'm glad I have myself a flashlight the flashlight isn't even working that well looks like things are cleared up but yeah big explosion can't be good can it right I'm home I'm free I think I'm safe okay what do I need to make a radiation suit I need fiber mesh and lead I have one led already but how do I make fiber mesh I'm gonna make this actually so I think making new materials allows you to allows you to actually get more like unlock more crafting recipes so I need some fiber mesh I don't know how to craft it though everything is looking a little bit crazier don't you think like it's looking like the moon is massive if that even is the moon I mean is that the moon is that I mean who knows oh wait is that a message I've got a message yeah I got it the red lights on what's this we're plugging some holes in our emergency see glide so if we're late for the rendezvous don't panic also don't go home without us seriously three out there's another escape pod location uploaded to PDA no way there's a signal location where is it where is it geological data environment scan that's not what we needed we've got new blueprints as well for the radiation suit I wanted the coordinates speaker manager crew reported their c glide is damaged okay so that is going to be let's go up here it's over there 424 meters let's go the first it's nighttime so I'm gonna stay in here right guys I actually think that is a perfect way to end this first video on subnautica if you enjoyed it and we like see some more of this and please leave a big fat thumbs up that'd be greatly appreciated you guys wanted this so hopefully you want some more I really want to find out what the distress signal is the big ship blew up it's crazy I'm excited to play more if you want to see some more an you enjoyed this video they felt like could be greatly appreciated and if this happens to be the first bit that you've seen by me and you haven't done so yet why are you doing why don't hit that subscribe button today the joint team TDM apart from that guys thank you so much for watching it you're amazing have a great day and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] 
hey guys how's it going welcome to another Saturday now I'm gonna put it out there my day has been absolutely crazy so I'm sorry I haven't got a normal video for you today but I guess I kind of have because you're watching this right now either live or afterwards so hey I thought I'd dive into some more subnautica today because I absolutely love this game I know you guys do too and we made some crazy discoveries in the last video slash stream that I just really really wanted to get back and explore some more it was crazy and if you haven't caught up on the last video my goodness we actually saw the Reaper Leviathan that's right the Reaper Leviathan it was pretty scary it was right at the ends which made it even more like weird I guess it was very very strange as an experience I also haven't had time to prepare for this video so we might have some things to collect first why do you have something rotten food is so weird what was I gonna do right yet today and that the title of the stream anyway is called boarding an abandoned alien spaceship something like that because today we're going to see the aurora I just want to see yes this the laser cutter we should probably grab one of those right do we need one of those go on to the Aurora I think so I'm not a hundred percent sure but we're gonna try and find out anyway it's the e-ever sounds on I was just thinking it's a little bit quiet right we should probably go in and we've got the diamonds for it could we just straight up build it cave Sulphur we need as well okay let's go and grab that we need to go and grab some stuff for the water as well I think I have some salts somewhere was it for this bleach I come from how to make bleach I've forgotten already how is how is that possible we need to be all actually I've spoiled on these so a silicon rubber and a bladder fish is an emergency flotation device it will produce lighter-than-air gas for fast personal buoyancy so what allows you to do is go from like the the sea floor to the surface super quickly it's very very cool I've seen videos of that it looks awesome right what was I going to look for bleach salt deposit that's why I was looking for let's go grab some salt oh man I knew it's gonna be nighttime I knew it's what just hurt me something just hurt me I do what it was but I don't want to find out yeah I need some salts it was this guy I've seen this guy before also you guys were getting pretty annoyed that I wasn't scanning everything last time so that's something I'm definitely gonna do today let's put this here for now we did get the scanner as well we had not the scanner we got the the stasis rifle last time with you absolutely crazy go away go away I will zap you with a stasis rifle buddy I got it for free yeah that was incredible that we managed to do that so let me just get I I was meant to do this before we even started but I didn't have time so I what I wanted to do was make sure that I had everything prepared but unfortunately I didn't have time to do it so that we could go over to the Aurora but stick around guys I promise you it's going to be amazing it's gonna be awesome just need to find some salad a little salt there we go there's some let's grab some of that also a guest need to grab as much as possible in terms of foods oh geez no leave me alone leave me alone I don't like you call this salt you actually found loads already that should probably be enough as well oh I forgot we have the seamoth how could I completely forget about that let's grab this let's grab there's some other fish down here I'm gonna grab this I know what it is it's a fish I'm gonna take it anyway and this is well hover fish sweet it's gonna cook some food get ourselves some nice sustenance and then we'll be off to the Aurora need to remember to get myself the the radiation mask though because otherwise you will die which will be horrible oh I got some things to catch up on already let me do that in a second I just need to move this because I can't actually see I need to say hi to a cherry fruit loop the cap master the barbarian king Dark Lord windfall of a Star Wars guy popular destroyer MODOK let me just get into my place otherwise they will die that's a seam off I want to go in yeah I'm gonna go here actually MODOK service plays YouTube Evan King and Bama creeper how you guys doing remember everything all the money that I make from anything that happens during the live streams I am donating to charity so just keep that in mind while you're watching live if you're watching live all right let's get that out of here I want to get rid of this battery how do i uncharged it yeah that's what I want to do and I want to get rid of this one as well just so I can charge them up there we go unload battery perfect right I just want to make sure that we've got as many charging as possible there we go we got the battery charged the last time which was awesome right let's grab some diamonds we do have some a hundred percent okay I should probably do that right now I need to eat I need to eat I'm gonna eat let's go geez please don't let me die again not again let's make sure we have the sustenance first I guess we should have food and water because otherwise we will die all right let's cook some things cook hover fish let's go I haven't tried this before let's do it okay so some of them don't taste very nice that's interesting what does this give food perfect that's good as well never eat the antenna I'm gonna eat it anyway let's do this and now we can make some bleach so that we can get some water there we go awesome oh my goodness it's so many coming in so many Ward fangirl Emma how's it going pecks row destroyer origami Watson ADL's Etsy reverend Valerie brown family gameplay Holly and Copeland are you gonna do breath of the wild I haven't actually played that for a long time but I will check that out story swap Ellis does gaming donkey kong game a 150 subs with no vids hi diamond traveler Victor and little gamer how you guys doing let's make ourselves some water before we die that would not be good we died in the last one actually and yeah I'm gonna take my helmet don't worry we haven't actually been anywhere near the aurora yet which is crazy so we should probably do that at some point we're actually making so much water right now got it all look all this water tasty tasty water that's what I'm talking about do I have a space in here I do i do put some stuff in there actually no I'm gonna take that with me and go to the other place I need I need my diamonds always needing diamonds in Minecraft but today we're getting diamonds from somewhere else also probably good to grab my Power Cell because I do have a spare one so I'm gonna go and grab that - I think I've got one we've got we've actually got two diamonds already so we're definitely about to do that I need some cave sulphur as well let's put away this these - what else was I looking for there was something I was looking for that I do need no I don't see more upgrades that's what I need to develop as well the seamoth upgrades but I don't quite know what you can do with those oh the Power Cell that's what I was looking for I didn't see it in there though did you I definitely had a spare one unless I used that I might have used it to craft actually yeah I think I did use it to craft you get cave sulphur from the guys that blow up I know I definitely will grab some of that so I'm just trying to catch up on these because there's so many diamond traveller Victor little gamer JJ savage what a name panda MC mr. cool Tania Saba's Olivia James gaming at dantdm fake interesting Aiden games diamond in the sky PK minor Valerie brown idea sparkles service plays Thomas Tanja and gaming with barb ripe we need to go into the place where those explosives come from there we go there's caves over right in there get away from me actually got me what a punk we just need to grab some of this there we go right let's make this thing I don't know if I need it but we're gonna take it anyway it's gonna be amazing my power so much you mean here brain coral samples eggs Gary fish maybe not I've already done that one I don't know am i I guess I did use it for crafting I must have done so I need to be careful of that as well I don't want my I don't want I don't want to lose my seem off that would be horrible right let's make this you should be able to make I'll be one titanium of course we do I just put that away yeah I need titanium let's go and grab it I'm gonna make a second fabricator as well so I don't have to keep going backwards and forwards between these let's do that let's grab our single piece of titanium it must be in here and now we can craft it just in case we need to get through some titanium doors because I don't know if we do I don't know what's on the Aurora at all but as well you guys said we could craft the bed so I'm well up for that all right let's craft a laser cutter two of my fat diamonds let's take it oh my guess there's so many coming in I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm trying to I'm trying to work this out while I don't want to leave without having something right we've got the laser cutter and then I'll catch up on the donations and stuff cutting device suitable penetrating standard titanium doors let's go for this yes show it off it's not you doing anything right now but that's that's that's fine right let's get in the seam off let's put on our radiation suits helmets thing and let's head to the Aurora I'm worried I'm scared I'm sure it's going to be fine right guys you promised me it's gonna be fine let's head there let's see what's going on when I catch up on these oh my good I'm actually scroll down Valerie brown I think I already said ideas sparkles yes I have blue gamers and aadya and you're AG the animation squads justin sims jeremiah says that i could play more roblox maybe in the future buddy maybe I don't wanna miss anything while I travel over here AJ the DJ Mason Megan vlogging donut how's it going dad TDM is good as well don't you worry lizard Lord Ethan Scouts oh my goodness Ethan stout sorry Bailey Willison Holly Copeland Ellery celery anakin Wagner Tammy Knowles family game play Star Wars the Midas touch I am reading the comments that worry if I do have a response them I do read them out don't you worry assassin blob man you'll see my store about fortnight tomorrow hopefully game of life Rachel Rd and Justin Sims am I ever coming to the USA I will be coming back to the USA soon don't you worry all their clothes there's another wreckage down here as well let me get out real quick just to see if I can scan any of this stuff I want to see what's inside I mean I'm a scanner ready just in case I need to scan as many things as possible oh I've got a um I've got a message that's annoying because I've only just got here I need to break these as well grab all these things assuming scan anything cuz these are perfect for scanning it's nothing in these cargo boxes there's this but we already have that we probably don't need that for now it's a desk that we've already got the table we've already got everything already winds scans man I thought we'd found something oh wait a second office chair let me scan that thing and you guys say I just scan pretty much everything I come across as well and I'm trying my best last time I died because I was scanning too much well check this out it's like a little dog it's like a little arm corridor very nice now we can't go inside here let's use the repair tool on this there we go repair this and it should open and then we should be able to find some really cool like things inside here we go let's not die this time though guys you remember happen last time we're actually pretty close to the the surface so we should be fine grab trap we already have I don't know I haven't got the power source in here okay this is getting a little bit this is getting bad again I'm going to go to the surface and come back down I don't want to die here again in exactly the same way we did last time that'll be horrible this is a titanium door on the top okay let me see that oh is that what I just did I think that's what I just did oh that's one of these crate things right what do I get a medkit nice alright let's remember cuz it gets my umm what's it called my orientation goes all funny when I'm in here I don't want to die is this a titanium door let me see if I can quickly do this where is it where is it where is it laser cutter five no it doesn't work it doesn't work going through this door and you can't open it okay I need to rethink that move all vocal prayer I've already got that too right let's get out of here before we end up the wrong way around we're getting distracted from the Aurora where's my way out here it is okay that was interesting though well what's this image quickly grab this I think I need something else to break this open I'm pretty sure all right let's get back into the seamoth and let's head closer to the aurora this is worrying but it's gonna be fine and be absolutely fine the Aurora's right in front of us how do we get in underneath here it's kind of like docked on the sand which is crazy let me see if I can catch up with these real quick just before we go in Nina gamer more mario odyssey to get to the darker kingdom i'm still working my way through that don't you worry very smart Eevee a stuffy steam brycie wants me to shout out the kids kai Erik and Isaiah how you guys doing wall-e gaming Apollo Kade Vaughan Jaden Ryan Midas touch can I call you Jasper of course I can I'll catch up on the rest in a minute let me just check this out I don't want to make my seem off get in the way all this is perfect actually one is oh oh oh oh you leave me alone buster did you see that you tried to take me away I just need to scan this if you could leave me to scan that'd be fantastic perfect we've got the Cyclops engine now all right here's the Aurora guys protected by this great beast where do we need to go we've got some what's his diamonds what are mine I was going excited for a second how do we get inside the Aurora I'm going to take my seam off because it's just a little bit more reliable of a way to get around around the outsides there must be a way a reliable way to get in it's not round here oh wait a second could be round here I also don't to damage my seam off that much we haven't been round here at all have we here it is should we go in in the seam off they guess so oh my goodness I'm scared okay let's not do that we just hit that we just hit into it how do I get in over here the light's not actually getting that good on the c-more oh no no no no okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll leave you alone ah no I'm sorry leave me alone leave me alone leave me alone oh my goodness no how do I get off when we get off the steam off this seamoth I'm out I'm out I'm out oh my goodness where do we go where do we go we'll go go to the service Oh huh you guys taught me to go to the Aurora it was a bad idea it was a very bad idea oh geez it was a very bad idea oh my goodness I don't even know what to say that was scary it's so scary we've just been attacked and I feel like I've lost part of myself that was terrifying it grabs it what am I supposed to do can i stasis rifle that thing it was crazy actually see absolutely crazy he's go to the front okay that's good to know I need to repair this thing though oh my goodness we just got absolutely grabbed by that thing that was insane Jack's fire Ruby Alexandra save us a big show Whalley Victor method oh I'm still like surprised that that just happened oh my goodness I can't keep up with these diamond shark Hayden Potter lady blog VR TM squid gods splatfest - or there's a splatfest on I didn't know that that's called SAP and Jonathan Ashley Natalie blue gee I hope it's at the right Gerrits Gary red squid god Jada and Emma thank you guys for all of the suggestions I just need to not knock this and take it back with me use my repair tool luckily the reaper actually put us down because otherwise that could have been so much worse I probably should have the stasis rifle on me right and then it won't do as I don't know I can I can I even touch that thing with the stasis rifle I don't even know I have no idea our SAP and $400 that's insane I think I saw a 300 earlier as well but I can't find it on my my list there we go that's done I'm scared Can I grab some food cold cut creeper can I eat it yes I can perfect okay I think we need to go through the front then that's probably not how do I get rid of that thing though I've repaired the seamoth why worry it's just going to attack me again hopefully it doesn't I don't know it might it might happen again I just heard it roar and then it just grabbed me oh my goodness right where it do all right let's try again just try it one more time and see what happens that was insane actually insane let me just go back through these real quick there was a 300 somewhere Alexandra thank you so much that's crazy all of this money by the way all that goes through sponsorships and through super chats is donated to Cherry every month this is the first month I'm doing it so hopefully even get a nice good amount to take it off I think we've already got crazy amounts so thank you guys for the sport it's crazy Pokemon gamer shout out to Emma Walters as well you have daddy-daughter time for your for watching my videos that's crazy hi guys Jarrod I've just said octa plop Victor Natalie blue tiger once brothers Jordan and Evan shouted out and Connor no and fast jacob how are you guys doing right these look like the scariest aliens but they're actually the nicest what do I do about the reaper go to the left side okay I'm not going through that other other side again he's very very he's terrifying I read about the little Leviathan that he does eat sea moths for breakfast so we definitely if we need to see and we need to go the other way very very quickly let's try entering the front as someone else suggested because obviously he's protecting it that's why I'm guessing anyway well what's this all his life pod that's another life pod let's try going towards it just look out for roars and yeah just be very very careful I'm giving myself advice right now this is another life pods anything insides anything inside anything will be great there's a med kit okay I probably won't need that at some point nothing else though completely empty not even a PDA in here there's a battery charger in here well there is a PDA there we go like pod walk through log scaling scary it's getting too nighttime as well so I'm a little bit worried we're getting close is this gonna happen again oh man I can't I can't keep up with this it's gonna be a little bit terrifying if you see him again I've got the stasis rifle on me I'm pretty sure I've got it ya got in my imagery so I can try and zap it but I don't know if that's gonna work I'm a little bit already is going to need nighttime but part of this mission is to go and grab ourselves a bed hopefully it's successful that's all I want I'm trying to take on the reaper love aya thin or just a normal of aya 'then I don't know and apparently is a different type that comes out at night as well - literally terrified about but all I want is I'm taking this on just so I can grab a bed that's literally all I want oh my goodness what you give me a timer to do something don't do that to me please oh my god it's actually shaking is it gonna what you're gonna do or let's leave this seam off here this is probably a terrible idea there's crabs look at this okay I'm gonna cut you crab I should have bought my fire extinguisher with me why did you guys tell me I cut you I cut you are something else's get off I killed your friend I'm sorry okay I'm using my new my on my newer my new knife perfectly right okay we're on the ship I'm really annoyed I didn't bring my um I didn't bring my fire extinguisher now let's let's see how much we can go go inside there's this infected water that's fantastic so I'm sure that's gonna make our make up water supply go down quickly of all this fire be good if I could find a fire extinguisher around here maybe unless of these crab things because they're annoying me but at least my knife is super good right now okay I don't think it'll fire penalties is lagging no no no no there's so many of them oh okay so they are eating humans right now it's okay these aren't that powerful we can get to slice and get them out what is this this looks important and very pixelated this is crazy this is really crazy it's properly shaking there's nothing I can scan and there's not really many ways I can get through this thing is massive absolutely massive so this is what we were supposed to be on I don't know there's something over there there's something in the water there's crabs over here as well let's try and one oh my goodness that's hurting me what was that I think it was the flames definitely don't touch the flames right anyone aboard it said something about human life-forms actually which is interesting so maybe there's some humans in here I mean there's only one way to find out and it's getting pretty shaky up in here Oh fire extinguisher flares fire extinguisher sweep I just need to cut you come here come here you're annoying me come here let me just pop a medkit real quick we've got a few of them what's wrong with you all right let's grab this let's open this another first aid kit fantastic I don't need the sea glider right now but I do need a fire extinguisher here we go guys we're going in this is I don't even know I don't even know what to say put these flames out this is like exactly what we did at the beginning of episode one do you remember oh my goodness look at this oh I'm a fire yeah shouldn't do that to definitely make sure the flames are out before I do that again there's something on the wall but I'm not quite sure where we can use it the airlocks in that way is this actually gonna I'm worried I'm actually I'm fine now that I know okay sweet we should probably read that in a second I need my scanner right now why is it shaking so much I don't need the repair tool I need my scanner where is it where is it or is it there it is right here we go let's scan this bad boy we're getting some more blueprints which is actually perfect because that's what we need to be able to advance in this game I am worried that my fire extinguisher isn't actually gonna last that long oh look there's something working in here Oh more PDAs crumpled up paper a desk a trash can what's this man I'm downloading all the data as well as a there's a poster for something called the prawn suits wait hold on that's that's the I'm like an advert for the prawn suit that's kind of cool okay I'm running through it oh man this is actually crazy don't worry I'll catch up on Super chats and stuff in a minute I'm just super distracted right now I will catch up on them don't worry I feel like the further we go in and the more dangerous it gets but I feel like there's something really good in here otherwise why would we need to come in here right anything in this cargo box nothing in there can we use the laser cutter to get through this let's see does anyone wait to find out I'm glad I built one first okay can't laser cut through that it's lacking like crazy that only means one thing the things are about to get mad okay I could jump perfect as long as that oh jeez as long as that doesn't mean that the Leviathan is arounds that's fine with me can we get through here or do we need a code we need to put a code in okay I can't I can't zap this let me see if there's anything in the data bank no nothing in there I don't know the codes does anyone know the codes is there any way to find it out I don't think there's anything in the data bank here this is something to do with the engineering drone I don't think there's any way we can we've all codes and clues wait a second way they're seconds cargo bay code one four five four let's go one four five four works yes perfect good job we took those notes which I didn't actually take whatsoever I'm gonna need some food soon as well this is this is crazy I'm glad there's not that many aliens in here mind you I say that and it's probably gonna get a little bit mad in a sec isn't it we need to make sure we scan as much as possible we need 20 scans for a prawn suit remember so it's gonna get a little bit a little bit crazy nutrient block oh that's perfect eating that right up this place is so big I don't even know what could be in here there's loads of loot boxes which is goods another nutrient block so we can actually be down here for a while because there's nothing else that needs to happen oh man all right another loot box so many nutrient blocks this is perfect so we can be down here for a while it's exactly what I wanted to do can we climb this don't need to we're just gonna fall down absolutely fine there's fire falling on our head though wait dude was that there before was that smoke there before I hope it was I really hope it was sorry for the lag again guys that's it generating new bits scan yourself I scare myself a lot and I don't actually need you right now right what have we got down here we've got CMOS phase drive rooms more disinfected water that's perfect what's this hey sir how are you please don't hurt me there's so many things to explore or another lootcrate down here so we're actually underneath the water right now so we're gonna have to make sure we have enough breath I hope I bought some spare batteries as well I'm pretty sure I did the prom bay in the locker room right I need to cut this open here we go this the first time we've used our laser cutter and it's pretty slow there's blood sucking creatures in here yah that's actually quite scary it's really scary actually rising tide octa plot thanks for the code by the way rising tide Eric Jenkins Brady Fox Katy cars safe it's Tonya Garland's is shouting out Jay droning keanu hope I got that right I still need to open it I have opened it can I just go through yeah look at that perfect with some med kits as well amazing my oxygen is not actually going down right now a battery this is just properly rewarding me right now I'm so glad we came in here this is like a locker room isn't it and we'll go over all the abandoned PDA stuff when we get back cuz right now I just need to make sure that I've got everything that I needs another battery I'll take it's more disinfected water oh wait a second this is the prawn Bay this could be where we scan all our prawn materials which is a weird thing to say I'm not gonna lie let's get rid of all this just we don't burn ourselves repair tool as well I'm glad we bought all this stuff with us otherwise we have been in big trouble right skylight Kang shuts out your cousin Evan hi Sabhas plays no worries buddy thank you so much mr. juicy Jackson Millis party thank you guys I have missed some so I will go back to them don't you worry oh look there's a prawn suit as a prawn suit literally staring us in the face can we scan it that's the big question if we could scan this that would be amazing oh jeez no I'm sorry I don't think I can scan it how do we scan all these bits okay so there is a black box in here a Power Cell yeah this is we are reaping all the rewards right now this is great we scan these bits I can y'all okay we might have to get our prawn suit now I got the prawn suit mark three wait a second what oh it's just a was that the full blueprint no we need to we need eighteen more but I can't even scan these pieces I can scan that but it disappears afterwards Oh prawns new fragment scan 50% so we can do it we just need to get to it oh geez can I jump up this way everything's kind of blocks come on parkour skills parkour skills buddy I know you're good in water but are you good on land as well you certainly are good job right I want to grab this pour on soo up here there's living quarters in there as well potentially some people are living in here oh no no run out I need to scan this there we go yeah I scanned it I need just need one more of those now and I think we might be able to get the ones up top not a hundred percent sure all right let's go into the living quarters we've run out of our fire extinguisher so hopefully we find another one a little there's little cats in a oh it's so cute so cute is there a fire extinguisher in here right I need to use some stuff or drop some stuff let's just drop some titanium so we don't need it pick up these pick up this I think I'm actually got way more than enough stuff right now the titanium is pushing me away so it looks in here we can't open these doors we can't even zap them open otherwise it would tell us cabin 1 ah there's more codes ah beds yes is exactly what I needed yeah I'm so excited I'm so glad we got that that's amazing the Aurora is crazy guys I can't go in there I can go in here but there's Captain's Quarters is there anything we've seen before I need to go to codes and clues use birthday 40 weeks before we get home 400 weeks 1806 maybe let's try that 18 or there's not a zero okay maybe not we need to learn the captains quarters code which we will do at some point I did see a fire extinguisher through here by the way so let's see if we can grab that I think it was in this room wait we scan there we can scan the vending machine no way can you pick up the posters as well let me see if I can pick it up I'm gonna scan all this stuff just we have the blueprints for it this is great ouch didn't mean to do that single wall shelf as well so we can properly make a really good base when we get back as well that's amazing the loads of bottles everywhere a PDA I'll take this but I need to drop something what am I gonna drop filtered water I can drink there we go oh I'm definitely keeping this what can I drop guys I wish I didn't bring so much with me now I can drop this and grab this yes haha that's amazing okay I can't get through this door I don't think I can anyway no I can't oh my goodness I was rolling on the fire extinguisher this is so good nothing on the floor I think they said something about something being on the other side of this so let's see if we can do that we've traveled really far and there's stuff inside here it's like a maze another fire extinguisher down there I don't think we need another fire extinguisher yet oh this is crazy guys it's so interesting says it's a black box over here somewhere which is something that records it's another Power Cell well let's get rid of the quartz pick up the Power Cell there's so much quartz surrounds that we should be able to find it not many power cells though another one oh man what can I drop I can drink the water let's do that it's properly shaking right now is there a way to get through there that's all I'm thinking because that's where they said the black box was I'm not too sure also can I scan this I need to know why is it lagging so much assuming scan this I'm guessing that's why this is here yeah I don't know why I'm scanning right now there we go we've got the prawn suit synthesized it needs plasteel ingot aerogel enameled glass diamond and lead we just used our two our two diamonds ah man we found so many things here though all we found this as well the vehicle upgrades that's good we can do that Cyclops engine as well well we found so many things this is awesome I'm glad we've got the bed as well just because we really needed it right there's nothing through there I might actually head home in a second guys a theme that might be the best thing to do while we've got all this stuff and then we can always come back because it is amazing there's so much stuff here what can i pick up then could pick something up it's a timonthy full oh my guess we've been through the drive room I don't think we have let's go this way yeah we haven't been here yet let's definitely do this okay so we can repair this apparently oh so we can go down there we can scan the ladder car we know we can I think we've already got the ladder actually so this is the drive room let's have a look what's in here a cyclops engine efficiency module okay so we can't get any more radiation on earth right we need to drop something else I'm keeping this poster guys I'm gonna eat one of those grabs what's this just kind of breach why I can repair it can I repair the Aurora can I do that okay so you can repair all these that's cool I like that Anika Atlantic Joe Starling shout your brother how's

know what happens if we fix these all by the way who's looking for sparks I think they were all on this yeah let's try and repair all these and see what happens just while we're here I mean why not things are going well we've got enough food we got enough water should probably take a medkit actually there we go let's do all these alright just need to scroll back through some of these real quick

kind of a little bit glitchy I'm just going to slice them all with my knife right powers doing good for the repair tool as well wow this is crazy please stop this right three more right there's two in sight which is perfect there we go files Jacob Jonathan decree minecraftgamer Hayden Potter Benjamin Christina Ariana and Olivia happy sixth birthday happy birthday hope you had a great day one more left where is it I hate it when you just have one more thing to find in any kind of game but it's even worse when you're under the water where is the breach it could be above actually let's see if we can get up top one final breach must be here where is it where is it where is it they're only attached to these big things though right so the breaches were only be up here there's one more I'm seen if I can see sparks I see some sparks over here it's a good dive buddy this place is falling down maybe is this place gonna absolutely destroy me if I spend too much time man where's the last one I actually can't see it anywhere oh wait what was that flames it's flames it's definitely one more down here and then I'll catch up on super chest there it is how's it going I don't know what happens after I repair this let's see what happens yes we did it sweet I don't know what we did but we did it the radiation levels are much lower now which is kids we did some work we did some repairs on the old Aurora amazing not looking not liking the look of all that smoke though I'm a little bit worried about that right I might head home just because I need to make sure that I can catch up with these super chats and stuff let's see if we can let's see where else we go we can go back through here I was gonna jump it that was sweet there's probably lots more that we can do here but I just haven't got anything that I can find right now seemeth Bay we haven't been here we can repair this actually let's quickly go in the seamoth Bay just in case we can find any upgrades or anything we do need to head back just so that we can drop off all our stuff as well if we didn't have to seem off already this would be a perfect place to have it see what oh this is what I need yes I actually needed that that's I'm so glad we came in here seamoth fragment we don't need it all the seamoth stuff there's a PDA down there as well perfect right let's head back guys I can catch up on all your interactions and then we can get our butts out of here can I get up here yes I can I was worried I was gonna be stuck then right anyone remember the way out why can't I climb this hello my climb this please I can't climb the ladder what's going on got to go out this way right let's get out of here I see mothers over there we can upgrade our seamoth as well which means we can go to lower depths which is something I definitely definitely wanted I'm so pleased we've got that what else did we grab I'll have to look for the crew the inventory when we get home I need to go this way this is crazy Oh guys I'm so glad you got me to come here we did get attacked by the Leviathan which wasn't so fun but you know what it was worth it for all this stuff a hundred percent yeah you can do this in VR it's crazy I wouldn't like to do the Leviathan thing in a in VR that would be a little bit crazy as well a little bit spooky but hey you know what why is it lagging so much I'm sorry guys yeah Leviathan would be a little bit mad wouldn't it and it's daytime perfect I can craft myself a bed I'm so happy so happy let's do this I'm gonna jump off this thing go into the water actually I'm not gonna do that because I don't want the Leviathan to get me a check and do that can't I let's just equip the seamoth see glide even let's go deep-sea dive in let's hope that it doesn't get us it's gonna be around here somewhere isn't it let's just get into our CMOS and get out of here there we go we have got some new modules as well power module so we can replace it if it does mean that we do run out of power let's get home and then I can catch up on all these there's so many they need to catch up on thank you so much for the support guys remember everything that I all the money that I make from these live streams go to charity Ike I don't want to look down I just want to go forth and get out of here can you shout out Ethan oil and jackass I can how's it going Sean Crookshanks how's it going

fine there's so much to get what's this I think I've been there multiple times I'm so glad we got the seamoth I'm so glad we got the upgrade as well because that means we can go lower than 200 meters I don't know what the upgrade gets us but we now got 3 possible upgrades that we can make bar there's lots of bladder fish here that's perfect I think I just ran a bladder fish over did you hear that noise right we're home we're doing good what just happens what was that something just exploded on me that wasn't fun some copper though right I need to put all this stuff back now don't I cause I

seamoth I didn't realize that seemed off here we go buddy I think I've got an upgrade for you I think we have how do I apply this do you know there must be something we can put because there's like a hot bar down there but when I press tab it comes up here do you guys know how I put the module in oh maybe I put it in in their vehicle they some of that seamoth no this way you craft him write porn sprong sue even and the Cyclops we need so much for the prawn suit aerogel enamel glass diamond play steel jeez I don't know what that is yeah how do you put so I can't put this in my hotbar either how do I apply that or does it just apply automatically no it doesn't apply automatically otherwise I would have it would have happens you need a moon pool is that what I need open the console I need a moon pool okay let me check out how I get a moon pool I don't even know if I have the blueprints for it bom-bom-bom look at all this stuff are we go to bed now as well which is amazing what do we need to make a beds one titanium and fiber mesh definitely gonna try that out I think I need to scan a moon port I do I need one more that's so annoying I need to upgrade it so badly so badly go surfer sahil Jake EDD gamer fat Pikachu hello hello fat USD Baqarah Valerie brown and ELISA how you guys doing tad roblox King Bo mystic vortex Alfie no man aqua thunder ed gamer sea bass splat him Wesley and Ken how are you guys doing right we have got a lot of stuff going on right now we probably should build some things let me grab my habitat builder actually let me drink some of this there we go I need a med kit as well where's my habitat build up there it is I don't want to see what else I can build right now I desperately need a moon pool we aren't bioreactor the vehicle upgrade build in the hour okay so we need a moon pool and then we need to craft this as well okay that's good to know look at this I need fibermesh I need to remember how to make 5 m/s we need to make a beds desperately let's see if we can make one of those and then we need to do some deep-sea diving in our seamoth so we can grab some more supplies as deep as we go oh yeah we got a message as well that's listen okay so that sounded a little bit intense and it was in that one sunk to the ocean bed 250 meters under the sea I think we can actually do that you can switch these around so some people saying you don't need the moon pool you just go to the side or something I know the power cells there open the upgrades module on the seamoth how do I do that do I do it inside maybe I can just click it was it the upgrades this is what you cropped them isn't it yeah that's where you cropped them was in the other place though we had go to the side of the seam off oh my guess it's going so fast it's goes so fast it's got this oh that's how you craft it there's an upgrade storage on the sides okay I'm gonna try and find it I don't want to enter it I just want I just want to upgrade you oh wait where is it there yeah buddy found it thanks guys you're legends right how deep can this go now 3,300 meters right we can go and find that other ship now can't we the one with a distress signal I think we should just go like right now I've got a post up wait a second wait a second I got a poster thanks for the help guys massively appreciated right let's put this poster up somewhere should we put it here yeah keep calm and be a cat in an astronaut outfit epic gamer I'm gonna finish marry Odyssey I will I just haven't had the chance to yet Benjamin thank you for your donation Sean thank you try

the tablets haven't got the Cyclops engine yet I'm gonna take one power cell with me on one spare battery the rest we can take with us let's go so apparently you guys are saying that we don't actually need the radiation suit when we go to the the Aurora anymore because I did that upgrade which is rather Pleasant I like that we're gonna head to that coordinate now which is on the sea floor where has it gone where's it gone it was here somewhere all right down there sunk to the seabed that's actually a place where you haven't been yet is it disappear when I get in here it's so weird where did it go where's that where's the Waypoint there it is turn around all my orientation went in this way like completely I think it's past here yeah there it is I keep hitting fish and killing them I think I will make a bet don't worry about I just want to do this real quick because I think this would be super cool and we can go down to 250 meters now without getting killed and it's going to be awesome Ethan Jacob Kier Matt Kelly Wilson epic gamer when am I gonna finish it I'm not too sure Samantha Suleiman and semen king ma how are you guys doing thank you for joining the stream thanks for hanging out with me on your Saturday right are we going near the Aurora it's what we going past it I think we went past it yeah we go right past it should probably take a wide berth because I don't want the the Leviathan to come and attack us again because that was that was the worst thing that's happened so far actually it's not we actually we died before so that was worse ah wait a second we need to switch these up there we go so there is still radiation or is that just radiation down here ah that's why we haven't done been down here before because whenever we came down here there was radiation and I think it's from this mushroom biome alright let's see what happens we're not too far away we've got loads of power food water we're doing goods hey Molly how's it going they're lying you don't need a moon pool I know I've got it now don't worry I'm hearing so many groans look all these things it's like a sea of these whales I should probably I have scammed that guy out you haven't I how'd our kids get in this might actually be where we saw the Leviathan before it could be I'm not sure I'm really not sure do I know the way I know the way George's jungle diamond he gets a me at the savage and a Mason how are you guys doing all geez almost went straight into a lightning thing right okay what are we gonna do with that that's a big old lump of fire right there okay that is that is pretty abnormal isn't it no don't attack me don't attack me don't attack me don't attack me don't attack me it's coming for me ah it's chasing me luckily my seamoth is actually a beast all right how are we gonna get down there without dying and worried that we might die but I'm gonna go for it and see what happens Kapaa okay here we go I need to swap these around real quick open the data box collect that I've got a repulsion cannon volcanic activity yet we know that unusual okay this is as deep as we've gone before let's grab this I don't know if I can I can't repair that look at this thing it's actually crazy it's like a proper it's an underwater volcano that I don't want anything to do with right now oh my goodness things are trying to attack me as well right I kind of want to be this low because I want to try and find some better I want to try and find some better materials and this is the best way to do it by delving deeper I don't if we were to find that knee just on the surface we definitely need to grab enough so we can get the prawn suit Oh FLE next episodes that would be Darby awesome I don't know if that's gonna be able to happen though see how much we can grab from these got some gold sweet we actually use gold for anything I'm not even sure I'm delving in let's do this let's be risky you don't get anything if you don't be risky Ruby sweets you're a knight amazing this is worth it creature egg I don't need right now okay there's good stuff in here real good stuff in here lots of creature eggs shale has got good stuff in got lithium perfect we are gonna need that for this light bug that's cute I like it I need to be careful not to get stuck in here by the way which I am pretty good at I've got that whatever that was more uranium you're you're a knight wherever its goods don't get stuck down here I got to distract kids it's like in Minecraft but you actually have breath it's me stupid careful I need to get out nice gal otherwise I'm gonna die where did I come in it was through here up here and out this way there's some Ruby on the side let's grab that oh jeez okay I am I'm in trouble definitely in trouble quick quick quick quick quick let's get out of here let's not get stuck and die like before I'm panicking a little bit okay we're good whoa that could've been bad let's get back in the CMOS we've got some good stuff though we got ourselves some Ruby urine i'ts lithium a diamond we do need another diamond actually don't we let's keep doing some cave diving just so we can find some more diamonds it's exactly what we need we're very far away from home but that's fine because we have the seamoth and extra extra Power Cells the light buggers are surprised are they super rare with the light bug is super rare man I like the light bugs all right there's a little deposit down here I don't know if I can break that open do I need a camera can we do it with a cutter it's just penetrating doors okay maybe not let's carry on it's getting deep though I don't wanna go too deep otherwise I will be in trouble I've got a message at home as well as we probably should head that way I just want to find another diamonds because I feel like we I feel like we need it for something oh jeez okay that's coming out it was properly popped in it important to sell out the sands this guy's crazy please don't kill me I found some good things I know what that was whoa it's dark down it's so dark down here look at these things is this salt it is salt I probably shouldn't no no no no no what is that something grabbed me something grabbed me don't look into the eyes of something just grab this maybe full no no not now not now not now not now not now not now not now thank you that's not why when it was it my image was already full is there a way to get like a better backpack maybe that would be good one there all right let's drink twice let's I think I dropped something I really wanted then I'm just scared that there's so many of these creatures out here I don't actually know what they do and they could kill me very very easily and they keep doing magical things to me as well oh no what was that did you see that it just knocked me properly knocked me this is terrifying I'm not going to lie to you is actually terrifying Lithia there's something else here as well I wanted to grab man I don't even know how to drop right now I can drop the salts diamonds yes that's perfect right should we make our way home just come a little bit wary that things could actually hurt me out here do I need to scan this I'm hearing noises none out I'm out let's go seem off let's go come on let's head home because there's a lot of scary things out here we're a thousand meters away from home as long as for the fire that doesn't pop up absolutely fine Sammy the savage you're back again are you how's it going Mason how's it going Jacob solid player 98 wolfblood will sooner a Nagy I have not got a comment on that I don't need to be natural fat Pikachu can I sing my little pony I actually don't know like the theme tune so unfortunately I can't I'm so sorry Simon Savage again its semen King bah Alex said I'll see Jamie's

bumbles santhi Aaron and gaming pros I'm all caught up right while I'm here why it's a little bit less dark let's see there's a there's a forklift down here what a shame that's so unfortunate let's see if there's anything to scan down here cuz I don't think we found this one yet I don't think there's gonna be any nasties down here we should be fine I mean there could be bioreactor wait a second I thought that something else so that's a grab trap got it Babloo oh we already had that vine right why do you want to find is what was the thing we really need it I've completely forgotten there was something we desperately needed to scan it was a room I'm pretty sure as a room laser got to have already got that was part of a room I really wanted earlier oh the moon pool wasn't it I don't know how I'm gonna find that though unless I find another another one of these I guess that's the only way you can get it nothing in there right where's my steam off let's head out there's a life pod over there we've probably been today if it's not on our not on our radar already we've probably been there have a quick look-see anyway oh do we have it look there's a stuff here oh jeez bio reactive fragment we've already got that is that why just scanned yeah it is there's a PDA down here perfect there's a data box as well Wow something just bit me it's you know why do these things keep coming after me can I get inside I think I can here we go there's something in here there's LEDs which I don't actually need another abandoned PDA we have so many PDAs to catch up on guys there's so much flares oh really flares I don't think so anyway there's nothing else here is there I need to stay in the protection of my seamoth otherwise I'm gonna be eaten by those guys see what is this seamoth fragment I've already got one of those that well something's firing things at me hello you just fired someone just fired bullets crazy yeah something's definitely firing things at me I don't wanna stay and find out what it is Oh another big wreckage we might have been here already though I'm pretty sure we have let's take a quick look and bit worried there someone's gonna be firing stuff for me though have we got this already we have oh bioreactor again we've already got this maybe I haven't been here yet let's see if we can find one of those moon balls what's this scanning room yes let's grab that self scout already we already know were infected guys look what's this it says infected CMOS we don't need oh hello wait a second wait a second this is where I was before wasn't it this is where he died before I think this is it this is definitely it look at that salt deposit so I need to ideally find another room in here that'd be great I'm gonna go in but I'm gonna get some oxygen back first whoa okay those are things are firing at me let's get out of here see more if I need some oxygen let's put the rebreather on did that work there we go it's much better for us let's put this on let's go through some of these shoutouts really quickly before we go in bumble stinger Xanthi Aeryn and Charlie how's it going Gaming pros keep calling me a cat an astronaut suit exactly buddy exactly it words to live by splat Tim I might think about it diamond King Jack and max zachary marcus gaming pros andrew gaming MC watt will machine metate Oh Matty Oh Lucas Latricia you need flair for your escape I've got a flair already I've actually got to Jamie and I check it pretty much all day every day at the H willow and your son Max how's it going right I think something is firing stuff at me so I'm gonna go around to the side that I need to actually you can go in here can't I just so I can use my um my seem off as a little bit of a waypoint oh man there's a battery charger in here the whole time do I need any more of these I don't think I do but I'm gonna scan it anyway just in case I don't then the plants weird I cannot you cannot you scan the plant pot perfect let's take I don't need them water right now I can actually just drink some and pick it up there we go this is different I think this is actually different to what we were before there's a picture frame as well it doesn't actually tell you everything that you can scan does it I didn't realize that I've already got that this is where I can get a little bit crazy are okay maybe not this isn't where I was before this isn't where I was before at all see it looks like you're going up but really you're kind of going sideways it's so weird can I get in any of these doors this kind of stuff seems a little bit important if I can't scan it I can open this what is this what is this a hidden room sweet I'm gonna get a plant shelf as well there's something I could open him in ego battery charge of fragment I don't really need any of these things sealed or okay maybe I can well let's get some oxygen back and let's continue going through this Atlantic Joe Stein for gaming kaya Wiley how's it going Ava beech and Lewis barks how's it going all right we need the laser cutter to get through this so glad we made the laser cutter and stuff is this the right thing that's not the right thing that's a repair tool all right let's open this bad boy sparks are flying take any eggs you find I will one I've got a habitat to put them in just because I don't really need to I don't really have one right now there's a better co2 tank I mean Oh to tank you don't co2 do you yeah I will try and find it right what do we got here more data lightweight high-capacity tag you literally were just saying that that's crazy this looks like it could get deep it certainly is what a figure in station I already have that this is Scott as much as we can so it looks like you can kind of find rooms that just have everything you need in which is awesome but we've got all this stuff laser cutters we've got because you could have come in here and just discovered all this stuff instantly which is great unfortunately we have it all ready so I will be departing what is this oh that's a piece of door I was like what is that all right let's get out of here before we drown I think we found everything in this one little wreckage let's head home we do have a full inventory right now we probably should get out of here I mean we could come across some other stuff too we need to make a plan really of the stuff that we need to do because we've discovered so many blueprints today there's just so much that we can do now there's also so many more environments we can explore as well laser cutter I already got this is awesome guys we've made so much progress today so much Casey I'm try not to crash Casey 7:27 Troy Bolton and Dallin I hope I got that right or darlin Tito mosquito Ava Beach the turtle squad I don't know that my little pony fee by god I can't do it sorry the red diver going and very smart Evie I have seen that it has got a brand new Jim on brick bronze could be interesting to check out all right we need to do a little recap don't me cuz I can't actually remember what we've done here today but let's go over here first there we go perfect oh ah if there's anything that happens let's just look at this it looks amazing let's let's empty some of our stuff we lost so much but rubies and yura Knights as well now absolutely insane crazy right what do I want to do now I've got oh my goodness all these batteries I've got I probably want to take out some of these let's take out this one thing get it right let's take out this one just because again it's the only one that I have under a certain amount let's refill it with a big old full power source and we're ready to go sweets right recaps let's go through our blueprints because we've got 16 new ones who got gianna room no locates resources and recs within range yo we can make that right now let's do it we need a five titanium to copper gold one two three four five copper and gold is in the other one gold was it two copper I think it was two copper gold titanium a table coral I had table call earlier did I put it in here I did I think that's it guys scanner room let's do it so I'm gonna put the scanner room right next where we are right now it's gonna be I didn't even think we'd be able to do this today but again this game just rewards so much of your exploration it's crazy right let's make ourselves a new room I'm excited scanner room so if we put that here is that right that we can put a bridge to it alright let's let's do this scanner room activate this is crazy Nathan syt George's jungle and dev dev whitey how you guys doing hug having a great day here we go here's the scanner room guys right I now need to make a wait is the hatch there I need to make myself a I think I need to make one of these just need titanium I kind of like the glass one though it's got low structural integrity I like the glass one let's see if we can make the glass when I just need some quartz don't know if I have any clay drop some if I don't it doesn't matter that's diamond we have so much Dimond yes no cause you know what let's just make a normal one for now I'm just gonna grab all my titanium so I'm not sure how much it takes and hopefully I can make a tube between the two I think that's how it works oh wait there's a camera pick up camera drone what I didn't know you have a camera drawing there all right basic tubular compartment where can I put this I can attach it to there why can't attach it this way I could only attach it this way okay you know what fine let's go I only takes titanium anyway can we make another one go this way oh you need an l-shaped one Punk Absolutepunk let's deconstruct this yeah let's deconstruct this there we go okay get to I get my titanium back as well that's pretty cool alright give me a second while I figure this out I want that to go this way just so they are connected then do we need another one this way well is that because I've got a hatch there I'm so confused so you can't get in that without a hatch can you then I don't have a door I could do it you know I'll leave that for next time because it's taken too long what I do need to do is craft myself a bed right now so let's quickly do that also can you connect this to your base or does that not really matter what's it gonna do we've got new equipment we can do a propulsion kind of warps gravity to push and pull objects that sounds amazing we definitely want to do that well they're gonna crafts I was gonna cross something it's gone from my brain bent we're gonna craft the beds I think we don't need our habitat builder for that though ba ba ba ba titanium a fiber mesh ok fiber mesh that's what we needs creepvine samples I don't have enough space for that I'm gonna put that camera back I don't think I need that put the camera back where it's supposed to be I've got a little bit excited and try to destroy everything just put it back in here there we go so we have cameras in there now as well right I'm gonna quickly run grab some creep buying samples just so I can make the bed so I can go to daytime cuz that's that's what the main mission was to be honest Marcos Espinoza genre awesome Xanthian spy Dex how you guys doing I'm just going to the drop off to catch them catch them creep buying samples that's disappeared you wanted to disappeared from like very eyes there we go and there we go perfect alright let's get to our base our base is looking pretty crazy right now I want to see these cameras as well but I do need to make sure that I research before the next episode so I don't have to ask you guys too much two cameras is actually amazing look at these structures we're making ourselves a pretty handy dandy base and I'll collect some more titanium as well cuz that's super easy you just get the metal salvage and then it works right let's make this mesh then we should be able to make ourselves a bed right but uh where are we gonna put it we should just put it in the place that we've already got to make sense here we go this it's quite big let's put it here actually just put it yeah let's put it here right next to our keep composter yes look at that beds get in sleep away ah beautiful absolutely beautiful and waking up fresh as a daisy absolutely amazing and here we are daytime it works guys it works right I need to put a something on the front of this just so I can get in so I have a look we got some plant pots and stuff that we can do now as well and crap the power cell charger which is awesome a hatch quartz and titanium I guess I need some quartz let's quickly do that there should be some quartz around here somewhere I've dropped a lot of quartz around here let me just quickly find some and then we'll make that because I think that's going to be good to see I just want to see what's in the scanner room we probably need a little bit more quartz as well for some power for that room but I'll sort that out before we do the next stream throughout the video don't blow me up don't blow me up I'm just in that I'm just in the business of quartz okay that's all I want little bit of quartz it's annoying I left loads of quartz earlier so I could have actually got some will be on the floor here is it spawning this biome I'm not even sure I really really don't know she's fine like a good cave that's got some it's gonna take some gold as well don't mind if I do titanium I do need some titanium actually so thank you copper always need copper man if I have I taken all the courts already I think I might have been I think I've had you taken all of the courts from this cave there's salt the guy trying to kill me take the lead where is the quartz we're actually gotten a pretty good mining mission as well I didn't realize there'll be all this stuff here I just gotta do it from biome I think so let's head out this way should have taken my seam off I mean why not I just put you got some oxygen as well Tomek dark captain cat and gaming with toxic how you guys doing Shabba don't know if I can see any there might be some on these little islands definitely sandstone we can take some of that take some silver coin there must be some around here Shirley just need a little spike a bit just one I just need to make a door I could steal the door for my other place but I don't really want to do that because it's gonna deconstruct it no court or what's this actually seamoth fragment we already have that though come on just one piece of quartz I know this thing's gonna shoot me there like sea cucumbers but a little bit more aggressive I will find him I'll find it if it kills me Hey baddam found it I know what that noise was I said bow down for some reason I think I've said it with gaming with toxic thank you just in case I missed it well you've had to be in life for a while and it realized haha right so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna quickly craft the door just we can see in the scanner room and then we'll see what we do next we're really close we've got extra waypoints because they're cameras I wonder if you can put the cameras in anywhere else that would be interesting to know just to keep an eye on things if the fire thing is trying to rob our stuff I mean it could be you never know right let's make ourselves a door shall we hash there we go let's get in this bad boy see what happens thank you look at this whoa whoa use fabric is a fabricator in here like a oh my goodness so you can use the cameras to take a look at what you've got where's there a wreck nearby this is cool can I put the cameras anywhere look at this yeah I can actually do it I can make them move around as well oh my goodness that's amazing did you know that I didn't know you could do this so you can control these cameras around and then when you've done it's my switch camera so if I switch to this it should be able to tell me where there's a wreck or anything really where is there a sandstone chunk is that right that's amazing but how do I interpret this as a map I'm not quite sure I'm gonna have to look this up this is cool though I'm glad it has power already I'm glad as a fabricator but it's only for certain things that must be what it is so if I quit that yeah all the dots go away if I want a I don't know a limestone chunk so is that the main camera there's a there's one like just below where it is I think that's what it means and then if I switch to the other camera like this yeah it does change so there's two limestone chunks just below so let's test that theory it should be one just below like down here I think where is that camera camera camera ones over there so should be some sandstone chunks down here somewhere is it correct I mean this is that as limestone I don't know where I you might be able to put on your PDA or something I'm not too sure I'll make a beacon for it that'd be quite cool but that's cool how you can kind of find things when you want to I'm gonna have to do a little bit more research on that a hundred percent but I will do don't you worry we've made so much progress today it's unreal let's go back into our scanner room just to celebrate so I'm gonna do some more research on that we have done some amazing things today it's still scanning limestone Zhang's look at these oh it was limestone not sandstone it there was one we got it that's amazing so cool Marcus Espinosa and Phil a day the cheetah plays how are you guys doing so you know up today guys I think that's gonna be it for now thank you for all of your sponsors and super chats today it's been unbelievably

So most of you remember when I played possibly one of the hardest games I have ever played ever getting over it It well apparently there's a brand new contender to that hardest game ever and it's called Trap Adventure 2. I saw a video for it yesterday, which is going absolutely viral on Twitter Let me see if I can find it.. I found it! So this clip has fourteen point seven million views on Twitter. That is Insane, and it looks pretty innocent. It's just a normal platformer, right? No, it's one of those like typical rage games. Where you try and find a where you try and find a solution to a seemingly Simple problem, and then it does something like that. Did you see that the man backs up and the platform chases him? But I'm not going to show you much more because.. I'm gonna play it right now I don't know if my phone is the best way to play it But it's only on Apple products iOS Trap Adventure 2 possibly the memest and hardest game out at the moment Let's try it! Now there's normal mode or last-chance mode normal mode gives you ten lives And then you go back to the beginning because it's made up of load of mini levels if you lose one life to go back To the start of the mini level if you lose all your lives you go back to the beginning And then there's last-chance mode, which seems absolutely crazy one life. That's it normal modes Let's do this The music though.. The music is pretty cool. I don't know who this small man is but we've got two buttons one is jump And one.. is that duck? That's ducking. Okay, and this.. is paused. Okay. Let's go. Let's do this Let's see what's happening. Okay the first level is easy. This is the one we've just seen to be super careful if we go up here we die And then we die again great. I think I saw a little bit you could land on if I did it right It's just before those second set of spikes. There we go!  Now.. It changed the quarter into a round. What? Okay, so no waiting around or it will absolutely destroy you.. I f you don't destroy yourself, man I'm getting sweaty hands already. Why is this happening to me? oh It followed me, okay, right? Uh? What do we do now let's just keep jumping? Okay, that's yeah. I knew that was gonna happen Why? Why would someone create a game like this? I can't make it all the way across How do I do that? Yo, I don't really want to wait sir Browns Okay, so I think I just like walked off the edge, and then jumps yeah I did I need to do it a little bit better next time here we go Yes, right, there's this run away what I've got one life left. That is ridiculous absolutely Ridiculous, no game over already actually we got to level three level up. You got one more chance What are you talking about? Oh on the top right? Can you see that it says level two? I don't know what it means bye. You got one more chance Normal mode plus one does give me an extra life. You legends give me an extra life. How nice of it, okay, right? Let's do this. We know how to do this bit. That's fine jump Oh that was close and now we can do this bit and this but you just need to like run off the edge There you go rod No, because you have to do with app controls sometimes like the quick movements. They just ain't very nice yes Yes, yes, I did it. What's this? What is that? How do you avoid a flippin giant pool? Hey, we did it. We have the duck underneath oh no really no. What no what do I do? Sir you're okay. I don't even know how I dodge that I think I ducked underneath it because the slot moves I don't know what to do here. I have no idea ha okay It starts to move backwards, but the slot moves you can duck underneath Then you have spikes and then the ball moves backwards. Ah oh Yeah No No, that's not How is that possible at least I can do that part? I think I have to I just have to jump up I don't know. I'm gonna have to have a look at it again Run away run away. Oh, oh oh, that's too close. That's too close Duh, I honestly don't know how to do this bit you have to be so quick come on Boulder come on buddy You got this you go down here jump up yes Okay, yes, okay. Level five four lives remaining. This isn't so bad. Is it what is this? block ball game That that was annoying okay, so oh oh What what is this what? Is this so you can fire a ball? But if the ball hits the top, it's like this weird that that would Tetris block game But if the ball hits the top, then the spikes kill you listen That's not very nice three five more than one we can and I'm game over great Oh, I got plus two so I got another level nice But I have to start all the way at the beginning great got this though, right I'm sure we've got this we absolutely fine easy game. Oh No one need jump. Sorry. I need to calm down come on big boulder come on then come on then there We go jump and out of here right ball game I'm usually good at these, but this one is a little bit of a punk right there We go jump off and the balls kill you as well So I need the balls to break the blocks and then me to go down the right it seems simple this is Insane so I can use this one ball two to break everything right it works like that Oh geez what are those? What are those? They're like smiley faces, but they don't look too happy to me Oh jeez okay, at least those don't break blocks Otherwise we would be a massive trouble But I do need to avoid them to get down to the end which is a little bit worrying I wish I'd fire off more of those balls now come on Just hit one more just hit one more, and then I can sneak down the ends. You know you want to yes No, right, let's send three there. We go and see what happens. Oh, I almost got killed there my fat thumbs Don't work this game properly jeez okay. I need to avoid these go No 1 2 3 jump off and then just follow the magic it's like it's it's Simple really it's the easiest game. I've ever played come on guys what this magic for me. Oh my goodness. Oh Oh, my goodness the app controls are so bad No why do they make them smiley faces right three balls gone, I think I'm good I think I'm good this is perfect oh Is it perfect is it perfect go go go No did you see the smiley face? Oh my goodness? I need to need to dry off Man, this is horrible. Let me try two balls. That's that's gonna be a control about Oh oh Wow so you can't actually jump over these guys because if you jump over them on the top layer You just die and here come the smiley faces Fantastic come on just one more block there. We go now oh Wait a second what if I do one two nope I think that would work though we do one two Yes, there. We go there. We go ah Scaring me how do you do it so quick and how do you do it? So consistently you can always get to wear the red faces are come on one more one more than the faces there we go How do I avoid the faces though this is not helpful wait can the faces go through the cracks? That would be crazy. I think the balls are stuck. That's not gonna. Help me at all. Oh, there's so many faces I might as well. Just give up look how many faces there, are that's crazy the balls aren't moving anymore Oh, there are a smiling faces There's no way I can make it not alive anyway. Oh the faces do come through what's not dead, you know what I think three gives you the speed to do it, but Three is horrible to dodge at the beginning come on come on come on come on. There's too many faces There's way too many faces why oh? I should have gotten it wasn't oh jeez there was an opening That's why I was trying to say come on one more one more come down here. Calm it down here. Please yes Yes, I did it. Okay. What's this? What is happening? There is water Ok spikes they get bigger, and it looks like I've got breath as well if I messed it up already No No, I've already got one life ok we need to go down I've died It actually died. How is that possible? How is that possible do that? Return, what do you three four five six seven eight there? We go. That's it? That's it? That's the secrets? Oh my goodness right how do I do this? How do I go down quicker? Oh you can press up and down, okay, right? I get there so you swim down there we go Okay, and then it's gonna go up. Okay. That makes sense then up and down. Yeah, what's this though? Oh? Oh my goodness no no no no no no no no no I've only got so much breath Goes down nobody or two lies okay? This is good. This is good. It's driving me mad, but it's good know Why I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm gonna like it breath, hojae's right I have one life one life, and I don't know what oh, I'm dead anyway. I'm dead it's the spikes ah This is infuriating, but I will do it. I got leveled up so I get one more chance Yes, uh, I got all the way down that was amazing how do I do this though is there anything up here? there is What I couldn't see cuz my lives are in the way. I watch too many lives So the water fills up and you have to do this We have to do it. Yes. No. Oh, I survived. What is that? It's a cannon, okay, right? This is mad. This is mad. Ha ha ha the world is against me Oh jeez they're like bullet bills, but more aggressive and annoying. This is horrible absolutely horrible come on it can't be this simple no You mean you're so mean whoever made this game is actually horrible I feel like I'm so far and I bet there's like a hundred levels isn't there come on I can do this my Concentrate I can do it. I can definitely do it. No. I feel like if you take this one slow That's the secret you can just dodge these there. We go there. We go there. We go yeah, right? I need I need health having a submarine this is fantastic Maybe not this is great. This is actually great so I can drop bombs If I drop the bombs then I die yeah amazing great. Okay, let's go let us go down Why Why Why why why why I'm actually kind of enjoying myself, though secretly because you have to it's annoying you have to get to the right place and then and then get back to where you were to try and figure out what you're really supposed to do while losing loads of lives and precious time in the process, right spare them That's the way that is so the way Oh McGuinness I'm actually getting good at this guys come on We wasted way too much life on that Yeah, quick. Go. Go you're going the wrong way. You're gonna die close to this one take your time Don't get killed by the wall and everything is okay. It's absolutely fine absolutely fine. Yes. We've got it No, how do I do this before I don't even know those ones at the end are just so fast This Is It this is it the set no I forgot about those how can I forget about those simple bits yeah right submarines I'm chump so we can drop bombs, but the bombs explode them so we don't want to do that we want to go straight down and Not clip the edge. We also need to make sure that we don't go into those I mean I like this guy, but he's starting to infuriate me already How did I just click the edge like that? How how many levels are on this thing there's 24? Which is actually less than I thought there'd be where do I get to 9? So I'm 20 and 20 not 15 levels away That's not so bad so guys that is trap adventure to the the brands new impossible game Which I actually got almost half way in in one episodes, so if you want to see more of this game And you enjoyed this video or both then please leave a big fat like that.

Hey guys! Today's the day, the big Minecraft village renovation project. 2018 is happening. I am not appropriately dressed, but I am appropriately dressed for... *Sigh* the memorial of tuxedo bunny. I can't believe that happened. I shouldn't be laughing. It's not funny. It's actually quite upsetting. Dude, Jakob, what's going on? Why didn't you keep your eyes on the rabbit? Maybe he did! Maybe that's why he jumped in headfirst. This is where Jakob was and the rabbits around his somewhere... was around here somewhere Basically today what I want to do, Trayaurous has the googly eyes! Yes! But today what I want to do is I want to clear things up around here. It's not looking too neat, especially over this area. I want to create a nice bridge, I want to make sure my farm is good, I want to make sure my cattles are looked after as well, because it's Autumn 29th, which is very, very close if not the day before it turns to winter, so things are going to get a little bit crazy, probably a little bit snowy, so I'm worried. Not gonna lie. Another problem is that we don't really have that many resources right now, lots of dirt, which is great, but I need to craft myself some axes and I think a pickaxe as well, so let's do that. There we go, that's two of those. Not sure what else I'm gonna need, do I need to water everything? Everything is watered, ready to go. Am I gonna get another harvest out of these bad boys, because I am worried that that's two days. One day I will get another, oh geez, I'll get another load of sweet potatoes, but some of these eggplants have got only one. Only these patch of eggplants are gonna grow! No! Bad times, bad times. Actually, I just found some wood because I went collecting wood for our next building project, but I'm actually gonna need wood for our bridge. Not quite sure how I'm gonna build it, I think... Hmm, we're gonna need logs, fences and normal wood. The only thing is, actually let me just break this because it should give me some wood, there we go, haha. Yes, give me more, give me more. Yes. I think I've done all my chores today. Actually, I just wanted to check. I haven't. Have I? Have I fed these bad boys? I haven't. Great, so I'm gonna have to do this real quick to keep them happy and give big old milks. But I'm guessing these guys are gonna want to be inside because it's gonna be snowy and stuff in a couple of days, so let's go collect some wood and let's sort this out. Wait a second How did you get out of here? What are you doing here? Why are you just chilling out here? Who let you get out? What is going on? Is this door open? This door isn't even open. Is this... I'm so confused So confused, hi buddy. How's it going, did you run away? I could have like not even found you. How did that happen? Don't do that again. Geez... It's resorted to that, has it? The chickens have started running away. Oh, actually I think I have an eggplant harvest that is just about to be sold overnight But I'm not a hundred percent sure I hope so. Right, it's getting to night time I've only got 44 dark wood, and I was also supposed to be planting these so they can actually grow I don't know how many I need of these were bright they can grow by themselves or in fours I don't know, but I need to get home before I get killed oh speaking of being kills. Here's an Enderman just in time ah Yeah, I'm just gonna try and walk past you without being spotted. Don't even look my way. We're safe Let's go to bed the question is do we earn any money, let's have a look please, please Yes, okay, we did nice nine thousand one hundred and twenty nine That's really good. We needed one more crop. Just before it turns to winter which I'm guessing is not gonna No, no no no. No. This is not happening. It's not happening like this go away. Go away go away How are you hitting me from that far away? He's probably tramping all my crops as well, but I'm gonna have to strafe him and go in for a shot We've got a strafe. Let's strafe There we go and him for a shot smack. Oh jeez no. Why are you doing this to me go away? Every episode Every episode that is it that does it just get out of here. You're breaking over crops if you break any crop That is oh jeez come here come here go in go in attack attack dogs. Go you're just sitting there you doing no. He's gonna He's gonna. Hit me. No. This is so awkward get out of here. Oh geez don't on kill me yes Ha ha oh that was annoying as long as he didn't ruin any of my crops. It's fine. That's the only thing I'm worried about with those things as soon as you jump on these they just get destroyed right That's over now. We need to get back to this project harvest everything we can before winter comes I think we're gonna be one day short on all of our eggplants. Oh, no actually that's tomorrow That's two days There's definitely not gonna be 32 days is there? We're gonna get one eggplant crop and that is it come on guys we need to get out of here. This way this way hurry up Get all my stuff back. I got a bow actually a rare bow which is quite cool. I think I did Nope, there's something missing. There's my oakwood. They literally just went to collect there it is Oh, my goodness really why does my stuff go so far when I die right? Let's pop these away real quick there. We go. Let's do our chores, and then collect some more wood wait. Can I see you again? No But you look fluffy. I should never have bought you you tiny sheep. You ripped me off basically, right? I'm gonna give out Cow treats as well, so hopefully I can milk them more often in the future I don't know how many times I'm gonna be able to do that or when it even happens But I'm gonna try Oh about two big milk that medium milks even that's awesome This milk is a little milk That's fine, but they won't let me milk them again So obviously they're not that great right now two medium milks though is a great start It's actually a perfect start because it means that we can get more money That's like 50 more gold per milk means you're at least getting some kind of money before winter comes oh, man. It's already midday Right I have a decent amount of wood now. So we should be able to get this started Let me think of a plan it's gonna look kind of cool because these are circular But I'm gonna do it's kind of like a mini Golden Gate Bridge Style, I guess I'm gonna put in all of the the little trunks first just so I know that they're the right way around And I can use them for wood in the future This is pop one this side as well, and then when I go up like this. Yeah, that looks pretty cool I like that and I guess we should do one in the middle as well which I about here Let's see if this looks good it does I think I might want to come across one to be honest yeah, that one's definitely better all right Let's move this one and then we can start building the actual the actual bridge We need lots of slabs I can always yeah, I'm just gonna why I've already done it now We're gonna change it all into slabs and see if this is enough cuz I want to make it so that I've got Enough for fences as well, which should be good man. It's going to nighttime already. This is insane I need to make it go up like this Does it need to curve any more? I guess we could do it one more? But doesn't really need to yeah, I can go out like this. Okay. This is perfect Let's just put in all the other slabs I'm poor need to get some torches up on here as well, buddy got literally one torch which is fantastic Please nothing hurt me. I'm building a bridge there. We go is it done there. We go. There's the bridge Finally the real Disgusting bridge that we had there before has changed. I think I need to change this bit though How many steps up was it it was only it was only two But you know I kind of like it is the shorter version let's pop this Just here. I definitely made way too many slabs that's much better sweet. I just needs I need some torches Don't I I have enough perfect torches and then we compare those back in there I think out know what I say what I say. Oh geez Travis watch out. Do not get killed Please do not get killed none of you get killed there. We go. I'm going to sleep. This is getting treacherous, okay? We're safe. We're safe everything's good right at 11,000 and everything's dead No, I thought we'd have another day. I really thought we'd have another day We can't even harvest anything look at all of these eggplants that could have survived Literally one day and we'd have been rich as anything but no This this is that actually real life, there's a there's a zombie here as well great, okay? Not sure what I'm gonna. Do now I need to go and grab my stuff I'm lucky that that was only I'm lucky that all of my stuff wasn't even made I live just lost everything before I'd even harvested it I'd have been super excited. I can see it in my head right now I'm a mega excited about everything growing, and I just would have died This is a horrible horrible experience is that how many times I died now in this one episode I don't know, but it's too much right this now needs sorting. This is this is not goods torture the ends that never happens again right, okay, so Winter is is Here. I am I am scared. Why is the moon? Rectangle what is happening there, but the moon's a rectangle That's so weird anyway less of that and more Building I need to make some fences. I think right so I need lots of sticks which I've accidentally made which is fine and then Dark oak wood fence. Okay. I don't think this is gonna be enough, but it should be okay I think I'm gonna need to replicate this on this side as well so we can go like that Oh that looks horrible get out of here. Okay, that looks better I'm just gonna have to put it underneath like that instead so that should be fine It's just where we started what we were doing. What are you doing? You're taking a bath? I need to heal up my dogs because they've been serving me pretty well So I need to treat them like they're well-loved, which they are of course, but I just need to prove it They will get in the way of my building though. Okay. I think I have finished Leverage I just want to put yeah, I think I'm gonna put these on here And then I'm gonna add this and this and then one more here when we're here one more here, and I think Bridge is done Do I want to put one more on each one do we have any like? Lamps and stuff, let's have a look. I'll go for light And see what we've got that's that's way too many. This is a PC. Yes. I need a gaming PC I actually need a house. I'll be a good start wouldn't it umm lamp Okay, we've got fancy lanterns. We've got So many lanterns and stuff, I think I'm just gonna pop these on for now just cuz we need as much light as possible So the the the nasties don't come and blow us up again. I'm not salty They're not salty at all that's looking good. Though. It kind of matches all the dark wood in the Everything I like it. I like it a lot What do we need neck actually I just want to add a couple little bits here. I just want to do this Yep want to put a piece of dirt here Just so it levels that part out and make sure that this is sorted out on this side there We go and there we go perfect right next port of call is making this path just more easy to Access, so I need to take this annoying and disgusting thing else and I kind of only need to fill it with dirt Just because I want it to be grassy I guess I do need to add some paths and stuff And I think there might be some included in this so if I go on path What do we have okay? We don't actually have passed. There is something though like Stone path I'm pretty sure Deco craft has something where you can just put like stones on top of things you've done it before When we're in the diamond dimensions we had that can't seem to find it maybe not then but I have spotted this a convey about That looks amazing Oh look look at this. It's two iron ingots one redstone and three leather for a conveyor belt we need to do that That'd be amazing. I don't know what it does, but it'll be sweet, so hopefully when I put all of this dirt around here What will happen is the grass will just gradually get over to it? And then we'll have a proper wraparound path, which will be goods let me just grab some more dirt Oh all the things the dead actually I need to see is it too late Yeah, she's not even open I was gonna see if I could find out what kind of seed she has cuz I am making no money today There's one thing I do have a lot of it is dirt a crazy crazy amount of dirt. How's that looking? That's much better So now we can actually run around the front and not feel like we're trying to jump and parkour over different bits and over time this will just Turn into grass Hopefully anyway if it doesn't we're gonna have to change it again. I might even add some tiny bridges over here Just so that I can do a quick shortcut around the corner and use the new bridge Yeah, but least we found a useful this dirt. This is awesome. Okay I think are actually done if we do a quick run through just run this way Round the corner, maybe this could be filled out a little bit more and then round this corner. We've actually got a waiter Why does this never get old they're literally just? Googly, eyes it although. I like it. Let's take care of our animals real quick sit is turning Oh, my goodness is actually turning to the next day, which is insane quick quick quick We need to get this stuff in before midnight there. We go and Egg boom that's literally all we have that's crazy right that's sleep away. Hopefully. We don't get destroyed and wake up with a little bit of money, so Literally 400 and a giant log. Hello rights this a day is Sunday so Jenny isn't open which is annoying because I really really want to see what she offers in the winter It's an Enderman just chillin over there. It's fine. Hi buddy. How's it going? What do we need to do next? We need to See can we get some bone meal to make this grass grow just to make it look nicer a lot quicker I think we can we've actually got so we've got a few bones right, but three Let's see how much this give us got nine. Let's see if this works I don't even know if this works, but I'm gonna give it a go three two one BAM No, no it doesn't work, let's actually see if the goddess says anything to us about winter because sometimes she gives us gifts Sometimes she gives us money, and I think I'm gonna need it at some point so hi goddess. How's it going? Do you need anything else my sweets? Yeah? I need money to be honest tomorrow's looking lovely to have sunshine. That's goods She literally doesn't say anything There if you fancy giving me a gift the easiest way to store an item into the pond literally join some blackberries Enjoy, she doesn't even want the blackberries She's rejected them this Enderman has picked up a block of my farm I'm not too annoyed because there's not really any farm left to be honest, but we do need to sort out And I'm actually really impressed about how much this this bridge has transformed the whole place I think it looks awesome hmm hold on a second. I need some leather I feel like you have leather there. We go. I need to make an item frame are checking to steal this one. Thank you I'm just gonna put this here and then put a goddess flower in it just because I Don't know if these will despawn if you throw them into the water because she D spawns after a while So I'm just gonna put that there just we always have a goddess flower Why is there a witch there? Can I grab a witch with the lead No, no, please no. No no no leave me alone leave me alone. We don't need you here. How did you even get it? Why are you still aggressing on me go away. No this is bad. I'm out. I'm out I'm out leave me alone leave me alone I Have no weapons literally no weapons at all look at her over there. She thinks she's the goddess nah I mean you can be for now if you want to because I'm not going to argue with you look at her Guys this witch is still chasing me. I don't think I even have any arrows. Do I I literally have no arrows I can't deal with this woman. I found six. I am gonna destroy you whether you like it or not there we go There's one she's just chilling in the fountain think it's gonna give you youth I don't think so I don't think so at all She's still in there. I think she is yeah. Yep. She's just you know swimming in the fountain What's wrong with this woman? I am going to destroy you as long as you don't destroy me first here We go to a dodge just do a weave. Let's smack him. She gained health again. No, this is unacceptable. Thank you What did you give me just sugar okay? At least she's out of here now. That's good so part of me Just wants to sleep. I think I'm gonna do it I'm gonna sleep and wake up in the next day because then jenny is going to give us whatever she sells in the winter, and I'm hoping it's something that allows us to just be a Little bit productive in winter, so I'm just worried that the animals aren't gonna be enough I don't really want to spend my money on just two animals For a hundred. I think like 200 gold a day. It's gonna be a tricky one guys, but we're gonna get through it Don't you worry at least? We have a new bridge at least We've got one of those, and I think yeah look the grass is actually spreading. This is working I was going to with the big green generation project. I was gonna add paths But I kind of liked it without paths right now I kind of liked that the village is just built in the Just in the grass and the hills I think that's so much better So I'm gonna leave it like it is for now the other thing I really needs is a house, but I just want to see what Jenny's gonna sell me first she opens at 9:00 So I'm gonna see what she sells me UNEP doesn't just build random buildings He always builds something else so this has been my house for a while. I can't really cool This the big minecraft regeneration village project 2018 if I just build a bridge do I? I can't do that so I'm gonna try and build myself little house. Where should it go No idea because I've kind of filled up all the space maybe I could just have a 10 or something that everybody Oh, maybe I could build on the hill I could be like king of the hill and then look down upon my kingdom Let's see what that looks like so up on here yes That would be perfect Do I have a shovel on me? I don't right I'm gonna flatten this out and prepare myself for a tiny house, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny. What's good? Where did you just oh geez really you're still here, but you're outside now. I mean, that's fine I don't want to talk to you. Anyway. Okay. What do you sell you sell flour? Chakra breads cooking oil rice balls and salt, so you literally sell everything you did before But that's it just with bread so you can sell well You can only sell bread for one hundred anyway flour I don't even know what you use for Chocolate and cooking oil you can cook meals and stuff in this But I'm not sure how so if we get flour like this bake me to bake bread I literally can't get any recipes from it. That's so wit Jenny. Help me out here I need a recipe book up in here. What are you looking at huh? I know I'm gonna go hungry It's not funny. You don't even have organs, so please stop looking at me. I'm gonna. I'm gonna slice you there you go That's what you get for looking at me right guess It's time to chop down some trees and make ourselves a house, so I'll be back in a second I've also want to touch on what I'm gonna do in the next video which is delve into the world of engineering. That's right We've got electricity and stuff in this mod, which is what most of these guys sell So we don't have to craft most of it, so that's exciting, but first. I need to make myself a house, otherwise I'm gonna die repeatedly over and over again. It's not gonna be fun for you guys to watch Oh, maybe it is. I don't really know, but either way. I'm getting some wood right. It's getting dark. I've decided I want to do is my house. I love these trees I've also decided what I'm gonna do with that bone meal that I had these are called sakura trees Or sakura woods is what it drops anyway, and it drops these amazing saplings as well So i'm gonna grab these i'm gonna try and live in like a Sakura house Don't know how well it's gonna go, but it's gonna be worth a try also drops loads of saplings So you can regenerate it pretty easily? Oh geez I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die oh no No, no, no, this is not happening. This is definitely not happening come on porkchop You can save me now come on save me. I just need to run come on. You've got this buddy You've got this why do I leave it so late.

That's so weird This winter's the worst Why is it so terrible that rainbow looks insane though? Yeah, okay. This is gonna be difficult. Yeah. I literally can't see anything. I'm gonna die unless you're gonna die here This is awful you left. I need sanctuary. I just need to stay in here until it gets time I can see this is madness. I just want to build the house am I safe I Don't know it's looking. Yeah. It's just looking terrible right now. I'm not a fan of this I don't think anything burns in this weather either. No look. It's blowing things up okay Not winter is the worst I can see why in Game of Thrones they hate it I'm just gonna sleep next day none of the snow. Please it's still here The snow is still here. I literally I literally can't do anything. I can't see The zombies and stuff stay where they are that they don't die I've got a sword now But that's not really helping me at all there's two zombies on my brand-new bridge this was gonna be called the The great village regeneration projects, but now it's just cool I don't know winter sucks or something along that line Because I haven't been able to do much for the regeneration have I I didn't think winter would be this bad. It's pretty But it's also pretty annoying. There's not really much. I can do. That's as far as I've got my house look I've got a door That's it I need to harvest sakura trees, but I can't do that because there's just nasties everywhere only have five hearts So they are gonna kill me. Oh there's another creeper creeper creeper. Oh my goodness What is happening Jacob save me look at these things? There's a Zombie gold armor winters the worst there are monsters Absolutely everywhere like literally everywhere. I am going to die alone scared and Losing all my items the only way you can stop the snow thing is by going under a tree or something We're going in a cave Otherwise you're just blind. I'm just going to stare youlfs you left. I'm staying in here I'm going up to the top and I'm gonna use these beds that aren't actually beds if that's okay with you I can't even do that. It's stuck there. We go. I'm done here This is crazy the the big regeneration project has now been cooled off due to Winter weather things you guys have been telling me to build a house for ages I didn't do it and now it's all there is his snow does it literally never Allow them to burn this guy's not gonna burn because he's got a crazy amount of armor, but what about the um? What about the rest of them at least have a piece of your armor, please? No fine, you know what you are the first sacrifice into the lake There's creepers, but I'm not seeing anything else. I don't know if they burn because it is daytime It's just wintry no no no no I'm stuck between two creepers. This is not good. I don't know where to go I don't know where to go. I can't even run everything is just spawning in I hate this. I hate this so much you have You'll if I need your help. I thought this was a happy farming pack turns out It's not. It's full of death and destruction with my name all over it. I'm staying in here I wasn't going to end it then but I'm gonna have to I wanted to do so much more for the regeneration project but I can't because farming is a dangerous profession guys and Yeah, we're gonna have to call it off I'm sorry If you have any ideas for how I can survive the winter please do put them in the comment section down below because I currently Have no idea Whats so ever. I'm not sure what to do about the monsters I've got five parts two shots from a bow from a skeleton And I'm dead I could get blown up by a creeper at any time, and I just want to build a house That's all I want if you enjoyed this video anyway that Pacific felt like that be greatly appreciated We did manage to build a bridge and make the land a little bit better apart from that It was a whole load of nonsense, but if you did enjoy your thumbs That would be great and if this happens to be the first video you see by me Please do consider subscribing to join team TDM today or for daily videos apart from that guys. Thank you so much for watching You are the best and I'll see you all next time goodbye 
wait so there's more of you now these guys freak me out in the game and in real life what why is it 3 anyway guys hey how's it going welcome back into a hello neighbor the full game on the Xbox I'm back playing this so soon because you guys absolutely love to the first episode so if you're hyped let me know and we're gonna get straight back in to act 2 now I don't know how many acts there are in total I believe there are three we completed the first act in the previous videos and today we're gonna start right at the beginning of act 2 and hopefully finish that in this video depending on how long it is but let's find out we're in a pretty sticky situation last time so here we go here we go see what I mean sticky situation were in the room that we visited last time but this time we are looking a bit worse for where we got our toes out we got our knees all dirty and one shoe why is the neighbor stolen my shoe so the last time we were inside this room we were in here voluntarily and there was still a bed here but the room was a fake one seems as though it's it's all too real now which I'm not too fond of I thought I heard footsteps then let us open the door and we can't open the door okay let's see let's see what's happening okay so we are still in a fake room look there's all the the wires and stuff I heard banging why was that what did that just happen did I just did I just miss that I think I just missed that look it a light fell down okay I don't think that was me but can I throw something can I pick up the candle I can't pick up the candle I need something to throw oh it's open now why is that and who are you hello I can't pick you up but you're in like every weird scene in this game so far there's got to be something to do with this doll yeah look there's lights pretending that it's actually light outside and a whole lot of creepiness is going on we've got a vent as well which I'm guessing yeah I'm gonna just grab and you know throw out here see you later what else have we got I might just take one of these which is Beecham a love Beecham I can't she take what I was gonna take one just in case I could throw it at the neighbor but doesn't look like we can I'm just gonna do what the game wants me to do and get on out of here am I still I'm not actually crouched right now so I must still be a tiny little um tiny little version of our character also known as a child and where is this gonna lead us I have no idea but there's dirt a ladder let's just climb this ladder and see what happens oh look at my arm as well my arms all bandaged we were buried under the house no he buried me under the house you're a nutcase you hear me a nutcase I can't actually believe that and what house is this because we played through a few different houses I want to say three maybe four but I don't remember one having all of this pipe work right I don't remember any of them having this pipe work I can't believe we were down there that's so weird there's a shoe I've got a shoe it doesn't fit me but there's it oh there's a hat as well and some cans what what is going on I don't take the shoe just in case what is this binoculars yeah I didn't mean to throw those I did not mean to throw those where did they go so we need another wrench to get up there there's also like a tap as well which is a little bit weird he has seriously fortified this hasn't he weapons if I push this it doesn't actually work yet but he's gone a little bit extra on the old security hasn't he oh oh it's moving now which way is it moving though there's like the option for a crowbar as well oh my goodness you frightened the life out of me so it resets back to here every time it looks like there might have been some time movement as well I do keep all my items which is goods do I keep my progress what's this is that a frying pan I'm gonna take this bro thanks for the frying pan next time I see your neighbor I'm gonna smack you real hard it's definitely something to do with these pipes let me see if this is okay that's where we left it coming here yeah it started to run now which is good I think crowbar needs to be used here he's probably moved everything though a zani look at this place we have never been in a house that has this much protection before red key gets us out of here and there's a big gate in the way of the trampoline I would love to use this trampoline but it looks like it's powered by something so first lead follow the cable shall we the cable goes into his house I'm out I'm out got the ladder up the ladder not move right this quickly hot step it up this ladder that was really quick actually we can go down here there's another lever which doesn't actually have a lever on it okay that's slightly annoying we need to get up here maybe we might need some boxes and stuff but I'm not quite sure let's head over this way first huh yes he's like boarded up all his rooms I think we need to go in there guys look at that the pipes are looking real suspicious I can't believe how protected this house is I just want to check the I can't smash this window okay I can smash the window but even if I throw a hat at it this this won't come off oh he's mad he's coming up hit him I got him but he he doesn't even care oh geez okay I'm out I'm out I'm out I'm out go go go go go run right I need boxes I threw the through the binoculars guys he doesn't see me yet he hasn't seen me yet and we haven't actually been in his house oh jeez oh jeez let's just let's just explore and see what happens he's put a sofa in front of there we've got another leave I need to press this yeah there we go okay I have no idea what that's doing but since we're already in here let's just find as many levers as possible that's locked okay is there another lever in here he's gonna find me any second now it's kind of annoying me that I've got a box in my eyesight but it's gonna be fine let's go through I can't go through here what I can't go through there where can I go oh oh he's found me okay at least we've got another lever done I want to check something there's another one here okay let me see if I can quickly just you know pull up here so my minecraft skills coming in perfectly a week Wow what yes come to me leave up come to me come on don't do this don't do this I need to I need to flick you know is this tall enough please be tall enough how do I grab that one oh I did it yeah so now what I want to check is that gauge that we saw before where's the gauge where's the gauge he's coming for me the gauge is there oh did you see the water the water is pouring out where is it there it is okay I have no I oh yes we can use this as well perfect I think that's up the ladder is chasing me I got caught guys I got caught and I'm in a circus thing this is like his house with mad graffiti on it so this happened in the previous episode we got captured a certain amount of times then it just shows you bits of story which is quite cool we've seen one of these very similar circus style things in one of the PCE games but I don't know what else is gonna be in here it's like one of those fun houses you see have fun fairs which I normally like but oh my goodness really it's gonna row a roller coaster dude look at this guy he isn't that nice at all I mean he looks friendly but still let's uh let's get in here we go put your arms up guys and get ready to enjoy a ride through the neighbor's house he's got a secret roller coaster oh it's heinie okay watch out for the table what's up what's up what's up that only do this so we heard a girls voice this is weird I'm Disney but a really creepy Disney okay he's crying the fridges on the ceiling that's a little bit weird oh my goodness there's hands on the front of our roller coaster are we going up this is when you normally hear the the chain noise where guys I'm not gonna do that all the way up that would be annoying what if these hands come from anyway here we go here we go we're going over the top we're peaking oh my goodness I've got my clothes back as well which is kids ah it's a girl nope catch the girl bro that's scary haha since when did this get so weird I'm gonna guess I'm just gonna straight-up guess it's the neighbor's child we now know its daughter the neighbor's daughter had some issues and there was a car crash as well all right let's put this on here can I put this on here I can let's twist it and we can hear water so waters now running it into that room for some reason hey sir oh geez I didn't know you could get me from there this is the most unhelpful basketball in the world look it's just blocking my vision so much I'm getting your house whether you like it or not buster I can see him coming quick get in get in get in get in get in I'm running out of things to throw so I'm gonna have to throw milk basically let's try and throw it as fast as we can Oh smashed it in we go just get in just get in the house oh my goodness getting the house quick Oh what's best we need to find another one of those wheels I think it was like a boiler with a tack that was still free whoa what's that I'm in his house put his doors here is he caught me hello how you doin sir I'm glad you haven't caught me I'm just taking a peek II peek behind your door so we need to get in there somehow press I don't even know this is so weird white water what what's the deal with that okay guys I'm an idiot I've got to record my camera so let me recap what I've just done I did some amazing things as well I'm so annoyed I got in here and then I went upstairs then we just put the lights on and check this out there's so much up here this is open as well oh my goodness he bear trapped me are you kidding me see Roger I've been here before so there's a doll house with a key on it which I'm sure we can unlock I guess we need to pick our kits is he here is he here I am going dyes up oh my goodness I need to go I'm gonna go up here quick quick quicker quicker got got got got it's wrong site no I hate you neighbor I hate you a lot oh we got more secrets though where am I dude this is freaky no I don't like this where on earth am i oh this is more interesting stuff okay a bleep machine or hospital beds there's a there's a bit of sheet missing oh no someone's died someone definitely died I'm gonna guess that the kid has died at some point that's so upsetting like really upsetting there's a door there but it's so dark I can't even see the doors here there is oh look there he is he's crying he's real upset it's okay buddy I mean I guess it's not it was all your fault whoops this is there any way I can go and try not to miss anything but I don't think there's much I can't miss I'm a receptionist now sir something went bad something went real bad I need to talk to you yeah let me just let me just talk to this microwave his Eric and his daughter died but I I don't know why he would be being all creepy with his house because of it though I mean it's pretty traumatic so I don't blame him but my goodness right we need to get up there run run run run run okay I want to go I want to go up here let's go this way up up go why would he go up there we go perfect so this is where we got before when Alison recorded my face and we made it into here it has not much stuff as the weird dollhouse that we need to unlock had a key door for the yellow key which we just kind of unlocked because it was just hanging up there and we unlocked this one there's also this and there's a flippin shark in here remember the shark guys he's back he's ready for action and there he is I have a theory that we filled up this room not sure why but look at it it's so weird to shark with a bear trap face there's also a staircase down which leads to our countrymen where elites do it leads to this room which is outside okay so this leads to down here which we can't actually unlock yet because we need the wrench which means we need the wrench pretty desperately there's another valve there as well but I don't know if we still need to do the valves or not is he up here I hope not yeah he's up here okay he's uh he's having some issues though so I'm gonna leave him there if he's stuck that would be phenomenal I'm jumping down this is gonna give us some freedom I can per valve thereby don't have it Oh Oh I need this I need this no that was the wrench in the fringe why didn't I think about looking in the fridge oh no he's right there guarding it dude I'm going to I'm gonna throw this at you right now don't worry it's gonna be fine huh yes got him I need to just grab it really quickly come on come on come on it's so hard to aim on console yes record it right now I can open this I should be able to do anyway let's see yeah okay right now I can go up here super easy now my theory is there's a lot more of these so I need to I need to just move the one that I used before the question is where do I put it I put it here can I can i grab it I can grab it but I've got this on me I'm gonna leave this up here grab that perfect okay let's go this way try and outrun him and put this where it needs to be ooh oh oh he's definitely at me he's definitely gonna get me oh yeah you got right that's financially because it leaves us free to do this okay let's see we can put this on here I don't know what it's gonna do if anything but it's worth the try right let's see what happens can I put it on okay I think I'm here I think I've got it come on put it on put it on there we go use it use the thing dude use the thing it's running I don't know where it's running to but I guess we'll find out okay so my theory is I need to put this in more places because I think as we've gone around we've seen this red thing quite often thank you right where should we take this next I think this room has that boiler in so I'm gonna go in here and see if I can use it yes I can okay perfect right let's grab this wheel put it on no I've lost my wheel as well I didn't get the Turner you punk get in turn the wheel don't get trapped oh can we pull this as well we can okay turn the wheel there we go grab this oh it's in the radiator now okay so we need to find more places to put that I'm pretty sure there's something through here I'm fairly sure I'm in a bear trap no he's got me he's got me it's here yeah it's that door come on I'm inside all right let's do this let's do this I can't even see I've twisted it and I'm giving it back okay I don't know what's going on here is he capturing me hello sir he's close I definitely done it though is there a way I can pull a lever did I pull it I definitely could pull it I don't know if I pulled it though ah man oh and he's boarded up this window now are you kidding me he's that smart I just want to pull this lever broke there we go I pulled it something's happening that's now sending water somewhere else could it be up here maybe not or do we need to put the red thing on here let's take a quick look see look let's put that on here come on let me do it there we go there we go okay right can we turn here it turned us and it's working hole dude I don't know if we're gonna be able to float up there though is it gonna what's gonna happen what's gonna happen can we floats do we floats we don't float okay this is done though how on earth do we get out of here I need something that floats I'm gonna grab back this just in case as well I don't think we're gonna need it again but we might do I think it might be stuck down here you know uh what do I do I can hear running water like a crazy amount of running water what this is open since when is this been open when we filled that room with water no no no surely not is this it do I have to go up here and just jump across let's see what we can do ah I didn't make it okay I could definitely make that I must be able to they both don't even listen bro I'm just you know just jumping around this level made no sense whatsoever but here we go yes yes bounce oh we made it we're out here I don't know what's happening but we've done it we've done it is he gonna follow us there are turds please don't kill me I'm a nice man oh he's not he's not even gonna follow me that's some creepy low-key look at him he's like you escaped me once buddy but you're ain't gonna escape me again haha we did it we actually did it I have no idea what the logic behind that was I'm guessing we just needed to fill that room with water start that generator thingy and then the gate opens maybe you can still make it across because that door still needs to be open so there's definitely secrets in that act but what happens next the dream sequence so this is the most recent one that we've done before and we're locked in and we're in a weird town okay I'm gonna have to leave this here even though these eggs look delicious no girl likes you I don't really know how that logically made sense I think I was looking and to be able to fill that room but that wasn't actually the end goal the end goal was to flow the water all the way through the house and the pipe work so that you could get that generator working to close down the gate and jump over the trampoline but there's definitely more weirdness to be found in there definitely we escaped we may need to act three guys if you're excited and you enjoyed this video then please leave a like that'd be greatly appreciated and it's time to be the first bit same of me please do consider subscribing to join team TDM today because that took me over an hour of 15 minutes it was nuts I made no sense

Oh, it doesn't require water That's great, and they won't die when we put them down. That's cool, right? Let's get some more crops gonna need a lot more money for this. I did not mean to do that What else could we buy we could buy some corn? But it dies in summer 9 summer even which seeds take so long, but they're really really cheap Let's try some wheats, and then that's all our money gone for now, but we'll be rolling in the dough very very soon Don't you worry guys gonna be rich?

guys I'm so proud Tony has a brand-new job you guys remember Tony's the bald guy from getting over who has no legs and no hair but a whole load of determination which is why he's got himself a job and is also well actually this might not be Tony at all this game is called pogo post man and what we need to do is we need to deliver a letter to the top of a mountain while riding a pogo stick I'm just gonna call him Tony the second let's start that and I or desires unfulfilled please enter your wish here be mindful and your wishes will become true what wish could we deliver Oh from Tony the first I wish forehand legs send wish there we go write our wishes here I'm gonna deliver it let's go hey there is yeah that's definitely not the original Tony is it this is Tony's son he's bouncing on a pogo stick and this game is pretty much getting over it with a pogo stick now why is this a problem because you don't really have that much control lucky bounces on the spot so if you're trying to stay in one place you kind of can't you can only control how much the pogo stick retracts and when it retracts so you need to like be careful of the bounces and oh jeez yes made it yeah yes I am destroying this tony ii is doing a much better job than tony the first was on his first ever video okay okay we're making it we're making it this is actually good progress and i'm guessing that a little red letter is the wish that we have to deliver to tony so hopefully you can grab himself some hair does it matter about the other male that's flopping out definitely not oh geez how does a postman like actually why is he trying to deliver to the top of the mountains that way that's where Tony lives oh no look at this guy he didn't make it he's got the wish in his hand I wonder what the wish says I'm just picking it out this is Tony the second he delivers wishes for a living and the original Tony lives at the top of the mountain because that's where we left him last time kind of in space that's why he's up there right let's try and get to this house at the top of the mountain this is going to be absolutely off I can already tell you kind of could only like you can't really control them in tiny bits it bounces so much you can't stay in one space now what do I do he's stuck on the sign come on buddy you got this you've got this I'm not quite sure how I move left and right but doing it yes yeah it's kind of like it's kind of scary that it has a timer on it cuz now I feel a little bit I didn't see that no okay it's definitely got those getting over it vibes hasn't it that's not very nice that's not very nice at all now I can see why this guy just didn't want to didn't want to continue anymore or maybe he didn't have a choice because there's no water up here how did I do this bit before I'm so confused yes yes okay cool right so we need to definitely not jump too high but it's kind of difficult when he's jumping every single time on the spots yes yes okay so you kind of control him backwards and forwards without even without even extending your Pogo so to speak oh geez these move as well where do I need to go next I'm so confused I think it's up here is it is up there I don't think I need to use that second platform I can just bounce upwards come on sorry the second don't be like your father we could do this in one right yes yes haha okay right green barrels definitely a no-no but look how high the sky come bounce here's the most extreme post man I have ever met in my life let's go this way but let's not go too crazy because we don't know what awaits oh geez stop stop being so crazy please there's moving parts happening and you can't get down there unless it flips the other way so let's play this really carefully yes okay yes no no you can do it buddy just ride the Pogo nice and carefully you obviously are very skilled at your job so please apply those skills right now and allow me to deliver this wish okay this miss actually hard I need to bounce off of it without touching the other side because that sign is solid it's not gonna let me bounce on it without any consequences oh oh yeah there we go much better now be very very careful I don't trust this mountain at all by a much interested to see what Tony's house looks like what he decided to do no way did I make it that's Santa's house is this where I need to go does Tony live with Santa what is happening put it down there put it down the chimney you got this you got this put in the post box come on just put in the post box please yeah you're making me angry just go to the right use yep yes yeah Oh from Tony I wish for hair and legs well Tony I hope you got what you wished for I did it Haku look at these other wishes be a millionaire sleep more turtles eat bacon he wished for a pogo stick as well I wish to be a yo-yo man which is hatch Lee has actually been delivered by Bob Hey look how out of the bottom from Tony the first I wish Mary legs wish by Tony the second

Well well well, looks like we have some unfinished business Mr. Freddy Fazbear You've already made me bankrupt once, WHICH I'm not happy about. AND THEN, I completley forgot about this g-- *laughs* --ame hahe Seems to be a recurring theme for some reason Bu-t uum I don't know why I forgot about this because I love the game so much. I was looking through my videos the other day, and I was like... wait a second... I didn't complete this, I-- I-- I honestly thought I had got futher --but, um.. Hey, how's it going we're back in Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria Simulator And I wanna try and finish this game, I don't know if I'll be able to finish it today. I would LIKE to but I don't think I will be able to. So um, If you haven't seen any of these videos before, defiantly go and check out the previous ones Hopefully, I've made a convenient playlist but knowing me I probably haven't. where you pretty much run your very own pizzeria. This is our.. umm main guy he is that the pop legend that is mr. Hippo, and he's doing us a pretty good service now We have actually salvaged quite a few animatronics, which is really really good. We also have a really good health and safety rating I'm pretty sure is that what that is? H and SA I think that's what it is Well two more spaces for games Uh--li-- Like I don't want to spend too much money because I can buy upgrades for the next section of the game But we have these things and all of them are high liability and I--I don't want liability At all Yo, we could do the neon jukebox though. I like him. Yea...look health and saftey goes up. I think medical stations might be better than a- than a jukebox. I'm gonna buy this there. We go let's put this down somewhere I'm gonna put it here. That's a duck. errrr... I can't put it there either fantastic where can I put this thing? Oh? They're here already okay, so a health and safety is is pretty off the charts our revenue is pretty weak I would apply the jukebox as well. Why not. Look at its cute face! Ah no other new catalogue It's well the balloon cart look at it. Oh my goodness a confetti tile floor the deluxe ball pit that is insane Haha these all oh No, what is that? That's disgusting. Data archive? Like what is that? Neon party set an insane ride.. there's a high liability Orvil elephant we got some new animatronics the prize king is here as well and security puppet No, he's well expensive. Oh, Oh Lefty nine liability risk music man These animatronics are amazing! And then we can just buy some pickles which are unfortunately unavailable We give you one happiness. look at this 71 thousand for funtime chica 999 dudes these new animatronics are creepy, but very cool. I like them He's only five bucks, but his liability is nine, No. Let's get out of here. No more sponsorship deals Let's go. I bought all the equipment I can buy so uh let's go to audio Let's play some audio up here some people are already coming in Let's just lets us do this actually the longest ones are maintenance I did buy a new maintenance guys, so let's see how this night. Goes shall we whoa you can go away I definitely heard someone in here huh Why are you shuffling clean them ovens quickly before someone kills me so much shuffling. Oh my goodness Okay, I think we're safe. I'm pretty sure we're safe. We're doing all right. Oh jeez to the right and the left oh Geez they're all up here. There's three of them. There's actually three of them. I AHH! I knew you were there I Knew you were there. Yes you made me jump. Oh oh Go by Audio really high so I can hear the things. I only said the audio was on the right though Let's try this again, shall we? let's just play audio like here, and then we're gonna unclog the toilets real quick hahaha No, I forgot about these go away. Skip. Oh, it's getting high now. Let's get real hot in here. Okay. We need to uhh.. AHH! Springtrap: That was easier than I thought it would be. (Back to dan) was it they all have different voices all different animatronics have different voices I think I need to be more patient. I'm not really being that patient right now. I put the audio there and then Wait no. I want to do this and unclog the toilets unclog them Turn this off And just wait until there's no noise at all I used to be so so careful Springtrap: How can I resist a promise, such as this? (Back to Dan) What Why is that so loud where am I supposed to look if they do that huh last thing just need Pizza kits That's all I need that I'm done Come on. Come on. We're done. We're done log off whoa right the end I did it now. We got to record we got to do the salvage now Okay, who is it? Who is it? Oh? This guy's cool. I like him He's very cool. He's like a sheriff five grand I think we're pretty good at the salvaging now, but we throw it back in the alley I Don't know we throw it back in the alley does he just appear in the restaurant anyway Salvage. Let's try it Let's try it because we can zap them anyway It does decrease the value, but it doesn't really matter as long as they're not super evil towards us It's okay document resolved He moved he definitely moved Right I'm gonna zap him Just because I don't want I want to see what his neutral state is he Definitely moved then so this is his neutral which actually looks like it's it's kind of aggressive also I don't know if they're triggered by the audio or only when you move the paper up and down. I'm not too sure document results Yeah, he moved he definitely moved I'm just gonna do it I'm just gonna keep that video as soon as he moves. I'm up Yeah
That the problem is I don't know if they have two stages of movement or just the one but we've zapped him twice already Which is quite bad? Yeah, he moved again. I Heard I heard him. I heard his cogs whirring Or I'm just hearing things whichever one, but that's our third zap, and we still have two of these audio things to go Results actually we should be okay in audio, Brompton three two one I'm eyes up in once more I'm just gonna do it yeah half sit I Didn't realize that I did not realize that but hey. You know what we should be safe now right like completely safe I'm fairly sure I don't want to zap you again document results oh Yeah Okay cool right let's see how much moola. We've made 57 new oh my goodness this is great how much revenue did we make we made? 2500 from the savage better than nothing better than him being around in our restaurant and we're up to three thousand four hundred and nine Yeah, no lawsuits as well smashing the restaurant business over here We have five thousand eight hundred and forty four now which is quite cool. I like the egg baby, but he freaks me out Why would there be a? Adult giving birth to a baby that's giving birth to an egg I mean what I like all of these actually like the price Kings cool the puppets cool, but I need some more money Five grands no you're so annoying. I feel like I should just you know play and see what happens Ah, what night? Are we on I feel like I've just done night three and Now we need to go on tonight four and there's only five nights Let's give it a go shall we I'm a little bit scared actually. I'm very scared I hate this so much, but it's addicting at the same time Whoa? The temperature goes up so fast why I need to bring some ice cubes or something just to cool myself down quicker Cuz this is mad absolutely mad No ha ha AH Knew you're gonna. Be there. I just try to fit in printing the fliers out and just get me I'm pretty sure we salvaged baby though, so does that mean even if we salvage them, they're just less aggressive I'm not sure I've only got two tasks left (Springtrap) You may not recognize me at first, but I assure you, it's still me. (Dan) what? What are you talking about? Huh? What are you? Why would you say things like that I should be fine. I'm listening for the noise back back log off. Yes, oh It's like log off quickly. I think we're good. I think we goods whoo All right, let's see this revenue. Sorry. That's two nights I did that like first time which is like for absolutely insane a hundred visitors. That's what I'm talking about they each spent five dollars That's that's good with me. No new lawsuits as well Fantastic was there. No Salvage that time There was legit no Salvage That's weird right. That's really weird. I wonder why and as well at there's some floors and stuff that aren't available So I'm guessing you have to unlock them somehow There's the pickles as well right at the ends there must be a way to unlock these I've only got six thousands dollars. I feel like I'm doing terribly for some reason. I really like all feel like a lot I'm worried if I get a lawsuit then I'll just become bankrupt And I really really don't want that at all if anything I would buy this guy, but I don't have enough money I think night five is next so I'm just gonna. I'm just gonna do it and see what happens here We are night five and it's like County wrong, and this is actually nightfall not too sure just be patient Wait for the shuffling to stop then we're okay no Oh That creeps me out, but who are you though? No, I'm so dead. I'm so dead. Why would you do this this stops the audio and stuff as well? What's too close this is stressing me out, I just I should just go working with donald's instead I don't need my own restaurant someone else could do the hard stuff. This one's really hard There's so much movement between the two vents It's crazy even like this is the hardest bit because the printer and the fans make so much noise And the animatronics on you make a slight sound so it's difficult Know this I went to the left and saw went to the left. Oh my goodness quick quick wow That was an awful time for an ad final two things this is gonna get tense I Shouldn't need to use the fan again here. We go last thing come on Come on this should be fine Dun-dun-dun yes first time I have got the hang of this game finally ah Please have been night five is that six (baby) Did I did you really think that this job just fell out of the sky for you (dan) hmm, yeah? (baby) This was a gift for us (dan) oh (baby) You gathered them all together in one place (dan) uh oh (baby) Just like he asked you to (dan) *nervous laughter* (baby) All of those little souls in one place Just for us, a gift Now we can do what we were created to do and be complete I Will make you proud daddy Watch listen and be full (phone guy) Connection terminated, I'm sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth if you still even remember that name But I'm afraid you've been missing You are not here to receive a gift nor have you been called here by the individual you assume Although you have indeed been called You have all been called here into a labyrinth of sounds and smells Misdirection and misfortune a labyrinth with no exit a maze with no prize You don't even realize that you are trapped your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles Chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber always seeming so near and somehow out of reach But you will never find them none of you will (dan) oh (phone guy) this is where your story ends And to you my brave volunteer who somehow found this job listing not intended for you although There was a way out planned for you I have a feeling that's not what you want (dan) what?! (phone guy) I have a feeling that you are Right where you want to be (dan) NO! (phone guy) I am remaining as well. I am nearby this place will not be remembered in the memory of Everything that started this can finally begin to fade away as the agony of every tragedy should Enter you monsters trapped in the corridors. We still and give up your spirits They don't belong to you for most of you I believe there is peace and perhaps warm waiting for you after the smoke clears, (dan) It's getting hot in here. (phone guy) although for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole So don't keep the devil waiting for a friend My daughter if you can hear me. I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent I'm sorry that on that day the day you were shut out and left to die no one was there to live you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours and Then what became of you, I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear Not to my daughter. I couldn't save you then so let me save you now It's time to rest for you and for those you have carried in your arms This ends for all of us in communication (peppy tutorial guy) Congratulations on completing your workweek we apologize if your situation Wasn't presented to you in a completely honest fashion when you first started (dan) look at this guy (peppy tutorial dude) But it was important that your intentions and actions be genuine Here at fazbear entertainment we value fun Family and food, but more importantly we value our commitment to atoning for past mistakes and tying up loose ends Thank you for your participation there is no need for you to return to work next week as Fazbear entertainment is no longer a corporate entity (dan) lost my job already (peppy phone guy) accept this certificate of completion (dan) Yeah! (peppy tutorial guy) goodbye for now and thank you for taking this journey with us. (dan) I did it guys I did it I ran my own restaurant to bankruptcy, and then the opposite which is completion. Wait a sec oh It's the credits so Someone set the whole place on fire and destroyed everyone I think it's write up some loose ends ex I mention it at the ends where There's a daughter that died in the original Freddy fazbear's I think this is just a crazy my first impressions of it from seeing it once a girl died And then she's the one that's been controlling the animatronics is she baby. I'm not too sure I think she's baby But um yes. She came back and was trying to get Revenge on the freddy fazbear. I don't know (watch game theorists for answers lol) I don't know. It's it's a proper open-ended thing, but it was cool, and I can't believe I actually completed that today This game is dedicated to the fans It's been a pleasure making games for you does that mean it's the end of five nights at Freddy's I don't know, but um we did it and apparently there's five endings this thing's so I Don't know how to get the other endings. I've got two then so far. I've got this one with the fire I've got the bankruptcy one as well Which I guess kind of counts as an ending, and I'm gonna guess in proper five nights at Freddy's style It's oh it's not I thought we're just gonna quit the game is it Is it just gonna leave it black? No oh look? It's my final phase rating so I couldn't be bothered to play all the minigames ten times between nights But I'm guessing yeah, there's my certificate of completion. I did it guys. Are you proud of me? I hope so okay doing some research with this handy dandy guides. We have six endings which is crazy good bad mediocrity bankruptcy blacklisted and Insanities so the bad ending is when you don't accept at least one animatronic now we
accepted Every animatronic so we got the we got the good ending which is except every single animatronic can survive all nights in order to get Mediocrity ending simply don't do anything What in order to get blacklisted you need to get nine lawsuits And in order to get the insanity you need to buy eggbaby and place it down then go to any night turn off the computer And hold your mouse at the place where the computer light is supposed to be then turn on the computer and enjoy the show We might be able to do that now right can I? Continue my game if I can it might put me back to that night where I think can I afford eggbaby Can I afford yes I could buy eggbaby so let's try this real quick this should be the insanity ending Where do we put egg baby here? Well, you're big you're huge actually Egg babies actually insane Right let's do this quick. So it said go to any night to turn off the computer Hold your mouse at the place where the computer light is supposed to be then turn on the computer and enjoy the show okay Let's go. Let's do this bro. Egg baby ending. We go so turn off the computer Then hold your mouse where the computer light is supposed to be which light this light then turn it on (phone guy) it's only now that I understand the depth of the depravity of this creature this monster that I Unwillingly helped to create as if what he had already done wasn't enough he found a new way to desecrate to humiliate to destroy as If the suffering wasn't enough (dan) whoa (phone guy) loss of innocence the loss of everything to so many people Small souls trapped in prisons of my making now set to new purpose and used in ways. I never thought imagined He lured them all back back to a familiar place back with familiar tricks He brought them all together are they still aware? I hope not. it keeps me awake at night. I could make myself Sleep, but lefty (dan) hey look, lefty,
 that was lefty (phone guy) until I undo what he has done and heal this wound a wound first Inflicted on me, but then one that I let bleed out to cause all of this (dan) ooh (phone guy) He said some kind of trap. I don't know what it was but he led them there again He overpowered them again, and he robbed them of the only thing that they had again I Don't know how those tiny breaths of life came to inhabit those machines But they will never find rest now not like this I have to call them all back all of them together in one place (dan) Interesting (peppy tutorial guy) congratulations you went somewhere you weren't supposed to go saw something you weren't supposed to see and prevented it a tidy resolution to a messy problem needless to say, you're fired (dan) what!? (peppy tutorial guy) but before you go a certificate of insanity We're giving it to you to ensure that no one believes you and to ensure that we can promptly replace you without incident Thank you. There is a truck waiting for you outside take care (dan) See you later. I'm going to the crazy Hospital now. that she makes so much sense so basically that kind of ties up even more loose ends I think the girl was killed by the dad's creation which was the original Freddy fazbear, and he did nothing about it He didn't realize it was that did it or maybe he did but then the animatronics he went on to make more and they were from the Blueprints of the same thing so they carried out doing bad things *screech* Think that's it anyway. Oh look at them certificates. They're building up guys.

oh hello neighbor Xbox one patch is live please update it features fixes for save corruption issues some players are in reporting oh that's definitely me let's check it out this is the longest of long shots ever if you didn't know and you not caught up then I've been playing hello neighbor on the Xbox for ages since the full game came out I put like 1015 hours into the game and then my save corrupted just before we found out the secrets so I've just given up like completely but now there's been an update it actually updated 2 gigabytes worth of files which is promised to fix save crashes now I don't know whether that means preventing it from happening again or whether it saves previous crashes let's find out let's pray please please that's a different loading screen so maybe some changes have been made is it gonna be the one we want though what what no I have no idea what's happening he called me about I'm out oh my goodness guys I'm so happy but this is now slightly awkward this is actually really awkward last time he was so mad I cut the head off one of my um hello neighbor doll brush things now it needs to go back on because they fixed it luckily I have some tape so let's see if this will work here we go let's just put that there and yeah yeah this will work this will definitely work we got this it's okay we can fix this definitely fix this yes yes yeah I was gonna say it worked but I'm not quite sure that that's what's happened here he's back you know what you can sit here nice and proud and I honestly don't even care the game he's back working we have the key card in hands we were so close last time to finding out the secrets of the neighbor and it literally didn't let us so now guys without any interruption let's head downstairs and let's find out these secrets oh how you feeling buddy oh yeah okay so we've done this bit already we have to go through this way little washing machine I should be able to get to a decent point like straightaway go around here and then I think it's through here I'm gonna grab the TV as well even though it's loud and obnoxious then we need to run all the way around here hide from this weird creepy guy and try and time it right let's go let's go let's go we just need to go up here and crouch hide away from this guy and he should just pass us then we're back to where we were oh oh I'm a little bit close I'm just a little bit too close that is so weird right TV thank you very much but you're out of here let's go let me keep this chair actually I didn't do that before and then we can't pick up these boxes but we need to go headfirst through this wall whoo ah there we go nicely done buddy and now we're here where the game crashed before actually I kind of need the TV don't I so before I threw the TV at this thing all this things changed actually it looks completely different that's interesting we push it over can we do anything with it I'm so confused because before what I wanted to do was I wanted to move this over to there and try and like run up it like a ramp I don't know if that's gonna work now can we double jump up here I think we can double jump up here guys look we just need something to jump off of maybe this quick it up here let me use that yeah I don't have the chair maybe the TV here we go okay double jump oh yes the chair works okay I'm on it now can I double jump over there that is the question let's try here we go oh that has to be done I'm sure you can do that yes yes I did it okay let's pop this down you need to be quite now shush shush this is important this is the door that we were so close to getting into last time I am so excited you guys ready let's do this bye my mom oh okay nope you can get out of here see you need all of the powers to be able to do this otherwise you're gonna fail dude here we go I'm behind the door what do i do 92 run yo this is what we did before it's exactly what we did before but we had to know we were blocked at the end yo it's open no locks we're out of here let's go oh wait a second did you see that it was like the girl but there was a boy oh this is getting creepy guys I we figured out that he kind of had one child which was a daughter but that looks like there might have been a son as well oh yeah there's definitely a son going on there's no there's one door there's a basketball hoop is it gonna make me play ball there's the kid look that's the guitar from earlier oh my gets in the hats those and the stay put those are the ones we have to put on the shelf in the right order it's not gonna make me remember that is it I just want to play basketball let's see if we can do it this is so creepy really creepy please is there anything behind no that's a lot whoa but oh my guess what is going on I will throw things at you I'm gonna throw this I'm gonna throw it I'm gonna throw he's got a flippin house on his back what is happening dudes I was too busy playing basketball what is happening what do I need to go I'm kind of like I've kind of just astonished by his size okay yes so the house is ruins we have eyes that the that's the tennis ball machine oh gosh we've got the the Train as well we have to go up here we do have the double jump now which is good because otherwise this parkour is gonna be impossible it's kind of difficult still with the double jump help me there we go we done this one what about this there we go and are we gonna go on another like rail rides cuz I don't think this is gonna work I mean we could oh geez what's that it's broken this is insane guys actually insane mind you can we just run the whole thing let's see what happens if we can just run it I'm guessing we need to get into the house on his back just because why would there be a house on his back otherwise but I don't actually think we need the roller coaster to work unless he's gonna splat us or something this is actually crazy ah looks like we do need to oh wait there's something down there oh man I don't know what to do look at him he's so weird he's got a house growth on him I feel like this isn't where I'm supposed to be we might need to work this out a little bit let's try and jump down here not sure what that's what I'm supposed to do but let's go down here as well there we go I've died fantastic there's so much going on here look there's a fire work as well this is like one big puzzle isn't it right let's do this this looks like some pretty tricky parkour guys but I think we've got it there we go let's press the button and see what happens I like the trains going what's gonna happen is it gonna crash into this house I kind of hope so that'd be really handy here it goes here it goes we didn't need power for after all we just needed to press the button yep Wow okay that destroyed that here we go what's in the house it looks like the the train has actually perched itself quite nicely inside the house no there was birthday cake and I'm dead I think there's even a way we can make that oh there is okay small bath big cake that's exactly the way I like to lead my life that's amazing we grab one of these candles I can yes we can light the firework with this bad boy let's um let's check if there's anything else we needs I don't think so but um this guy with a big house on his back yep he's going down I'm actually really excited to light this firework here we go light it light it yes it's working what's gonna happen there he goes right through is right it do his face oh it looks so sad I'm sorry well I'm not sorry that's a liar it's okay so now we can who knows mm hold on a second we got some more parkour skills that we can put into action here wait are we gonna launch in the toaster again can remember that minigame what we launched in the toaster I think that's right okay let's go let's see what happens what we got to lose oh it's um it's blocked do we fix the toaster we need to flick the light switch okay let's throw something I'm gonna go for the basketball first and see what happens hopefully this is what we need to do here we go hit it hit it you know you want to that was the worst throw ever box number two go doc oh that was so close oh it worked yes that's getting that toaster don't think I've ever said that before okay guys girls it's toaster time let's go I want to see what happens where does it launch us literally to the sky okay why so high no don't do this don't do this come on just land nicely what I think we need to double jump just before we get to the ground but that didn't that didn't really um set us up for a good landing did it up up and away are we gonna make it we are gonna make you and look there's a switch I don't know what the switch does but we've switched it it's making movements oh okay I see what's going on now jeez we so long to work out is uh this coming down or is he just gonna you know just to stay up there hope not I think it's gonna stay up there yeah we need to flick the switch then run and jump on it that's gonna be mental how do I do that okay flick the switch down there we go and this should allow it to go down hopefully yep there it goes it is quick though so we're gonna have to jump really quick ready go let's do this huh yes yes made it our first time let's go up the tube when you thought this game was just a simple game of cat and mouse and now you find yourself in an automated tube as a tiny person with the giant neighbor with a house on his back I mean if anyone could have guessed that was gonna be the outcome of the game then you are only a psychic because that's it's insane is there a house in here too okay great I have nothing to throw you have got to be kidding me I literally have nothing on me to throw no no no maybe we do this can I grab something from here please don't let me fall off that would be actually awful I was just celebrating yes got it cool bow that's what I'm talking about there's running jump it's double jump and there's another switch flick it and there we go Oh oh no no no I breath yes I can now float to my heart's content so I didn't really need this umbrella at all that was amazing though unless you got umbrellas for days now that's that's great right what I need to do now I think is push some of these baseballs in because well I don't really know why we just seem to be attacking the neighbor at all costs so I'm perfectly fine with that I had to think fast you know to grab that umbrella okay let's try and put this in go go go go go off the edge off the edge get in there that's what I'm talking about is it gonna fire itself yeah I got him okay can I do it again that would be so funny I mean not funny at all I kind of feel a little bit sorry for the neighbor now I don't know why I'm like this is like the weirdest boss battle ever here it did work whoa okay this is actually important we better not lose any of these baseballs because we need them how many times do I need to do this though let's see what happens okay that's all we've got to do for that there's some ink over here let's let's fly over here as well it's a is this a slingshot yo I actually think this is a slingshot but do we do we need something to cut it oh it's like it's a um it's a bow and arrow but I need something to cut it with all the candle the candle we need the candle should be able to burn through it right here we go right I've made it let's get this candle out and see if it burns it's working it worked do I need to burn it more let's see what happens I just want to see it fire there we go yes did he get him it shot something but I don't know if it actually got him you okay buddy you're looking pretty crazy oh we can jump across now I'm living worried about the red lights I feel like I'm missing something wait a second yeah I'm definitely missing something I have a theory let me just do one more thing I need to grab one of those they look like Mentos because over there there's like there's like a coke bottle and coca Mentos goes crazy and spews in the air so I'm gonna try and do this just a theory just because I spoiled that coke bottle just now and I've spoiled ease and have already known what to do of them let's try and grab I guess three but one should do can I make it over there though come on come on be nice be nice no duh definitely a coke bottle there though haha here we go let's see if we can you know do some science while we're here I mean why not can we drop one in let's see ah yes it worked it's actually gonna him it didn't seem to do anything why did I need to just I might I'm already there have I already done enough that was cool though I like that I wish I had done that instead of firing him with baseballs I coulda just done one baseball and then the rest just Mentos and Coke and arrows lookin awesome right instead I'm gonna fly over to this platform and just go in the house let's that's the only thing I can think to do otherwise I don't know what to do I'm not even gonna make it I'm definitely not gonna make it I need to just go straight on the house come on come on buddy lean forwards for me that's perfect that's perfect I'm here open yes I don't know what's gonna happen but I've done it I could have done that ages ago I didn't need to do the coke experiment but hey you know uh if you're trying to complete hello neighbor that's a tip for you and here we go another minigame oh look missing it's the missing posters so let me just break it down for you a second basically the neighbor has two kids I'm guessing one boy and one girl I mean wait I'm guessing they're his kids wait they might not even be his kids in that case everything just got a whole lot darker oh my goodness look missing which we saw at the beginning a boy and a girl were missing and we've seen boys and girls in those silhouette things one in the roller-coaster on one in this episode today whoa and there's the there's the freaky light monster that we've seen before we're about to learn these secrets guys and I'm actually scared there's also a shovel and a grave oh my goodness oh my goodness I am shocked appalled and also very interested ah what else we got through here that's the basement where he's got his another one is freaky light friends with some knock in for someone coming up or they just looking around I think they're just knocking around I don't think there's anything this way there was a door down here and this is also like the outside there's a neighbor he put up the posters and there's the freaky demon this is weird is he trying to like cover his back maybe by putting up the missing posters I'm not too sure but this demon right here that's got to be like his conscience or something saying like his bad conscience the devil on his shoulder he's crying though he's feeling pretty upset this is dark this is really dark and weird let's go through the other exit door and see what happens I'm scared this is weird guys so weird but I'm so interested I'm glad we didn't have to miss out on this because this is this is cool Oh what was this it's the boy is that me no that's not me is it I'm in a very very big house this looks exactly like me huh cuz banging okay this is not the neighbor's house the neighbor can not afford a place like this so you're playing with cars I like it you that's me though right that's that's definitely me where you going buddy where you going why are you walking like that you okay what are you doing oh my goodness what is that yeah I should probably scream like that as well I'm following you buddy I'm with you what are you running like that you're freaking me out what what why is the music started no no this is give me chills this is hello neighbor right I am I am flabbergasted I don't even know what to say look at this I'm following the kid where'd the kid go you go downstairs buddy I'm with you he's gone he's actually gone oh my goodness ready to go where did he go I'm gonna go under here cuz I've nowhere else to go I can't go in here that's okay huh huh screaming I don't even know what to think what my hair is the stand up friend oh you can fail it I need to follow him better this time I'm guessing like follow myself she's actually savage so crazy right I'm not gonna lose you this time buddy don't go into the darkness okay I need sir I need to help you out where does he go where did he go where does he go he goes he does go this way I thought he did but why can't I go under here I can't fit I'm too big can I go through here I'm too big for that too what I need to find another way out of here I can't even use that door what about this I can't use this either how on earth do I get through this this little thing ah look there's another side to the stairs okay I'm coming for you buddy don't die yet don't die yet or whatever this is happening to you I have no idea so I can now go down go now I can't go down there I mean I could try but that would be terrible okay I'm gonna get down there before him just because I'm a little bit scared for him and myself and he should come around this way I think or he's gonna come around one of these ways hello little boy little boy that you are okay he's here okay run it's soaked it's really giving me the chills guys he died anyway okay whoops look at this thing it's actually crazy this is gonna be the neighbors demons or something I don't think there's anything I can do here I can't pick up anything I'm just gonna stand in front of him and try and see what happens I think he's good yeah he's good I just stood in front of him and saved him perfect now where you going no don't run that way come on dudes come on give me a break where are you going up are you down here he's definitely down here okay let's go where are you buddy buddy there is there is no he got taken out I think I we need to be in the light here okay that makes sense I wasn't doing that before come on come at me bro yeah that's what our thoughts I think I'm getting taller as well which is a little bit random there he goes okay here we go here we go let's go up and then across effects let's go behind and it was here right yeah you leave him alone he might be me but you leave him alone okay here we go here we go get smacked okay where are you gonna go now buddy where are you going I'm getting much taller than you for some reason and I'm not sure why oh geez I'm getting taller so I can't I can't run after him there's got to be a better way for me to do this yeah I'm he's dead he's dead because of me great okay I have no idea where to go now I think I need to go this way there's only one way I can really go which is up here can I do that yes I can okay let's do this is this the next window where's my little friend where's my little friend hello I don't know where he is I think I failed where is he is he through there what do I do I can hear his little feet oh jeez I think I've done it I think I've done it right anyway I can go is up here come on come on come on come on come on I don't know what I'm doing I think I'm just blocking this guy now but that's all I can do come on run faster run faster is he gonna come through this door little dudes please be okay there he is okay let's turn around and face this monster head-on here we go yes we did it we did it the scary guy is consuming us as we speak oops this is like the weirdest thing ever but here we go whoa that was weird there's the house there's a house wait is it even a house what's inside there he is it's okay now oh geez yeah he's blocked someone in oh no no that's the kids there's a kid in there why did you do it though why would you do that I don't understand there's so many theories so many theories guys I'll go over them in a second but wow that is uh that's deep I don't even know what to say look at that look how eerie that is Wow okay let's go let's go through the door and then we can discuss what's going on because there's many theories that could have happened to you I have no idea what is the right one we might even find out now but let's exit and let's do this that's quite eerie as well I like that a lot let's go through the magic portal if that's the ends that'll be pretty like weird but good here we go we're back it where we slept before are you kidding me and there's the neighbor's house what used to be the neighbor's house and that's me I don't think I was ever the character I don't think so anyway I think it was just a boy that looks like me why would you move next to the house that where the neighbor was and maybe he doesn't even know there we go what what do you got though you were apples and books that's pretty much it right that's all you packed is he gonna make me do an act for that would be pretty mental if it did because when we went close to that house that was when the the way is like scary guy was or is that the end that's the end that's actually the end we made it we actually made it okay while the music plays let me discuss a theory that I have so remember we have the flashbacks from before where the neighbor crashed his car and also someone died we have no idea who and there was also a boy and a girl involved now there's so many things that could have happened one his daughter died which made him go crazy so he kidnapped a boy to replace his daughter and then something happened to him while he was stuck in the basements or he ran a kid over and they died and he like kept them in the basement I don't know that sounds a little bit weird the more I'm saying them out loud the more weird they sound but basically what we do know is that the the black creepy shadows with the shiny eyes those would definitely like the neighbors haunts or like bad memories coming back to haunt him because when you saw the kid at the end bashing on the door which the neighbor had trapped him in he was changing into those weird shadows so there has to be that we just have so many theories that could make sense through all of the interpretation of the events but what we know is the neighborhood something Bad's he regretted it and it involved the kids yeah that that's all you can definitely say if you have any theories then please feel free to discuss in the comments section down below I would love to go through and read them because I might go back and revisit some of these levels just because there were some other fun things that we didn't actually discover like unlocking via the dolls house is one off the top my head Vikon remember we've done and probably some other things as well so if

always it is amazing so let's continue with the story the background to this game is changing which is scaring me a little bit and I remember where we were before I think we were checking out the puzzle no where are we did it did he just send me all the way back to the beginning you can't do this to me there must be the puzzle must be complete come on let's see the pink onesie though there we go looking good I didn't save it's a saving but I don't think it's taking it seriously I'll be right back guys okay this is where we got to before I have the second puzzle piece which goes right here we got once ago and it's through this big painting let's do this there we go it's looking like grandma's house got a little bit more messy she definitely used to sort out this tree problem there's also leaves absolutely everywhere and the worst plant in the world look at this okay I feel like things are gonna get super super creepy I can hear like some weird very very weird things okay yeah it's just opening by itself and why there trees absolutely everywhere it's so weird I just wanted my puzzle piece I just want to finish my puzzle go home have some food and then forget this even happens what is this oh this is the creepy monster do you remember that jump scared me before and I'm guessing this is me I don't know if that's teddy though Teddy I don't think that's you but it might be the Minecraft version of you very square looks like we've got another gate to go through underneath the bed is this supposed to be like symbolic of our house after something bad has happened um oh wait a second what's this it's a bottle okay that's random it's not I don't even know what that says that's interesting though I wouldn't if that has anything to do with the story that'll be pretty cool that'd be interesting right ed through the nether vents I feel like I'm a superhero spy right now ha is that is that a Jefferson hello mama no it's it's not even I started with people's feet it's just boots oh that's really way that I'm kind of stuck my onesie is now gonna blue as well that he's so weird so this must be symbolic these like different states of the bedroom I'm pretty sure anyway I'm just guessing I have no idea can I get up here I don't think I can there's you know there's another bottle here what is going on and another one what is happening here bottles trees grandma's house and big scary monsters that's definitely a big scary monster there's me with a very big sad face and I think that's a green Teddy Teddy you look good in green I'm not gonna lie I'm gonna hug you because I feel bit safer and I can see a little bit better as well let's see what's behind door number two oh man okay right I need I need this come to me stool I need your assistance because I am the strongest a baby alive and I can drag things like this go door let's find you this door is gross ah where the other side of there that's good okay grandma has some way to get around her tree problem do we need this again we can't move this one oh ha ha no no Teddy Audrey Teddy hold me please real close I thought was freaky is he still there it's not there oh it's a well that's weird that's really weird I'm just gonna leave now is this outside I hope not please don't be outside it's kind of half in half out hello scary monster you yeah what's in here another bottle let's see is there a bottle in here no bottle in there no bottle in there okay they're gone got a serious leak problem up in here and uh we have to go outside near that thing for a puzzle piece can I just buy a new puzzle instead I guess I'm a baby I don't really have any money so I don't have any choice I feel like I'm missing something though oh what's this we've got two people and two babies not so that middle one looks like a baby though so good it could just not be it's so weird I hope I haven't missed anything and especially the puzzle piece and that's the drawing of the thing we just saw so weird so very very weird I'm hoping that the puzzle piece location is just really really obvious because otherwise I've messed up and I'm gonna have to do it all again again which would be terrible oh man okay so this is where this is where the creepy guy was that's a very big mushroom teddy hold me close hold me real tight oh my goodness there's a well can I see it ah ah this is the one from the painting it's from the painting it's from the painting this chair is also a tree I am worried so worried can I get in the well this is the one from the picture so last time at the end of the episode we saw her go up to it drink from the well and just leave it was so weird but this is where the monster is I think the monsters kind of resembling something ooh let's who happens oh it's gonna happen we're bringing something up I don't know I don't want to know what's in this uh I don't know it's in this bucket I really don't oh I do I do it's the puzzle piece and something else you've got a puzzle piece that's perfect okay that's as far as I can go can I oh really they're gonna make me walk the plank to grab it that's that's not very nice oh if I fall in so we got that I have no idea what you just said but you said something about a puzzle white also grabs is that a key I think that's a key that must be the next memory artifacts that's weird so is there an easy way for me to get out oh wait a second maybe it's not that my artifact we can use it for this padlock I can still hear whispering as well which is it's freaking me out a little bit right let's use this and that's used oh that looks like the same person that was in the painting that's so weird and I can't I can't keep this which is even weirder hopefully this gives us a shortcut back to where we were I don't remember seeing a big globe I just need to see a painting and I'm out of here just like in Super Mario 64 but oh hold me close steady hold me close don't look up he's just a wannabe Slenderman that's all let's uh let's go through this log I don't like being in the outdoors because that's where the evil man is hahaha that's twice in one I don't think we saw him at all in the previous episode but this time is everywhere where do I go where do I go is it this way I'm so freaked out guys I don't know where I am there's another picture though is this yes another drawing of the man and me with a very sad yellow face okay this is this is definitely not good I just want I just want to find the painting I just want to leave I know I can hear his creaking and I'm seeing shadows I don't remember this bit there's like giant furniture everywhere as well so so weird is it I don't know if this is it it's a big building though this is creeping me out guys I don't like being above the water as well with that creepy guy around oh I'm hearing creaking I'm just gonna leave I have to move these move move move there we go see strongest baby in the world can just pull planks whenever he wants up they almost hit me right what's inside here we've got lots of barrels it looks like this barrel has moved bottles again what are the bottles about I can't even work this one out there's like four people in I heard knocking I definitely heard knocking the SIRT green up there as well so we need to get up there but look there's the monster there's me Teddy's not here sorry teddy you know you're not in this picture but we've also got the bottles as well it's really really odd right I need to do some hardcore parkour that was easy enough okay look at my shadow when I walk that's so weird so creepy oh geez right green key I got you I don't know what I need you for but I've got you just in case I don't like the noises I don't like the noises there he is I kind of want to see him he's gone already he's actually gone already Teddy hold me well because it's gonna be fine No oh I guess that is even closer than it was before how on earth do I get out of here do I have to follow him surely no I'm gonna croak he makes me feel a little bit safer oh why is he knocking on the door who is that who's knocking am I even supposed to be coming this way I think I am I need to find somewhere for this green key to go okay this is definitely a dead end I just need to I need to find a green padlock I don't think it's in there so we to follow the creepy trees also that's awesome but very very weird what's the noise why is the music doing that I'm hiding in a bush I've been playing too much for tonight I'm just hiding in a bush I mean we could go over there but we've already learned before the child's don't swim so probably not the best thing to try but where is it ah no no no we'll get through the trunk oh my goodness why you no no leave me alone leave me alone you cannot come through this you could not come through this Teddy Teddy scare him away what is he doing what is he actually doing can he get me can you actually get me yo that was weird oh that was weird he was like he was splashing and stuff why are you splashing what's your arm with you ah there's a fence hopefully this isn't the fence we just came through I'm hope that's one with with a natural green key please yes I think it is has loads of different places to go like different ways why would you oh this is a dead end before such a quicker way to get the key that's cool here we go that's the third time third or fourth time might actually be on my go second here I can hear a mic here and go go just put the key in the hole and I'm out here I don't even care about grabbing it let's go let's go let's go yeah bah bah bah no no no go go go go go baby doe you pull it off what are you doing yeah it was horrible those archery horrible oh my goodness where's he gonna put me back to you oh my what I jumped out my skin guy is so so terrifying please don't put me back to the start don't make me do the whole thing again all thank goodness I have to go this way don't I don't you dare don't you dare I do not look to pull back in huh I'm gone I'm gone come on baby go as fast as you can please I don't want to see that guy again ever again in my life is this this isn't even the painting it's a window I just wanted to see the painting I just want to put the puzzle piece back I'm scared over here why am i inside the barrel ah no get up get up get up get up right now right now open the window and I'm gone I'm gone get out of here geez ha go go I don't know where to go I don't know where to go I just gonna died on this chair oh my goodness he is absolutely terrifying leave me alone please leave me alone I can't remember where to go this is stressing me out guys this is really stressing me out I can properly hear him as well the painting okay the paintings they're perfect let's just run run run as fast your little legs can carry your buddy cuz this guy is creeping me out let's go let's go all for completing a six piece puzzle they already had three pieces in it easiest puzzle in the world can we not just could we not I just fit through there we are a child a two-year-old child after all you better not follow me as well because I'm not liking this here we go third piece final and that is that I'm trying to decipher this paintings if it means anything but it might do in the future they've all got the same woman on this painting at the end is kind of similar got more memories owls books the caterpillar thing the pink elephants right this painting deep move but I've missed it but that all the woman's gone the woman left the mum left I wonder what this is gonna entail oh I thought this is gonna be the house is definitely not the house if this is a maze I'm quitting I don't want to play a maze I'm gonna crawl cuz a bit faster but I do not like this this dark in here there he is there he is there he is there he is steady steady hold me Paul because homey clothes from the scary man from the scary man just leave me alone I can't even run with Teddy it's so bad oh geez oh my god it's run Teddy run run run because if I run too long the baby falls over and I really don't want that to happen is he gone now he's over there he's like a tree person he's so creepy there's like more drawings how do I get out of here do I just go out the ends where is he where is he I can't even see him because when you hold Terry you can't run but it allows you to see easier okay here's the memory I just need to get over this over this thing let's go let's go no come on let's go it won't let me through so I have to go that way oh it's making me stay in here a lot longer than I want to no don't look back do not look back just keep on going keep going I'm running I'm running I'm running I'm running it's gonna make me do the handle really it's that window I don't really know how to get out no no how do I get out here this event okay come on come on we can do this just use the bends because then he can't get through the banks he's too big it was so close that was way too close did you see him he's right there he's gone now but oh my goodness guy can I drag this back up yeah you go away buddy I don't like you Teddy I love you buddy I love you I don't wanna see you taken by the big tree man all that was horrible it was so horrible oh he was literally at this close to us it was insane right next memory let's listen in and see what happens shall we I've got Teddy just in case [Music] the rabbit cried she cried so much that her tears filled the bottom I see is that it that's the worst story ever it's my train when it was my birthday and everything was a lot nicer give me a book thank you thank you mom let's go oh look it's like a Mario pipe that's hilarious I'm getting out here I've seen that guy way too many times and I like for one episode let's go what is my ones who keep changing to blue as well it's kind of bothering me except perhaps a time and effort into thinking about the colors that was horrible guys I like this place though we certainly are teddy bear it's so good to see you again buddy even if your eyes do freak me out still what was that I don't know I think it's a Pokemon Oh sad and desperate oh it's a she is it like yeah it definitely stands for something I'm just not sure what yet right what do we have the book might be so nice I went through with all this we can play together all the time it's gonna be great without that stupid giant Sriman after us all the time a woman as you've just said teddy but I'm excited I'm very excited to get back to normal I've got cake tea as well mum bake me a cake and then I just didn't eat it it's too many things for pink elephants I got you as a gift so I guess I'm spending some good time with you all right let's spin the wheel of fortune and see what on earth is gonna happen next on our crazy baby adventure we did it guys so you've got the pendant the music box and now the book one two go very close to I can feel it good it's good good good push the button you said that last time there's a little little little bit of me that doesn't trust this bear and I'm not sure why why don't I trust you buddy is it your shifty eyes I think it might be right get on my back here we go it's gonna be fine teddy as long as you don't betray me or something crazy like that we're gonna be absolutely fine put a bucket we've got a ball let's put the ball in the bucket there we go and let's make our way down another slides oh-ho put your arms up guys there we go where on earth are we gonna end up next we are in Harry Potter's cupboard under the stairs that's a little bit weird he's got packages and stuff too he's got boots he's got three boots for some reason a random hat box oh I'm in like a closet so it's kind of like Harry Potter this bits a little bit more creepy though isn't it this is another one of those sideways rooms I'm not quite sure it's got like boarded up windows a lamp that just looks kind of cool but kind of freaky weird so weird this reminds me like with all the doors it colorize me a Monsters Inc as well so I'm Monsters Inc crossed Harry Potter it's insane and hello neighbors remember like the basement bit we have to jump over when you get the super jump I mean look at this if this doesn't remind you of of all of those things I just mentioned then I don't know upwards that's insane so we've got a vent that goes oh okay things have got a little bit more tricky we actually doing platforming that looks weird really weird okay right let's check out the surroundings there's these black marks that we keep seeing as well Teddy will glow them up for us got a tennis ball there's all kind of bits and bobs they don't really do anything a random door I want to check this out though because we've got like a truck and a really big drop like a really big drop let's shut this down yeah um yeah should stay away from the edge should knife oh no look it's this thing but it's all ruined or is it shiny it's shiny why did you get so shiny buddy let's see you down there bye I'm guessing we need to get out there but I'm not what we're gonna do when we get there such a weird scenario as long you know what anything as long as that woman man tree thing doesn't turn up I'm absolutely fine it's it's gonna be okay oh is this gonna bring us to the top it is okay we have to take this out and then and then there's noises Oh sheep there's sheep what what is going on so it moves why why are you making this baby do such extreme parkour it's unnatural and weird but also kind of fascinating there's another bottle as well let's go oh my goodness this is really really weird it's gonna fling me forwards there we go these bottles are so odd but at least I can throw them okay yeah I shouldn't do that my goodness any expected to smash Wow that was horrible that was not nice what if we got here creepy corridor to the left nice a corridor to the right and some splurges and doors and some family portraits that have no family in them this is a cool level though I like this oh maybe not maybe not hello is anyone there or did he fall he almost fell I think when the baby feels fear or when our character feels fear everything just goes weird and that looks like my mom bent over backwards like a dripping that's that's not cool that's really not cool what's under here another picture look this is a better one and get better at drawing and it's just a nicer scenario I'm gonna take that one why he's my crayons too because they have other not crowns it's fountain pens I thought it was a scowl pool for a second we'd have to do some surgery luckily that is not the case cuz I would be in big trouble I kind of like just throwing things down here it's kind of satisfying I wonder if that's gonna that's gonna make us have a much harder time when we get down there I hope not but you never know all right I guess all this have to do is pick up this oven glove and and climb the mounting of things let's see all is atop the mountain of things anyone there tree lady man the flashing lights never good sign is it really like at all never is that a big coat at the end as well you know like those coats we saw at the beginning I think it is I really think it is but um guys I don't be so mean right now because if I get to the end of this and I have to end the video and I have to start again next time I'll be super annoying so I think we've had enough of the tree guy woman whatever whatever they are they're super scary I think we've had enough of those today so I'm gonna end the episode here I'm sorry I'm sorry but there'll be one tomorrow and I think we're near the end of this game so you've only got one more artifact which must be from here and then whatever happens from now on things got weird things got scary and I really secretly enjoyed it I hope you did too if

Hey guys, how's it going happy Saturday so for today's video, I thought I'd start off with a little story! so yesterday I spent the day with 10 amazing children with the make-a-wish Foundation, now I've mentioned the make-a-wish Foundation before because what they do is they help a terminally ill children or children who have had their lives Affected by a really really harmful disease or illness and the families as well And it helps them to do amazing things Basically the children can wish for almost anything they want and Make A Wish will do their best to try and implement for them They're an amazing charity I've worked with them before made a video with some of you guys before from make-a-wish as well so first off if any of you guys are watching that I Met yesterday, then thank you. Thank you for making your wish me. Thanks for hanging out with me Thanks for playing some games with me We actually played gang beasts, which I hadn't played for a long time, and I need to play it again I'll get James and Justin, wait. I'll get on the phone They are not picking up again, but no I really get them involved, and we should do some more gang beasts 100% it was an awesome day. I also got this how on earth do I put this together. I have no idea I give up. I also got this is a Giant creeper head as you can see but it's got messages from all the kids that I met yesterday and their families and I will keep this forever. Thank you I really appreciate it now the reason I'm talking about this at the start of this video is For two reasons the first one is that if you've been in any of my live streams or watch the videos Afterwards or follow me on Twitter or anything you will remember that I mentioned that I activated super chats And I also activated sponsors on the channel as well now all the money that I get from those Donations those super chats and those sponsors will be going to charity every single month So the end of every month will bundle all the income made from the live streams And then will choose a charity every month together to be able to Send money across to them because I think that'd be an awesome thing that we can both do to make because someone else's life That little bit better, but just for this month. I'm not gonna open it to a poll I am going to decide that we should donate it to make-a-wish Foundation they do incredible things I've worked with them a lot, and I think we should donate our first team TDM sponsors stream Super-chat Wallet income thing I think we should donate it to them, but we still have two more streams of this month I'll do one today, which would have happened just before this video goes live and one tomorrow on Sunday So we can top that total up I'll give you the full amount go ahead and follow me on Twitter and Instagram And they'll be where I announce the full total for the month. We've actually got a lot already. So thank you guys I think this is gonna be an awesome thing for everyone pretty much Now the second reason I'm mentioning it is because someone gave me this Yeah, it's it's a little bit different than what I'm talking about but it's a it's a grow a pug Yeah, I have never seen this before, but it says I can grow my very own pug to hug Which which I'm excited about and it grows to six times its size So I thought we would give this a go the only thing is it takes 72 hours to get big check this out so after 24 hours it gets a little bit bigger 48 hours Which is two days it gets even bigger And then 72 hours, it's gonna burst out of the glass so I have big expectations now. I have this glass right here I would have liked a test tube, but I just don't have test tubes lying around my office weirdly enough So I thought we'd give this a go and check in with it in three days and see how it goes Let me unleash the pug first. Where is it? Where is it? I can never open these packages properly. Oh here it is hahaha At the moment it's not looking too much like a pug. It's definitely got the curly tail but but apart from that I'm sure it's gonna grow into its looks, right? um Excuse me guys. I kind of need to use the tap so okay Yes Yes, all right. We have our oversized test tube. We have our pug let's pop this guy in go forth little pug and grow to six times your size I believe in you oh It's gone belly-up is that what is that what's supposed to happen? Well I hope so so I guess we should leave that for three days And see what happens go ahead and follow me on Twitter It's at dantdm and Instagram as well, and I'll post over the next few days How big it gets and in three days? I'll start the video off with how big Our pug in water grows didn't think I never say that, but hey here We are I feel like it's actually getting bigger already, but it says it takes three days. Let's be patient and I've been promised a hug from this thing, so let's hope that that's true, but yes the people gave me that gift yesterday Thank you. That is awesome. I also got was this which I didn't even know that they did so the pop figures They're so popular I have loads of them, but I didn't realize they make five nights at freddys ones this one is nightmare chica And this got me thinking I saw something the other day about these guys if we head over to scott cawthon web site oh Okay, that's changed new office under construction. Please come back later. This is not. What was here last time Let me show you what was here before look check this out This was on the homepage of scott cawthon website Which is where he usually posts all the spoilers and gets people hyped up for the next five nights at freddy's game and it all It said was custom night, and then it had loads of different Animatronics and characters from different games some of them look absolutely terrifying like this guy And then there's also a telephone so who knows what is cool is there's characters from the newest game as well like the the terrible animatronics like this cage guy balloon and Buckets, man. Yeah apparently that's now disappeared so could there be another five nights at Freddy's game in the works Potentially, and I'm excited this just reminded me of it so in summary. Thank you for all the gifts you gave me yesterday Thank you for meeting me. It was awesome. I loved meeting you guys I've chosen the charity for this month from our livestream revenue Which I will reveal on Twitter in a few days for that final total We put a pug in a glass of water, and there's a new five nights at Freddy's game in the works Good news all around. I'm sure there's something else. I had to say, but I can't remember. I'm sure I will remember Some time anyway, let's do what we haven't done in a while and read some of your comments Which video should we choose ah yes, the who's your daddy and V are the baby hands video? I think I'm gonna play that again because that was a cool game you left the mouse on the screen, No Again, or I did there it is How did I manage that? how, I edited the whole thing and didn't even notice guys. I'm sorry but again Who's your daddy plus among? The sleep plus duck season equals baby hands that is correct. Hopefully though It's not scary. I'm not too sure I hope not Grandma epic grandma voice: hello and guess what what? What hello peeps it's your girl gran TDM and today, we're gonna have a video on the savage grandmas NOOOOO Savage grandmas. I'm not gonna lie to you. This is exactly what I had in mind when I saw the savage grab my thing Give us an update on Cosmo the robot actually there is oh? Oh no He's got cobwebs on him Cosmo, I'm so sorry, I don't know what's going on with you, buddy We haven't spoke in a while. There's like pug hair all over you I'm not sure what's going on with Cosmo didn't update it for ages Let's take a look Cosmo the robots. Oh my goodness look at cosmos collector's edition. He looks amazing This is the normal one that I've got Look at that. He's got a makeover He looks beautiful the problem is I don't know where his cubes are which is kind of important. Okay? I found the cubes They're right here. I was just about to say there's one part missing, but I found it it's his charger Let's plug this bad boy in I'll download the app and then we can see what's happening in Cosmo lands, okay, Cosmo It's your big moment I'm gonna put you on your charger and come back to life. You've got this. Just don't don't drive off the sink He's charging okay app is downloading. Let's check in with him in a bit do more would you rather please? If you have to wake up to one thing every day, would you rather be deeply insulted by a stranger or? Be slapped across the face One thing every single day so as soon as I wake up. I either get a slap or get a deep deep insults We're talking about emotional pain or physical pain here But how hard would the slap be I think I just rather be deeply insulted. It's 5050 there's a slight slight difference more people would like to be that's across the face about 1,400 more I'm not sure about that. I think I could take the insults I take them every day to be honest interesting oh my goodness Dan do an injection game oh What Nya what an injection game I'm a little bit worried about you nya play a texting story You know what, I've seen some of these Apps before so it's kind of like it's like a story But you're learning it through text I might do that for another video if you want to see that leave a thumbs up, and maybe I'll do it okay Let's move on to the escaping clown prison video and see what comments. You've left dan I waited all day the other day and no video.

I'm sorry I couldn't upload a video But hopefully you enjoyed the ones coming up the owners of this game should make a mode where you can play as the police That would be amazing that would be really really cool If you made it like online as well, which I know the escapists already is But if you made it online so that you could have players versus police that would be super cool almost 18 million Yes, we are actually how cosa we nine seven six. Oh, that's so close like 20 just under 24,000 away, oh, that's gonna happen in the next few days ah I haven't you know you know me I have no plans so I'm leave any plans that I should do for 18 million subscribers in the comment section down below This is a comment on The most recent unnamed minecraft series that we're doing and I actually pinned this the other day.

oh it is time it is time but we had to the hardest prison in this game the craziest prison in this game the USS anomaly or as I like to call it space prison that's right they said all the prisoners to space and we are about to be one of them I cannot wait all of the guards appear to be robots oh my goodness look at their names and so weird my clone is also in this prison which is interesting looks like there's a whole lot of guard robots and not that many prisoners so without further ado let's do this they're also wearing spacesuits it is actually pretty good approach convict after 70 years in cryo sleep to reach this prison you may now begin your 12 months sentence dude that's long wonder what I did to deserve a year in prison regardless I'm here I'm sleeping and I like the look of this prison a lot why is it 2 p.m. almost that's really weird so the timings are completely messed up let's go to roll call actually let's take a sneak peek in our desk we've got nails we've got a toothbrush we're pretty much set wait what is this the walls are speaking look there was speaking can they can they keep tabs on us that's so weird right let's just grab some missions and see what they are manseok already doesn't like us there's my clone though um no let's not be bullies come on now hold on a second guys guys like oh no cements do that no don't hit me don't hit me no I was trying to click the map and it wouldn't let me know it's breakfast time guys it's breakfast time I'm gonna be in big trouble let's just run to breakfast time and hopefully he leaves us alone my bad yeah my bad I'm just trying to find some pay phones but for some reason if I click the map it just lets me punch ah the pay phones are right here let's take a look shall we escape tip race from space a multiplayer tip and an energy sword yah we need 25 more coins to be able to get that so let's do some more jobs and not accidentally hit people oh look there's contraband detectors in the cells Oh No what how am I supposed to work with that there's also an upstairs as well we've got some free time right now yeah this place is wet I really wish I could see the map I don't know whether that's a glitch or whether it's done it on purpose because it's the last prison either way slightly annoying I didn't look for foil and tape and stuff to make a contraband pouch because that's pretty insane oh no oh no no he's coming to get me he's coming to get me I'm to grab all these things I need to destroy this and grab some money how much have I got 35 any do some more whoa precious mineral I'm gonna take that just because I know you can make an energy sword job time okay let me just grab this tea bag first and I think you know I think these things are telling the robots what I'm doing there's a skull in here there's actually a skull in here I need the foil but that's a that's a contraband item how am I supposed to get it out of here oh wait there might be a way around here there really isn't out I'm being hit I'm being here I'm going to lose my foil No yeah I've been detected oh my goodness this is insane guys actually insane I just want to put this away geez you guys a prison is hurting my brain I need to find a route where there's no contraband detectors and I think it might be up here okay job period is like through here and there's more payphones up here as well I wonder if that there same thing all different stuff hey buddy how's it coming now why are you hitting me dude what's going on words ow how am I supposed to do this huh I wanted to check what jobs they would have because where it is nice prison I think these wall things are definitely snitching on us so we need to be extremely careful the past few persons I'm gonna put out there they were pretty easy but this one this one looks like it's gonna be absolutely ridiculous Manzi oh please like me more I've given you a flippin cup of tea do I have enough money sixty-five beautiful let's see how on earth we can get out of here race from space boom four years mankind wanted to conquer space but not like this I know the whereabouts of the gravity control to give you the upper hand to try and bust loose to get to the gravity control you'd have to head to the warden's office then with that sorted I use something thrust powered like a jet pack maybe you could get your hands on one from the guards quarters situated east of the prison well that isn't sound easy does it my goodness I'm trying to see if there's any other controls to be able to open up the map because I really really can't do it map em okay let's see if that works it does beautiful I don't know if they just change that or what but it's really annoying okay this prison is pretty big we need to find the warden's office which I'm guessing is as a control room here it must be down here somewhere because I can't actually find a specific warden's office unless it's above here I think it's gonna be up here how on earth are we gonna do that also is there any way to get to my cell without knocking at the contraband detectors I think there is you just need to go all the way around up here and then down that's the only way we can get contraband around here that's gonna be really difficult right give me some time I'm gonna grab some jobs I'm gonna start doing things Jaco doesn't like me for some reason ouch a bomb just smacked me for no reason as well why does no one like me here go away Jaco no I'm trying to do a job for you star please stop please stop that he Timmy he Sammy ow he said Lal oh my goodness this guy is absolute madman oh look the security cameras in the cells that's why they can see what I'm doing and now I'm dead okay so every single cell has a security camera so every time we try and do loads of desks that is gonna it's gonna get you kind of found a random desk I'm gonna need I don't even know what I'm gonna need but I'm gonna need chocolate I need foil broom handle I need stuff to knock out guards I think so I'm definitely gonna need some kind of guards outfit so I can turn into a robot which is gonna be awesome we got free time it's quarter past midnight but hey that's absolutely fine I got some rolls of foil because I want to make myself a contraband pouch at some point just so when things get a little bit crazy see look it's literally smacking me every time I check a desk what am I supposed to do two cameras actually I have an idea let me see if this work with these desks can you just pick them up and move them out I guess you can't I'm just gonna put it here and it doesn't seem to actually detect me so that kind of works at the skulls worrying me a little bit I'm gonna take the toothpaste about you foul some decent things oh wait a second follower of zag death Ian slip the rumors are true I'm a follower of zag death Ian slip only by performing the slippage ritual of Nana can I summon him to break me out I need a few things for the process will you help I mean it's a one out of three mission I don't know if it's gonna help us escape but I don't know why we wouldn't try get orange-colored pen to create slippage symbol I mean okay let's do that I'm probably gonna get beat up for it but we might as well here we go here we go here we go quick quick quick orange pen orange pen that's all I need alone arming big trouble big trouble big trouble don't hit me actually got away with that pretty well there you go what's the next mission the slippers symbol have been created now the book of slip States we need a candle for the next step could you craft one I mean sure but I am gonna get in big trouble for this so you owe me big time buddy actually though for these top ones if I just move it to here it actually doesn't detect me when I'm in the desk that's pretty good and they just move it back whenever they want oh it gave me a lighter but I can't cancel this mission I'm just gonna have to take it I'm sorry what if I pick up this desk and then move it to here does that work - it does okay we found a way to do it perfect wax amazing so we can just move all the desks to the front of the prison cell and then it doesn't actually detect us of doing anything wrong just like this amazing I need to craft the candle now I don't know if I have enough in select I do okay is this against the rules it is not I'm gonna go and give it to you if this summoning the god thing works then I want anybody I want him to actually get me out of here - let's see leeming what's your next thing praise is a death Ian we are so touched by your glowing tendrils all we need now is an unidentified skull until dantdm collects various Space Oddity starting ow ow ow someone hit me why did someone just hit me are you okay geez he's gonna give me an energy sword in return y'all that's amazing but I will need to be careful when I accept the energy sword because obviously it's going to be against the rules so I need to be extra careful where I except it has always duct tape up here and it's there's there's no way to get down the stairs with outs and triggering a detector so I'm just gonna have to just get out to get smacked I've been rumbled but I've got myself another duct tape I should be able to make a contraband pouch now so I'm gonna grab that just in case I need to hide this energy sword with my life I've literally spent about half this recording on the floor passed out oh wait I don't actually get it from a cell I literally get it from dantdm the clone himself well that's a little bit worrying I had she after engage in a fight there he is he already doesn't like me so ah the Horde get is he starting fights with everyone I just need to get in court so hopefully BAM oh geez I just missed he's on a tiny little bit of Health come here clone come here there we go got him give me the skull that's all I need thank you no don't hit me that is all I needed but I need him to come out because as soon as I complete this mission he is gonna give me the sword and I need to be super careful right here we go let's do this I've got the sword the energy sword is mine I think I've done this in the right place so I should be able to put this in my desk this thing is insane can we actually make our own as well let's pop this in the desk whoa I just want to see how much damage it does it's high it's speed is low that's pretty awesome I'm gonna I'm gonna keep that oh no I'm gonna miss lunchtime now what have I done what have I done what have I got Oh nails I was just trying to curls and stop just walk it through all the detectives God take my nails they're not even mine ok I'm gonna quickly craft myself a contraband pouch just because I can I think it's two foils and a duct tape let's see what happens boil foil duct tape crafts okay it's not that what is it just one foil and the duct tape I don't know I'm gonna intellect no again you join me on the floor but I have stuff that I've needed to collect I've got myself a lighter an inmate outfit and a tub of bleach which I've just robbed off of a body that was knocked out yeah I made someone naked in return I got a beat-down for it which I guess is well deserved the reason I need it is to make one of these bad boys and infirmary outfits of course I can do this actually maybe not that is contraband and they missed breakfast time whoops doesn't like I got in trouble though so I guess that doesn't matter it's gonna run for it here we go here we go I just need to plant this get some money because some people are selling contraband bouches okay he knocked me out instantly well that's a failed mission isn't it the amount of times I've been hit is crazy okay I need to hold up some space six I grabbed a screwdriver just in case meats get into the vents at some point but I've crafted myself a contraband pouch as well apart from that though I don't really know what else I need apart from the red key so I need to use my cup chocolate and lighter to make a molten hot chocolate knock our guards steal the key make putzie you know all that good stuff because I go I need for an infirmary outfit which I think works exactly the same as the guards outfit so let's see we can also buy contraband pouches as well just in case also I've heard somewhere you can upgrade yeah you can look contraband pouch plus foil and a duct tape again makes a mega contraband pouch which is actually pretty cool I found the warden's office where I need to read the pay phone thing again cuz the warden's office is here I assumed it was all the way over here hmm it says to get to the gravity control you'd have to head to the warden's office then with that sorted I use something frost powered like a jet pack maybe you could get your hands on one from the guards quarters okay so we need to get to the guards quarters first grab the jet pack and then ahead over to the other place that's gonna be difficult I've missed roll call quick quick this could be close it's real close oh one seconds I would have been in massive trouble oh my goodness yeah we neither jet pack and then we've got to head all the way from at this side which is where the jet pack is going to be all the way over to here which is gonna be difficult because there's contraband detectors there's dogs lots of dogs that is that is gonna be really difficult there any vent ways to get in I mean no and there's no vents up here apart from this one what's this above the maintenance cupboards I don't know why I need to get into there really I mean I could try I have myself a I have a screwdriver so I just try it because I don't means any keys or anything to get in here and I can actually access it oh my goodness look what's this I can do this and then get up there and into the maintenance cupboard I'm gonna try that just to see what's in there then we can work from there here we go here we go here we go let's go up and now let's go down I don't know if the the maintenance man's gonna tell on us but we're just about to find out here we go we've got it I'm gonna put one vent cover up here just in cases anything in here what's in the maintenance desk was this worth doing what's in here we've got radio receiver plunger screwdriver tubing and safety goggles there's nothing in here guys I have wasted my time completely wasted my time do we really need nothing I mean I really don't okay I need to get on the desk where do I need to put this um I guess I'm gonna in big trouble okay get up here puts one of the covers in the slots there we go let's pick up this vent cover get down here and put that one in the slots oh wait what's there oh I can get in there I'm so dumb let's see if we can do that I need to grab the I need to grab the screwdriver though I need to grab this one that I couldn't use before here we go it's dinner time okay I probably should get to there need to put the vent cover in there and then I'm just gonna put the vent cover on here I guess and then I should be able to get in the other side I should have got in there anyway cuz look this is like a really kind of really protected space I'm also gonna leave the screwdriver in this desk just because there's contraband detectors near dinner oh this is interesting okay it's free time guys we've got this we just need to make sure that we don't get caught because there's guys in here I don't know if we make noise or not but hey we're just about to find out we're going in and seeing what's in the secrets room what's in here just be as quiet as possible come on what no way no way I need to get back up there oh my goodness you kidding me there's a jetpack up there right I need to put this back in really quick its job time I need to grab this vent cover go down put this back in I'm a professional at this now and 90s get back and then to my job you know I just need to get back I've got the jetpack I've got the jetpack please don't beat me up because if you beat me up I will kill you oh my goodness you actually got it it's fine it's fine I'm doing nothing yo jetpack save oh are you kidding me um right what do I want to do next I literally just need a red key now so I'm going to combine some of these things together just to make a better contraband pouch because we are gonna need one of those really quickly though and I need more space down here and I think that's it let's go to my job before I get in big trouble jet pack guys we just need the red key now that's all we need the only thing that's going to affect us is the who has the red key because we have we have this which is the putty craft this boom wad of putty which isn't contraband which is goods the molten plastic will be contraband or we don't have enough for molten plastic we need one more lighter actually that doesn't matter does it we don't need the plastic just yet we needs the molten chocolate so let's do that first here we go mug lighter chocolate boom Cup of molten shock now we've cleaned up a lot of our stuff now I also have a circuit board and a wire so that just in case they have themselves the keycard I can also make the keycard mold I'm pretty sure keycard mold yeah so a a keycard plus a circuit board and a wire I have all I need I just need to spy and see who's got the red key cards 0.9 should have the key card then all I need to do is get an infirmary outfits which I can craft I then also need a contraband pouch which I have and the jet pack which I have this is exciting and point-9 looks like he's coming this way and it's free time as well this is perfect right point 9 is going down I need to do this right now here we go let's see if he's got it no he's got the green key no he's got the green key but you came through the red door that's annoying and now he's gonna beat me to death I mean what am I supposed to do when he's got himself the green key I need the red one that's all I need that's all I need Oh lighter I go on oh my goodness I did not expect that okay I just need a cup and now I can make another cup of chocolate that is actually legendary I hate it when you're just trying to find one thing so frustrating okay this person just came out of a red door so I'm gonna try those you ready no he doesn't have any keys no keys dude are you kidding me it's me ah that's so annoying no keys you just came out of a red Quito I'm taking your outfit buddy give me your outfit thank you you get out of here you know god no longer your punk Oh No Security's gone up because they found the damage to the prison that might have been me I'm gonna have to just do it I need to energy source someone but I don't know who to pick Merve inator has access Jake I've already hit you so I don't wanna do that again okay there's one coming down here it's Paul I think I'm gonna hit Paul but it depends what the next the next thing is and this isn't gonna be a one shot so I need to be careful here we go got him got him got him got him one more time otherwise I'm losing this oh jeez no don't hit me turn him out need to do a powerful shot this energy sword isn't good enough here we go did I get him yo he's got a green key as well Paul oh my goodness Paul at least I know the energy sword works how long is it gonna take me to get this so long right I'm gonna go and get some I'm gonna get some strength and go to a hundred so I can try and knock them out in one shot of the energy sword and then I'm gonna come back with the red key and we're out of here got it I actually got it oh no no no no no Fido don't do this to me bro Fido Fido just call me with the red key molds he's got my energy sword as well Fido I hate you because it's a three stars that means that the dogs can sniff out contraband and put you at a hundred percent that's lockdown as well there's out she locked down as well what else did they get rid of the you know what at least I know who has the key how annoying is that okay we're back down to one but my goodness where is the person with the red key it should tell me all I can see is green and purple it's actually not telling me who it is that's so annoying yo that's a stun gun that could come in handy I need to make him have a better opinion of me because I I think I all know I hit someone I didn't mean hit someone I'm sorry I'm sorry I have enough coins I have 330 coins so I can buy that I just need to make him like me a little bit more where is he and there's my lighter that's exactly what I needed man Zia my buddy how you doing I'm gonna gift you Sen beautiful coins there you go can you sell to me now no okay I'm gonna give you ten more beautiful coins come on buddy like me like me why won't you like me I'm running out of money I need to buy the stun gun off you ten more coins would that work he's still won't he won't so to miss your low opinion of me jeez you're ripping me dry buddy he likes me now he definitely likes me now give me a stun gun thank you I've never seen one of these before this is insane okay stun gun lighter all I need now is talcum powder and the red key I mean that's all I need I also need to find out who had the red key so I'm gonna watch my footage back so give me a little bit and I'll be ready to escape this bad boy okay I've collected everything I need I think I hope this should be how we escape this prison man I took a break as well because my eyes felt like they were going square I also found the culprit it is this guy no it's not that guy is it this guy it is AR ll three eight one that's the chump that we need to knock out and get his key luckily we now have a stun gun which I think I'm gonna grab right now I also my goose jumped on and he's gone through there okay well at least we know who it is you have a stun gun I actually have two ones of putty so if this goes incredibly wrong we can do it again without having to find more items I've got a lighter I've got literally everything I need to be able to do this I just just need the opportunity it's gonna be tense times I think we can do it here we go stun gun putz II think that's all we need and the right guy to stab who is this guy I can't see because he's behind that's the wrong guy there he is he's up here so he should come down and through this bit any second now let's keep an eye on him and I can't go up there even though that would be perfect because I've got contraband on me here he goes is he going up or left he's going up okay we need to do this really really quickly I need no other officers to be around let's do this here we go come here come here this is our time here we go is that and then it grab the key quickly craft the key and then put the key back and then run Ron Ron Ron Ron Ron Ron Ron come on I need to get this home please no dogs please no nothing we're on a zero security so he should be fine oh we did it we actually did it let's put all this stuff back oh yes okay maja is always nerve-racking but what's gonna be even more nerve-wracking is actually trying to do this because I have got a guards outfit so I can turn into a robot but there's dogs here which I'm a little bit worried about and if it goes wrong then yeah we lose the jet pack we'll lose everything and I will rage quit I will do it guys it's free time I think we're gonna do this now like right now I am so scared though why want to try real quickly it's just if we become a robot we do that looks amazing whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what are you doing in here excuse me you're not supposed to be in here why are you searching my thing is it because of the security camera oh I should probably get changed right is there any one there's no one in here and trying to think the best way I think it's just gonna be up and rounds and as soon as we've got in there we're just gonna have to use the jetpack that's the only way to do it jetpack contraband pouch plastic key guards outfits I mean that's all we need right oh no three times about to end why would you do this to me I took too long I took way

Mystery Box challenge but I don't have a box so instead it's just gonna be guess what's in your hand do we put a blindfold and I'm gonna take it in turns to guess what each of us has chosen yeah it should be you should be so Danny's gonna go first yeah I just need to select an object okay give me a second so this is the first object that I'm gonna get Danny to try and guess hopefully she gets it okay so hold out one hands and yeah like that there's your first one you might wanna use your other hands to poke the top no if you get this that'd be amazing I thought it might be played a kinder egg with something it's similar to it yeah it's similar to a kinder egg secretly weirdly yeah wait is it something we used to like play with yeah yeah yeah oh what's it called you know what it is you know what it is yeah I wouldn't taste is this important no let's write that in my hand so egg it's an egg but what's inside it used to be obsessed with them and there used to be a rumor about them having offspring what we've definitely talked about this before oh it's gonna really upset me if I can't get it I try to think of some clues okay so we are holding in your right hand yes it's in what you're holding your left hands which sits inside an egg so like starts with a I'm so nice this upsetting me like I hate losing so rubbish what do you pass do you bus yeah go lift your blindfolds I don't you know what these are is gonna be weird it's an alien and then you have the two and then people said that if you put two in one egg they would have a baby but it never happens no people solve it yeah no you've never seen that before no should be funny it when I was feeling it it was like I was like this is this is a baby Oh disappointed all right so I think we're gonna switch yeah okay so guys okay it's got legs and it's wearing clothes is it yeah feels like a trophy [Music] that's ahead yeah there's definitely like a human oh I wish it could be anything really can i is wearing a jumper it you don't know I just picked up things from home okay this is what we have at home what kind of things you cook it's like a collectible yes yeah so yeah I'm gonna need a clear okay so you collect them mm-hmm they might be like characters Oh popular superhero aha yeah yeah I mean what super fuzzy my favorite superhero spider-man spider-man my mom wearing a jumper yes know what you go jump for that school none makes these little jumpers no one like bottle and so we got them at Christmas on like a bottle of champagne and then thought that's the best that kind of point yeah happy we should have like a clue allowance yeah one clue yeah one clear well clear okay blindfold on you ready to get your first point just so yeah I'm not gonna get any okay I think you'll get this one okay this is what it is by the way guys yeah first yeah yeah oh it's squeaks [Music] don't means do you make a similar no needs to be fair rubber penguin no other birds eagles no white I think of any bad Robin or a sparrow no peacock no chicken [Laughter] [Music] I dunno I dunno why it has a target on his back either okay one on next one is right this is what this is oh it's tiny it's like it's China hmm it's an egg cup but you can put something in uh-huh can you perk handle it yes so is there like an animal cool legs and a tail is it go horns of course you are talking I have a cleaver yeah so animal that has horn type of features around around a special time of year o reindeer yeah is that ready to kind order well that's cool I like that that's very cool yes do I wait I reckon don't get this pretty quick no arcade you're getting quick I think if it's the dummy that they did yeah why when you younger these are so entertaining I used to have one that we'd itself I mean that's actually I didn't do that yeah just thing I bought all of these objects at the same time from the same place dude can you imagine what they were thinking this is a bit hard I didn't give you an alien for the first one Oh like an egg that's all I can say it's like it's a soft okay now what might you use it a soft egg yeah cuz I won em joke eggs cleanings would I have one of these mm maybe no I don't think so some some boys would but not usually okay no I'm so lost yeah path no I literally no idea even if you see I'm gonna pass what is that wait is it a makeup thing yeah no it makes sense now like [Music] okay guys this is the next thing you gotta put your hands out you are gonna be able to hear this one so you might give it away so pop your hands out this is this is not the thing that's protection what okay I think that's enough okay that's what it is I don't know if you're gonna get this I don't know five words it's not hairspray no so you can touch the top yeah yeah oh my goodness this is the one that you wouldn't get yeah was it the sound no I well I don't even know what it feels like wait this is stringy does it exploded oh my god I know exactly what this is I know exactly what this is this is a stuffed pug uh-huh like this from the top I've miss seen these every single day this is the next object it's oh I was gonna say what it was then don't hate me it's not alive is it no it's not allowed oh my goodness is it what I think it is this is quite a job on my hands that I was gonna be even meaner because that it moves I was gonna turn haha by the way if I had that done to me I would freak as soon as I felt that like the legs yeah if you didn't have this on it and you like to go up to someone yeah you would think I could easily think that that was real you could South it so that's the subscriber the objects that I bought in one shot a baby a toy spider an alien a rubber chicken and some silly string in one shop you think it's a you're for yeah I have to get this next one right so the only one I didn't get was the alien yeah which is so annoying because I feel like that was oh yeah right alright last one this is pressure I need to get this one right it's like oh it's spiky um it feels like a um like a cactus shape ahaha it's a cactus mm-hmm but there's more to it yeah it's like something on his head um oh do you think I could fill with this top bit yeah okay so you can put a bit of string in this top bit what to hang it oh is it like a like a boob or an ornament yeah that's cool you have these on your tree yeah so that one well almost too else about a couple points oh

Oh, it doesn't require water That's great, and they won't die when we put them down. That's cool, right? Let's get some more crops gonna need a lot more money for this. I did not mean to do that What else could we buy we could buy some corn? But it dies in summer 9 summer even which seeds take so long, but they're really really cheap Let's try some wheats, and then that's all our money gone for now, but we'll be rolling in the dough very very soon Don't you worry guys gonna be rich? I tell you I'm not sure what else I want to do because I haven't really got anything else to you know Spend how often can I milk this cow because I think I can do it once a day, right?

hey guys how's it going welcome back to another stream slash video where today we are back playing as subnautica where today I have just one main task just one and that is to create the prawn suit you heard me correctly the prawn suit which isn't just some kind of theme park ride operators outfit in a theme park it's an amazing completely beautiful mechanical suit which allows us to walk along the ocean floor at very very low depths so that we can start mining super cool stuff and I need it I need it in my life we researched it in the last episode I can't remember what else we researched in the last episode the Lester's jumped straight in and we're gonna find out so I was disposed to hit stop streaming that would've been a bad idea let's go mainstream and let's head back in so last time we didn't crop this we built ourselves a massive scanner room which is pretty awesome and we have a message okay we should probably do that right now where are we heading where you're heading need to get out of here let's go back to our main base did I take the door off no I didn't that's good I've got this whole like awkward tunnel thing going on as well which I didn't mean to do bare you know it's fine let's go listen to our message first so I'm not sure what its gonna be and here we go guys okay okay this is awkward because I feel like we have already done this we've already been there I think I'm pretty sure we have right first up I need to collect some food desperado actually I have food don't I have food and water what am I talking about I have water all over the place we put some of this stuff back so it's what I gonna do I've completely forgotten I need to need to research what the prawn suit needs I've done some research beforehand this time finally oh yeah the bad oh my goodness like a billion for god this poster I mean let's just bow there we go let's just bow look how beautiful that is I also got the modification station as well Ruby I'm gonna be up Ruby because we actually do need that today we need LED as well we can put silver in here let's take out the there's actually no titanium in here at all let's move that along into here please have space thank goodness we have space right what was I gonna say right let's have a look at the blueprints for the prawn suit the prawns it requires a lot of crazy things but it's gonna be worth it okay I promise you and if you didn't tune in last time what we did is we went on to the Aurora which is the crazy spaceship that crashed us and got us in this mess in the first place so we need to do that right first up we need some place steel ingots and we need some aerogel in some enameled glass diamond and lead we have diamond and lead so it's just the other things we need to craft place steel ingot plasteel ingot whatever it's called is titanium ingots and lithium I think we can make that right now let's give it a go titanium ingots how do I make titanium inga again I've completely forgotten got

wooden earth I am doing got it I was slicing that guy way too much we're stuck in the grab trap now though so we can probably just just chill out hitting him because I feel a little bit bad I want to grab one more so we just need to watch him and pick up another piece of metal let's watch him do this bit is he gonna do it where is it and then we can pick up the metal at the end go on buddy piece of metal not the human flesh you just want the piece of metal I know you you just want the piece of metal okay and then I can grab your teeth or at least one of them it depends on any teeth you have you can't have infinite teeth I guess you could do like a crocodile you never know come here buddy take the metal take it take it I want your teeth I'm gonna grab this while he's distracted what you

perfect I'm out of here thanks for your tooth sir thank you so much what another message as well so interesting thing with the message that we've got earlier I I'm pretty sure we've seen the life pod for already it's really close to the Aurora as it said in the clue of the message so I think we've already been there which is a little bit worrying let's play one two three Aimee moon Steven Yeun even Jedi Knights a load of bull picks and say hi to Tommy hi Tommy big show I'm gonna play more for tonight I certainly am soon anything anywhere rainbow pug lover Dre and sky Oprah make a wish a nice to see you again no problem thank you yes so if you watch my video that's coming out later today I have made the decision that this month's charity is going to be make-a-wish so don't you are your money will go to them okay lots of British people sweet okay so what the other life pods I wish it would take out the ones you've already visited so does it not add them add them to it life pod 717 313 recorded to databank are okay oh it's no it doesn't give you the a precise location it just gives you a just gives you a picture yes see we've seen this one 100 percent we've seen that one already lifepod seven and lifepod six we need to guess where they are live pod six I think we've already done and live pod seven we need to find okay that makes sense that makes sense right let's say I cook up some food and stuff I'm stuck on the roof that's cool let's just make some water just so I've got some cook some food chill out you know amber rich and Braden thank you so much as a fiver Chris TG tdg sorry it bosses code super gaming roblox Animax just sunny sunny sunny our plays and Alex Lee and how are you guys doing right that says I don't actually need any food I only need water let's nom that let's actually make some more water just make as much water as we can just because that seems to be the thing that runs out the quickest and then we can get working on the other things of course something new here yet enamel glass so I just need quartz for that as well can make some titanium out of that which is perfect we just need to go and grab as much metal salvage as we can oh I thought there was some titanium in here there isn't okay no worries that's fine but the boomerang in there got loads of rotten food all over the place right let's collect titanium we've got a few things we need already which is good so I got one two three four five six seven eight we need 12 more titanium which should be fine and then what else do we need aerogel in enameled glass so where's the aerogel aerogel is a gel sack and Ruby we've got two rubies which is Goods just need gel sacks not sure where you get those from but we'll have a look in a second let's go get some titanium shall we before it turns to night time let's go this way we don't have any coordinates to follow right now I feel like the gel sacks are these they look like these this is brain coral no I don't need brain coral get out of here could probably ever cleared up my inventory a bit more but it's okay I just need to find some metal which isn't too hard to find at all so if we need we need four eight twelve I think it's all we need we only need four pieces of metal which is kids that's not so bad at all that should be easy to find there's one down here note that's salt don't need that right now let's go down here whoa whoa I don't know where those things are it's kind of creepy it's like it's something that tries to pull me in still don't know what they are but they are a little bit creepy aren't they there's jellyfish down here I don't want to get lost cuz when I get lost they die you guys know that a lot don't you right it's going to nighttime I should have slept let's at least bring one piece of metal home there some there we go so take this home let's sleep cuz we got our bed now that's what I'm talking about this gives me some opportunity to catch up as well Lyla thank you so much

room honestly quite hard to use I'm not sure why I feel like it's a little bit of guesswork you don't get the coordinates you don't get the directs like the directs position and things let's try it anyway oh my goodness what is it scanning those are the limestone chunks oh so many right I want to stop that I want you to find oh you can just find titania I want to find wreckage what'd you do I

need to make a fabricator in my other base don't I'm I need to actually see what it requires to be fabricated first right if you make something here what is it the scanner don't need to do that right now make some more titanium bangs dope and then we can make the titanium ingots let's see what's going down no problem super game in roblox glowing cats and Lucero lions even thank you right we have our two titanium ingots that's good what else do we need I think we just need the gel sacs I'm pretty sure and then we're good I didn't think we'd be able to do it this fast because we've got diamond we've got LEDs the place steel ingots are we still need to make that don't we and then the enameled glass so place steel is lithium times two we need for lithium put your hands together guys and hope that we have for lithium already or we're going deep-sea diving to find it like lithium silver we have plenty of silver lead and copper come on come on you know you wanted to have loads of lithium yes we've got it so we need four of those and then fabricate those together you know what is the recipe for a fabricator it desperately need one it's in here somewhere oh look all these things scattering upgrades cyclopses as well where is the fabric aid it's titanium golden table coral we scruff one of those straight away I don't have any spare titanium though table karo I'm pretty sure I have there we go and one piece of titanium I'm gonna go and find one more piece of titanium just so I can have a fabricator in the other room it's gonna be way better for us it's gonna make things a lot smoother

I'm not even too sure right this is much better so you'll have to waste time going between places right I'm going back up to the prawn suits place two lingers aerogel is the next one enameled glass enamel glass requires you know glass good job we grab that quartz a second ago let's make glass and then we've got the tooth so we can do that which is perfect I'm so excited enamel glass I can't believe we're actually gonna make this we've got enough power cells as well I think right we've got the glass we also need it's just aerogel gel sack and there's something else the diamond in the lettuce just there it's just the gel sacks that I needs let me just quickly look it up just so I can see you in getting from Joe subnautica jealous like is an edible flora species that can be used to crop aerogels usually found attached to the walls of caves picked up or harvested using a knife okay so let's do that it's exactly as you guys said we just need to find a cave I'm pretty sure there's one close to here it's gonna be around here somewhere I need some water there we go the real Jacob Shane story Matthew O'Meara shower you and your cousins Cameron and Haley hi guys how's it going Sofia gaming super gaming rowlocks again with a 10 thank you so much Emmet McNulty act less human and I'm sure I can do that buddy well look all this metal should probably pick some up just because I've got the space right now you nicked it from me just click on this space right now you're gonna get some copper as well I need some salt just to make some more small water so I'm gonna run out of that soon so when we got the prawn suit we can go deep and I mean super deep apparently you can go I think you can go deeper than 914 hundred when it said its max so that's gonna be amazing to have running out of power do we only spare batteries we do okay we're good we're gonna get stranded I don't know why I'm breaking these though actually need them I need a cave a big old cave none of these are caves so you take some other mushroom biome actually there is a mushroom biome close by let's go in here real quick owl orgies should not done that should not have done that I just went straight into no no no don't die just don't die haha I swam straight into jellyfish that's like rule number one of the oceans surely are you kidding me that was ridiculous Fox Christ Dasha and deer but thank

some gel sets what are these these are nothing they're just mushrooms I'm not sure if I'm supposed to go down here we're about to find out this is something we have not wait is this where the worm's are if you like this is where the worm's are I've got my rebreather on so that's goods I'm not seeing any any things I need down here to be honest a little bit worried I could just die I just need some of your things I'll take the lithium though where are they they must be down here somewhere I'll look this is the volcanic it's a bit more volcanic down here okay this we haven't been down here yet oh wait is that one is that a gel sack that's not a gel sack but I'm gonna grab it anyway it's magnetite okay I'm gonna grab that I'm gonna get rid of salt oh geez I just want this magnetite magnetite there we go let's get out here this place is terrifying this is not where I want it to be I just need to go to a standard cave not a shockingly purple one that could kill me at any time

them at all yet its new one little cave to find them in I've probably been in a lot of caves but haven't actually found them maybe I just haven't really seen what they are what was this it's also nighttime which I again I don't like being around at night just cuz it's so much harder to see this is a cave right gel sex there must be jealous ex around here somewhere why would you do that to me okay there's another one fantastic [Applause] that guy is always angry that's not it's and where are they they didn't make me just smaller than what I'm looking at are they these acid mushrooms no I think I just saw something purple rounds here it's not these I know it's not these that's brain coral man why can I find these so annoying I have jealous ex in my locker oh okay I must have found them already oh there's one that's table coral it looks similar I have gel sacs already how did I miss that I know I missed it because I'm an idiot that's why no way it lags every time I got inside my own house gel sacks I do I have to as well that's actually incredible right Annie that lithium I need the gel sacks as well let's get crafting at guys and girls let's do it smash gaming or watching four years that's crazy cool animations Deer Park then Road Menace and lieutenant tad more how's it going will I play Manuel Samuel again probably not I think I did actually record the rest of it but I just didn't feel like it was that good to be honest with you what am i doing why can't I make the aerogel gel Saxon Ruby I'm gonna Ruby my inventory let's put some of this stuff away Gold I don't need salt cop I don't need and two pieces of leads let's grab the rubies look at that that's amazing we had Ruby - just two rubies and to jail sex that's all we had aerogel boon let's go here we go I think we've got the UM I think we've got it everything we need for the prawn suit we've got now my mom right - aerogel - diamond and two LEDs we've got there that's our first advanced think we've actually crafted let's grab the lead to lead and to dial the doctor we have diamonds we do our man all of that deep-sea diving has paid off massively we're doing it guys we're making big motions big motions I think this is about to happen I'm gonna go and see I'm gonna sleep just so it goes today getting good use out of this bed aren't we amazing green fire vlogs X ALL I'm not sure to say it's all maybe hi how's it going super gaming roblox and the dog family and also Gavin hi at how you guys doing much appreciated that you are here right let's go to the vehicle main hopefully we can craft this bad boy moved here we go prawn suit hopefully we've got enough we do so we build that epic mech suit designed for navigating challenging environments on first let's go I clicked it it's happening it's falling to the floor there it is prawn suits we did it look at this it's like a transformer absolutely amazing let's try this bad boy out shall we no problem so this thing it has thrusters but it's not very good at getting to the surface okay if I thrust it doesn't go up quickly does it like at all oh man that's gonna be rough so what can we do with this thing let's find out let's see we can punch we can punch things we can't mind things I don't think just yet this is awesome so it can only walk along the seabed which is fine that's absolutely fine but don't want to go too deep just in case we lose it right I think you can use one second let me get out of here so I wanted to do no no I'm pressing all the wrong ones ah access upgrades so it has no upgrades at the moment what up grades can we make it's the Cyclops that I want to build actually oh look all these storage modules CMOS solar charger jets upgrades needs nickel titanium crystalline and lithium we have none of those things gas torpedo my goodness this thing's insane the drill su arm would be cool as well I think we have what we need for that we just need more diamonds the Cyclops bridge that's something I really need to find I need this because apparently this is a good thing to drop the the prawn soup I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna look it up one more time so when I looked up before the stream started it says the ponds view has his own beacon as well as his goods it may be wise to use a cyclops to transport the suit as certain biomes such as the blood kelp zone or underwater islands may be difficult for it to get up out of on its own okay it can also be used on lands it uses power cells and can be doctor a cyclops or a moon pool to recharge it comes with a six by four inventory space nice okay we have the prong suit now I'm worried about taking it really low just in case we get it stuck but of course we need to take somewhere right that would be awesome we need to find the psyche lips cyclops bridge blueprint so you should probably just you know get out of here and try try finding stuff let's get rid of that we've got a Power Cell let's get rid of this battery and then we can take the other power cell with us I think it's in here I already have an upgrade do I the Cyclops efficiency module they do I have the upgrade research but I don't actually have it I don't think battery battery battery battery need to go in here there we go let's pop the full battery there I put another Power Cell somewhere I got two Power Cells let's take both of them I just take one that should be fine probably need some more water before we go we already have the Cyclops efficiency module I'm not sure why I've got these things what do you have in here lots of salts I can't remember what you use to make the disinfected water to make bleach Coral tube samples let's go grab some of those I just need to make some food water and then we be on a prawn suit escapade it's gonna be great I promise what is going on why is that not picking up called you I need coral to a pool shell it's got five of those oh oh oh where did you come from hello goodbye these things always attacking me it's founded a giant wreck close to the aurora okay let's head that way that's going our seamoth because I don't want to get I do not want to get eaten by the BAM off when I have the bear my for me talking about I don't want to get eaten by the Leviathan because the prawn suits will get destroyed by that in one shot which I do not want to happen let me just quickly catch up on the super chats where are we where are we all we've

take five with us fire extinguisher I'll take just in case we're gonna take some batteries as well just in case we need those and apart from that I think we're good let's go on an adventure should we

story and your son Liam how's it going Erin tube Brooke gave and get the hate sudeesh chip in the scanner room to see the stuff when your screen okay the emerald menace I'm ready I'm ready haha I did not know you could do that with the scanner room that would be amazing wouldn't it let me just take an exam a special fabricator in this room which is here scanner room HD chips streams data from scanners HUD computer chip and magnetite I can actually make one of those but for now I'm just gonna go on a little journey in the seamoth oh you know what I just make a beacon shouldn't I because I haven't actually done that and I always regret doing not doing it but I can't remember what it's what it needs what it needs it I know it needs copper I'm pretty sure beacon copper and titanium let's do that real quick sorry I keep delaying our little journey but I need to so let's just make this into titanium really quickly Jeremiah says hello neo sadly is great from Justin Thank You flaming poisoned dab for us are you crazy I will not do that ever especially on a live stream right copper ore we didn't have some of that copper and gold looks so similar alright here we go a and Pekin just in case you find something awesome some of ice says what am i doing now I am going to find a partly there is a island behind the aurora we also need to find a big wreckage as well to scan some blueprints because I don't have any right now this is a little bit broken what is going on let's use the repair tool I love you seem off please don't break there we go right let's head in let's do this so we're gonna go towards the Aurora last time we got attacked by the Reaper so the Reaper Leviathan whatever it's called and geez I keep I keep hitting fish I'm so sorry I feel so bad so we're gonna go the other side of the Aurora last time we did this to try and find the entrance we only got down the side of it and got attacked by the Leviathan so that could happen again we survived last time so it's okay I think it's okay in this but I would take the prong suit but I'm pretty sure the piranha suit is way weaker and the Leviathan will just rip it to shreds which obviously I don't want to happen that would be awful but let's see what's down here predominately looking for things I can scan so I need two more blueprints right now but let's just see what we come across hopefully one of those things is not the Leviathan because that would be bad really bad we've got these things as well which I'm not actually sure if they hurt me or not it's going crazy though right let's see what we've got here shall we you got anything to scan I'm gonna get my scanner out metal Salvage I don't need that right now I just need blueprints any more boxes I can take some valuables as well scanning room fragment I don't need those already got one of them is this scanning room fragment he's be careful of the big beast behind me I think he's trying to eat me but he's failing badly which I don't mind I don't mind us all nothing at this wreckage oh geez what was that I need to learn the difference between those big whale things right there and the Leviathans cry they're all a little bit terrifying well there's a giant cave down here look at this that's that's magical should we go down there's something down there let's see what's down there this could be a bad idea but what's this hello what is that a rogue cradle anybody know where that is I'm gonna look that up right now rude rogue cradle subnautica Rouge cradle is a large flora species is purely decorative oh it's only decorative that thing looks way more awesome look at it and it's at the bottom of this thing it looks way more cool than that we got here creature eggs blue creature eggs when he gets purple I got a little bit scared just because it usually means there's more terrifying stuff I probably should be going this deep in because I'm gonna lose myself okay this looks like it's okay oh they look really bright all of a sudden and I've lost my seem off where you at they have the gel sacs on the sides they might do right let's grab the CMOS and get out of here actually is there anything inside this laser cutter we already have that man what are you doing you literally swam into the sea water it's like you know in a pigeon or a bird hit since it's into a window that was that was amazing oh geez I need to catch up on these chats okay that might be everything's all there's like a sea of these whale things totally learn the name of them why this is similar to the place where we got attacked by the Leviathan so while I'm reading super chats you keep it on this okay thank you we have Justin Simms I've already said that one Jack the game and dinosaur again wizard Mehmet dread skull five years

donating it to make a wish for this month which is gonna be crazy can I scan this giant door I don't think I can we get into new territory now though guys because we haven't actually been here yet where is the aurora from here not actually that deep we're in a kind of con desert ii biome where's the aurora it's there oh geez I'm scared I'm worried that we're gonna come across the Leviathan but hey you know what last time we destroyed him well technically we ran away from him either way I'm gonna say that's a good outcome from finding the Leviathan so two things that are behind here apparently a wreckage which I think we just found which is awesome at a massive wreckage oh my goodness look at this thing which actually doesn't have much here oh that's annoying metal salvage what's that what's that oh no no no he's here run run run I knew it was here is he following me yeah I don't know where it is but I'm just going forwards it's like oh jeez I heard it I definitely know the difference between Leviathan and not now whether it go is it protecting that wreckage you saw it right you saw it I'm not going crazy right it's blue you high-five me on the 23rd of October have another one Shh alright the Leviathan is down here guys we need to be super careful why is he protecting that wreckage so much though does it not want us to find out what happens so I'm gonna find out what happens as long as you leave me alone I just want blueprints he was up there apparently there's an Islands beyond this as well which is actually very good for blueprints I'm gonna try and go to the surface a little bit oh man use your gun can you actually I know you can kill Leviathan 'he's there is a way to do it but i don't feel like i'm prepared yeah but apparently as well there's an island behind the aurora there's not one over there there's not one over there let's just keep going forwards these waters are really murky it must be because it's so deep man as well so i thought there was one leviathan but i'm pretty sure we've met two separate ones i'm a hundred percent sure because we met one there's one near the aurora which is right here there's also what the other side near the Krait island that we found there was definitely another one how crazy how crazy deeper these so if we took our province to down here we'd never find it again there's like nothing down here it's all just emptiness but it's like creepy right really creepy the Shelby show GD rainfall pretzel games thank you anything anywhere the giant whales are reef backs yes that is true Blake's youtube adventures you tried British gene it was good glad you enjoyed it buddy I think we just changed biomes like a beautiful blue this is with 2,000 meters away we're in a crater edge let's quickly have a look at that geo local Georgia cool scans of this area show a steep decline in all directions aah what was that what was that what it uh what is that oh my goodness I was reading I was trying to educate myself what what is that Liz that Leviathan I mean it looks like one but it was see-through I just spat all over my chin that shocked me guys I was trying to read it's very very rude of you

Alexander Smith an awesome guy master you guys are legends I need to get out of here this place is insane are you kidding me we got attacked twice it did that time we did loads of damage like 42 damage before it didn't oh my goodness it's so funny that someone donated saying I haven't screamed yet and then you know what I did I screamed bad let me pause it real quick there we go you see this or something out whoo that was insane I am never coming this side of the Aurora ever again so last time if you guys missed it actually I don't want to be this close to it at all because look the the normal red Leviathan comes from here doesn't it get past this straight away so if you missed it in the last video we went inside the ship which was really really cool we got a lot of blueprints lots of awesome stuff in there lots of fire actually as well it's a bit crazy yes so if you want to find out what's inside that big ship then check out the last video I need to make a day time because I am poop in my pants a little bit I did not think that was gonna happen so moral of the story don't go past the Aurora unless you're ready to get attacked by a ghost I mean that's pretty much sums that up right I still need to find some more blueprints though should we go further the other way I just feel like we should go as far as we did just now but the other way and see what's next we haven't been that far yet ground carbine carbine even sorry can you have a shout out there you go buddy you've just received it alright let's drink some water I need some water after that my goodness that was nuts absolutely absolutely nuts if she Daniels you know puppies love you that's awesome thank you well penguin Jordan Schlegel hope you said that right you and your nephew love me thank you so much Tabitha

nightmares about the ghosts of the fire can are you kidding me let's just rub our faces and look really closely at this there we go just rub it on the foreheads keep calm and don't get attacked by ghosts leviathans oh my goodness there we go I'm feeling good now let's sleep no nightmares please the emerald menace how's it going da most amo Savage how are you hope you're doing well right next on the agenda we did the prong suit thing we did the ghost Leviathan thing the next thing is to replace the Power Cell and go the other way and also repair this thing I'm sorry buddy I didn't need to get in I was trying to repair you there we go I'm sorry you got attacked that's the third time you've been attacked now really sorry let's change out this Power Cell there we go right away let's go the other way so where haven't we been yet let's do some discoveries so new underground thing is over there where's our other beacon Cray Island is that way so really the only option we have is in between the two it's really hard to see these beacons can I change the color of them I want to change it to orange ah that's so much better so that way and that way the aurora is that way let's go this way yeah we haven't been that way at all so let's do that that should be fun just want to check I'm going the right way first yeah we're going seem off let's do this let's see what we can find we need some blueprints that's exactly what we need I just I just ran over another fish I'm sorry if you hear those thuds that means I've hit a fish ah fun flicks Channel awesome guy master you'll find out about Minecraft misadventures in today's video at 6 p.m. which is in about 40 minutes don't worry groundcar carbine no problem thanks again for the another for another 10 Jenna Scott's Jayla a happy birthday hope you have a great day and obvious lavage again thank you so much for your kind words guys right we have not been this way yet this is Southwest let's see what we can find hopefully we've had our fair share of ghosts and stuff today but you never know what could happen we could find some more ghosts all there's a fragment down here there's a giant crevice as well you also have a beacon prepared just in case can we have a look or what this is inside bioreactor do we have one of those we do okay that's annoying I thought we found something new then what did you hear that that's some weird kind of music just then right we are in some kind of spiky place why did I just get damaged we've been here yet I don't think we've been here yeah look at these spikes I need to be careful of the sea moths depth that is well they can't go any deeper than 300 otherwise it starts to get crushed which is bad I want to take more damage than I need to I also need to hold on a second let me see if I can do this there's something I can use special equipment is required to collect this resource is it just the prawn suit you can use to do this or is there something else can we use the laser cutter maybe stasis rifle laser cut so let's see if we can do it No what do I use to grab that guys do you know repair tool laser cutter a thermo blade it's not gonna be this is it definitely not okay you know what let's give up we'll do some research on that next time cuz that's so we can actually instead of finding everything one by one we can find things way more often so when we do find something we find like it's like finding a stack and stuff it's much better somebody shot at me oh is that what it was I need the drill okay I'll find the drill plasma diamonds timmi worth ninja jellyfish emerald message menace sorry DJ juggles feel better Sylvia hope you feel better Zelda 64 the yellow zebra wolf caller diamond creeper and star master 10 jellyfish ninja jellyfish thank you for the 30 much appreciated oh my goodness we are going far we can go a bit deeper but we can only go to 300 this is where things get real deep which is where we need the prawn suit but we also need the thing to accompany the prawn suit one of those dots what's on earth of those dots way we have been here those are the fans remember the fans that we found last time not you guys but we found the fans that are like their alien fans really weird I really want to craft the other depth module of this because I really wanted to go deeper cos at the minute we can't really find much else I'm gonna keep going though see if we can find a landmass that would be goods I'm gonna go to the surface real quick see we can find anything this is deep ocean though I just need to finish reading while I was reading when I got attacked by the goes to the vibe then diamond creeper star master wolf caller grants again a hundred thank you so much captain cats dantdm sings a SpongeBob SquarePants team I have not seen that video yet I definitely check that out that'll be amazing any life there's no life around that's all dance the terrain actually run out at some point well can you just keep on going the annihilating iron a lot can you speak the annihilator nineteen madelung coolest name ultimate pickle and their BFF Anika how's it going and Todd Shoob thank you so much for your super chats guys look how blewett's go out here maybe we could read what we were meant to read before the crater edge this data consistent with the theory ah another one why every time I try to read every time this guy doesn't want me to educate myself is it just because we're going so far out oh no don't no no don't don't hurt me I'm trying to go away from you buddy I'm trying to get away from you leave me alone why is that every time that I try to open some kind of literature he tries to attack me insane Ethan rad Kay creeper explosion and I think clash royale I have made a video on castor oil before I just suck at it to be honest diamond creeper in yellow zebra plays how you guys doing that's like our third ghost attack I hate this guy what if I read again Aurora crashed on the edge of a two kilometer by two kilometer volcanic crater it has likely been millennia since an eruption reached the surface encouraging the ecosystem within the crater to flourish the ecology of the trench surrounding the crater supports only two kinds of life microscopic and Leviathan class exploration is ill-advised okay so most of our exploration has to happen on the 2 by 2 kilometer crater oh wait a second oh this is lands we found land we found before it's not this is different more land ok right let's go underneath this thing and then we'll go out the other side and explore this land oh man ok so yeah definitely don't go too far out because the ghost of Athens our thing well I've got another island to explore I don't know if this is the one we explored before I was meant to do this actually you know where the Aurora got shot down or our rescue got shot down actually this must be what you guys meant about the other island being here what's the best way to get up we can get up here why do I always do that there we go I also want to drop a beacon down here so let's do that really quickly I've got one here so let's drop a beacon there we go let's name the beacon put it down I want to name it this one's gonna be called Aurora islands just because it's quite close to the Aurora here we go let's do this let's see what's on this Islands the good thing about the islands is you can scan a lot of stuff you can sometimes find materials the things that you don't really find at all in the in the ocean oh my goodness grant again thank you e gaming x - thank you creeper thank you Zelda 64 weirdo 3 your sister is a two-time a cancer survivor Thank You dantdm a make-a-wish thank you so much I'm so glad that she has survived it twice that is insane so much courage I am in awe of you that's amazing Cheryl Frazier wanita super game in rowlocks and peter mullan thank you thank you so much for all your support guys right actually have we we might have been on this this island actually I feel like we've been down there before do you know what I mean I feel like we've actually been here I don't want to fall down and hurt myself can we climb this kinda no box little shrub I don't know if we can use that for anything I hate it how when you run the the flashlights dips down that's kind of annoying good size that planet it's massive okay they've got crabs here that's fine we can take down the crabs call me yeah I'm gonna slice you Oh slice slice out stings hurt what are we gots I can't tell if we've been here before or not I feel like we followed a waypoint here before but I'm not too sure I'm really not too sure pizza of a moon and I've already said that Jax Turner Sonya Lego Logan diamond creepy you're sick hope you get better soon and little happy little happy how's it going thanks for your donations guys alright what do you got up here we've got giant shiny trees fantastic what else though ah we might have been here before I remember that up there is there a way we can get up there there's can you see it it's like a it's like a base like a land base and I'm pretty sure you can build land bases let's see if we get up there this might be the first island we ever came across we just couldn't wait it yeah it is I recognize this a hundred percent let's try and scan some things we couldn't scan before where's my scanner scatters here that's not what yeah that is why what he needed just want to see mine scan any of this stuff stasis rifle we already have well what's that a bulkhead not even sure what that is but I'm gonna scan it anyway yeah I'm gonna get Cyclops after the prawns - I just need someone put that in chats the bulkhead Doris is already two separate compartments while reinforcing structural integrity the door can be opened enclosed seal off compartments in the event of fire or flooding okay that's pretty is pretty handy what else can we scan I must have missed those from before what is that and we're gonna some getting stuck in all the rocks all right we've got a desk we've done that before nothing else here there's some of these plants I'm gonna pick up some of these Chinese potato okay cool we've got some plants that we can use fantastic I want to try and go up to the top of that mountain really quickly I think we should be able to do it trying to avoid that crab because it's jumping all over the place but I just want to see what's atop this mountain if I can I know it's really hard to climb and it's really tall but I just want to know what's up there there's probably plenty to scan as well I think we can make this as don't have fall off or even better there's a path white I swear I could hear noise then I don't like that okay I think this path is gonna lead us up I hope it turns to daytime in a minute just in case there's nasties around and I am the potential to fall off is high really high well let's well then bulb things that we needed before gel sack on it's not a speckled it's a la pink cap I think we've got some of those back a base here we go we're almost there I'm gonna guess this has a PDA or something in it as well hey we made it sweet I wish it was lighter though we've got some plantings which we've already got we also have yet old upda I think scandal these things actually this is log voice none of these okay so some people try to sustain themselves here just using the flowerbeds here which we already have stand I'm pretty sure and if we do I know what we're doing in the next video we need to go ahead and make flowerbeds and just want to find them on here where is it where is it where is it they go plant pots indoor grow beds is this is a plant pot then I think it is I can't scan those can scan this so I'm gonna scan it look at this how beautiful is this this is where the edge of the crater is over there is another one there's none on all the way over there okay we need to we go down there without dying let's try and go down this bit I didn't realize there was two of them is this a bit we've already seen I don't think it is this is something different I was gonna end the stream ages ago but I'm finding too many cool things and falling down too much I know I forgot by the food going rotten that's bad we're gonna have to go home soon I can eat this but I kind of want it let's see what we can scan down here should not done that this is where I've been before there's like something in the top though what how do I get up there is there a way to get up there easily there's something in there can you see it there's like a PDA or something let's see we got this way maybe so head up here yeah there we go sweet nothing down there and are we've already opened it I do remember this actually yeah I do remember it right next mission get to the top of the next Mountain and see what's inside there I left with this titanium last time oh my goodness it stays there forever that's nuts grant again that's a massive donation buddy hopefully that is your own money

top and then we will stop for today well my mom's got this way okay that's a dead end what that was risky that was really risky okay I'm gonna do it this way instead how else do I get this this up this way oh goodness I'm gonna die on I this is bad I'm gonna do it yes yes all this guy's a parkour master completely the opposite of me look at that he's a champion absolute champion I just need to make sure I do this before I run out of foods I know now it's getting difficult it's a bit too vertical for that one oh man how do I make it up here there's gotta be a pathway I just can't see where it is oh man oh man no no our way on here oh jeez no no okay that didn't take as much damage as I thought I would that was scary there must be a pathway up there surely or a waiter is there a way to build up I'm not really sure the last one seemed like that was a good path but you know what there isn't that it really isn't maybe it's up there cuz there's like a bridge mind you this is where the spell from wasn't it there we go follow the yellow path this yellow path is going down it goes in circles this is not helpful at all this is where I ended up this is where he jumped across but obviously this isn't the way that you should go maybe up there I'm very worried that I will run our food very soon so I probably shouldn't head away you know I'm not sure how to get up there guys at all and you know what I think I need to do some research before the next ones so I'm going to a big fat save and I am unfortunately gonna have to end this stream here I stream for way longer than I

check it out in the description below but if you have let's change our pajamas the most important parts of the game I think today we should go for bear because we met the bear in the last episode we're gonna honor him today let's continue the story because last time we got to the big memory door but I don't think we got through it so let us begin okay here we go the door is opening again and I think this is where we left off last time we're gonna go into our memories we need to collect three more memories then I don't know what happens burglaries let's see what happens excuse me excuse me teddy Oh check out my pajamas guys looking good kind of making some weird pattern right now but hey let's go Teddy I need you come to me Teddy I think me and Teddy are gonna be best friends I did find a little bit freaky before but let's see what happens through the memory hole we've got a shovel I guess we kiddo we grab that we can I'm gonna take this with me too seems okay I'm gonna throw it down it didn't quite work did it can we throw it down there just in case we need it we certainly can let's go a little baby let's do this into the first memory including the locket I'm guessing or we're gonna have to go through a memory that's based on the next item I'm not quite sure but we've arrived in a mineshaft I don't know it's a little bit weird Teddy very very weird hold me hold B I like the xylophone that's pretty cool who thought in this game when it started we were going to end up in a mineshaft because you shouldn't be putting your hands up because you're lying there's no way you would have thought we'd have been here but I am going to assume that we are in like a kid's imagination because this is this is pretty cool I like this a lot and it's obviously not real I mean it could be it could be that kind of freaky game but I want to go on that tire swing I don't think I can reach it but that looks pretty cool guys this bit though looks a little bit terrifying it's kind of steampunk like which is very very strange we're good owl as well hello how are you doing it's kind of setting a bit of an animal theme here do we need to grab it it looks shiny okay yep we're gonna grab it oh it's a roundabout I'm pretty sure it's around about let's go on it yeah Teddy Teddy this is great fun me and you on a roundabout together just make sure you hold me close buddy please and now on to the other side perfect let's hope this two-year-old has played minecraft before because we're gonna need is minecraft skills this diamond pickaxe is diamond hoe absolutely everything it looks like another memory across that bridge oh hey this looks like good you know this reminded me of this one scene inside out and have you guys seen that film because I think it's very similar with the memories and stuff going to the slide this one looks a little bit more treacherous but me and my bear onesie itching my belly button we're going straight down here we go yeah put your arms up is that a cat a bottle way up dish tower you are joking me we've got a catapult we can fling do we get in it we got another owl as well oh we put these on here perfect do we not get to ride the catapult no that would be amazing ahahaha okay so we need four more owls let's see if we can find some I'm gonna play pit as well do we need to find them in here let's see what we can do I don't think we can actually dig with this thing it's a waste of time it's starting to look like some kind of very very creepy Park I'm not sure if I like it but I'm just gonna find the owls and get out of here hopefully that creepy guy from last time doesn't appear how you doing allall I need you oh no no no no no no that's not fair you can't do that to me Teddy Teddy hold me close buddy I told you to hold me close when things get scary can we just get out it slots are you kidding me what am I supposed to do now what is that no leave me alone be careful yeah we should okay we've got an owl we've got a teddy bear and I'm pretty scared now looks like this gate has opened into the even creepier play Park guys I don't know about teddy but you guys need to hold me close to this is this is terrifying I've never been so scared of playgrounds look at this thing what are you supposed to be a llama a sheep either way I'm not riding you buddy haha oh my goodness oh that actually scared the life out of me it hit me square in the face why would you do that I'm crawling for my life I feel like there might be an owl up here nope there is another roundabout but there is an owl on the other side how do we get there we climb over this no maybe I can go up here yeah I can I'm like alright the Indiana Jones of babies Oh another picture as well is this gonna disappear it is that must be some kind of collectible that's pretty cool right ow thank you we need two more okay it's gonna take us back as well perfect what is that what is hanging from there oh oh oh no no height teddy hold me hold me there's footprints those footprints were not here before it's gotta be that creepy guy please no more footballs soccer balls whatever you call them what do I do with this strive to run away these flowers light up as well which makes me feel a little bit better oh maybe I have to hold Teddy when that happens that might be it regardless I need two more hours still oh look there's another door here but I can't open it yet and that's where we need to go to that's a pretty funky looking bridge I like that a lot oh geez don't fall down there there's another picture I got you thank you what is this I thought it was an owl but it's not glowing what is that it's like a weird kind of monster toy that's so hoodoo is so creepy look at its face oh okay what are we going here we got some boxes another shovel and I'm just gonna move these all the way because I am a baby with superhuman strength why is that noise what is that noise why are you breathing so heavy that's a giant owl are you kidding me can I not use that one it's huge no there's another picture inside here though I should probably be looking at the pictures to be honest it looks like there was a like a sad boy on it that in itself is creepy but um that was it was that there before guys I'm freaked out I'm really freaked out I need to just find a small owl oh no that this can't be good can it like at all I'm gonna I'm gonna do it though I need the owls oh crap we're trap which rats why oh dude what someone locked me in I'm just a child a scared little child with a teddy see Minecraft would have been real handy buddy that is a looks like a swing maybe weird not gonna lie yeah me too teddy me too so the owl is precariously perched in the middle of their odds on everything falling down when I grab it pretty high I would say pretty much an 11 out of 10 there's another owl there as well were you there before I don't remember you being there before I'm out of here teddy hold me oh oh no that's what we remember in the first episode we grabbed one of these but it was green this one's not looking so good is it that's all I'm out of here I need one more oh geez no oh I remember this is this is from before isn't it so we can just open this now perfect right let's grab let's get out of here I have three I need one more but I'm sure it's gonna be I guess we haven't been up here yet so let's see if it's up here Oh all the swinging swing please don't swing at me please do not swing at me actually we need it to swing don't we there's an owl in there so we need that to hit the rock off let's see if we can do it let's get on here move the swing and then this should happen here we go let's see what happens yeah buddy did it but this this looks like a coffin like way too way too much like a coffin for my liking I'm gonna take the owl because that's the last hour that we need what is that are we hearing like little shards of memories I think we are what is this picture of I can't tell I'm really

which is when they were just about to put me to bed and now we're in a very very scary house even from up here very scary and looks like there's a tree growing through it so it's obviously very old right let's go into what I am are going to assume is a haunted house with creaky doors and everything Teddy you know what to do buddy that's right why am I here I think we should keep quiet I'm gonna do my best I am a child I'm a two-year-old so I can't really speak so it's fine we are we at Grandma's house we're at Grandma's house she just hasn't moved the trees from our house though we I recognize this it's definitely grandma's right there slipping another creaky door this isn't for the creek yeah very creepy ah yeah grandma needs to do some cleaning definitely this is a very cool house though if my grandma had Al's like this I would be around there all the time memories maybe the next one is behind those roots yeah maybe I don't know what the game looked like before but this is the enhanced edition as I mentioned before the anarch's edition looks beautiful I think you'll agree what do we do with this Oh a puzzle we have to complete a puzzle it looks like it's got a girl and maybe a mum and a forest on it okay let's find some pieces shall we and each get past these roots though they're a little bit um big again I'm gonna employ a very big chair to help me do my job

Oh that's cool. That's really cool! anyway, we have an important mission today, which we didn't manage to do last time, and I think it's in... Is it in this room? I'm not a hundred percent sure. No, no, it's not in this room. HAAAA! Whoa, that flew far! Ah it's in this room of course it is. So we need to look in Sister's diary. Now you guys offered up a few little ideas of how on earth we look in the diary; is it up here? Down here, it's somewhere around here... there it is! Right here, the magical diary holding all the secrets of our sister But we need a key, and I'm pretty sure the key is up there with that big old piranha plant, and you guys offered as I mentioned a few ideas of -oh my goodness!- of how to get this guy to calm down. No, don't bite me! So let's go gather some stuff to try and get this guy to calm down. Now there has been an update to this game and apparently they've added like new objects and stuff. I have- Oh, actually These are definitely new, these right here. Give me give me... there we go, ka pa This, is useless. Get out of here, hehe! Yeah, they've added brand-new objects They keep updating this game all the time to add small new bits, bug fixes, all that kind of stuff New things to find, new things to play with, which is awesome! Right first idea that you guys said was in here, you think you could use this, which is like what looks like a plant repellent. So, let's see if we can go and take this out. I need to know, I desperately need to know what's in that diary... What are her secrets?

Please do consider subscribing to join TeamTDM today for daily videos, and apart from that, Thank you guys so much for watching. Have an amazing day, and I see you all next time! GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODBYE! How am I gonna get my hand back? Subtitled by Gamer Boy Adrian :)))) 
Hey guys, So the other day I tacked on the end of a video me playing a game that I've wanted to play for ages called Sort The Court and it's a game where you become either the king or the queen of a land and then you have to answer yes or no questions from people in your kingdom and they have positive or negative consequences and you know what it was actually pretty fun, you guys enjoyed it too so we are back playing this game. But today i'm hitting new game, I'm confirming that i'm gonna lose all of my existing save, all because I want to be the queen instead. Hit queen and let's begin. Ah, you know what? The queen still looks really upset The king looked really upset last time. So i'm gonna try and get to day six if anything interesting happens in the first six days then I'll let you know I'll see where we get to in six days. Starting off with our first problem, Chester the chest here wants to eat some of our some of our people in exchange for gold. Sure let's go. 100 gold for five lives! *laughs* Monsieur Esprit! He's back! "Good day madam. Do you require any haunting services? For a small price I'll scare some people for you." Umm okay that was a terrible French accent. Yes, I would love for you to scare... Oh. Okay, maybe not, that was - I should have thought about that one, shouldn't I. Why do you want to scare people away? Oh well, I'll do it *laughs* Get outta here. "My lady, a man wishes to settle a dispute. He says he is way cool, but his friends say he is not. Do you think he is cool? Umm... His friends say he's not cool, that's that's pretty bad, if your friends say you aren't cool then you're probably not that cool... I'm not gonna be able to see him before I decide? I'm gonna decide that he is not cool, I'm sorry. "Very well, I shall inform the friend of her correctness." Oh. I feel like I chose the wrong thing there, whoops. Day One is complete, population -6, wealth +98 that's not so bad. Alright the wizard is here, he's just passing through and thought you might like some magic, anything could happen. Care to give it a try? Sure, let's see what happens. Yeah! "Seems like it went very well for you!" See, the queen has got good luck already. I got a lot of stuff then, I'm already rolling in gold, people, and happiness. Wait Day One was complete again? Okay, that actually worked out way better for me. *laughs* The queen has a crazy amount of luck. "Mew. (This cat seems slightly magical. Not sure what it wants, though...)" Now last time we said yes to Pancake, I'm gonna say yes again, hopefully it just stays. Yeah. It just stays. "The chicken is running wild! Should we capture it?" Bok bok, yes, capture it make it stay. Oh wait, "This thing is dangerous..." Did it just kill a person?? Why is there eyeball here? It's just staring at me. Does it want something? The All-Seeing Eye. It might be able to tell my future as my reign as queen. Let's press yes and see what happens? Wait what, no, what is a eye gonna do with a hundred gold? Get out of my sight! Actually I need to get out of your sight because you took my money. There's another cat as well this one's called Boots. Doesn't have the best name in the world, but I'm gonna say yes to patting his belly. Plus one! We've got plus two cats minus 100 gold.I can't believe that eye  just took that money from us! "Eh he he! The spirits are appeased right now, but perhaps we should grant them an offering of gold." The witch is back. Hi witch, how's it going. Uh, should we give them gold? "I know the spirit world always appreciates gold and it might prevent them from haunting us in the future." You know what, I do have... Oh my goodness, 200 gold? You're insane. I can't do 200 gold, I'd rather lose people than gold. Get outta here! "Nothing for now, then. I'll let you know if anything changes with the spirit world." So she can let us know anyway if anything's coming and then we can just run away. Day Two complete. -1, +2, -100. The city's growing, people are happy. You know what, that's fine. We started off pretty well and then got knocked straight down by a stray eyeball. "Could I trouble you for a sandwich?" "Surely the cost of one sandwich is nothing to a great queen like you." Sure. Looks like you're a little bit tubby for your body size, but I'm gonna give you a sandwich anyway. That's fine. *laughs* "I'm excited to eat this." I bet you are buddy, I bet you are. One bite, the whole thing is gonna go in. Hey it's a granny, hey grandma! "Eeeh, hello sweetie. Can I borrow a coin for the newspaper?" Yes, of course you can. Go - get out of here. "Thank you dearie." Bye grandma, see you later! You better be cooking me some some kind of nice tasty meal soon. We're actually meeting loads of people we haven't met in the previous video, so... looks like we're just playing these days as it is. The fisherman. "My boat's too tiny to catch many fish. Can I have some gold to upgrade it? I'll pay you back, I swear..." Does this guy look trustworthy? Does he? He doesn't even have pupils, I'm not sure if I can trust him. Mind you, the queen doesn't have pupils either, um... I have 294 gold. Boats are expensive, right? I'm saying yes. Yeah, a hundred. "Oooh you won't regret this! You'll see!" You know what, I feel like he's pretty trustworthy, look at the shine on his head. It looks like his head's on upside down, if we flip it... it looks - *laughs* Get out of here buddy. You better be giving me some fish later on. Yoo look at this dude, he is absolutely ripped, and look at that dragon tattoo, amazing. "I'm a blacksmith and I'd like to set up shop here. I can pay my own way, "I just need your permission. What do you say?" Absolutely, Go ahead buddy, I'm not gonna argue with you 'cause you will be able to kill me in a punch. He could be able to kill me by flicking me in the forehead. "Haha, yes! I'll show you my incredible skill, you just wait!" Go on, get out here, buddy. *laughs* Oh no it's you, the Duke of Spook! I would like a spooky nickname please. it's always just +1 happiness, you say no, -1 happiness, which I - I don't want. "You can be... The Creep Queen!" Thank you. Weird man. We lost a lot of money again today, this is not going well. But our happiness of population is going up, the city in the background grows as well, which is quite cool so we need to keep an eye on that. "Villagers are complaining about garbage in "the streets. Should we hire workers to clean them up?" I guess... so I'm spending a lot of gold now though. 50 gold isn't so bad. "The villager's noses will thank you, surely." No problem, no problem. Ahh it's the jester boy. "Oooooooo! I wish I could put on a shoooooooow!" *laughs* May you have the funds to do so? Umm... You, you elongate your o's too much, so no, I'm sorry. - 2 okay, that's not so bad. I need to save some gold, I'm sorry - get out of here, buddy. Come back to me in a few days. Ooh look at this. Butler. "My lady, there is a man in the foyer asking to join your guard. He's got an eyepatch, "looks pretty shifty." You know what, if he's got an eyepatch, I'm letting him in. "Should we take a chance on this stranger?" Yeah, sure, he's got an eyepatch. Come on in. Maybe he's a pirate, who knows? Are we actually gonna meet him? "Maybe more swords will help us." Do I not even get to meet my bodyguard?
 Well that's definitely not him, he hasn't got an eyepatch. *laughs* Right, this is the sultan, and I'm pretty sure the business proposition is good, as long as he hasn't changed what his business is. So I'm pressing yes. "I'll bring you details soon." I'm pretty sure it's a caravan and a camel, so, good deal. Ahh, it's the skeleton. "Any mysteries afoot? I could do some snooping for a small fee if you're interested..." I need to save gold right now I'm afraid, so I'm gonna say no, I'm really sorry. "Are you suggesting you know all the secrets of the universe already?" Yes. I do. I'm the queen, look at my face. Population 1, our wealth has gone down again, but we've gained 10 people. That's not so bad. That was a very unproductive day. *laughs* "The people have started a petition to ban pineapples in the city. Should we do it?" Umm? Is this is - this because of the whole 'pineapple on pizza' debate again, is - is that the reason why? I don't think so... Mind you, it'd make the people happy. It's not gonna make the queen happy, but it's gonna make the people happy, so let's do it. Sure. Yeah... why did I use gold? Uh. "The pineapple trade will suffer, but the people demand it." You know, I'm losing gold at a crazy rate right now. Who are you? "Uhhhh, you think you could tell people to stop callin' me 'slimeball'? It's hurting my feelings..." Winston, you have a glorious name so sure. I will. +3, yes! "Thaaanks boooosssssss..." 'Boss'? Do I employ you? Who's next, who's walking through my door? It's you again! Yes, what's my nickname now? Are you just gonna call me the same thing over and over again? Yeah, you are. You know what, it's +1. Get out of here, buddy, I'll see you later. See you tomorrow for another unimaginative nickname. Ooh. "Want me to steal from the rich and give to... you? No, not just the rich, I'll steal from whoever, basically." So this is gonna lose happiness but gain gold. Yes. Let's risk it. Yes, that was a good trade. "They won't even know what hit them." Perfect! So, I can't be blamed if you get caught, then it's your fault. I gained fifty gold. Let's - let's do this. Okay. The wizard's back, he's ready for some magic with his beady red eyes. Uhh, last time it went well, it - ugh. No, I'm not sure what to do. I was just gonna hit yes, but it went so well that it could possibly go so bad. I hitting yes. Come on, come on... Yes! Ha ha! The gamble paid off. We're doing well. Already on Day Five, that is green all over the place, and look how big our city is getting in the background. Hey, it's you! "Would you like to purchase any swords for your guards? A well-protected city is a happy city." ...I could spend some money now, but a lot of swords... sure. 20 gold yes! "I'll have a shipment of swords sent to your barracks." Thanks buddy, see you later. It's the spooky ghost! Oh, it's Monsieur Esprit! I feel like this was bad last time, he wants the same thing... no. Don't - don't do it, please. Oh, that's good. So definitely say no to that, 'cause it has no effects. Umm... Who are you and why are all the people visiting me French? "Bonjour! My name is Madame Abeille, and I've come join your court. Will you have me?" Well... you kind of look like a bee princess. If - if I can imagine or draw a bee princess, this would be what I would draw. You have a lollipop, if I can have your lollipop, then sure, you can stay. It's gonna be fine. "How sweet! I'm sure many wonderful adventures *weird mouth noises* "await us!" *laughs* I can't get these voices right. *laughs* Oh my goodness, look at this handsome dude. Uhh... oh, we've seen him before, yes you can stay! +1, just don't cause trouble, and get out of here. Cut the people's hair! Hey it's Monsieur Esprit! No. I've already told you no today, what have I said? Get out of here! Right, back to where we were before, in pretty much the same position I think, just with more interesting people, including this guy. "It's sliiiiiime day..." I think you made that up, didn't you? Have I got a present? *looks around* No. Bit awkward. Sorry I don't have one for you. Oh no! I'm sorry Winston! No, don't walk away, Winston, no! Oh hey, it's the butler. "That man you hired earlier has gone missing." Oh, no. "Should we send a search party?" I really want to know who he is, just because he had an eyepatch. So yeah, sure, sent send the search party. Go. Go! "We must find him at all costs!" We - we certainly should. Next! Oh. Really? Sure, give me the nickname. It's gonna be the same. There we go. Thank you for the +1. *laughs* Oh my goodness, look at this guy! "Bum bum badum dum dum! "Booooosh! You like my rhythm, brah?" Just because you said 'brah', I'm saying yes, and I think it'll make you happy. *laughs* "Badadadada brap!" *laughs* Get out of here. I said yes because you said 'brah', but you said 'brap'. That would have been a no. So, good job you didn't say that first. "Mhmhm there's a bunch of goblins in the lower quarter. I'll shay then for a few gold coins if you want." Yeah, 'cause otherwise they're gonna run rampant, so yes, please. Okay that's not so bad, 10 in exchange for 4. Oh. Ooh, this happened last time! "The witch is becoming a celebrity, "she's becoming something of a folk hero." Good job, good on you! And she's protecting the city at the same time, which is good. Average day, city is growing, 217 people. The queen is doing much better than the king last time. Oh, look at this fellow. "M'lady! I wish to embark upon a treacherous quest!" I... Do have to pay for it? He doesn't mention payment, so get out of here. "For the kingdom! I shall return to you, lady!" You'd better bring me a dragon that'd be sweet. Oh, it's the thief! "The guards confiscated some gold that I found." "Can I have it back?" No. Get out of here. *laughs* Give me the gold back, you stole it! I sense double standards happening here, uhh... I got her to steal gold before. Just - get out of here and never speak of it again. The sultan's back! "An offer for you, friend. I would purchase a shipment of luxury goods from you, for a fair price!" Uhhh... yes? That can't be bad, right? Okay, he bought people. Oh, no, happiness. 300 gold?! Yeah, why don't people like the sultan though, what have you done? What are those eyes hiding? And - and your chick as well. Ahh, the eye is back! No no no no no, press no, press no - get out of here. -10 happiness? This eye is annoying me! He's corrupting my kingdom one day at a time. Uhh *laughs* "I accidentally ate some folks out front. Can I pay you back with gold?" Well we're not - if you've already eaten them, we're not getting the people back, are we? So just give me the gold please. Thank you. -5 people, he paid more for the people this time, so I forgive you, Chester. For now. Look at that well stat! That is insane. Our happiness needs to grow though, 'cause otherwise we're gonna we're gonna - we're gonna be running a kingdom of yobs. Oh, Sandwich Boy is back! He wants to construct a tavern but he'll need some gold. Yes. Okay, go ahead buddy. You want a couple hundred - sure, you know what, I have it  to spare, I have 700 right now. Take my money and build a tavern for the great people. 3 happiness in exchange for 200 gold, wasn't what I was expecting, but you know what? At least they're happy. Oh jeez, look at this. *laughs* Georgie! "Hey bud, care to flip a coin with me? Heads, I give you a bunch of gold. Tails, I take a bunch of your people's souls." Uh, I'm gonna - I'm gonna risk it, this is - I'm literally the riskiest queen ever. Come on buddy, heads! Heads! Heads! Yes! Haha! I am the richest queen in the seven kingdoms.Get out here, Georgie. "Heh, yeh got me! It's heads, enjoy your gold." Georgie, goodbye, see you later. Oh, it's this dude again. Umm... yes, I'll give you the juggling balls, you - you make people happy for ten gold. Stop elongating your O's, it's - it's creepy, buddy. Just stick to juggling. Oh it's a tiny child! *laughs* "I - I'm Little Timmy! N - nice to meetcha! You - you like some ice cweam?" Sure, Timmy. You sort your voice out, though. I'll have some ice cream. Thanks, buddy! Uhhhh... I don't like that guy, he creeps me out. Oh, Pancake's back! "It's the slightly magical cat from before, does this mean we're friends?" Sure. Sure it does. Bye Pancake, don't eat too many pa -
 pancakes. Another successful day. Oh no, the wizard is back! Do I risk it for a third time? Yes! Yes, yes! Ah! Look at this money! Just, look at it! "A spell of great fortune." Uh, you can come back any time, he is the best magician in the land. "Ahem. Might I get a cup of tea for you, my lady?" Do you even need to ask, butler? Yes! 3 gold for 3 happiness, not so bad. Thank you, see you later, buddy. Ooh. "A petition to bring the circus to town is circulating. It could attract tourists, are you interested?" Yeah, definitely! How much is it gonna cost me? Uhh... nothing, apparently. It's gonna give me gold. Fine, enjoy the circus, people! Oh grandma! I can't even remember your voice. EEEEHHHH Oh yeah, that was it. *laughs* "I was considering opening up a soup shop. Think that's a good idea? I need some gold..." You know what grandma, you didn't bring me any cookies, you didn't bring me nothing, but I'm gonna say yes, just because we're related. And it wasn't too bad. "Very well!" See you later, grandma. I can't be bothered to read the rest of yours. Ooh, look at this. Look at this! "Madam, the city's population is growing steadily. Our records of citizenship indicate that "250 people are now calling the city home! With a bigger city we'll need to maintain even higher happiness in order to keep people satisfied. "Make sure you pay attention to the citizens and their issues to raise happiness! "Anyway, we still have lots of work to do. Let's make this city even bigger!" I agree with you. Let's go. "By the way, remember earlier when I mentioned the Council of Crowns?" I do. "I heard a rumor that one of their members has been searching the land for a new ruler to join them. Perhaps they are aware of your progress. Maybe, so I can be on the Council the Crowns? And the circus is in town bringing joy to all to those who visit. It also happens to bring a nice bit of gold! Not that we need gold, we are rolling in it right now. Day Ten. 20, 20, 357, that's all thanks to the - to the wizard. *laughs* Hello sir. Oh. Ohoho! Ohohoho! Monsieur Mouton! "Citizens from far and wide come to visit my barbershop! Would you like a fresh cut, madam? Free of charge!" Look at my hair. Do you think I need a haircut? Of course. Yes! Thank you! *laughs* "Of course you do! You look dashing!" It didn't change. Think i just got ripped off. Mi - mind you is free it was fine. Ooh! Georgie's back with a flip of a coin, yes, let's go! Yeah! Oh my goodness, I have literally just putting my hand out and money is falling into it, thanks to all these mythical creatures. You can come again, Georgie, with your stacked coin. Do I want you to steal, again? Uh, I said yes last time, I'm gonna say no this time, 'cause I - I don't want to. Laters! Oh, it's slime boy Winston! "Uhhhh, somebody came by and cleeeeeaned up my hooooome. "Are you gonna pay me baaaack for that?" You know what, I didn't get you a present for your birthday, so sure, enjoy it buddy. *laughs* Sandwich boy! "Working conditions for us are unsafe! Will you please spend some gold on improving our ability to work?" Mason, first you take a sandwich off me, now you think you're not safe at work... You - you're quite the demanding little fellow, aren't you. Uhh, sure. I can't let people die, can I? And happiness will go up by 2, not so bad. Just don't ask me for sandwich ever again, buddy. *laughs* Look at this! Our wealth's gone up by 260 thanks to that coin flip, we're doing all right! Look all the money I'm sitting on, it's insane! Oh, Georgie, Georgie. Could we do three in a row? We did three in a row with the magician. Yes. Oh no. Whoops. Uhh... he just took 15 people's souls. Georgie, I'm not gonna be mad at you 'cause it was my choice, but please get out of my castle. Thank you. Ohh... why are you always doing this to me? They want gold and I'm pretty sure it's 200 as well. I can afford it, yeah, sure. You know what, witch. You're annoying me, if I find out these spirits are fake, then you're banished. Forever. Monsieur Esprit! You called me out last time on my castle, and of course it is. +1 happiness! *laughs* I though your monacle would turn around. Oh! Yeah, it's you! *laughs* She accidentally stayed up all night eating candy, can she have some gold to go to the doctor? You're still holding candy in your hands, you haven't learned your lesson, have you? But yes, you can go. How much does it cost, 10? Not so bad. "I never thought I could eat too many sweets." Same, you know what, same. And then my teeth started falling out. Pancake, my magical, magical friend, how's it going? Still says nothing. I think Pancake is secretly a person in disguise, so, mark my words, Pancake will talk at some point. Oh, no. That's a bad day, isn't it? That's a very bad day. Ahh, little builder! You always want sandwiches from me! Can't you make your own? I paid you so much gold and you can't buy your own? I know it makes you happy, so i'm gonna do it. And it's not - it's not that it's not that expensive but come on! He's gonna be coming at me for free sandwiches for life now. Wait, who is this? Petite Souris! *laughs* "There's a mouse! Should we chase it away?" Are you kidding me? It's wearing glasses and reading a book! No, it's staying here. "laughs* It seems happy. Look at it, oh look at that thing! It's so cute! Oh, it's you again. Uh, you want to put on a show, you know what, I said no last time. Yes, have some funds. Make sure people like it though, otherwise you will be in trouble. This could be a - oh, you? Back for another sandwich? He actually is! What is wrong with you? You're so short that if you eat too many of these sandwiches, you will be the widest man in our kingdom. So be careful, I know it makes you happy, so i'm gonna say yes, but if you get fat, don't blame me. You've only got tiny legs, so you won't even be able to walk okay? Yes, the jester's show was loved by the court and put everyone into a happy mood! Good job, buddy. Thank you for that! Uh, happiness is actually really really hard to make go up. It only goes up by tiny amounts, I haven't really seen more than like 10 happiness at a time. But that's Day Thirteen, We did more than double the days last time, we got 1,180 gold in the bank, 282 in our kingdom, and 167 happiness, which isn't so bad.

hey guys how's it going welcome to another episode slash stream of subnautica that's right we're back playing subnautica today because I've been extremely busy over the past few days and I didn't have a time to record this or anything else so I thought you know what let's hang out for a little bit and play some some but you know what I mean subnautica let's play it so I'm just a quick announcement before we start playing I just want to quickly say there because we've got these super charts and stuff up here that super chats and sponsors I just want to make a cool announcement that everything I get any revenue I make through Super chats and sponsors during the livestream portions of this this doesn't apply if you're watching after it was live but if you do make any super chat donations to get a message to me or you make a sponsor towards the channel all of that will be donated to charity so every single month I will tot up all of the all of the revenue from Super chats and sponsored every single month and then we'll choose a charity together to donate it to which should be really cool so I'm really excited about doing that but let's I can't actually remember what I calls this episodes or this stream or whatever but I think I caught it something about being infected because last time as we delve straight back into the game let me get my scanner up in here and press the F key and I'm gonna press F - Mike - pay respects oh look it says on the right hand side keep an eye out for it in fact it's and it says my waterborne bacteria levels are high that's um it's a little bit scary friends it's a little bit scary I'm not gonna lie I think it might have something to do with the the island we went to last time not a hundred percent sure let me do a little recap for you if you haven't seen we put ourself a base last time which I'm so so excited about I'm so proud of it I'm a little bit worried that we have already got that many batteries left like at all I can't remember the key I can never remember the key to change batteries we've only got one and what I really need is a battery recharger which we can find in wreckages and also in three different biomes only one of which we've actually been to so that's what we're gonna do today let's do it Jamie how's it going and Kelly kickin off with some super chats how's it going guys what I want to do actually we've had a few things go on and we've got pretty busy and there's a few life pods that we haven't gone to see yet which I think would be good to try and go there scan some things and hopefully we can get a battery charging some kind of board of I'm kind of bored of making them every time speaking of that though I should probably make one just in case shouldn't I we've got a Power Cell I'm not actually sure if I can use that yet I accidentally made it no let's turn that off please stop I want to make a Oh what's this a creature decoy attracts creatures to its location can be deployed by handle by submarine okay sweet I completely forgot about that what was I just about to do a battery so I need acid mushroom and copper or do I have any copper ore on me right now those are not acid mushrooms actually while we're here why don't we go to our brand-new little pods because why not I'm gonna grab a couple more if I can I'm gonna make two more batteries I know that's annoying but I think we might need two let's see I was supposed to go into there that is not the way to go over here enter the base it even talks to me this is amazing I'm worried we're gonna actually have any copper we have empty batteries I just want to grab the purple tablet things as well and copper copper copper that's gold copper perfect I can actually make two batteries so I'm going to do that and then we're going to go to the life pods to begin a little adventure today which shouldn't take too long whatsoever especially since we are now going to have ourselves some spare batteries which is good right before we go as well I need some water which we can make with salt I think and then actually let me check so don't want to keep on trying to find these guys because they're kind of annoying to find I've got enough food that's good it's just water the kind of drains pretty quickly let's quickly have a look at the bleach salt deposit and a coral tube sample is this coral tube I'm pretty sure it is giant cord let me go we got it we got it already sweet let's just keep on grabbing a couple of these so we can make some water and I'm pretty sure that's what you do right make the bleach we have salt already disinfected water is literally just bleach okay we've actually about you learnt something today already which is good let me just grab some resources then we're gonna go on a big old mission hopefully not die and discover why on earth we are infected I'm a little bit worried about it I'm not gonna lie it's gonna be a little bit weird but hey it's gonna be it's gonna be fine I hope so anyway right salt salt thank you let's make some proper water which we haven't actually done so yet let me catch up on these as well magic guy how's it going Kara's emai how's it going Timmy LP Mexican gamer thank you please no more games of James you know what I just might do that yeah and that's gaming and dab master how's it going guys thanks for your super chat and if you missed the beginning I'm donating all money that I ever get from super chats and sponsorships to charity we'll decide we'll talk up all the money at the end of at the end of the month and then decide on what charity to give it to right did that work I made bleach now I can make disinfected water times two as well per bleach yeah exactly exactly we're gonna make some filtered water anyway that's way better so at least I know how to do that now let's grab this this is plus thirty as well which is pretty cool we have a nutrient block as well which is awesome I need to make some batteries as well so let's do that two battery we're gonna make two of them because we have the torch and we have the I always forget the name of it the Zoomer I saw we're gonna call it for now I mean the see glide we've got some peepers as well I'm gonna keep one of the peepers because they do allow you to they do allow you to get rid of those big scary like I can't remember what they're called like I remember they're called but you know the scary ones with the massive mouths they're kind of like swordfish but with mouths you can get rid of them that way we obviously don't need the rotten fish because that's disgusting so I'm going to put that away I'm gonna put these away as well so we've got enough inventory space one people I don't need let's get out of here escape pod away right what should we go to first this one's the closest so let's go this way first that'd be awesome let's see what we come across that's the thing that I was talking about apparent you can get a peeper out and then they'll just disappear so we'll have to test that theory right so the things we're looking for is the battery charger and I'm pretty sure you can find them in this biome here that's what Wikipedia said anyway so we're gonna have a look a little look-see down here see if we can find the blueprint scan it and hopefully that will work oh wait a second speaking of if we find it down here I'll be absolutely amazed see glide fragments mobile vehicle B fragment we've already got those there's lots of cargo down here actually and another bit okay oh I forgot about those definitely forgot about those those are a bit scary as well apparent you can find them in these bits as well actually with the big Oasis by a reactive fragment yes as quickly scan that whoa okay you can leave me alone though please I just want your bio reactor that's all scans can scan perfect I need one more of those I didn't realize you could find them not in cargo boxes I'm kind of getting distracted already but I didn't realize I was so close to one of these biomes with you let's have a quick look-see shall we and now I read out some donations while we are heading to live pod 13 I just want to see if I can find any more bits I think it would be cool to do what's this there's something over here alright let me go up there's a wreckage it might be a Life pod we've already visited so you know it's gonna be fine right let's go for oh my goodness I've got lots to catch up on I'm gonna have to pause it in a second let me quickly pause it I know it's a bit crazy at beginning of the stream and/or video let's go

where else could we look here we could go I think we've got this already that's metal salvage that's nothing I really need that battery charger guys so badly exciting I can't just keep making batteries I mean I could but it's not really worth it is there anything I can scan in here I think I've tried scanning in places like this before and there's just nothing inside it's more outside Oh actually saying that propulsion Canon is in here let's take that off their hands use the repair tool do I have that on me oh please say I have that on me yes I do perfect let's put that here oh wait

just trying to see if I can find anything else there's another battery charger down there but I don't really use the scanner anymore I already scanned it just want to find I guess the prawn suit is pretty cool just because we need so much and what if occasionally station as well would be handy any new blueprints are amazing I don't really want to miss anything in the ex I don't feel like I'm gonna come back what's in here and I also am a command chair everyone needs a chair a decent share I now need to get out of here before I die it's so weird oh please don't let me drown in here I can't

I thought I was gonna lose all my stuff to be honest with you I really did do you know what this isn't a bad thing because what we can do now is change over to our habitat builder and where is it where is it where is it habitat builder and build ourselves that battery charger real quick it should be here a what are my goodness wiring kit copper wire and titanium we got out come on share as well that's awesome that it was got a bioreactor come compost organic organic matters electronical and an electrical energy I can't even read today guys I told you been a long day all right let's crop this real quick wiring kit copper wire titanium I think the wiring kit is too silver which I don't think we have if we did that'd be amazing are we do we actually do this is beautiful what else do we need let's take a quick look where is it where is it where is it where's the wiring kit to silver we also need copper wire which we might be able to do I think I might have just used my last bits of copper though copper wire is just two copper I just need to find that I definitely have anymore I have titanium though which is good I just need some copper I should be able to find some of that shouldn't be too much of an issue let me go grab some copper and then we'll be fine it's okay we died our first death everyone dies once I guess and you can apply that to that right I don't like all of these beasts oh I just need some copper that's titanium I don't need that but I'm gonna take it just in case right so I need to be wary that if I go inside a wreckage like that there's just the potential that you will just get lost especially since it's hard to explain but all of your directions just go completely out of whack because you can't really figure out what's up what's down we just found some silver that's amazing yeah it's so weird so so weird things are following me it's you go away I hate it when it's night time I wish it was like in Minecraft where you can just sleep and it becomes the next day gotta be so good unfortunately it's not like that and you do you could die at any moment let's go through here I just need one lucky little piece and at the minute I'm not finding it especially if that guy trying to aggress on me the darkness is so terrifying there's nothing in there there was a little cave down here anything in here that I can have okay one of those fantastic I wish I didn't use that when do I did need to use that copper to be honest tonight oh here we go this is the stuff I need this LEDs silver gold okay way better than I actually needed which is a little bit bad I'm gonna grab as much like hang so I have a lot more storage now oh jeez no no no I looked at square the eyes don't need a creature egg oh my goodness all I needed some copper I felt like I had so much copper and then it just went you can build a bed you just need to make it okay that's good to know I just need to I need to research it though do I need to research it first because if so I will find one and I will make it because it's gonna be so much nicer got some bladder fissures well while we're here I can't believe I actually died right I need to exchange this power source okay actually you know I say it's bad that I built the batteries but I needed them 100% right we'll catch up on your donations and stuff in a minute guys don't you worry just concentrating on this right now because I don't want to die but even when I am concentrating I die anyway I think these are actually too good to be copper I need the limestone not the sand actually the limestone is better isn't it need to find the limestone fragments anything up here would be amazing and wasting time doing this here we go silver LEDs we're getting so many good things and I'm not actually looking for it probably shouldn't complain to be honest it's getting to daytime as well perfect around here I'm gonna grab the bladder fish just because I can there we go this is what we need kabbaah yes we need the limestone fragments which are the least rare I need to grab them anyways they're really camouflaged though which is radiation detected as well okay that's not good let's go up let's go up is this why is this why I'm infected is this why I'm infected the way you jump out the water this is crazy I don't know why this is so mad you try and go to the top but it just goes crazy it's called fuzzy as well I think it's to do with that weird green guy over there he's infecting me it's definitely infecting me right it's another wreckage here actually we don't want to on the topic of getting distracted we don't really want to get distracted a lot of bladder fish down here though yeah there we go just when we don't have access to bleach it's over this way there's radiation down there so I can't go that way I do have my radiation cap I don't know if I have it on me though that's a good point but there is radiation down Oh things are not liking me today are they I just need yes these titanium okay that's annoying there's more they're so camouflaged cop I yeah we got it we got it I don't know how far away we are from the home but we got it where are we 200 meters okay that's not so bad this gives me some time to catch up so biggest expert Nick showman reigning love near Jones Charlie says hi hi gonna pick corn epic there we go that's better I got it right this time random Pig demo live am I gonna do any meet up soon maybe just I'll announce it don't you worry if I ever do any Daniel Bob Toth inator Jamie Shella the bunny rabbits interesting name Estonia reactio waddles Elmo's TV gaming yo waddles thank you again SJM grain gaming channel yo what it was again talk suave car car best Bros film advice go to the island go to the indoor grow bed on the ball boat Reese's they give ton of water and food thank you Joey Ryan twice and car car gaming wow that was a lot of people I just want to check they didn't miss anyone no I didn't perfect right so now we can craft what we need let's make our copper wire let's make a wiring kit and let's do this and what else did we needs I think that was it five boom we needs yeah we got it all sweet let's go and make this and it's go and put the batteries in er finally we've got some kind of sustainable power that's actually really good progress amazing progress actually where should we put it though we can put it just here that'll work yo waddles what I'm gonna play with thinknoodles again and tell everyone penguins rule I mean I guess they do I can't really are currently deny that can I am how many batteries do I have I need to put some batteries in here one percent no percent no percent no percent there we go how quick does this work though I'm just looking at it it's actually pretty quick so we should be fine Lord Acura I will look into that game come on epic thank you and be G at 2006 thank you for your kind words right why don't we get distracted with last time I need to go to the Life pod don't I I think we've got enough watering stuff so just head out there let's put this stuff I know I keep going backwards and forwards let's put the valuables back in our lockers just because we need to I know some of this isn't actually valuables but I need to make sure that I've got as little on me as possible to grab a little bit more water maybe some food and then we're gonna go to the life pods if we come across the other thing I will I will go towards it but for now we don't need to right water let's grab some we've got enough water I'm gonna do a cooked bladder fish which I don't think I've actually done yet but I do need to bear in mind that they do run out as well they go a little bit stale they go off a little bit it's gross Cameron norge talk suave thank you guys massively appreciate it let's just drink a little bit of water there we go let's get out of here guys which lifepod will be going towards before I think it was 13 let's go carrying high-priority passengers remains that sounds disgusting good thing about going over to this by the way is that they should have things that we can scan which is awesome so that should be good and we're gonna play for tonight again yes I will if you wait for a video on Saturday I'll explain why I haven't been playing fortnight it's a funny one don't worry I'm infected I know it's not good I don't think it's good anyway I haven't seen anything bad happen yet we did die I don't know if that still means that we're infected but I guess we're about to find out how do I always get lost down here I'm I'm not even going the right way nineteen there we go this way there 175 metres below it should be fine should be anyway TV legend thank you guys rock Smasher when's the next minecraft adventure episode I also have a great announcement for that very very soon stay tuned for that and Shanee is awesome thank you for your donations you guys are awesome right we should also look out for the salvage parts but we we're very closed already with the c glide it doesn't take that long to glide along excuse the pun oh these mushrooms I think these are mushrooms right let's get our maximum amount of oxygen and then we're going to go straight down I don't know if we have any spare batteries but we can also switch them between our torch and our C guides let's go who are these high priority passengers and what were they doing oh is that an alien we've got more aliens look at this it's like a tree underwater are these going to attack us okay okay I think these things are gonna be friendly then there's only one way to find out let's see what's in here we got the abandoned PDA hello space fish I'll just grab you because you I feel sorry for you there's literally nothing here I'm pretty upset actually there's nothing to scan I might as well just scan myself again to see if I'm infected I am awesome there's nothing here there's nothing I can scan can i scan this I like I actually can I can scan the bridge let's take that we need three of them is there anything nearby that we can say well this was disappointing what is this lithium okay I'll definitely take that that's fine oh that's got a steering wheel on it that's interesting these things are also interesting so they're like giant aliens that we haven't discovered yet and we've got a new biome as well so I guess from that all we really learned was well we just got one of the PDAs didn't we all there's some other things down here I'm very aware that I am going to run out of oxygen students let's head to the top let's get out of here well these sessions always very very intense don't you worry we're gonna be fine boy back ningen our training is awesome DJ cheeseburger what an absolute name that is Ashley groom says can I shout out Joshua and Bella hey how's it going and all three of you watch my videos that's awesome Joanne Rupert Tinga beds can be found on the aurora and some bases awesome with a HCMC yes Gordon you are good boy now I am square talk Rock Smasher thank you yo lordy Geordi Games you said something about staring at the same spot of water something weird working a beast and talk to you it sounds pre intense well there's another life pod over there so we've done this life pod there's only one more life pod to do I think we should just go for it anyway it's 1,000 meters this way but I think we should do it just to see what's inside was Connor open for some better things but we didn't really find anything did we at all we've got one PDA which I guess is goods but let's explore the mushroom biome usually pretty rare in the old Minecraft but nothing really interesting is happening here we have some new plants and stuff which is good tree leeches tree mushrooms probably some super weird animals but for now I'm just gonna grab materials like copper which we definitely do need some of and as many blueprints cans as possible look how terrifying eyes if imagine if you were actually doing this in real life it's terrifying enough playing as a game but doing it as real life would be crazy just seeing like the ocean like this with nothing in front of you would be crazy actually crazy rainbow park you can have a shout out thank you for the to much appreciated son Brando as well thank you for the two as well again very much appreciated look at these things I love these things but also kind of weird at the same time it looks like we're exploring a lot of new biomes today and the musical as well thank you so much for the sponsorship and the five greatly appreciated right what are the Reds see I was gonna say red seaweed biomes I don't know the actual names of them if I were going past our ship actually cargo box well we do need this laser cutter we're finding some cool things actually grab that there we go we only need one more of those oh yes there's stuff down here this is deep though Oh time capsule what thank you for purchasing our limited time offer enjoy your brand-new stasis rifle no did you see this guy's we just got a brand new stasis rifle for no reason look at this thing that's sweet so this no way no way this thing's crazy so apparently you can it says freezes physical objects in place does that mean animals and plant life as well if it does that's pretty sweet what's this pi ohm stimulates terror in humans and worried okay we just got free stasis rifle I've absolutely amazed absolutely amazed I can't believe it it's actually crazy right let's go down okay that's that I was like what are these tentacles look this is scary guys really scary talk Sean a devil life I can wear my flower crown at some point don't you worry Adam plus kids love your channel Thank You Bobbi a Pedro and car car oh here we go wait a second there's another wreckage let's not get stuck and die in this one though that'd be fantastic I'm actually kind of terrified I'm not gonna lie to you this is really terrifying I do need to just scan as much as possible I think we have the bioreactor already we do okay it was worth a check what's this moon pool I'll take this as well thank you sir let's just take as much as possible I don't think there's any nasties around here well maybe they just haven't shown themselves yet it could be really scary I think they've got the desk all ready as well actually I'm gonna grab as much salt as possible as well just because I know it makes water now also need to keep in mind that it's gonna take ages to get back up to the roof I scan this I can't that looks kind of interesting lights with 221 meters down guys Oh Power Cell charge yes right I need to do this and then go to the surface then come back my goodness this place is dark I can't see anything I can see the I can hear noises I can see darkness which is scary the infection is the storyline that's awesome Oh another thing that I was meant to do today I was explore the alien base but I think I'm going to do that in the next the next episode slash stream just because I don't think we need to do it today just because we found all this crazy stuff with 1000 meters away from home and there's literally blackness in front of us someone say there's something big down here so I am scary so scared Oh what is I'm attracted to bright lights like a moth what's this open data box vehicle upgrade console nice I will enjoy that very much what we'll have to do after this is see all of the things that we gained where is the door it was a big open beyond here wasn't there there it is there should be some more things we can scan in here the modification station that might be the last one we need actually it is we're smashing it we don't have anything else here that we can scan we've got all the desks which is fine I don't really know what's this bioreactor I car before I've got this yet though I do okay good to know I'm just keeping my ears open because I know anything could destroy me at any time well what's this it's a radio yeah we definitely don't need one of those all right let's head to the surface and then what we're going to do is is this a service I think it's a service I can't even tell gonna head to the surface then dive back down see if we can find the wreckage as well that'll be good huge shout out to Eli was just turn seven happy birthday for whenever that was Henry Byrd will and Bella how's it going Rufus and Tabitha how's it going loving the series I'm glad you're loving it as much as I am Phoebe and Emily I hope I got that right how you guys doing if you're in effect you need to disable the gun okay I'll figure that out definitely oh man you look so scary at night is that why it's so dark because it's nighttime what else who else do we have Diamond Joe no and the musical thank you again Josh Lee please give a shout out to me and my friends Alex and more Winn go to the only base on the island you don't need weapons disease nothing inside just bring your courage okay that's awesome thanks for the tip and the random channel Larkin's how's it going guys right we're gonna go deep down this is probably a terrible idea but we're gonna try it anyway does our mask actually help here it's fine it's absolutely fine okay we're good how do I get in here though how brightnesses this is cool not as terrifying as I thought it would be I'm gonna take the PDA and I think that's all I can do here we just need to listen to the stories of everyone else this took a long time to get down to who I'm gonna grab lithium defo I might be getting a bit greedy here but I'm gonna take the sandstone there's weird stuff down here okay the plants attack I'm out what's the plot just attacked me did you see did you see that the plants just literally savagely attacked me I'm not in the business for that it's a little bit scary don't know why just picked up as well what please say hi to my son Rowan Thank You Darlene II I think that's your name and stalks wild again thank you guys okay this is a good good episodes we've got a lot already oh wait a second what we've just found another island this is interesting we're gonna explore it Aurora rendezvous point on dry lands please don't have anything that can kill me I've actually tried out my rifle yes why kids just kill anything like one I guess that's how it works right okay you guys telling me to look for a certain fruit as well which we have gathered before is it this I don't think it's this oh man I wish I had more beacons with me I should definitely bring more beacons when I go out of I was gonna say out of town but that's definitely not the right right saying to use let's go this way it's getting to daytime as though it is much better let's just look out for aliens I probably should listen to the PDAs as well I kind of want to do that when I get home to dry lands but this is saying dry land as well can I climb this come on no I need to climb it yes yes nope okay you know I don't like parkour in games where comes from subnautica parkour guys I just want to get up this cliff face going let me let me let me how am I even standing on this can we get up here's my tamiya seconds it's playing the music as well and I know the music is usually a good sign there we go nailed it speckled rattler pink cat I'm not too sure what this means so the Aurora rendezvous point I'm guessing that something to do with flight survivors or potential survivors is it down there I think it's down here I'm gonna take a quick dive and see what happens here we go fish executed with perfection isn't gonna be on the other side I knew this was gonna happen oh no it's not it's right here another abandoned PDA this is creepy right let's drink some water and read through these okay right do we have any other way points on our map we do not okay let's listen to these [Music] received emergency transmission from second officer key activity intercepted a transmission from our HQ seems they sent a date package to the Aurora we were intercepted by Leviathan class predator before we could reach the ship consider the co oh man so these guys are two survivors from the Aurora that might be in a bit quiet for you I'm sorry if that was but basically they they wanted to read the aurora but down here it says they were intercepted by a Leviathan class predator you guys been warning me about this guy for a while oh look this is officer Keene again to all Korea if you're reading this then you have followed the automatic distress signal broadcast by the slice pods onboard computer disregard my safety and attempt to reach the designated rendezvous coordinates and they're the nearest landmass okay that's what we should have read first interesting the Aurora's carrying everything needed to build the phase gate mobile vehicle bays bio reactors propulsion cannons cannons what at a cinema there was a zero-g gym my cafe I don't understand how we're here now I don't know why no one's coming for me oh geez everyone's like everyone's gone I'm just quickly reading through these I don't think this has any clues the crew log does so we need to build something called the phase gate which involves mobile vehicle Bay's bio reactors propulsion cannons and it also had a cinema as well so we can watch films sounds good to me what we're here let's see what surrounds it's deep oh look it tells us right there look at it what is this what are those what are those what are they and they might eggs what are these I kind of want to touch them in case they explode you know those sea mines they look exactly like them which admittedly is a little bit terrifying a gel sack okay I'm gonna grab a gel sack because why not I'm gonna grab two of them for good measure okay here we go we've reached the floor this is weird this is very very okay there's an alien down there did you see that I think it was one of those purple guys we should probably get out of here yeah I'm not sure we should be here I need to go back and get some new batteries anyway we're 300 meters below and you need a new power source okay let's quickly this is not good this is not a good place to be all right let's do this perfect we have power all right let's go back to the surface oh my goodness Madison Cates how you doing instinctive plays tap gamer or what's this why are there rocks falling off of it that's weird it's a little bit weird really weird actually you can find a bed in the Aurora thank you the HP gamer Jamie DJ cheeseburger again Jack blocks and the musical ICI gamer is always giving tips about the cure nice so it seems like a load of you guys are talking about going to the Aurora is pretty much what we should do I don't think there's anything worthwhile on this island but it's good to know that this is here which is exactly so our base is over here it's like southwest of our base which is good to know so we need to work that out thanks for the tips by the way guys really really handy snagged ash Nick schoneman demo life again thank you so much find a cuttlefish egg for a pet in the old basis that's cool thank you with a HD MC tres Van Meter Emma musicals again paper plays and wolf boy gaming I think I'm all caught up now it's a lot of people thank you i massively appreciate it so on our way back we should probably see what's going on down here it's more of these weird big blue things the giant egg shaped things oh what's this special equipment is required to gather this resource actually haven't tried out this you probably shouldn't do that look at that what have they done can i fire it at this i wanna only hit the fish yes it works ah okay so my theory about this gun is that you use it to make sure that the the aliens stay still so that you can then scan them and get info on them might not even be correct might just be a way for you to stop people trying to attack you and by people I mean crazy fish and aliens could be not too sure trace back meat or games this is subnautica I always put the game name in the description below mmm you schools you can have a shout outs your mom is gonna kill you thank you please stop if your mom's gonna kill you I don't want that to happen paper plays wolf boys and John Scoob if you don't want to get the seam off do it it'll become your prime you to travel and also the moon hall I need to check if I've gots all the blueprints for the seamoth I've got a few of them let me quickly check I've got enough breath for it Oh heat insulation that's good to know what was I looking for a CMOS CMOS seamoth we need one more for the seamoth so I desperately anymore wreckages like this one let's see what's in here please have seamoth fragments I mean I mean the business was seamoth fragments if anyone's got any that's a beacon fragment I don't need that any other fragments counter sure why not let's make this into the Sims underwater shall we I'm in the business of blueprints and I got some I got what I came for I was gonna see if I can scan this but it's fine I don't need it I just want to find as many wreckages as possible I guess the deep right go the more likelihood there is I'm finding them I probably come across that one before to be fair and whilst overt aware that we haven't actually had any messages for a while which is a little bit strange cui we've already had hot taco 21 thanks for the sponsor yeah Legend all right let's see how much these batteries of charge shall we I guess it depends on how much how are you god look at this yeah they're all charged amazing actually amazing let's put all of this stuff in here silver dime we got some diamond with some lithium as well gel sacks you can actually eat which is a little bit weird this is rotten as well so we probably shouldn't keep that we can now take these batteries out and put in the other ones I'm gonna take this one out how many do you have that are dead one two and this one sweet this is why we had to make the battery charge X is just amazing so amazing so I kind of want to go back towards the irena go back towards that wreckage that we died in just because it had some really cool things in the only problem is I now don't have any way of knowing where it was let's see if we got a beacon look at these oh there's so much stuff loads of prawns two things psych ops bridge is almost done multi-purpose room scanner room moon pool we need one more moon pool scan as well the vehicle upgrade build in the moon pool to upgrade dr. vehicles the bioreactor we actually have as well we don't need just yet station advanced fabricates for motor oh that's interesting we have everything we need for that but a computer chip let's see how much a computer chip is table coral gold and copper wire we should be able to do that let me see if I've got that actually I just want to see what modifications we can make to our current outfit so I think that'll be sweep all these rot as well I didn't realize that was I looking for I was looking for not that none of this either yura night I just realized I highly reactive radioactive material we need sorry this is getting so confusing table coral I can easily find that let's grab some of that shall we oh my guess it just changed I was just about to read some stupid shots and stuff right table cards just grab this thank you now but thank you for the table coral much appreciated but it was literally just near our base I'm gonna take a Gary fish as well cuz why not where's my door no no find my door I need to make this place bigger you know what's cool is the multi-purpose room actually is very very big you can put so much in here it's crazy right computer chip gold and copper wire so we need some copper up in here have you only got one now they'll be worrying if you've only got one we need some gold so we're gonna grab some gold just need one copper let's go see if we can find some venture out into the open I just need the basic lumps of whatever it's called I think it's called limestone I don't think they grow back because I'll see that as stone it'd be nice to find it close by but I'm not a hundred percent like 100% convinced they do come back do a quick scan I thought that was some but it's not oh there could be something through here copper yeah perfect is that the only thing we needs just one copper if it is let's do it let me catch up on these as well hold the stasis rifles get a bigger bubble cool that's very good to know thank you Evie lover Victoria well doing at Qin way welcome back Jeri Laura at Casper Casper sorry I keep butchering these names so I'm reading them so quickly Evie lover I think I've already said Lynn I I hope I got that right this is for seamoth fragments go to the grassy plateaus the red grass biome or the seamoth Bay in the Aurora we need to go to the Aurora don't we need desperately Ellis diamond miner wolf gamer silver Eevee Corey Miller and jet over Zach and Sammy hi guys how's it going I mean he's got a fabricator I'm in the wrong place I could always build another fabricator I probably should do that you see how much one is actually five boom a new fabricator is actually quite expensive so you know what I'm not going to not for now when we built up more materials I wear but for now we don't need it it's gonna be fine I promise you it's gonna be fine build some of your blueprints I'm working on it guys I'm working on it let's grab this so it can make another one right here we go Oh advanced materials that's the aerogel that's cool right let's make a computer chip shall we I know I'm infected I don't know what to do I'm a little bit scared can I shout out Gabrielle's your sister yes I can football explosions there you go I just craft it I think I did what wasn't gonna craft afterwards I can't even remember vehicle upgrade Conroy it wasn't that it wasn't that it was something my blueprints something down here why can't I remember what is this so much here it was the not the bioreactor the modification station but how do I make advanced fabricator for modification of survival equipment but I can't make it here can I make it here laser cutter I probably should get one of those as well do any of you guys know how to make the advanced thing because it won't let me I don't know why wasn't gonna do I need to check this with superbunny materials in here just coral tube a fire extinguisher and some flares don't need those right now do need to drink and eat though there we go we don't want this let's cook some foods Catrina wolf thank you your name is Calvin how's it going Nick why doesn't Jimmy post any videos enjoy it's be honest so she won't be making any for a while maybe we'll feature in some of mine in the future but you never know right let's eat let's not eat the rotten one beautiful ok let's go back to our other pod we don't have any messages again which is kind of weird I kind of expected to have some more messages right here's our little bass Q little bass we're filling up on stuff which is good but also kind of worrying because I feel like we need to use it to build stuff right Power Cell charge we don't actually need one of those yeah the modification station I'm actually quickly look at our modification station subnautica dead gamer is your birthday happy birthday mr. money hickman there are six apples on the tree you take four how many left it's a trick question and they're not - I have no idea let me just see how you make this it's an appliance that can be built inside the Cyclops or a sea-based module and what application station are Gruden's upgrades tools equipment and vehicles okay so why can't I build it now surely I can't I have everything I need I need a diamonds which I have a few of then I also needs titanium and lead lead titanium did they even come across there you go I can build it but it won't I don't know where to find it in here bioreactor vehicle upgrade ladder oh there it is I'm an idiot let's click this and see what happens modification station activate oh there's no power that's annoying right let's do this and we need to build another solar panel then don't we there we go modification station unpowered so I can't use it ok now we need to make solar panels to get more power I think that's what you can do quartz titanium and copper did I just use all my copper what how much was it again to cause to titanium and one copper to titanium and don't think we have copper in here why am I always searching for copper before I do my next video slash stream on this 100% need to find just bulks of copper that's all I seem to need to find here let's just see if we can find one more piece it's not too hard to find it is in the dark though good job our a flashlight please leave me alone I'm on big business here dudes don't bother me these tiny little holes I thought something cool would be in there but it's not it also be sweet to find out how to do the creature eggs as well I will research that I have a lot of researching to do after this after the stream titanium will take it but that's not what I need what is this what is that it's so creepy alright let's head this way go deeper down just to find these little rocks that we need just to find this copper why so many rocks show me the rocks show me the rocks there's one it's need one piece of copper titanium near what are they you would have thought the seabed would about a ton of rocks what's this already got that will pick up the salt as well so we can make some more water looks like we're all good for our needs which is which is great news of course here we go copper again smashed it it's actually really easy to find I'm doing it I'm doing it Jerry Casper rune Energon scooch in way ruining again and Josh Lee to cure the infection go to the place where it says seven out of nine scary things then go to the Lost River and then it will help you there okay I'll keep that in mind don't you worry okay if aquire had these storage bits as well completely forgot there's not really anything in here there's titanium which I will take all right from that there's nori anything here I wasn't supposed to be in this bit actually I was because I need to make a solar panel that must be through the fabricator though there we go into low power electrical energy okay let's see if this works if we have double it should give us double the power I hope so anyway there's only one way to find out can you only put one on maybe you can even put one on oh no wait there we go we did it we did it we did it rune and Chaz rootin for more times amazing and Lord a Kyra you can get the gun on the island you can shout out my friends minecrafting the realm buddies good name good name how's it going yeah there we go look at that power right survival knife upgrades we're here let's do this so we could upgrade a lot of things now and we have a lot of things to be able to do that streamline construction enhances swim speeds considerably nice we can upgrade this already with a battery you know what we could actually do that we don't reuse a survival knife that much though so I'm not sure if that's worth doing I don't really know what does it do cooks and sterilizing small organisms for immediate consumption yes we are doing that I'm doing that right now upgrade our things give me all the things all the technology this fin upgrade we need fins silicon rubber titanium and lithium I can do those as well so I just need silicon and the lithium lithium is in here we have a few bits of lithium and silicon I can't remember because I haven't crafted it for a while can I actually remember creepvine seed clusters I just need two of those let's go grab them look at my new knife oh it's it's amazing that swing it look at this look at it are you looking at it I hope you're looking at it it's incredible I'm excited about that wait you're excited about that it's amazing Eli talk Nick chin way again thank you and ruining again smashing it remember everything made through the live streams of these so not during the videos but during the live streams will be made oh no that's fine what we're doing will be given to charity and will collect everything together at the end of the month and then choose a charity together hopefully we'll have donated decent amounts big amounts actually thanks to you guys to twelve different charities or might repeats them if we can't find twelve different ones but twelve times we'll donate a really cool amount to charity which will be great that means you get awesome livestreams videos and we get to do some good in the world as well which is gonna be amazing right I need to make myself this oh you only need one to make the silicon rubber let's go to upgrade our feeties ruinin Radeon and early 36 ish that's a cool name I like it how you doing thanks for the donations and sponsors alright let's head into here and we should be able to upgrade our feet got powers pretty much max always because we're at night time last time I'm not too sure all right let's take these fins off and we should be able to upgrade them here we go glad I made this Oh how fast is he gonna make me though ultra Clyde fins let's see how quick it makes us in comparison okay not so bad much better actually yeah this is nice I like it I like it a lot right you guys have told me that I need to go to the red field so I can find the seamoth fragments I only need once let's see if we can find let's even find it I just go to the red bits I'm still a little bit confused on my old my bearings but let's see if we can find it they'll be amazing to finish off the stream to find it will be crazy it's definitely wrong way let's go forward and see what happens and also check every box on the way I don't think that's it I just really want to find that big wreckage again you know the one we died in right at the beginning I want to find that again I don't know what it would take to find that again but I want to find that again right there's radiation down here I don't know what that actually does laser cutter we need that there we go sweet oh we got it as well new blueprints synthesized amazing all there's something down there as well I need to switch to my radiation mask wait don't have it what does the radiation actually do it's making me fuzzy at the moment does it make our oxygen go low pretty quick not a hundred percent sure and what it affects us but I'm sure about to find out wait where was that there look right here look at this we close to the Aurora maybe that might be it this is a seamoth fragment is this our last one this might be our last one yes it is boom already did it we don't need this at all you've already got it oh it's health oh no no no no I didn't realize my health was going down let's a popper first-aid kit and get out of here I definitely need to have my mask on me at all times so this way has radiation that must be towards the Aurora because we haven't actually been there yet it sounds like that's where we need to go next the Aurora is is so key do you know why not because it's interesting but because we need a beds let's grab another first aid kit I don't want to be unhealthy Theo I will play for tonight if you stick around for the weekend you'll realize and you'll be informed as to why I haven't been playing for tonight recently German L and EC the radiation kills you yeah I know that now I know that now don't worry things got a little bit crazy for a second what was I gonna do are the seamoth alright let's see what we need I'm guessing it's here right let's use this seamoth let's see what we needs the seamoth requires Power Cell which we've just so happened to already have titanium ingots glass lubricant and LEDs okay I might even be able to craft that right this very moment tenets titanium look ultra strong synthetic construction material let me just remind myself what I needs we need titanium ingots power cell glass lubricant and lead I'm just gonna take a picture of that so I've got it ready to go well I should be able to make that right we have a lot of titanium especially over here so let's do that glass we definitely will have as well a hundred percent because we've got quartz on us already we need ten titanium in three of these maybe I haven't four five six seven eight nine ten okay perfect and lubricants how do I make lubricants creepvine seed cluster okay I need to grab one of those we probably should make a fabricator in our second base now just because it's annoying going backwards and forwards can we connect by the way the escape pod to one of our to one of our structures can we do that that'll be good to know all right let's make some glass because we do need that we need two glass titanium ingot we are gonna craft right now as well Bobby Blitzer hi to you and your sister Asia Jones I think it is as well how's it going laser cutter takes two diamonds cutting to buy suitable for penetrating standard titanium doors we can make that two but I will need to find I think cave sulfur is the only thing I don't have that's interesting we've got so much stuff and I still can't believe look we saved ourselves making a computer chip and finding magnetite not sure if we have it yet because we've got a free stasis rifle that's actually killer it's so good right now I need to get a creepvine cluster so let's go and grab one of those shall we I just lost my page that's all I need and one more one more quartz which I think I already have not here but in the other place I definitely do write creepvine clusters let's grab those then we're making the seamoth the seamoth is happening and I'm excited why can I never remember where the clusters are I need to get a better bearing of where I am I should put beacons literally everywhere because otherwise I'm gonna get lost over and over again here we go next time before recording research everything I kind of like researching with you guys and as well you learn so much just while you're playing the it's just that's just kind of part of subnautica really is it's just so interesting to come across new things because this is one of the only games that's very very good being able to recall reward you just literally blindly going and discovering stuff which is partly why I think everyone loves the game so that's the reason why I don't research because it's kind of fun to discover yourself and you don't know I don't know really what I need to research before an episode so it's fun to learn together I hope you agree EC gamer the Reaper love fire thing eats eat are we eat CMOS that's not good is it that's not good at all so we we definitely need to not go near the Ororo and the seamoth when we create the seamoth now I'd be upsetting to Korea seem often to have an instantly instantly eaten I'd be horrible lubricant I think we have everything now we just need the or we need the other piece of quartz I'm just gonna grab that thank you we could if you could have like hey it might even exist a portable crafting table I died northeast Thank You that's actually really really helpful massively helpful actually right glass let's make this and then we should be able to make ourselves a mighty fine seam off there we go actually where we're going I need to go to the mobile unit I might move this actually all I did perfect I'm gonna move this just over here feel like it's a little bit better a little bit better place near here all right here we go should make the seam op I think we should I'm so excited and I haven't got any leads let's go let's grab that first that's why I put it close because I knew I would have forgotten something we definitely have some look how much lead we've got right seam off is coming I wonder if you need to you can upgrade it with the upgrade modification station I'm pretty sure but I wonder if you need power for it what you need to power it we're about to find out here we go we did it sir knee is right we've created the seam off where is it that's not it is it do we have to grab it from the vehicle Bay one person seeing space vehicle I just created it and it left am i being dumb here seamoth one person seeing space vehicle it is spawn somewhere yeah there it is yo look at this and to the seamoth oh my goodness this is awesome so we have a spanner we have power as well how do we power it up do we have to charge it at some point is that something we need to do we have a light we can turn on and off as well this is amazing we don't really need our c glide anymore do we this is so cool and I'm guessing this is going to be able to protect you from yeah you don't need you don't use oxygen just power this is cool this is so cool I'm excited this is one small leap for me one giant leap for the the seamoth yeah that's what it is right I'm just gonna check how deep it can go oh geez radiation as well that's not good for this is it I'm not good at all I just want to see how deep we can go because at the top I can see it says 200 in yellow letters numbers even I told you I'm tired today guys geez I just need to find a deeper space this is cool though I like him I like it a lot DJ cheeseburger Jackson gamer Jeremy not Shadowhunter and Endor studios nice to see you guys around again I just hit I just crashed my seem off already I'm so glad we have this can i grab things while i minutes that's the only downside I guess I also can't steer it because I'm I'm not very good oops sorry did not mean to do that I did just lose some some health there let's go towards Cray Islands I think I have some fluid on me there we go moaning this is perfect though it's so good it's so fast I'm pretty sure we can upgrade er as well and I'm guessing we can get out and get in as we please which is amazing but let's see how deep it can go before taking damage James Borg thanks for the sponsors nobody massively appreciated here we go let's test this we don't have to worry about oxygen again okay okay okay that's a good indicator okay so 200 is our max I'm gonna go to the modification station because I do believe that we will be able to fix that and upgrade that with the modification station I think they're gonna work together to be able to create that but there's only one way to find out I need to stop bumping into things so I'm breaking it I've already almost 50% destroyed my seamoth also how do i repair the seam off can you guys let me know so I'm gonna need that because of geez those dragons the underwater dragons are coming look how quickly that the meters are going down how do i repair my seam off it'll be great to know it's powered by a Power Cell located on the top of the cab thank you that's massively massively appreciated thank you easy gamer Michael Pattison Jasper the dog and Ally 36 ish I'm the best thank you we've made so much progress today guys again without really having to look up anything apart from the modification station which I didn't actually need to look up I was just not really paying attention but yeah how do i repair this I'm gonna have to find out I love that we have the seamoth I've also seen little previews of the prawn suit as well which sounds amazing and looks amazing as well right I'm gonna Park this just over here there we go Power Cell there we go it's just underneath all the repair tool is that how we do it only one way to find out yeah there we go already got it I didn't want to get in okay cool easy modes we ourselves a seamoth amazing alright let's see how we can upgrade it if we can at all see month upgrades the depth module oh my goodness we need a lot of stuff for that so the seamoth is great the only problem is it takes a lot to be able to make it so for the recipe do we actually need to oh that's the mark - where's the mark 1 how comes we haven't found the mark 1 yet so we have to discover it yeah we do ingredients unknown ok so we need to find that somehow that's pretty interesting I wonder why so you said North East was where I died before right how long are we in well yeah us take a quick trip north east just see what's going down I probably I don't need to go too far just because I don't want to run out of food I don't want to run out of water lucky I got some water here so northeast is where we went where we died this radiation again should have what my radiation - oh no do you see that you just crashed ha ha ha he just crashed the big whale just crashed oh my goodness this actually jumped out the water like a crazy man why is this still radiation something down here is causing radiation I'm not sure what it is so we're not going towards the Aurora at all is killing me though I have one med kit let's see how far we can get okay it's a lot of radiation I need to get out of the radiation pretty quickly come on come on don't do this to me I don't want to die just yet I don't want to die at all because I've already died yeah I've just realized I was looking at the mark - no I don't need to do that yet actually oh jeez I just got out always left it behind I can't leave my new toy vines but should be able to go northeast this way hopefully anyway I should have made another beacon actually what's good is I can do this without losing the without losing oxygen and then I can get back into this and not lose oxygen even more I need 20 to find the prawn soup beacons of copper and titanium they're so easy to make I should have made one just so I can spontaneously put it down if I find something interesting like that wreckage that we died in is it around here oh there's a lightning look at that whoa I haven't seen those before those are pretty intense they're like lightning aliens I just want to see if I can find the wreckage because the wreckage was amazing and there was so much stuff undiscovered in there as well I am worried that this doesn't go any deeper than 200 oh what's that that looks pretty impressive I'm gonna get out real quick this is good so we combine the two together to be able to give ourselves much more oxygen what on earth is this this looks like the alien thing that we had before it's like a ven I can't do anything with it that's crazy though and the seamoth gets its very own waypoint that's perfect is it floating no it's not floating no it's not floating at all and we got our oxygen back let me go back in it perfect so we can actually do some amazing exploring in the seamoth as long as we've got as long as we've got the power to do it we've got one more Power Cell generator blueprint to find then we've got that blueprint unlocked I feel like we're going a long way away right now is that like a volcano it looks like one doesn't it whoa okay calm down calm down oh my goodness what is no what is that is that it is that the Leviathan guys you need you need to tell me if this is the Leviathan right now oh geez oh geez it's going in the floor I'm out of here I'm so out here how far away I'm sixteen hundred meters away I've never been this far before was that it the prawn can go down to 900 meters okay we definitely need to find that what's at it I'm so confused whoa stand Lotter Michael Patterson hey Lieber or 101 vlog at Thomas is 12 tomorrow thank you for your charity suggestion I will keep that in mind don't worry a happy birthday for tomorrow zyphus thank you an 18 the good luck on 18 million we're very very close right now very very close Rory the lion josh Josh Lee if you go to the aurora you can repair the generators which will make the radiation go away okay cool we should to be able to do that Brendon Rocha and 101 vlog nice to meet you guys I guess was that it Reaper it is oh yes it actually was that was mad is there anyone or is there multiple oh geez no not the radiation again is there more than one of them I need to know that thing was mental though oh my goodness hahaha oh this is what I love about this game exactly what I was saying earlier as soon as you discover something else you didn't think you'd be able to make today like the seamoth did not think I'd be able to make that today then you discover something crazy like the Leviathan or the Reaper whatever its called Mads absolutely mad oh where it is he's a wreckage I'm gonna quickly do this now with 600 away which isn't so bad let's quickly see if we can grab anything from here I think this is where we were before seamless fragment we actually need that anymore actually have we done this one before what we've done this one haven't we there's radiation down here as well so I do not want to get involved with okay you know what no let's just go home let's get back to our base that stay safe I need to get my radiation suit I already have one I made it ages ago but I just haven't got it yet there's only one there's four okay that's the Reaper so there's only one Leviathan I didn't realize that was there I am a little bit crazy guys I didn't realize that was gonna be there weird how it went into the the floor though that was it a bit freaky wasn't it what's that glowing thing can you see that there's something glowing what is that is that that's my that's my home right I need to make some water desperately otherwise it will die again for the second time so much has happened we died instantly by finding a crazy wreckage who crafted the seamoth do I know I can save yes you know what good good opinion on that good suggestion otherwise I would have lost everything which we're doing horrible all right let's make some out guys run myself over what do I need to make water again bleach I can't actually member had to make bleach though salt and coral tube let's go get some coral tubes real quick I think they are red I think we've got some but I just want to find some extras and then we'll literally talk about what we've done before that's not that's not it is it oh it's these things I love this knife it's so cool I love they can instantly cook things so if we if we slay a bladder fish we can cook it instantly should we try it we don't actually try it out yet with a peeper come here peeper Peabody peeps I'm gonna slice you slice slice coming up why is it so fast yeah picked up cooked peeper yeah and then we can eat it straight away amazing right let's get some water before we die here we go having had any messages today we've been playing for a long time and we still don't have any messages which is pretty crazy talk the Dimond or community week to DJ cheeseburger chaos a boombox the Lightning alien was a ghost Leviathan okay that's interesting I didn't know that Josh Lee is more TDM coming back not at the moment but possibly in the future and not too sure just yet but I will let you guys know James is 2020 the new Minecraft snapshot is out check it out I certainly will and jamming out thank you for the 5 right guys you know what I think this is a perfect place to wrap up I am gonna save we did loads today I am loving this game so so much it's also the

actually saw that I'd built so much but yeah the hype is real thank you watch I'll see you next time goodbye 
after completing Mario Odyssey there was only one thing I wanted the skeleton Mario costume but it was 9999 coins it took days of playing directing coin after coin but I finally did it yes yes nine thousand eight hundred and seventy seven Mario Odyssey coins and it took so long as you've seen but while I was exploring and to try and find other ways to get coins right at the end of this journey I found this room right here oh and forgive the outfit I think he looks up pretty good but I walked in here and I was greeted by this literally a bank worth of coins let's see what's inside here first there's a moon I'll take it bowser castles treasure vault i mean look at this floor what is browser to get all this money from but i'm hoping that all of these coins will tip us over to 90999 the magic number that we need for that all-important skeleton suit here we go I'm going for it oh my goodness it does it's so close I'm gonna leave some in here you kidding me slowly does it slowly does it is this it so close yes nein nein nein nein nein we did it yeah buddy so now we need to visit the shop another thing I want to do today is to unlock a brand new world so I'm only like 20 moons away let's go back to the Odyssey I need 24 more so after these I literally need just 20 more moons and then I don't know what happens I'm on 230 so when I get to 250 I have no idea what happens and apparently there is also a secret ending when you hit 500 which is mad I've also got myself a lot more stickers what do you think I think it looks pretty cool where is the shop on this level I feel like it's actually oh it's right there we can go here and see if we can grab the scalloped own I am so excited to see what this looks like sir has he got it has he got it has he got it has he scarlet yes yeah all this skeleton costume look we're not sure how this works but it's cool right it definitely is and his theme expensive item in the game which is mad I'm gonna spend 9999 Mario coins you ready done and there they go ah pains me let's change into it and I'll look great in the skeleton suit thank you sir let's see what it looks like I'm actually really looking forward to it oh my goodness whoa that looks insane are you kidding me and what can i pry it from here I need stickers that's a cool set of stickers I'm gonna take those I can't believe how amazing that looks with the Hat as well what other hats do we have that could look better on him look at him oh my goodness I am actually amazed at this and look you can have copies eyes on the scalloped own we could have skeleton on skeleton captain's hat Mario hat what should I choose I quite like the chef's and I think that looks pretty good and there you go the most expensive item in the game purchased and it looks absolutely incredible I did not know the skull did that that's cool oh hey peach what are you doing I forgot you're around here what is on your face are you okay Bowser's Castle I think it's the first time I've been here on my own two feet oh yes you usually get kidnaps but basically in the previous episode if you guys haven't seen it the ending peach just goes off and explores all the worlds you have to kind of find her in each world and this is Bowser's one and she gives you a power moon so give me the moon please she didn't even comment on my new look so I do look a little bit different right I am going to head back to the Odyssey because we need to collect now 19 more moons and see what happens so let's do the world where should we go to I think we should go to Metro Kingdom it has 66 moons available and we've already got like ten of them so we're going we're back and we've lost all of our skins since last time okay so we need to I was gonna say we need to find this but it's literally right here you need to explode these and then launch into the sky explodes and loads more moons are available and it tells you where they are so hopefully we'll be able to find 19 moons pretty quickly there it goes and then they literally are shown on the map which is perfect Oh guys I completely forgot give me two seconds I'll be right back this isn't completely random by the way is completely to do with Mario honestly nananana this is amazing so if you didn't know Nintendo have these things called amiibos which are little figures which I think we used in one of episodes of Mary Odyssey cuz I literally only own one but now I own three more we've got Bowser we've got a peach and we've also got Mario as well and these allow you to have secret abilities and costumes inside the game which is awesome and they're actually pretty hard to get hold on so I'm glad I got all three this is Bowser this is Mario this is peach with a very weird facial expression but anyway though I grab those so I can potentially do another video on this because I'm pretty sure you can put Mario in peaches wedding dress so if you want to see that leave a thumbs up because I definitely do but enough of that let's head into new dong city and grab ourselves amused looks so weird was so amazing right there's a lot of moons around here but we need ourselves how many 19 also I learned this really cool new move check this out you can do like a diving cap thing then you can do it again so you can really like do some crazy parkour nonsense or in the seconds no way you can become the letters that's crazy these are all out of our you can spell Mario haha there we go that's one let's do this I did not realize you could become letters that's cool it looks so weird how are these humans not freaked out like see how much this game can just expand we've completed the story already but there's so much more to explore come on that's got to be a moon is that a moon it's a moon yeah it's no good a few to go though oh wait a second if we go into the hat store we can buy moons can't we like ten at a time maybe not here but you definitely can in Mushroom Kingdom we need any more coins I need to go back to Bowser's Kingdom actually let's do this first I just found another one let's grab all the moons that we can get his bold skeleton Mario oh my gos watch this I could I don't know no I haven't I haven't got my hat on so um yeah I didn't work I was gonna show off then and I completely did the opposite come on come on come on come on come on come on don't disappear yes so close okay change your plan I'm going back to Bowser's so that I can get myself some coins I'll show you the best way to do it because we only needs 1700 coins to be able to buy enough moon to be able to get to the next world I'm guessing it's the next world I'm not too sure it's just telling me that I need more moons I can't actually remember where this Bank is though give me these give me these Oh actually it might be over these slingshots yeah the slingshots are definitely new yeah it's definitely up here see you needed the birds how many coins the left though I hope there's the whole loads or there's not that would be that would be pretty insane but how many do we get we get ourselves 149 that will get us one one moon is also the space rock which is just down here and look out far you can travel using this hat method it's crazy and you can do it again it's mad guys just flew across the whole lands give me this well there are so many moons here on such a small platform okay so the best way to get coins is actually this way so you go down here where you went earlier then down here you need to grab this seed run it all the way down to here and then you can throw it onto this Mound and just climb the Beanstalk as soon as you climb up the Beanstalk there's like a special kind of level that gives you loads of coins just need to do that over and over again and then you'll get many coins we need seventeen hundred's there we go so this minigame will give you so many coins look how many we're gonna have after this it's mad and all you need to do is throw your hat once and then just just jump I guess and if you hit all of them you get so many coins around 310 already hit these last ones as well three hundred and fifty coins I just need to do that till we've got 1,700 and then it sends you back here and rinse and repeat which I found that out before I collected all my coins right I've got a thousand coins I'm just gonna go to the shop and make sure that I can actually buy them because surely you carve by just like 999 moons right excuse me sir I would like to buy your moons yeah look by ten let's do that okay he's just gonna take my money is that all you need to do shopping up Bowser's Castle but surely you can't buy look up maybe it's going up so will you just can't buy that over and over again the right is not gonna tell me that I have enough coins that's mad though we need 17 so we need seven more that is actually one on this platform somewhere if I turn to the left there's one down here Oh sir you'll want to use this shortcut are you sure I just want to get through here there's the moon I can see it right up there and we'll use some parkour skills here we go let's see we can do it y'all that is so cool being able to learn that move is it was it was the but it's my moon buddy Absolutepunk it's right there it's right there how do I grab it how do I grab it grab the birds no can I sneak up on it this is like this is like of hunting the bird so I guess I am bab-oh up all of this for a moon really give me why moon what how do I get bad you know what birds you win this time see you later right let's do this instead there's definitely a moon there wait do I have to land on that I guess I could do that here we go there we go it doesn't like a moon though it is a moon quick quick quick Mario Mario jeez what's wrong with you buddy you took two log Oh Mario come on come on come on come on yes that's six to go there's definitely one in here there it is don't mind if I do thank you okay there's definitely a couple up here so let's use this flower and let's see if we can go on the slingshot here here we go yeah that works that definitely works and I think there's a couple inside here whatever this is oh okay we can overtake these bones they're like they're like friends we're both skeletons guys stop chasing me please okay looks like I need a key but I need to find one and moon tokens as well I'm getting lots of coins cuz I can buy extra moons with every hundred that we get there's the key go on little man let's go we can find the moon tokens on our way back up we've actually scored ourselves a lot of coins and a lot of moons there it is double moon please now let's get out of here without dying there we go perfect right let's grab this one and then we need to grab this one too so we only need I think to find two more we can actually buy one okay here we go let's try this as well there's a moon in there but how do I get there is that literally yet give me that moon okay there's two more moons here but I'm not actually sure what you need to do I'm guessing you need to stack these guys okay yep you definitely do but now what what is this doing it's like a mini boss fight I see all you have to do need to stack these and then get on top of this machine and the way you do that is by this there we go and get some we have to do it three times oh my goodness is like a mini boss fight this thing is insane and I'm just about to die can I just do this I can yeah I did have to do it three times it was just once and there's another one on the other side as well which is it's the music notes actually I need one more moon let's go back to the shop here we go I need one of your beautiful moons please sir yep you can t buy ones you can only buy ten once in each world maybe I'm not too sure that's our seventeen with skull Mario we spend over like over ten thousand coins in one episode and I just ignored what Cappy was saying so let's go back to the Odyssey and let's see what happens cuz I actually have no idea whatsoever seventeen more here are the 17 that you need what happens next because at the end of the game when we completed it he did hint towards there being other worlds and we're halfway towards the 500 that we need to get the true ending which sounds pretty interesting you wanna see is powder I was gonna say please don't just be new products in the shop cuz that would be here we go here we go here we go where we're going to a new place on the moon what the Dark Side of the Moon okay this is interesting here we go into space can we see our new sticker I carve over the new one that we got but look at look at the scale of own Mario he is my favorite Mario so far there we go let's get there let's get there quickly please the dark side rabbits Ridge okay this is a giant carrot on the moon okay how many more does it say we need now yeah 250 so that's how you get the secret actually it's cool too ending not the secret ending you need to work towards that at some point but let's see what this oh my goodness is bunnies everywhere look how many there are and they're all wearing top hats this is this is glorious I'm just gonna dance with it what can we do here how many moons are there 24 and we need to get into that big carat okay let's do this oh we got the zero gravity as well nice which makes this even more powerful right let's go into this giant carats made out of moon rock ahh I don't know what's gonna be in here maybe some of those rabbit bosses I'm not 100% sure but let's have a look I did not expect this at all rabbit Ridge tower first floor oh no they're gonna be like loads of boss fights with these guys I thought I'd dealt with you guys before so why have you stopped the wedding you can't stop me you can't stop any of us come on let's see you try okay so we're gonna have to do it said first floor so I'm guessing you can go up floors and then just keep defeating them we're about to find out guys and we're in zero gravity as well which is interesting so you're just kind of like redo all the boss fights maybe I don't mind that I think they're gonna be easier in zero-gravity as well now we can hear them and destroy them that's that makes it easier stop moving stop moving get out of here okay so it was gonna be easier with zero gravity I think it makes it harder and he has a lot of hats now yeah I'm dead oh you know I should have bought one of those powerup hearts that would have been perfect okay this is it guys this is it I got it this is the end yes these are actually way harder do we get a moon for each one maybe nope definitely no moon and it looks like I'm keeping the same amount of hearts as well so I definitely should have picked up a definition to picked up a six one poor Mario I'm sorry I'm sorry I should've got you more hearts okay so we're heading more up the carrot every single time so I'm guessing we need to fight each wanna get to the top and maybe we'll fight the big fat one again I would like some hearts though please okay maybe not it's just gonna make me do it all in one that is crazy I don't think this one's too bad though you just need to wait until she does what you need are two which is this there we go boom then you sit on a red and now it's gonna send me all the way to the bottom right there's no shop on this land so I'm gonna have to go back and then grab myself a heart and then come back I'm gonna do this oh what's the new clothes actually is it always the doctors outfit okay how many more do we need ten thirty fifty you keep on looking outfits like every multiple of ten almost buy any one of these please thank you okay here we go I'm ready now let's do this okay done it I did lose two lives which is annoying but the main reason is you can't get out of here with the zero gravity you can't get away from him before he does it's a spinning attack very quickly because it's zero gravity but we've done that I've got four lies left if I don't lose a life on the next one I think I'm pretty good cuz I'm guessing there's four of them right round two let's do this I need to not lose any lives on this one okay I lost a life jeez and I missed it as well what's wrong with me no again oh my goodness have you got two lives to be able to complete this one and the next two okay now got less now I've definitely got less I can't believe I've lost so many lives on this one this one's easy dudes you're dead now though please give me more lifes please I think it's the sick one next I actually do and there's no extra lives oh man yeah it's sickness himself and I have one life to be able to do this game this bit is the hard bit when he does the following you I just need to hit him one more time though nope I'm dead yeah okay did the first boss without taking any damage let's do this okay I lost two lives on this one and that's because I didn't realize she hit you when you when you hit her spiked balls and she spins round the spiked balls can still hit you before isn't so bad the stick one is up next which is great so I think you can actually do this guy really really quickly if I didn't do that because you can knock his hat off quite quickly but I'm not gonna rush it because why we'll just make stupid mistakes and not need the help here we go here we go could we do it yes haha right we already lost one HP which isn't so bad now we've got the other guy and then I don't know if after that they're gonna do that big robot one that could be pretty difficult yeah it's this guy I can't actually remember what he does he just kind of throws this at you whoa okay okay I think I just remembered it so you need to do this and then straight on top why can't I do the Zetas TAC though that's weird oh my goodness he is crazy fast look how fast this guy is you kidding me back off dudes oh you can bat him back Wow okay I've lost way too many on this already wow I can't believe that just happened so actually you guys I'm gonna leave this here for now because this is gonna take me way longer than I thought it would so remember guys if you want to see Mario in this beautiful wedding dress where we complete the moon carat thing and in the meantime I'll also work towards 250 or more moons so that we can get the real ending to this game and so we also spent nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine coins on this beautiful skeleton which I think looks amazing

yep today guys we are going to be answering the age-old question the question that is on the edge of everyone's lips can me dantdm or can you you know what I mean can dantdm run his very own Hospital yeah I don't know if I'm gonna be able to by thought I bring you guys along for the journey we're gonna be playing a really old game today that is a massive part of my childhood I used to play this game all the time it came out in 1997 and I've tried to jump through hoops to make this work and it's cold you've actually probably heard of it it's called theme Hospital now I'm gonna switch over to the main screen which looks a little bit weird for now but when we actually get into it it will change that star selves a new game this creepy little doctor will turn up and apparently get dragged away okay this game is very very weird by the way all there's like easy medium and hard I'm gonna go medium because I haven't played in a while I am literally playing this on the smallest little window ever it's literally like this big it's tiny but hopefully you guys are looking at it and is looking good let's press ok let's start there so basically these are the levels right here and when I was younger I never got to number one never like ever got to number one so we have to make our way through all of these different prisons no we're not going to prison this time of running our own Hospital I'm getting confused but we need to run all of these hospitals they all have different kind of emergencies and stuff the first one is a car crash then we've got like helicopters train crash shipwrecks you know over the span of hospitals stuff welcome to your first hospital get the place up and running by placing a reception desk GPS office receptionist and a doctor then wait for some business to come along it's a good idea to build a psychiatry department son hire a doctor with psychiatric qualifications a pharmacy and nurse are also essential for curing your patients watch out for Road cases of bloaty head bloaty head is the funniest thing ever an inflation room will soon sort these out you'll be looking to kill 10 people and make sure your rep doesn't drop below 200 okay let's do that right now so she said he said a reception desk right diagnosis we need a reception desk where is the reception desk psychiatric ward pharmacy we don't need a ward yet gp's office we do need a GPS office ah here we go reception desk that's by one of those let's buy some benches as well because we need benches and we're gonna put them somewhere I am gonna put I'm gonna do like one two three and then one two three just like that and the reception desk can go right here beautiful I must employ a receptionist okay what receptionist have we got think they're here we've got you crab Alton is pretty good so we got to look at the ability hopefully it's actually what is that what does that mean hopefully that means she's goods plays theme-park lot very friendly and enjoys a laugh tea Waterson she looks the best so far oh she's good enjoy his fart surfing generally well motivated and dedicated that is hilarious I think fart surfer she's coming in actually she's 96 she's 86 I'm sorry fart surfing is great but I think I'm gonna go for you yeah I'm gonna go for you higher person gon get behind your reception desk you've got this right we need a our hospital opens and like whatever half of that clock is we need a GPS office as well we need to make the size big enough so when it's blue it means it's big enough and then we need to put the doors on the doors gonna be here gonna put a window there but not too many windows because as a patient you don't want people peeking in do you that'd be horrible right let's get the desk here let's get the filing cabinet over here and a chair awkwardly here is there anything else we can buy and pretty shortly can buy radiators a bin and a fire extinguisher we need safety up in here fire extinguishing go in the corner radiator here Binh I guess can just go here that's fine boom right I need a doctor now okay this is going well this is actually going well so far he makes ice sculptures little crabbing toneau ver here there's also ones that can be have certain qualifications and stuff as well who's the best guy Oh 173 enjoys french art house films careful and dependable in emergency work you're hired buddy how much money have I got I heard you got loads of money this is perfect our hospital isn't actually open yet I was like where are all the patients but there's none here it's okay psychiatry psychiatric I'm not even sure how to say that we need to build one of these as well let's put a window in here too I didn't want the window there but that's fine I can't change it right a screen because obviously you don't want people seeing you when you change in the couch can only rotate this way and the comfortable chair can only go here can I pick this up there we go let's move this actually that looks fine there we always have to remember what Oh we're open are we're not open okay that was the reception is talking right bookcase we're gonna grab a skeleton and a radiator as well let's put the radiator up here the bookcase is gonna go here in the scallop oh look at him he's looking magical we're gonna put him there tick right now we need to hire a doctor that has got a psychiatry degree there he is plays classical violin he's very hard-working that's actually that's lucky really really lucky I'm the best doctor ever thank you it's only just started though because otherwise we could be in big trouble let's also grab a drinks machine cuz that's the best thing ever it's got KitKat on it not sponsored wait I bought two whoops let's put one there at you can I move that I want to move this there we go what else can we buy more benches fire extinguisher we should probably get some radiators around you satisfied the financial criteria for this level Nokia balance about a thousand while making sure your hospital is running efficiently okay that's good I think we're gonna be fine so basically you have to keep on moving through the levels and as you go through the levels you start new hospitals with new bigger and better things it's very very cool it's called theme hospital is the face care in the way that I think that's the best place that I can put it we'll see we'll see I'll make sure I'm not placing things in the way I'll make sure it's over here my FaceCam eval sync it should be okay should be I haven't changed any settings look at this guy this guy's invisible look at him he's feeling pretty sick his temperatures not so well he's not that thirsty and he's feeling all right that's awesome why is he invisible though and where it where is he going you need to wait buddy you need to wait and who's this okay we've got a few people what are you waiting for what's this question mark your team has had to guess a patient's condition there's a 99% chance that it's invisibility which apparently apparently is a condition okay if you build a pharmacy and put me in nurse you can succeed what you want to do ah let's get her to or him we don't know they're invisible get patient to wait in a hospital then we can buy ourselves a pharmacy there we go let's bring this up here I don't think the pharmacy needs to be that big at all let's put a door put a classic window in here as well window thank you and literally just that that's amazing radiator because otherwise people are gonna get cold there we go what does that say tick I need a nurse really quickly does she need to be a certain person I'm gonna do this and click this your team has discovered a new condition it's called TV personalities cause daytime television symptoms delusions are being able to present a cookery show a trained psychiatrist what was that must convince the patient to sell their TV and buy a radio that's fine patients have enough seating now perfect your team as discovered a new ono thus quits eating pizza pan under the cooker that's disgusting I think those cheers are every time you cure a patient I'm pretty sure we're good all right yet over $400 for that and this guy is having a great comfy time it's absolutely loving it 208 this guy should actually they should get cured now are they gonna become onion they're gonna happen oh oh please be cured yes that's hilarious oh my goodness cure another six patients and we'll have enough to win the level I think we're actually pretty good right now we don't need to build anything else we just get this done we're rolling in the money five patients cured so far where can we get the stats that's money we've had no deaths which is great cures one visitors seven how we only cured one but have seven visitors how is that possible oh no what's this so Reginald crumblies expressed a wish to visit your hospital issue an official invitation to the VIP oh yeah let's do that come on in buddy look at this beautiful Hospital it's absolutely beautiful so are the kids is very bloaty head look at him oh man he's got a giant face we kids I don't know I feel like we did right people started littering your Hospital what I are a handyman okay let's get a handyman there we go sounds all right get to handyman this game is called theme Hospital guys it's like a really old game but it's so much fun got another condition I think it's blow to your heads I need to build more diagnosis rooms yeah let me do that diagnosis general diagnosis I think I don't think I've got one of these yet let's do this bring that in a little bit and we're gonna sit and busy already now I already know what it's like to run a hospital scream crash trolley we also need a radiator because otherwise people are gonna get cold and then we also need another doctor come on who's the best who's the best and guess three patients and we cure the level let's just do this God buddy get your bloated head sorted out it's fine we exhausted all of our diagnoses used on this patient was still not sure what was wrong and there's a 63% chance that we have identified what type of invisibility this patient has so we can either send him home or try a cure take a chance know the VIPs in need to keep everything running smoothly to please him I'm sure we'll be fine absolutely fine for you this is a new game yeah I don't even think they've like remade this game which they definitely should do excuse me sir what are you doing what are you doing here is there a way we can find out what we needs the hospital policy got this I'm just trying to see what we've got I think that's research so reputation we've already earned $1,700 okay this is this is deeper than I've ever gone into this game before what have we got your team has discovered a new condition bloaty heads perfect oh do I not have oh I need an inflation room I was confused and I was like I'm sure it just built that clinics inflation let's buy it I don't I'm not even looking at how much it costs I'm just doing it for the patient's door/window literally inflator right here radiator it's getting busy already my goodness telegram after visiting your hospital ah yes I got 2 grand $2,000 that's amazing yeah this game is old it's 17 years old how crazy is that but another one is long the team discovered a new nose growth there's not read that it's a little bit disgusting I think we're doing pretty well though look at this blue tea guy he's gonna get his head popped ready it's gonna happen it's definitely gonna happen actually that's in this room when he gets his clothes back on he's gonna be referred to this room and then he will start getting pots please it's gonna be hilarious you coming in no where you going but where you going but uncommon cold discovery as well you need to increase your hospital value to 55,000 how do I find out my hospital value though ah here no not here I don't know what else we need to build on when you're in money out balance is his death reputation we've cured eight that's good I think we've done that we've done the goal already there's also there's also other people that are making hospitals as well that are like our competition but I think we've completed the level I think we've done it did dantdm congratulations with the ministry are impressed by your hospital running abilities you are certainly a golden boy in the health department that's fantastic we think you'd prefer a slightly tougher job though you'd paid a salary of ten thousand seven hundred dollars the decision up to you are you interested in moving hospitals yes let's move along the game boards let's do this looks like this is a car crash which sounds a little bit crazy but don't worry that's why we're here there's a greater variety of ailments in this area set up your Hospital to deal with more patients and plan to build a research department keep it clean keep it reputation high and we've got new disease like slack tongue which means you've got a massive tongue and oh my goodness aim for a reputation of 300 bank balance of ten thousand and forty at people cured if we can do this so we can't have to start again but as you move up through the hospitals it's it doesn't really matter too much can you make much more progress especially since I'm gonna get used to it and stuff right desk filing cabinet share radiator boom we also need ourselves a reception desk let's go for eight benches for now and we're gonna put the benches one two three four five one two three oh oh I thought I had 10 that's hilarious let's put that there let's grab some more chairs or benches even there we go what else do we need me to hire two people so we need a receptionist and doctor oh look he's got he's a researcher as well that's good for this guy I like him it's also grad there's only one receptionist luckily she's pretty good what else do we need to buy we need to buy a general diagnosis place this is stressing me out already who knew running a hospital will be so hard I need to remember like all the things otherwise I'm gonna be in trouble they'll be able to cure my patient Sam I hopefully i'll never have to use the crash trolley that'd be awful yeah I wanted that they're right radiators up next perfect what else do we need what do we have in the previous one we had a pharmacy let's do that the pharmacy it only needs to be little yeah I was gonna say do we need a window if the nurse is gonna work in there for ages then we definitely do need a window radiator we definitely needs we have a go tick all right let's employ a nurse who's the lucky person she plays classical violin boom let's go what else wouldn't even need a janitor as well he's alright he's got a mustache I like him so we also need to grab some drinks machines just buy two of those couple radiators and I think that's it you put his drinks machine here let's put another one here for now and some radiators there we go where can you find this game I'm not sure you know I got this from origin when it was on offer at one point right what else do I need I definitely needs a inflation room we got to see how big we can make this what you can make it that small we want people to be able to see the inflation happening oh yes you only need one of those don't you all right that's radiator there we go tick oh man we need some more we've got like a quarter of the clock left um slight higher trick yeah when you're one of those like yeah trick I don't know I keep calling it the wrong thing pasted off face the window let's put a screen up I can't rotate the screen for some reason share here sure here radiator has to have a skeleton as well oh no we got vermin I remember you you could get rats in this game which is a little bit scary I need to hire another doctor as well Wow look at him he's well-qualified go go buddy do what you want to do I'm gonna get some bins as well oh you can't get bins here great a hospital is just about to open and also we can buy different sections of this that costs 12,000 this one costs 5 I think we should be able to do that we can change our heating as well I want to buy the top one just so we can put some research in their facilities yeah research department so we should be able to go up here now yeah beautiful all right let's make this here because then we can research new diseases and stuff I think that's what it's for anyway oh my goodness look at this that's huge how am I supposed to fit all this in there we go uh yeah that thing's massive oh my goodness why would that even I even do it looks like it can do a whole operation by itself doctors able to research bear the symbol that they need he is not a researcher he's a psychiatrist do we have a research I feel like we do maybe we don't that's bad you know researcher there's no research is available no that's bad I think we've got enough though do we need anything else I think I guess we just wait who's picking up pick up the trash janitor what are you doing you need to pick up the trash please I'll put you right there oh lucky you can change the exam with priority that's cool we just need to wait for the questions to roll in what we haven't built yet is a ward a staff room or toilets would help wouldn't they we do need toilets put them right here just in case because we don't want anyone going on the floor especially in a special ice ball I don't know why this sound is so bad let's buy another toilet another two toilets in another sink I had saw it all you can only rotate them one way there you go toilet for everyone enjoy enjoy what else we got your team discovered a new condition guts rod oh that's disgusting symptoms no coffee but stomach no stomach wall lying on earth alone doctors already we already got bloaty head we re researched again we've already satisfied the cry little can't even speak the financial criteria which is good uncommon cold we've discovered again we cured our first patient which is amazing I'm so glad I feel like we're doing all right wait there's a mouse right there you see it let's this is a little trick that I learned from you playing the game before you can put the plant down and then you can move it pick it up there we go because the mouse has gone now you just like properly fill in the hole of the mouse it's amazing and we're doing all right you know no complaints we're curing people left and right we got happiness all around as well we can up people's wages we can see if they're tired we could build a staff room if we wanted to but I don't think we need to right now we don't 5 that's great I want to see you might status what's this this is happiness it's cold people are saying it's cold scrab small radiator shall we air one ear and then we can also view this we can change the heat's that'd be fine I don't wanna go bankrupt though that'd be awful oh I've got a VIP visit a premiership footballer okay come here buddy I think you enjoy our Hospital definitely I'm just checking what else is going around it's really hard to control we need a researcher I didn't realize there are no researchers is there any available now it's only the light bulb there he is it has a bad attitude though lazy and body motivated these researchers are punks absolute punks I think I'm gonna get one anyway you know what this is do it wait I'm over here get researching buddy research whatever you need I think that yeah this is the research so you can change the percentage of what you would like to to research the most I think your equipment should be quite um you should get the cure equipment up more and more emphasis on that drug research improvements know what that's fine carry on and every time it cheers that means that we've cured a patient with your place got a window for the toilet yeah I did actually Cherie I can't even take it out that's awful looks similar to the Sims it's actually made by made by the same people I feel like it might be I know what's wrong with him is he cold you can't be cold surely see what people are saying they're still saying it's cold they've got enough or what's this I'll here's the wind criteria so we need to cure 40 people we've completed this already right yeah we just need to do 5,000 more spending and cure 32 more people we've got this let's not kill anyone though because that would be terrible that'll be really terrible three cores on the way to winning the level there's another invisibility guy right here as well and there's also when you get through more of the hospitals you get you get emergencies come in so you got lots of people coming in at the same time it's crazy you actually bought everything we can we could do a staff room I guess I don't want to spend too much money though you know what let's do it I'm pretty sure the staff room can have like a pool table a TV all that kind of nonsense there we go we just satisfy the criteria for it yeah here we go look pool table TV a pawn exciting things for the TV here it's an old school that's how you know how old this game is look at the TV it's really really old they go staff room VIP he doesn't like a premiership footballer does he I mean I'm not one to judge but he doesn't really look like one at all did I just see an invisible man you certain he did where's he gone hopefully he's been cured there he is look it has changed just change from visible in with Rita visible good job buddy no it was not when to click about one man click this how many of you we've cured 12 I think we've done the financial criteria we just need to cure people the employees have been enhanced as well so our research was doing well what does uh Premiership football I think he doesn't know like doesn't it like he's in the right shape to be a premiership footballer to be honest does he not sure it's the right outfit either can you play can you play footballer in a in the top hat I don't know but this guy is gonna try I don't you can see the queue size as well that's cool make your bigger and smaller I didn't know that right what's this question you tema discovered a new condition slack tongue you cannot cure this oh no I can't cure it I don't even have I don't have a slack tongue in it I need him to research it right buddy come here I need you to research this we need cure equipment yeah definitely he's almost there I think I just saw it move down to ten on this and up this to 40 and they should research it in time I think we're doing okay I thought we spent loads but we didn't and I've just caught the caretaker slacking off what you're doing it's playing some pole that's what it's there for I guess that's what it's there for where's a premiership footballer do I need to answer that question just a person who plays football uh-oh Premiership I guess if you're not in the UK you don't really know yes what the slice has been pretty recessed who should have to fit this in up here I think so anyway oh no he only gave us 400 pounds get out of here get out of here the person I had before gave us two grand wait here wait here treatment where's the tongue there is pause I was worried it was going to be big enough then oh please it literally just cuts their tongue on that's horrific but kind of needed you know sleeping illness an overactive sleep glands gives people the desire to crush our anywhere oh geez oh hello sir I didn't know you could get loans and stuff I don't trust this guy though definitely not get out of here have you got enough doctors we've got no wait times no queue this is amazing 21 visitors slicer has already been enhanced as well we just need to kill some more people it's far too cold really oh I guess in that building it is let's grab our let's grab some more room only before your machine has started citerior 8 as well that's not good is it can they just save themselves until I actually complete the level that'll be great am I going to do more hat in time yes I am I've got a stream plan for hopefully the weekend hopefully anyway I see open I've ever did you see it it was the opener member if you know you know if like we need more bins but you can't buy just straight up buy bins the way plants and stuff but that's it I mean I'm worried what's this bank balance must be 10,000 yeah my bank balances go in it go in south guys a bit worried about were three doctors and I don't think three doctors is too much because we need ones that have particular skills one researcher one psychiatric one that's just mean I just need to wait for the money to roll in you got this buddy and we haven't cured anyone yet which is great that would be awful if you lose this will certainly be a video if you're watching afterwards hi how's it going it's by tapping away it's having a great time researching making sure everything's going all right this guy's slacking off watching the TV it's not exactly what I wanted from you they're still thinking it's cold ones gonna blast this there we go all that cost too much no let's do that why do people so think it's cold there's so many radiators in here it's unreal build more drinks machines get this these guys are so so needy I've got two drinks machines already let's board on up here there we go I can't spend any more money because I need I need 10 in each 10,000 guys pass the level I'm actually worried is the game free it was when I downloaded it I don't know if it's free now you might have to pay for it not too much folks it's so old how do you think I'm doing though guys do you think I'm doing good I think I'm doing all right apart from the money situation but hey you know what you have to spend money to make money money and I want to take all of these off money outs yeah we're we're going low I need to go back up because we've lost almost half doing all right though this person is drinking having a great time oh where are we we're number one yeah we're number one why is it put it upside down wouldn't number one minute stop that's random random charts as well I think we're doing all right though oh where did that money come from I'm not complaining but does anyone see that I done from 6000 620 1000 I didn't know that all we need more benches okay let's grab them it's 6:00 let's put them outside their rooms just so people don't have to wait there we go outside the toilets why not one there and one there now people shouldn't have to sit down yeah people are warm for once how many have we cured so far 21 well over halfway there we've got invisible man over here so you definitely no you definitely know what's going on you don't really need to you know you don't reuse a diagnose and Invisible Man pretty obvious what is conditioning you know poor guy you can see the individual queues of places as well so something's too busy you'll know about it why is that so annoying that sound is so annoying I'm number one number one so far buddy so far I don't need to do anything possum great we got money in the bank we've got patients being fyords these drink machines aren't really even getting used which is mad I don't you can see how many times the benches use this is the world's

come on come on come on you got this today I think is it for our for the maximum bonus so if you only hear some of them you get a partial bonus that's good to know welcome you got slack tongue up wait please Oh send him to the research department I didn't realize we could do that so we can make sure that research is the research is boosted if you send someone that way big tongue is going in here is he gonna be scanning no way that's amazing my guy just laid down as are sucked into that machine that's amazing I think he's gonna be alright 49 more patients we've won this level as well we're doing well it's our third Hospital third need to increase our value to 80,000 large rooms make staff feel more important improves their performance well I haven't got the space right now okay how's he doing

absolutely horrible this is always like to run to run one detail zoom in to you buddy right yeah yeah I need to make sure that you clean up more cheese have you cured all the emergency patients I think that's the last one we might have you might have worked you must build a ward only gonna say forgot about that do I have enough money to build one treatment ward fantastic there we go it's gonna be a nice big one I mean nurses for those okay bed yeah just grab another beds I just you that's you three oh my goodness my panties go anywhere no I didn't mean to do that come on buddy this is this is pressure the pressures getting to me there's people lives on the line there we are that works need a radiator as well we're going place that there come on this guy's waiting for surgery he's having to stand up it's lawful make a bench oh my goodness we also need another nurse she looks good pop are there rats you're not doing too bad in terms of of money I think we did just complete the emergency thing as well all of our doctors seem to have disappeared four doctors to nurses a janitor and a receptionist oh I think we're doing think we good can I stop doing live streams that's nice it's really nice I only do them usually I only do them when I don't have time to edit a video or I do them as extra so you get one video plus a live stream throw Piggy's book cool did they just do surgery I missed it good job buddy what's his name kay Barnett well done buddy actually got himself a good olds where are you we're number one yes does that give us what is this Hall of Fame where am I on the Hall of Fame I'm not school that's insane do we get grants then highest salary is mine because I'm doing amazing my total value seventy-five thousands do great yeah we get money for that so every time it does the summary we get we have money someone's left a banana peel on the floor gross right well so we researched Oh a cardiogram and then one of those before but let's build one building right down here that must be for like hearts and stuff then we clearly cater for anyone that needs that perfect are there's so much disgusting stuff on the floor I think we're good though this guy's gonna get his head pop soon I kind of want to see that cuz I don't think I've shown you guys that yet let's follow him let's follow his journey he just been diagnosed there is barf on the floor which is a bit gross I will admit behave need to see this we need to see this can I read fast fairly it's a random question yeah there you go clean that up buddy I think my research departments doing okay it's not the not the best oh geez he's properly in the queue isn't he that's a big old cube who are they queuing for please everyone's cold again why is everyone always cold I did not mean to press out there No yeah where's the slack Tom cleaning where was it where did I put it I don't know where I put it there it is there's so many doctors I need another VIP ones to come as well LF probs the thirds I'm on the Hall of Shame are warts that is not true how do I see I want to see those again I don't realize those on the Hall of Shame I'm proper upset now I don't watch this is gonna get a chunk off you ready watch it Oh Oh Roman right well we'll go ahead got rocked yeah let's handle this emergency the complain about being thirsty okay let's grab three drinks machines and let's put one up here cuz this space just isn't used one here so people can see it but what here is wrong right here we go maybe she's coming in if we're like a queue isn't too bad the nurse has no clue whatsoever this is gonna be tricky though the helicopters already gone sorry yeah I wanted to show you the bloaty head didn't I completely forgot why did I show you the tongue look his head's gone hey do you see that those amazing right I think this guy's getting the same thing done so watch this this is gonna be amazing I'm watching it tooks it's bigger on the screen there oh that's great machine that starts to deteriorate that's not good it's really not goods bar VIP in as well let's see all these people in the yards no one's being operated on right now which is kids you're glad to get your tongue chopped off here it goes most of these are all real ailments we just simply could go in get your tongue chopped off if you need a bit and then you're done that'd be amazing cured right how we doing we just need to cure 23 more people and then we also need to increase by 2,000 pounds that's not so bad actually we've got 22,000 pounds in our bank so [Music] we haven't needed to use our cardiogram yet I think we should maybe change our research because we don't need new stuff at the moment we're down to 15 let's go to improvements bash that up to 25 the slice has been enhanced yeah that's perfect nice and busy this guy's busy he wants to check this out even though having me working yet oh this is this is beautiful to be do the emergency I think that's the last one I think we get an extra although this is the report yes oh there was only three I thought there were loads for some reason good this guy what are you doing he thinks he's Elvis right now his graph is satisfying though that he spent six hours feeling awful and now he's feeling great absolutely great I think we're at a point where we might actually win this hospital right now there's our VIP hopefully he's impressed hopefully our janitors doing his job cuz otherwise I'm gonna fire it repair your machines soon I don't know where the machines there's none that broken are there what are you talking about sir I think they're all fine yeah they're all goods we'll just listen out for that noise and if it does break then we'll be on it then have we satisfied all criteria yet we've got enough money all weights spent $300 what can we spend $300 on how it supplants five okay we need something that's more drinks machine is to buy another one of these bad boys place them everywhere people always complaining there's no drinks did that increase it no why nots really needs cures 14 more people or another emergency 95% 1500 let's go if you fail you only get part of the money and your reputation goes south like really south which we don't want because we need a reputation we don't actually need a reputation to win this level though I don't think I think we're good [Music] here they come you come the squits which is gross absolutely gross I want to try and beat this Hospital cuz then that means we be in three hospitals in and like no time at all this is a cool game though I remember it so well and I didn't remember to be this easy but I guess it can get pretty touching though what did I really I be think yes he loved it two grand amazing we satisfied this yet it still not satisfied what can you do usual what else we can do maybe make the stockroom bigger let's try that researching more things just kids how do I make it bigger let's do that take the door there window here and then we can buy some more stuff Oh No just whack a pool table in there and it'll be way better another plant as well amazing did that put it up 850 I'd so close we're so close to UM we're so close to completing this level we've got this we just go for four more people and just spend some money let's just put something really expensive in here let's put five drinks machines in is that how it works we're gonna put drinks machines just along this wall right here let's see if that worked no it didn't such an annoying noise I'm sorry about that I don't know how to fix it it's just an old game I guess we're gonna build something or can we what we do we've literally built everything you add something I can add you fight another bed in here I think we can there's not enough room no can't fit another room another bet in oh jeez I just deleted it oh those who do wrong is do wrong I've just deleted my ward yes delete it move this hall that was bad quick quick quick treatment ward glad there was no one in there cuz otherwise we would have just killed many people it doesn't make this massive wise not valid oh it's a bit bigger then we should be able to make it so that we've got enough bed space there we go right beds how many beds can we fit Joe can we can fit five beds beds come on come on help me out here why is it hot come on go where you need to be nice okay this is working we've got it took radiator as well she's on our little patients getting cold perfect I hope I didn't delete the oh no he's angry you were raised at 19 okay enjoy enjoy jeez I think we've done the emergency I do not mean to click that I want to click this and yeah right 80 1250 how many'd sixty-two people third successful hospital we did it guys we absolutely smashed it I think we're good keep the value of your hospital above 18,000 and I didn't read what he said hopefully the key keep us off the Wall of shame I hope so anyway after that we're doing good we don't have much queueing going on either how's your queue okay there's only four people which isn't so bad it's no border - oh you can you can move them in the queue position right-click on a patient to send them home and refer them to a rival hospital oh I do not want to do that I guess if it's the difference between someone being like really healthy and then someone knots then we should send them to a hospital but ideally I want to cure them oh man the kid get him long what what am i doctors doing you better not be in the staff room he's not always doing the cardio that's gonna see him do this why is this man so yellow what has happened to this dude he's so yellow that's so weird wait was that a new x-ray has just been fully researched oh dude let's buy this just because we can can we fit it in here no we can't if we delete that chair we can let's move this to here and let's put it in just because I want to see it x-ray there we go it's a squeeze but we can fit it in there we go sweet x-ray machine that's massive look how big this is where can I even put it there's another something happening I think a doctor is mad about his pay if I can't fit this stuff in there must be waits for the inks it's like the minimum that you need right oh my goodness how can I not fit this in right we have to quit this for now quit quit quit I have emergencies and stuff pay rise enjoy and oh seven people that's insane that's a lot of people that's a lot of people what if I got another question as well oh wait a second I could x-ray you if I can build it properly I just need to put it in right so I can't make it any bigger well maybe it depends where I put the door I just put a radiation shield down first oh yeah there dantdm marvelous you've heard of the running of this hospital superbly US bigwigs at the Ministry of Health would like to know that if you'd be interesting taking on a larger product there's a job we think you'd be perfect for the salary would be thirteen thousand seven hundred dollars give it some thought are you excited and interested in a job at Frampton on see 100 percent a million percent I think we're doing the right guys that's three hospitals in an hour and this is the bigger hospital that we have been awarded it's huge absolutely huge all right can I say this and say this in game two I've saved it I think I've saved it we did it right guys you know what unfortunately I think that means that I'm gonna have to end right here we did we did well today really good I think we did wasn't gonna say I completely forgot to say we did three hospitals in one video which is amazing I hope you enjoyed visiting some of my nostalgia and childhood with this game this is one of the games that just kept me kept me playing video games over and over again so I hope you enjoyed it if you did

Guys I'm not kidding you right now where I live It's currently minus 4 degrees and snowing and also my office heating decided to break which is fantastic Good timing to do that office. Thank you Why is that relevant well that's because we're back in the unnamed series that I've kind of called the greatest minecraft series ever Anyway, that was a spider wasn't it? But the reason that story the beginning is relevant is because it's still winter it's still halfway through winter And it feels like we've been doing winter for ages I'm not gonna lie this feels like we've been in this season for so so long I guess it's because we've been building the pink tree house Fishing for goldfish and just not sleeping as much because we don't have crops to grow because they just don't grow in the in the winter I Spider coming from what is the plan today? This is a very good question. I've just noticed There are so many death points on my map. It's crazy. Where's this spider at spider Where are you? Hello? Oh hello? Oh, you've got the eyes. You've got the eyes Oh Jesus a creeper there as well every single time But now we have a shield and the mystery of the shield in the previous video was Where did it go and apparently I gave it to you lift by accident. Oh That is why the shield is amazing We are apparently I gifted the shield to you lift by accident and then continue to give shoes to everyone else and the reason we had shoes is because we use this the diamond fishing rod which was the Main goal of the last video we found some treasure. It was awesome. She's go away. Why did you attack me instantly? It's daytime cannot see the light anyway today. We venture into a new bit of the pack today We are going to become engineers, but first we are going to drink because we're going to die I also need to put this egg in here there we go I don't want to sell my goldfish because that would be a shame I need to look after my animals, and then I'll explain to you what earth I'm talking about is everyone alive is everyone good You're all alive. You're all not sick. This is great great news I'm going to milk you now the chicken is still alive as well. That's good It has run out of food though Which I'm a little bit worried about I need I need money from I need I need food from you Otherwise my chickens gonna die I've until 11:00 Monday through Saturday, so you're closed tomorrow Or what am I supposed to do with this chicken what they really died? I don't want him to die because I've neglectful and you know what I'm gonna blame you because you don't really open it you know Sociable hours anyway, at least it isn't snowing here today, which is good. It's snowing in real life, but not in my game Thank goodness. There's pop those in there We could do some fishing for some more money, but I want to do something else I want to get full engineer II I think I showed you this in the previous video Engineer's we need it's not even cool that is it. It's a manual there We go we were one of these bad boys which is a lever and a book together? And then we can take it from there umm right we need to leave up Which means we need a piece of stone here? We go doesn't need to be smooth stone. I can't even remember It doesn't okay. That's good wait. We need a weed paper. I don't have paper I have leather because I could steal it. I have one piece of sugar canes. That's literally it Okay, didn't think this through. I don't know if I have any sugar cane up here I guess we're just about to find out we have four okay problem solved Three paper awesome right do you have leather in here? We have loads? Oh my goodness. I wish to be steel geez right okay? We need this like this like this boom and then we can do the engineer's manual awesome Okay, let's let's study this shall we I'm not actually sure what it's gonna say I get fireworks though. Yes I will never get tired of that. It's amazing actually makes me feel like I've done something worthwhile Okay, so this will tell us how on earth we get started in immersive engineering? Which is apparently a big part of this pack and will help us to automate just a little bit And I think this is a good time We've got about 15 days left until winter ends and you can start growing things But it'll be a good time to get things automated a little bit Just we can make money a little bit quicker Not that we're doing too bad at the moment, but you list gonna start ripping us off soon So we need to make some money quick so we have Update news Which we don't really need to hear do we overview and resources. Oh my goodness. We can make balloons great That sounds amazing is it a hot-air balloon No No way heavy machinery to crush the excavator This is some crazy stuff right here guys the squeezer Let's go for introduction greetings fellow Engineer and welcome to immersive engineering immersive Engineering is built around the concept of retro futuristic Generation and transfer of energy the engineers hammer is the most important tool at your disposal? It will be used to form multi blocks like the coke oven and the blast furnace So how do you make one of those we have plenty of hammers already we need an engineer's hammer? Which one is it which one is it this one? Can we bought other general store? Ha ah? I need to I need to buy off you lift. The general store really is that exactly what I need to do right now It's already gotten dark as well. It's only it's only 6 p.m. And I can't talk to you lift because he's gonna be closed isn't he huh? Splash your left your left your left piece will be closed ha ha ha alright. Let's sleep and let's see if You lifts gonna try and rip us off this time I feel like we need like 30 grand or something ridiculous oye guys look. It's snowing How great is that? I'm so pleased? Where is you'll if open on Sundays? I don't actually know. Please don't attack me Please don't attack me Oh jeez this shield is so amazing whoever commented that we should use the shield is a legend Yes, Sunday to Friday ok 9:00 a.m.. Let's go do some fishing Hello, sir. Get out of here. I don't need you if I had a Golden Apple I would kill you and turn you into one of my servants and you would get me my latop But I don't so you're gonna have to die my sword has leveled up to level 4 amazing. We can add something poison frost or fire oh I'm gonna add frost we already have soulbound which is crazy actually at the real Let's adds frost to be amazing, but we do need to make sure we do though is We need to repair this as soon as it gets Damaged because otherwise we're gonna lose all of our progress which would be terrible excuse me Jacob. I can't fish you buddy Oh god, maybe Jacob because he sells all of the rods and stuff Maybe he doesn't have any left, so he oh you could be the attack. Oh my goodness look it freezes them That's cool. Yeah, maybe Jacob. Just literary catches fished with his hands. Is that crazy you can just do that okay? It's time to put these away care for my animals and talk to you LIF. Oh, we have a message in a bottle That's cool. Let's put that away that away that away that way that away that away perfect. We also got some more boots I'll actually gift you lift my boots this time. You're deaf will this bring the prices down. I hope so enjoy. Thank you No problem, buddy make everything cheaper, please. Let's read the message in a bottle quick. It says dilemma and Obtain i am hypo diamonds that are invulnerable Instant mining speed tools and armor sincerely everyone What? Okay, let's just talk to unify So hold on a second hold on a second we we already got the general store is Is this the general this is the general store isn't it? Oh? What could I find the engineers hammer from you? I did not know that Okay, so it's uh. It's Sunday, which means she isn't open which is really helpful. I'm an idiot I think you guys know that by now though. It's not really a surprise. Okay. There's pop these in here uh What else do I need to do is it literally just the hammer oh? My game just crashed for no reason are we good though? Are we good you live was this down to you look at him just turned his back. He's like. Nope wasn't me, okay? I was trying to read what the ores are about so or as found in the world between layers oh They're always melt into copper ingots which are using basic copper wire crafting coils and other integral parts of the ie Architecture okay? I think we can buy these though I'm pretty sure we can buy all of these because the ores don't really exist that much in this world. Who are you? Brandon who are you? I think he's the mining guy. I'm pretty sure he's the mining guy. How's it going, buddy? Let me shop you. You don't sell anything but look copper ingot there We go a hundred gold so we can actually start doing this now We need to actually know what on earth we need to build for immersive engineering Otherwise we're gonna. Be lost and wasting money, so you can buy a blast bricks Redstone engineering blocks, so you can kind of skip the crafting a little bit which is great But this is mad expensive so we can buy copper ingots That's good to know so what can we do with the copper ingots the coke oven is the first? Important machine you will need to create in order to proceed with immersive engineering X Functionality is simple it will heat up coal or blocks of coal without supplying it with oxygen creating cold coke a carbon rich fuel Awesome it creates creosote oil. This is getting real details so we need bricks sandstone and clay is that it I mean we can buy these and It just crushed again. What is going on? I think this book keeps crashing my game, so I'm gonna be careful using it right we need ourselves. We can just use this instead we need a coke oven I'm pretty sure ok. It's not a craftable. Item. You just get coke brick threw sand brick and clay and Then you get three of them, but I believe you can also buy it from this guy Blas brick okay, maybe not definitely not okay, that's fine we have to find someone that sells it then the shop isn't open because it's Sunday you lips is open and Yeah, we don't need any of this stuff, which is crazy. I'm just trying to see if he sells anything that we actually need Absolutely nothing. Thank you diff for being a useless day we need Nine of these bricks. Yeah, we definitely need nine of them. We also need that hammer as well, so Let's do that shall we so if I need nine of them. I need four eight 12 bricks twelve clay and three sandstone I Think that's right, so if I need nine of these did I say twelve? I don't even show a maths is not my strong point, but I need for a I need 12 of these twelve of these and Three of these, but it has to be sandstone, so I need 24 clay we might have clay trust we have clay But he can't be bothered to look in the chest say we have nine clay already. That's good go in I'm pretty sure we have some more down here somewhere there. We need sand anyways. Let's grab some of that clay perfect This is great. So we should easily be able to get enough for this. I forgot the clay drops in fours I think or at least drops in a lot. We've got 50 severed already, okay Let's go smell this we needs to sleep as well to get it the next days. We could buy the engineer's hammer This is great news actually choice You need to visit the treehouse let's go watch out for nasty is though buddy you do not want to die here I've done it many many times. I'm sure you've seen I'm just gonna collect uh some food and let's go ferrous dry ours Did you just open the door hello? I? Heard a door open. What did you just do I don't even know where he is well. He's gone from down there Where there you go? I'm so confused anyway. Let's grab this and let's put in Yes put in half there the rest. I need okay. I don't need that much I only need 12 bricks the rest needs to be clay, and then they need sandstone, but I only need three of them So let's do this There we go perfect amount look at that And I'm not sure if it's gonna be safe to put a coke oven on a tree house But I guess we're just about to find out I'm assuming it's gonna be extremely heavy So we probably shouldn't put it in leaves, but I'm gonna do it anyway I think got any more leaves make a bigger platform have six That's not gonna go far is it think I'm gonna put it out this way for now I'm just gonna make it so that it's got a temporary platform So we can already we can just add another platform later down the line. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be fine I know it looks ugly, but we'll fix it okay in before in ten episodes time. I still haven't fixed it I just want it to be over. I really really do it's just stopping progress so much. I guess like in real life Okay, 12 bricks sorted so we should be able to make this now so if we do this this Okay, this did not work. My maths is terrible. Did I really do the maps completely wrong? I need 16 of these so Dumb why did I do four times three I don't know. It was meant to do four times four I told you math is not my strong point okay. It's okay We got way more than we need it at least we didn't travel far for it. It's okay. We've got this now We've got this now We should be able to do this now boom 9 Perfect so we have the coke brick that is great, and I think you just put it like this oh My goodness no No, I'm terrible at maths so bad I need 9 18 27 27 I didn't do I did 3x3 I need three by three by three. Oh my goodness, okay I need way more stuff, so I need 28 bricks right who knows let's have put this all in here We need some more clay, that's gonna be fine. We need some more sands which is gonna be fine also I'm going to sleep. I don't want this day to continue anymore, so Where are you? I need to vent my anger hello. Hello. You kidding me. What do you think you're doing? What are those eyes oh my goodness the snow has turned your eyes to like some weirdness There we go haha I'm using his own arrows to defeat everything. This is quite a little bit out of hands Okay, ice pirate there. We go get off of that. Why you still hitting me from down there, buddy you think that's funny Huh you think that's funny. I'm gonna come down in ah ah Hey this stupid song how is that? How am I gonna oh sure oh now you come to my rescue where were you I needed you, bro I really needed you. I don't even know where this stupid skele bone Is he just shot me out of the sky, and now he's still doing it sir go away Go away. Now you try and hit me again. Ahuh, don't do it. I thought it was gonna kill me again great. Okay? There's a zombie here as well. You know what I don't even care. I'm just gonna slice a lot of you I hate winter I hate winter no. Why are there so many. Oh care for your googly eyes. Just go away, please What since when if minecraft gets so hard oh my goodness? There's another one? Where are all these coming from seriously? Seriously all I wanted to do with some engineering work and my game keeps crashing you keep appearing oh Geez right, let's pop this all on real quick. I need my I need my shields have I got everything I don't really know you were a lot of help. Thank you. Okay, okay, okay? We've got our diamond fishing rod. That's good We've got our shield. We've got our our outfits our Manual our water our tools, and we good I'm out of here. I'm out of here. Uh yeah Well, so one of you guys suggested What was wrong with my bed by the wakes it keeps on spawning me somewhere else I think it's because there's leaves around the bed apparentiy it needs to be something else. Yes. I could sleep yes Stupid stupid day. It's now raining. Which I don't actually mind is way better than snow, okay Let's get this day started off a little bit better shall we I just want to triple check that I didn't lose anything Oh now you want to be here now you want to be here I just want to check that nothing else kind of spilled over the edge It's hard to keep track of all my items and stuff guys I'm about to die again from a cave spider They glitched through the wall or I'm trying to do is grab myself some clay And you just want to chill here trying to do this to me. I just want clay. That's all I want I'm gonna blame you you're not helping me at all. Okay, it stopped raining fantastic. This is good news. Oh got my bricks perfect I just need to make some sand stone 6 is going to be enough, that's great Do I have enough now actually I'm not sure how many does this make it makes 6? 9 ok I need nine more Yes perfect ok I did math properly this time Ok this is good This looks horrible absolutely horrible But I think as well now that we've done this we can grab the engineers hammer Watch this be like a million goals. I mean that's just gonna be my luck today It's gonna be a million gold and then a creepers gonna blow me up, and then my game will crash again And then my world will be unsavable. That's that's gonna be my day right. It's Monday 9:00 to 5:00 Jenny where are you? I'm getting stressed Jennifer Jennifer there you are how is it going shop? Where is the engineers hammer and how much is it? It is 2.5 k okay? That's not so bad You sell guns now What hold on did she sell all this stuff before a screwdriver a chisel a multimeter a pestle and mortar? a bee house Okay, she actually sells a lots this might be worth it Why would I need the workbench? Let's see if it has anything about the workbench in here engineer's workbench over the course of your engineering career you may come to deal with some tools that can be optimized and Modified to apply these modifications you choose a properly equipped engineer's workbench right-click the workbench insert the item into the slot and insert applicable Upgrades okay, that's cool. That's worth noting. We can also buy coils connectors and Other stuff okay, this is this is perfect Copper coil block for 500 I feel like that's really cheap as well right let's buy the hammer there we go We've got ourselves like our third hammer of the let's play. That's fine. Even says 27 here three by three by three, I'm so stupid, okay, we need to right-click of the engineers hammer Let's go. I mean an easier way to get to my treehouse is there like teleporters in this that'd be really good I am going to have a look teleport we have Auto teleport when it's low teleport to the nether teleport home Okay You can actually buy a house pet that's cool Tell up with yourself or the target and stay up to near service above in doing prime Teleport to your personal spawn point that can be bought in the cafe teleport to world spawn Yeah, we could get one of those I wonder how expensive. They are though. This is getting a little bit mythical I like it the vibes are good. I am going to eat this chicken. I didn't realize it right coke oven attack Oh, my goodness look at that that looks like it looks like the mining thing that we did yeah Okay, we have ourselves a coke oven. I have no idea. Why, but we got one. This is gonna be like the most advanced Technologically advanced treehouse you've ever seen back to the book we have a coke oven now Crude blast furnace is used to increase the carbon content in iron turning it into steel what is creosote oil actually do I should have researched that first a Creosote it Looks like this and can be used to make Not a lot it can use to be make torches for real and treated woods Is that is that all it does is this all you? Do you look pretty impressive, but apart from that? That that's it our okay? So I've just read up on it and apparently you can take coal and it then turns it into Coal that's twice as Goods. I'm pretty sure anyway. Let's make some blocks you can put blocks in let's see what happens I'm gonna put one in just in case and apparently it will then create stuff and then creosote oil it will create Let me show you Coke coal it will create this which burns out half the speed of coal so you could do EE as much I'm pretty sure anyway look at the flames the flames are coming up. I don't know how long it takes It doesn't really say I think it takes about a minute per block. Let's leave those in there and See if that works, if not. I don't know what to do It's just classic me trying to use a real expansive mod pack ain't gonna happen Is it yeah, so this book definitely crashes my game so I can read it for like two minutes And then it crashes it, so we'll need to be careful. Okay, while my game has been reloading from the crash I've been doing some research And we do actually need this to create most things in immersive engineering because immersive engineering uses treated wood Which which is crafting using creosote oil which is created by using this furnace now? I think it's because I put blocks of coal in that this is gonna Take a little bit longer, but it's definitely going down so when this is done it will create coal coke, and the oil as well that we need to make sticks, which we then need to make the engine is Pliers which are these also? the engineer's hammer oh okay, I was gonna say can be crafted with literally two pieces of iron and ace by the way or a piece of string but It turns out they've taken that out, which is fine. The engineer's wire cutters can also be bought at the general store Oh look at that a skyhook That would be amazing but look yeah treated stick for example is used to make the wooden grip which can then be used to make? the skyhook which sounds amazing So can we not craft the cutters at all I guess we're gonna find out right before my chickens die let's buy some chicken feed Hey, let's buy. I don't know like 20 and then put it in here there We go make some eggs for me, please Thank you. Yeah, look it's half way down. Okay. This is good. This is good So things are getting a little bit crazy We need ourselves a waterwheel because we need a way to create Energy and a way to do that is through the windmill or waterwheel and I was thinking because we have a body of water Already we won't need to make it flowing water which is fine But we should create a waterwheel and I think that would look absolutely amazing Then we could connect it up get some power going but all of that needs treated wood so a waterwheel needs for Waterwheel segments a steel ingot, so we're gonna have to sort that out at some point, but it's all through treated word Which is why we need this bad boy to hurry up and create us some creosote oil that is why we built that we did Not waste our time. We didn't waste our math skills We're all good, but we are gonna need those cutters, and we're also gonna need a kinetic Dynamo, I know it sounds insane But that's a copper coil block two redstone and three iron do we have any we don't have any redstone? For real, I would have thought we had some by now We probably use go mining for that then But let's focus on creating the waterwheel and then we can get that up and running which would be amazing because what we can do Is we can create things like? Item transportation. I kind of hinted on the what is it called the treadmill or something the conveyor belt Yeah, you can use these to transport items Which would look amazing if we have like a to them put it into the shipment box. It would be complicated It's like overly complicated But amazing we can also make furnaces that don't require coal which is quite nice as long as we have flowing water We can have energy which is cool very cool for a village that doesn't have any energy at the moment, right Let's say the shop is open and ready to go. It's Tuesday It is open Tuesday fantastic, so as well what's clever about this modpack is It's made us you can't craft some of the items. Can you craft actually the copper thing that we need? No, you can only buy them. That's what makes this pack Interesting because normally. Where are they I don't see the the shears the pliers whatever they're called I don't see them. It definitely says that the engine is pliers or whatever their cords are bought at the general store Engineers wire cutters can be bought at the general store. Why are they not here? Yeah, you can only buy these things usually you just mine copper and then craft them But you have to farm stuff farm animals sell stuff fish stuff to get the money to make this well We do need a copper coal blocks. We'll buy one of those I couldn't find the hammer here though the CAD assembler a spell programmer You can actually craft revolvers in this by the way which is insane We also have the forestry stuff to look at as well, which involves bees and the like But why are the pliers not here because I need those to be able to make anything because otherwise you can't disconnect wires otherwise they'll explode which we don't want to happen so I can't find anything online the documentation for this pack is very limited so I Apologize if I can't find out anything quickly, but she's just said in the chat section my supplies are pretty limited But one day I should be able to sell you more things so oh my goodness oh My goodness Wow this is awkward uh nope you didn't hear anything Johan whatever your name is well. Well well well I should not have done that whilst trying to say was she Probably sells the pliers or the cutters whatever they're called in a different season, that's gonna be my guess which is really annoying because that means I can't craft anything today the past the Past the hammer, but at least we've got started on it so far I don't think there's anyone else I can buy it from Johan only sells cars and stuff You don't sell anything do you you know what at least we can start crafting this stuff until we get past winter I just need the creosote oil So I can show you how to make the wood that we need then we could start making the windmill thing and hopefully at least Create the wheel today and see what it looks like because I think it's gonna look amazing Oh Simon is almost done does that mean it's it's fails does that mean we've wasted all this time oh yes, but a block of cold coke and 5000m bees whatever that means Oh creosote oil, so what we should be able to do actually is craft ourselves a rockets Actually, let me second guess that how can we carry fluids around in this pack basically it's buckets or? Glass bottles so we're gonna go for a bucket and hopefully we can pop the bucket in here Yes It worked I've never been so excited to be carrying a bucket of oil in my life look at my face I'm so happy. This is actually good progress. It seems boring, but don't worry It will be good so we can use this to make treated wood, and it makes eight Oh, my goodness one bucket makes eight planks. That's awful. That's so awful I need to make this wheel and it's gonna take Three oh geez here comes the mash so it takes four of these waterwheels Segments and the waterwheel segments take three treated wood planks each so three six nine twelve So I need twelve planks probably around 24. Just to make the sticks as well so we need Don't we we needs oh actually we have it we should be able to do this I forgot we had loads of it. How much wood do we have though? I don't think we have a lot You know we have dark oak wood. That'll do let's start making this water Wheels, it's gonna be amazing treated woods. Yes, and we can reuse the bucket as well there We go so it goes down by a thousand each time That's not so bad. That's actually pretty good to us 16. Let's make some more There we go and this is gonna go down very very slowly I wonder if there's a way to speed it up at any point that would be handy But for now, that's not what I wanted to do. This is what I wanted to do. We should have enough I'm not too sure though. Let's at least craft one so we need some sticks too there We go and then we do this this this this this this there. We go a waterwheel segment We just need to do that four times three more times now. Where are the sticks did I just what where do the sticks go I only makes four okay, so we need four for each one I don't know if this is gonna work Actually, yeah this might work There we go one two three Yeah We've got a waterwheel ready to go so the only thing we need for the waterwheel now is a steel Ingot can I buy one of these from our engineering friend? It's 8:00 p.m. He's probably not gonna have one, but I need to check when he's open copper hours. I am making progress I'm using my brain. It's a little bit scary, but it's working Suey is open Friday to Wednesday 10:00 a.m.. Till 4:00 Let's sleep and then grab hopefully Some metal from him Hey We got some eggs back perfect the guy is not gonna die and hopefully he doesn't leave us like last time as well and To be fair even though the tree house doesn't look complete from the inside from the outside. That's looking pretty good I just need to harvest off-camera some more of the Leaves that we need I think that's gonna be so cool when it's done now. I just need to wait till 10 a.m. First if you got a story that will last an hour and 20 minutes. I just need to talk to De Niro De Niro, I remember because it's name is similar I just need to talk to him So hopefully get some steel actually would it tell us if we if we can buy it from there BYE, MOM It doesn't say that we can But we can't really craft it any other way to be honest. Hopefully he does okay? He should be open He should be ready please have steel No, no no that that oh geez he doesn't have steel. He doesn't have any steel He has tin and bronze But no steel quartz enriched and how an asteroid steal hmm hold on a second? I'm seeing another recipe somewhere. Let's see if that one works and Maybe we'll get our water wheel that way so I've seen one that's like this, and then where's the treated word like this, okay? That's definitely not yet steel ingots from railcraft and immersive engineering But it doesn't really tell us how to get it I'm gonna assume that it's from the blast furnace, which needs blast brick which is bought From the blacksmith, and I'm pretty sure when he twenty-seven of them, so how much is this gonna cost me, buddy? I think you have to put iron in the blast furnace And then you get steel how much is it gonna cost me four glass brick 1k each, that's $27,000 my goodness actually insane Actually insane. I need to do a lot of fishing to make that money back, buddy Everyone's starting to assume that I'm extremely rich because I built this from the ground up But I'm not I'm not you know guys. I think we've actually been stumped. We are now stumped We can't do anything else until we start making more money So I'm gonna spend some more time off-camera Kind of grinding the fishing and hopefully grinding through Winter a bit because it's it's bringing us to a standstill not having enough money to do all of this stuff I'm doing as much as I can in winter including making some really cool stuff with this. We made AB last week We made a coke oven today, which is insane, but not today I think my dopey face has had enough we couldn't do math properly But we managed to get there in the end we're almost with this close to be able to create electricity and our Waterwheel so hopefully in the next episode. We'll be able to make the the blast furnace. We just need twenty seven thousand Okay, then we just need a little bit of redstone And then we can buy the copper wires to connect it all up and create electricity. I'm excited I hope you're excited too. If you enjoyed this video I'm sorry that it was like a little bit more brain work But I hope you enjoyed it anyway If you did because that thumbs up would be greatly appreciated also leave a like if you enjoyed the video And if you haven't done so yet And you'd like to keep up for the rest of this series Then please do consider subscribing to join team tdn today for daily videos apart from that guys Thank you so much again for watching your awesome. Have an amazing day, and I'll see you all next time but i will play more roblox :) 
yes I said I would never play this game again but there was a disclaimer I could never play this game again quite happily or if you really want to see me play some more and get this video to a hundred thousand likes that's right and I put that at the end of a twenty minute video so I didn't think people would actually do it turns out it has more than 100,000 likes so I'm back another disclaimer I had to get all the way back here again not from the point last time but all the way back from the beginning I don't know why but whenever this game updates it literally just cuts you back to the beginning which is annoying so today could be the last day I'd ever play this game regardless of what you guys put me through so we haven't got further than this stupid orange box with the oranges just chilling around it because I did the weakest jump ever last time I feel like the mechanics have been showing it a little bit as well I'm not sure why it just getting up here was a little bit trickier than normal but I did it in a bow I want to say like 15 minutes from start like the problem the proper start to now but enough nonsense let's do this let's just stretch the hands focus the mind and do this I'm even gonna roll up my sleeves I mean this is getting this is getting real serious huh yeah that's what I'm talking about right I need to be so careful now because this rock face does not look pleasant at all and if I make one wrong move and fire myself this way I'm dead I'm going back to the beginning okay look at that coming up what's it's like a cliff face that's out from where you are before can we even drag ourselves over surely we can that's like the steepest piece of rock ever come up focus yourself focus yourself I don't know what your name is it could be Tony it could be Mick it could be oh oh oh it could be you know God yes yes yes No Oh what would even happen there what's even happened I thought I was doing so well please calm down please calm down oh my goodness I don't like this I don't like this at all this is like the the most nerve-wracking part I've ever had because before when we were going through the chairs and stuff at least if you fell it wasn't so bad it was easy to get back but down there the void of nothing is the beginning of the game and I don't feel like doing that again here we go that was a good jump that was a good spring and let's just get back to where we were okay let's not panic it's not panic why are you sideways why are you doing this to me you just need to get on that tiny little platform and drag yourself up it sounds easy but Tony you're annoying me one tiny slip even if you don't do any jumps just means that you fly all the way into the bottom you just have to put your hammer out and hope oh oh okay okay I don't know what happened there but you know what I panicked I almost push myself away I had to jump back to regain control yes yes yes see see I've got better I feel like this might be the optimum position to be able to do this and you know what and so you get to the orange bit the only super difficult part is this it's like super duper annoying come on come on come on yes yes yes yes ha ha okay let me come compose myself and get back to where we were it's the toilet everybody I've also just noticed there's a sink upside down with a toothbrush that is defying gravity fantastic I feel like Tony's making new noises listen to him yeah he's definitely making new noises right Tony we're almost back let's go yes the orange has not respawned it's fine I don't care about the orange as long as I don't follow the orange down the void of nothing then I'm absolutely fine Tony you've got this buddy let's go yes Tony it sorry you're the best I like you right now just be careful this be careful be so so careful please just put yourself down put yourself down oh my god oh my goodness ah why is this so hard turn it on that should not have done that should not have done that oh do you just have to take every part of it super slow cuz that's gonna let's go to grind my gears no whoa like a breathe now I don't know how that happened but it did this rock not a fan of this rock at all come on now come on now I'm running out of mouse pad I'm running out of mouse pad and dismount yes ha look how he's balanced Tony how is that even possible I'm not even going to question it dude's not that's alright this is fling him around no no no no no no no Tony come on come on come on we're almost there now the joyous music begins fantastic why why does the game feel like doing this to me huh I swear if you go down there I will destroy you how on earth am I supposed to get out of this predicament huh he's literally got his muscles and his hammer stuck between two objects and he's slipping I don't know what to do it's just so difficult I can't even do the basic jumps anymore and now I'm stuck what how how now I was playing the stupid spongebob music again how is this even possible that I get in these situations where I just fling even at the beginning I'm flinging myself all the way backwards I pull straight down the lamps the lamps the hardest bit until you get to here yes I made it back Oh dodged it took me like 40 minutes to get back here I'm so happy right the orange is still not here that's absolutely fine and I just need to make this simple little jump up to the rock I can't believe I've thrown away literally the best chance that I've had of this but that ain't gonna happen this time right here we go here we go yes no no no no what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing oh my goodness you kidding me 30 minutes that took me oh my dear how are you doing it's been so long so I need to push up and not like swing it too hard otherwise the momentum will just take me the wrong way here we go yes that's the stuff that's what I'm talking about let's not get too crazy about it though we need just to take our time come on Tony come on just put that little butt down I mean not not your butt that your cold room but I don't think any kind of jumping is going to help on this we just need to be super careful super slow and very very calm come on come on that's the stuff yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness why oh yeah yeah I'm back it's taking me much less time to get back here now which is good so long as I don't fall all the way to the very very bottom I think it's okay the thing is you can't bounce too hard otherwise your Coldren will hit the peak and almost do what it did just then but it's fine we made it let's just take our time and let's see if we can get to that bit we were before thing is you definitely run out of mouse space because you're making small movements but with your mouse you're actually making big movements don't slip don't be slipping don't be slipping come on Tony put that cauldron butt down and don't you go sliding down the mountain you punk yes right now this ridiculous ridiculous rock okay I think this is gonna slide but you know what we're gonna have to try no don't do that yeah I hate this so much so much he just slips and then you can't even get you get so much speed going down because you're a smooth buttock cauldron that the rocks just take you away it's crazy I'm back I'm back and I think I'm in a good position to get enough leverage I think it's all about where you start off but hey we're just about to find out no no no no no no no no no I've done this before no you do not do this to me you do not do this tonight I think my reach for this is pretty good but there's only one way to find out and that's by doing it please please I've worked so hard for this don't make me slip don't make me slip come on no it's slipping it's slipping already it's slipping already ah yes oh okay we're back last time I pogo'd and messed the whole thing up I don't even know what I did last time but we're here perseverance has paid off this better not slip this time this seems like a less slippy Rock yeah I think we kids I think we're good I think we are good but there is another tower up ahead oh my goodness yes we are presented with a lion face that is amazing what better to be rewarded with than a concrete lion head now the problem with this is when we I say when we found not if we fell when we fail this tower we're gonna be sent all the way down the horrible way so I'm just gonna have to try it this Pogo is gonna be the riskiest one yet I think I can do it I don't know how far I can get into this little crevice here I don't think it's very far but I don't want to waste this chance at all okay okay I'm just gonna have to do it here we go yes thumbs up there's a thumbs up okay I should not let go of the mouse don't let go the mouse reminder to self don't let go of the mouse oh man you don't know how scared I am oh geez there we go I think that's a good placement as well why are they will pogos why this is the sole nerve wracking I'm pretty sure this is not anywhere near the end of the game as well I have no idea thumb thumb thumb right now we need to literally do you have to balance on the thumb okay I'm gonna balance on the thumb I could launch myself I feel like balance things a little bit safer but we have to balance our a bomb I think that works I think that works okay here we go yes oh okay let's just laugh why would you do that what why why would you do that oh my goodness now we need to do we need to we just need to grab that tiny little piece up there that's gonna be so awful it jumpscare you literally that let me shake my mouse like crazy okay here we go I'm just gonna have to do it that could not have been any better oh my guess this is actually amazing let me try and perch myself on this piece before it falls down that couldn't have been any better oh man hurt yourself I'm just gonna fling myself I'm just gonna do it come on no no that was the thumb that was the Sun [Music] I can't play this game anymore [Music] 
So a few days ago I said the best thing about virtual reality is that you can become anything you want so today I will become a secret agent oh Yo, I'm driving a c-car this is sweet, so this is actually a virtual reality experience that you do sitting down and it's called ah I Expected you to die which just happens and as you can see it's kind of like a belt Hopefully that doesn't happen more than just now is that me I'm looking good No, no this is not good. This is not good. I have a pod is that gonna go off oh? Yeah, well well well What do we have here? Huh just sit at my table the desk is gone. I felt quite important Then hey there you go my hands. Oh my guys always love you advanced operative division I am your assigned handler and support agent. We're going to be fast friends. I have no doubt Your new implants allow you to use telekinetic abilities to manipulate the world around you Wow back when I was a field agent We had to pick things up the old-fashioned way. That's insane Okay, so this is kind of like a tutorial we have welcome agent things are not always as they seem sure I know what I'm doing and apparently I'm gonna light this thing. Are you ready oh? Yeah, ah This is phenomenal activate telekinesis oh, I can where's the way don't eat sir Oh, they're freshly TouchPad what? You can pull it in oh Yeah Over this nice yes, it's gun time right how do we do this okay pressing the touchpad right? Oh? Yeah, oh, yeah. Oh yeah Noah commence with me. Haha. Okay training is done I'm pretty sure we and grab our new mission from over there with our psychic abilities What what kind of spy has psychic abilities? How crazy is that look at this? Hey? Operation friendly skies I have like drawers and stuff as well This is core does this same advanced Asian module. I don't want to calibrate no I've done that I have different slides and stuff I can just pop in here which is quite cool I think gun who would've liked having a gun huh oh? It's actually like super realistic pop-up right there. We go operation number one. Let's begin Please ah ah this is great Actually for like um in The Incredibles or something I feel like it can actually like Reach out and kick the pedals and drive it off the plane and you may just earn that vacation you're always going on about Wait wait you said drive it off. The plane is that is that for real? So when he's going on to drive and oh Oh, I need a key they actually need a key is there a key around here anywhere excuse me is this telling me how to? Work it how to arm your bomb oh? No, ha ha what about there? It is. I see it right let's pop this in there. We go twist it Yes Let's go. Let's do this Oh jeez here we go he's got me What ah no laser avoided deploying secondary countermeasures, what are you doing? Oh? The old ticking bomb I'm partial to plastic explosives myself There's a bomb um How'd you arm your bong 1 2 3, but? How do how do I disarm the bomb? Ah, can I open this? What's this? There's money? There's also a a knife. Yes, okay? we can cut these cut cut cut cut them ah Mission failed cause of death bomb explosion Whoops ah where am I this? Is a little bit freaky retry right so I need to do green blue yellow I think that's what I did wrong before right. Let's open this let's grab this There we go and it says green there we go green blue Ready right, I'm gonna open this quickly come here come here there. We go strike this towards Grab this drag it forward, and it was seized. What was it? What was it? Green blue yellow green blue green blue. No why why did that just happen to me alright? Give me a second here. Give me a second here there anything else I've got I got more money in the back which is great. I can always use more of that I could just go in there I've got a gun a chair and more money Let's just put the gun down here. Just in case we need it, but it says one two three Maybe we need to do it backwards. Let's give it a go right here. We go over Here's the bomb is the bomb right it says. That's why let's do Yellow there we go and then let's do blue and then green Yes hahaha Can we please focus on getting the car out of the plane? Yes? We can we did it though? I'm so happy right let's put all that gubbins down there. We don't need this and let's go that's neutral That's gone. Can this go please thank you. Oh my car is broken guys my cars are broken I press this next message so on there is an urgent matter We must discuss contact me on a secure line immediately. Okay? How do I do that? I just want to get out of here? Okay, honestly agent. We want the car in one piece Sorry, nothing short of an explosion is going to make a dent in that cargo door. I'm so sorry wait so I need to oh Can I shoot it there? We go that kind of works? Um there? We go and there we go. Yeah? Oh jeez a gas What happened what's happening of dying? I'm dying What do I do oh? Good job. Well done. Literally everything it can kill you right Okay, so there's definitely gas everywhere poison gas. I'm guessing there's something in there. It's like a big old button great great amazing wait oh Yeah, that's what I'm talking about look at this can we shake it? Hey Smoke gas okay. We probably shouldn't play with that we pour us up a little glassy glass we go It's so bright guys Cheers ha ha ha ha 40 cannon reset the system are ok, so we need to go ahead and Go jeez I'm gonna have to shoot the window out, but I'm gonna die of poison gas Which I'm a little bit worried about so I guess I need to do it pretty quickly all right Just put it in Drive. Just in case and Let's do this here. We go BAM. Let's grab it. Let's grab it quick quick quick quick quick. Do it yes? Yes, yes, yes, then what do we do then? What do we do press? It press it go good with the canister in and fire Bob oh How do I not die Poison gas gets me. Okay, so it turns out you could just do this and put the window back up I didn't need to shoot the window out. It's absolutely fine. Haha right. Let's do this there we go Let's grab this and then we need to push this button and see what happens Great right let's not this My goodness this thing is massive right pop the gas in there, and then do we just do it three two one Kapow Yay umm Not sure, that's what I'm supposed to do really does this know what? Do I see two fire smoke bombs it's literally not working what about this? Okay, that takes it away. Deploying scorpions. What what oh? My goodness guys. This is a scorpion right there. Why why oh I've got idea all right Let's grab these these are the explosives from before let's pop this in here there. We go ah boom Yes, oh my goodness, right? unconventional, but then again convention never was your strong suit You'd better drive the car off the plane before something else explodes here. We go guys. I'm after you very very nervous let's go ah Do we do it parachutes deployed Hey We did it. Oh, thank goodness. That was actually a mission in itself that was cool though. Hey We've got some achievements as well forgive me what I have just set this stuff on fire We got guns away smokey brakes drunk driving because we actually popped the champagne Haha, you can do it in 36 seconds as well, which is Mads. Oh look I think when you complete certain things you unlock them hey Get out of here right I feel like I'm doing pretty well as a superhero No, wait a secret-agent so fast the next one is squeaky clean Let's go songs people recognize you now, so you'll be going undercover for this mission nice. I hope you're not scared of heights. Oh Wider retrieved from zoara's car confirms information link to us from a dr. Lincoln We have also heard news that Zoe's lieutenant Daniels Sands has been researching a super virus We need you to infiltrate the lab and destroy that virus. I'm sure I can do that lets-a-go But yo look at this Whoa I'm like a window cleaner Okay, I am win loveliness or axis is creating a deadly supervirus We knows or wants revenge on the agency, but this is a tad extreme get into that lab and You through making an anti-virus oh? Okay, perhaps when you're done there. You can come clean my office. This is do a little sprucing up Just uh just a harmless little window cleaner Don't you worry don't you worry at all I can't do anything with this So there's only one waiting guys cut Wow let's do it. Oh No no no right, let's grab this I don't know what it is, but I'm gonna grab it attention dr. Ashley Lincoln has come to our attention you are engaging in unauthorized Antivirus research bla bla bla bla bla what didn't eat that right, so what is in here? We got three wires Which I'm guessing shouldn't be touched unless I know what I'm doing awake. There's an ID in there Wait what what no, I think I'm gonna die guys, I'm gonna die those lasers Wow I'm gonna die I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm dead there's poison gas. You know this poison gas is unreal Hey guys check this out. I Can show the lasers how cool is this right so we must be able to see we can save some of the wires But it's gonna be so so difficult to be able to do it. Ah oh oh oh Have we done it we've done it right This is an ID card which I'm guessing we can use over here, but look at me. Just look how many lasers there are This is crazy. Okay right this is gonna be tricky, but we're gonna be able to do it right here. We go this is Being a spy yes Accepted security disabled we did it full disclosure agent I don't really know how to make an anti-virus great however Shawn in HR says you tested well in chemistry so give it a go save millions of lives And don't blow yourself up. Oh I can blow myself up. That's not a good. That's not a good look is it right Let's do some research shall we I'm gonna grab this chemical formulas One of them explodes one of them made something corrosive on copper Which is that wire there? And the other one makes a puffy clouds? Great, so are all these things That looks like some kind of crazy. I don't even know like hair. Dye. Ah wait We need to use this as well right it's able to synthetic elements. Okay. I'm gonna plop this. I don't think I need this anymore I'm gonna put this just here It's like a big old chemistry lesson we need to make a r and r e what are those are e is purple a R is green Mm-hmm we need GI a R&amp;Y to corrode that copper over there Yellow and Blue makes an explosion I need yellow and blue to make green right How am I supposed to do that my brain is already hurting? What happens if we put this in there should we see? It's got him. Oh Where'd it go where'd it go? What Virus stable oh, so this is the virus that's insane right? What's this there's something else here this is Toxic what he's trying to make toxic rain, that's nuts oh Okay, I think I've got this I need GI Which is this one right here? Let's pop that in there there? We go we need a R Which is the green so let's grab this one and put that in there then we need Y which is red So let's do that Press it and see what happens don't explode don't explode Yes, okay, so this is this is corrosive, right? Yes Haha, so now. I can switch this on agent. You've been spotted quick Naturally, what how do I do that? Who's coming at me? Who is coming at me it appears the guard didn't buy it? What Yeah, I always knew you were intimidating. That's your stoic silence Definitely is I did not think he was gonna get me. I need to be careful though very very careful right so now We've got all of these. I now need to make Hmm a R plus R a green plus purple, let's try it here we go green There we go plus purple There we go equals back Please don't explode this makes like a smoke powder. I think let's see what happens just throw it Yeah, just make smoke so what happens if we put this in there that still happens Scan it send it away. See you later Very stable Chemical effect negligible what I don't have to know what to do. I've done all the elements, but do I just add them all together I couldn't add three at a time, so I'm not sure so I just do NN. I'm just gonna do it NN Which is the yellow? Which is the one we had to unlock there? We go Plus GI which is blue? There we go I think I'm gonna die here, but let's try it anyway Kapow uh-oh I think this is why I'm supposed to do because I need to exploit the system Please don't blow me up. I'm outside so I can just I can bounce to any second are we good yes I did it Oh Okay, let's bring that down. I didn't do anything I didn't do anything I didn't do anything all right. I always thought this no I am such an idiot. I have found the secret It was the little painting that was in there right girl is about to save my life. Let's grab this green Let's bring it in and let's do this. I also need this over here. I feel like I'm acting like a science class again Okay, GI so we need blue there. We go blue green and red let's pop that in Here, let's drop it on there there. We go and then we can open the yellow bring those in Egypt You've been spotted. What quick oh geez act naturally right? So the healing potion is green yellow and no purple yellow, red purple There we go Yellow, and red, so this should be a healing potion right come on little girl. I'm so putting my faith in you right now Yes, I did it right. Do I need to put that in here On myself when I blow that up No Stop him. I got no. I got a bullets left. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I could just throw the gun Let him work. Did it Wow this isn't going well See you later big bomb how do I stop this though? Is there a way to stop it? Hello, look at that thing But its pungency if that rocket launches with an active virus millions will die Neutralize that virus now neutralize the virus How do I do that NN + GI omegas NN + GI uh? Yellow + blue here. We go yellow + blue Needs this And then can I put that in there isn't if I can no, I've set things on fire. How do I neutralize the virus? That didn't work did it they didn't work at all um um um oh Yes, okay, we can take this off. I didn't realize we could do this Let's take this off perfect all we need the copper thing again. We definitely need the copper thing again What was the coupon GI a are so blue? Oh my goodness? There's not enough. It's not enough blue and Green green green green and red.

I need to go lay down cuz I am exhausted and I'll see you all next time yeah Bye 
hey guys how's it going today I got some for tonight gameplay for you guys which I know you have been begging for and no it's not because I've gotten good at the game it's because they've got a brand new game mode out which dropped literally last night and it's called at the 50 versus 50 modes right here this week we revealed our limited time 50 versus lulululu 50 versus 50 mode and you can play right now grab your closest friends and jump into an epic battle I'm gonna have to play by myself last team standing wins so as you guys know fortnight is known for its battle royale which is literally one versus one versus one all the way up to a hundred so 50 versus 50 is pretty interesting and it's only available until like mid December so we haven't got long to play it's wait for it you know what let's jump in let's play right now y'all look at this aswell snobol weapon coming soon these snowballs are for splode in spread holiday cheer by toppling your enemy's strongholds next week is that a grenade launcher but with snowballs instead are they actually gonna bring out a Christmas version of this because that would be they'll be so good I like change some the buttons as well I know it's weird to get excited about graphical changes especially buttons but that looks cool disclaimer I have not attempted this game-mode yet I have played so much solos it is unreal almost like a day and a half worth of gameplay but I'm guessing there it is we're gonna go 50 versus 50 we're gonna jump straight in and see what on earth happens I think this is gonna be mental nearby teammates are marked in green Boy strike squad only every player on the surviving team is victorious good to know ok here we go one player has already left our squads fantastic I don't even know where to drop so everyone still does the same thing and goes and collects loot but then you kind of team up and don't kill your teammates that's pretty crazy let's just drop and see what happens I mean I'm gonna die anyway also I usually play on ps4 and today I'm playing on PC with a controller go on go on judge me so there's a green teammate over there which is good and you can also team up on other people which is quite cool give it as jest well you got for me that will definitely do oh my goodness so if there's a gunfight going on and you think your player is involved you can just help them out did he just know I thought you died it's okay I he might be dead no he won yeah good job buddy that's what I'm talking about oh yeah all right let's stop messing around we need stuff oh oh new sound for the slurp juice as well we are in the ring too which is cool look and it shows you if you're in the vicinity of other team mates that's cool should we just go and find team mates and hang around with them I think we should do that I'm gonna go to the roof first though okay I failed I'm gonna go over to my teammates and hopefully not die on the way they should be making their way this way anyway right yeah here we go something's going down let's try and help from afar shall we uh who is who I'm gonna go on top of this building let's go let's go let's go come on let's go to the top and let's help our teammates out where are they there he is get out of here Punk I will kill you oh that was my teammate it wasn't was it and I think we're good oh I'm hearing someone I'm definitely hearing someone there's smoke grenades up here dudes oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I didn't mean I didn't mean to shoot you I'm sorry buddy oh my goodness I'm so sorry I feel bad how do I drop things oh look they changed this - this is mad I wanted to drop something oh no what's going on what's going on friends friends this is great I'm just gonna travel have enough friends this is actually amazing guys I'm not even kidding you I would like a shotgun I'm gonna take that number this is my clique all these people friends there's already friends I'm so happy how are we going to lose I mean I guess there's only 17 in the other team friends we've got this this the only thing we've got to worry about if another team comes up with us but with all this building and stuff like a whole team could just build like a fortress and I think that's what we're gonna do give me this tree this is so cool I can't explain to you how awesome this is can we go for a first game first win I mean if we come across anyone we're gonna be we're double their team right now which is insane and look we're all in the same place dominating this tower guys dominating I don't feel like I'm helping so I'm just gonna actually no I'm not gonna help at all look at us we are on top of this mountain and who we are going it's a win if we when guys I'll be very embarrassed I think we're good though if anyone comes towards us there's so many people in our squad that we're just gonna launch fire at them or should not have done that hey guys how's it going atop the mountain this sister this is meds all we've got snipers I got smoke grenades I mean I think we've got this in the bag 38 against 11 with one guys with one this is some place are we playing fortnight or minecraft right now this is unreal guys I want to help I want to build stairs come out build some stairs I'm gonna put some you know here yeah yeah don't hate me for it the only problem is if the circle isn't on us next we're going to die we've got to have wasted all these materials but you know what it doesn't really matter they've got ten people left come friend friends come up here as well if someone else comes over here who isn't on our team if that wasn't another team member we would be raining fire on them like crazy right there's multiple teammates coming across to us they've already got ten members guys I think we can smash this come on you can make it you can make it are suckers the other side we can stay here for a little bit or we could just leave friends what you want to do oh my goodness people are knocking stuff out what is happening or something's going down so it's going down oh jeez I should not be here I should not be here I'm in the worst place I'm gonna have to edit this really quickly otherwise I'm gonna be in big trouble confirmed there we go look I'm a master master builder where are these guys down there I can't even see them oh geez okay we need to get out here friends we've messed up we've real messed up oh man how do I get down how do I get down we're gonna use this old trick and it failed perfect amazing doesn't matter I've got bandages actually it does matter because the yeah the storms gonna kill me don't let it end like this we've got thirty four against nine no no no it's during that time it's doing two at a time I am so dead so so dead come on come on cuz I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm gonna die no I am so far away guys I failed you I've actually felt you I can't believe it's half of our team are in the storm look look everyone's everyone's dead it's the biggest team fail ever nah no there's no chance there's uh there's definitely no chance cool as fast you can little one you'd be okay it's gonna be it's gonna be fine we can't believe so many of us got caught in the storm look there's only 21 left how would it be would I in the storm at least ten I like how they change the spectating screen that's very cool right let's see how they said shall we get him get him get him cuz if our team still wins I still get the points so I'm not too worried yeah even happens guys they had seven and then everyone died not sure that was legit but we won yes I've seen that screen just once in my life thank you team Thank You friends you can view match stats as well nice I got one assist I got you know what let's not look at that this game mode is awesome so we just drop with everyone else I think we're just gonna do it I don't think this guy's a friend okay I'm a bit worried that I've dropped with no teammates I could be in trouble here we good are we good I'm just gonna fall on this house and make the magic happen okay there's there's no chest here friends right I'm sticking with this guy let's follow him he found the chest before me this guy's a chump this guy's not a friend gotcha I didn't get that kill either I'm not mad I'm not mad it's fine I'm not mad at all get out here you punk I need to kill you about three bullets there we go if this is hilarious cuz you not only have to make sure that they're the opponent but you have to kill them afterwards see look this is a friend almost shot him in the face but I'm fine right I'm sticking with you guys I got myself a kill I'm feeling good and I've got a a ranged AR which is beautiful I think we've dominated this spot you know good work lads good job I need some woods cover my back please it is exactly even right now 41 to 41 madness there's someone over there who is it they're not friends they're not friends at all it's a good time to get resources because you know that pretty much everyone will help you out okay sounds like stuff's going down like go go yes we're getting them we're getting them I love this gun because it hit traces so whoa okay okay that's not good let's build something here let's give ourselves a big old Healey Healey I got the worst nicknames for this stuff ever ratchet on the losing team but it's fine absolutely fine we got people to help us out right we need to revive some people as well I think there's some revival balls down here always help out your teammates and steal their shotguns here we go are we healing them at the same time I think we all want to feel like I'm helping at least a little bit billy gets pretty good huh yes right we've got a good gang of friends going on it's 31 to 32 and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be the next one to die got a couple decent kills I mean one was an assist but the other one was a kill that's pretty cool we need to start building or are we just we're just gonna run up me everyone's just running this way you ready to make that much noise sir please don't make so much noise oh I heard shots I definitely heard shots whoa dude there's a sniper oh it's there it's right over here yes got one shot at least hey I'm running low on bullets though which is bad we all good up here guys I think we kids I need some help though I could take this that'll be perfect brave man's going I mean sure let's follow him there we go he's got someone oh I could almost get them then there they are oh oh there's someone there too I can't show up there a friend guys guys guys wait for me please ah someone's going there nice can I take this I think they're giving me this fantastic it's got one bullet thanks guys appreciate it become nice they are they're just building things in front of me this is great 26 to 29 this is risky though if anyone comes up near as we're dead come on let's make it up we can't lose three at once maybe that's what happened before they were just building up and they

what this is unexpected Freddy fazbear's pizzeria simulator released by the official creator of five nights at freddy's scott cawthon now it's been well known the five nights at freddy 6 was in the works and then cancelled but now this has been released randomly yesterday I'm not sure anyone was expecting it to happen we all thought the five nights at Freddy's 6 was cancelled then again I'm not sure if this is anything to do with five nights at Freddy's 6 because if you read the reviews this game is not what it claims to be don't be tricked by the screenshots and trailer I cannot say what happens but it is amazing download this game I'm interested I'm intrigued and I don't know what to think of this it's literally showing weird screenshots of like 8-bit mini games creating pizzas and stuff not the traditional five nights at Freddy's but it's free let's play ok headphones on I don't think there's any sound right now and we're greeted with this title screen that literature says press ENTER so I'm gonna do it and see what happens we can design a pizza or go to the pizzeria what do I want to do I guess design Pizza design your piece a quick topping is to add them to your piece we got pepperoni sauce ours onions mushrooms olives and peppers well I'm gonna go mushrooms when you have a sausage and you know a pepperoni and I think I think that's fine what do the others look like Oh onions look like little bits of purple guy haha I think that is cool we're gonna leave the onions on the eggs I like the pink press Enter when finished and that's us done go to pizzeria ok round one wait what do we do move W a sandy throw pizzas shifts what is happening these aren't even the pizzas that we created are they I'm not getting any score either oh there we go we just have to kind of fire them at the kids that's so it how much do they take to die I mean I'm not supposed to kill them you know I mean 1 2 3 3 purl 1 so 1 2 3 there we go 1 2 3 perfect there we go right last one I don't know if we're timed on this I have no idea what's happening what is that why are you here you okay oh he's blocking us I was like what do you do being here buddy you were pizza too okay he's actually really really annoying how am I supposed to dodge you sir stop it stop it right now I need to Cuddy to feed these children why is he doing this why are you doing this sir it's so annoying stop about so many pizzas I am stacked I see you can hit him and then he stops then you can throw the pizzas I understand now he's like a shadow Freddy it's really kind of creepy one two three yeah come on free feed the child feed the child round four he's not disappeared though what's happening what is happening guys what is happening I am NOT doing anything all it's glitching badly it's pitching real badly I can fire shadow Freddy's now this music does not match this it's frozen it's died okay what are you hello I'm so confused who are you what are you doing here what's this employee only paragraph one there's a tape player as well is that all I can do oh geez what does that say it says prompt one results no yes or unsure so wait first play begin tape leaving dead space 3 2 1 what's going on purpose of this tape is to test automated response times and reactions from vintage interactive attractions ok audio stimuli if you are playing this tape that means that not only have you been checking outside at the end of every shift as you were instructed to do yeah but also that you have found something that meets the criteria of your special obligations under paragraph 4 ok follow these instructions document response times then safely secure the space before leaving upon ceiling of the room you are not to return ok begin audio prompt in 3 what's happening I don't like this so my testing the results for this this animatronic document results I pressed it right I've done it wrong I've done it wrong Mario prompt in 3 it says no unsure I'm so scared I don't want to be jump scared please please it's always Christmas please don't do this to me document no results no results no results ok it's kind of cool prompt in 3 - oh my goodness I'm preparing for it all I guess it's all guys it's freaking me out no response who is this I kind of recognized the animatronic but I don't really know who it is I feel like we've met before stop the audio please stop the audio result No right there's two more two more to go begin audio prompt in 302 what Oh her eyes moved oh we didn't even get to the last one it's a new day it's your time to shine it's time to take your career into your own hands oh it's happening saved money your whole life great now it's time to put all your eggs into one basket okay a huge gamble on your future a gamble that comes with a 100% chance of success in some cases what are we talking about we're talking about becoming a fazbear entertainment franchisee nights right restaurant ownership and management something almost anyone can do with a limited degree of success sure it's a lot of money to invest but everyone's doing it and that means it's safe and lucrative with your initial investment you'll receive everything you need to get started including a small room some tables and electricity great don't forget about the money you had leftover after buying your franchise package use it to decorate by a stage by attractions and animatronics and much much more now let's take a look at a few things that will help you get started as a fazbear entertainment franchisee okay such as atmosphere making sure your establishment has an inviting atmosphere is essential to bringing in new customers entertainment having a lot of entertainment value in your restaurant will ensure that customers come back bonus revenue coin-operated games and a safe and what is benign revenue during the day which means more money in your pocket ready for reinvestment health and safety there may be lines when you purchase something of questionable quality and we don't blame you cutting corners is just good business there are steps you can the good guys or you don't get sued for it and that brings us to liability being a thrifty shopper is smart but be aware that buying things on sale comes with a certain amount of risk aside from the daily risk of lawsuits there's also the risk that something might be hiding inside whatever you just purchased with that steeply discounted price tag yep of course that would only be a serious danger if there were something outside that's been trying to get in for months now which we are not confirming to be the case this concludes the amount of a legally obligated to provide remember you are now the face of the newly rebranded Freddy fazbear's pizza we're at a smile with pride and let's make some money fazbear entertainment is not responsible for disappearance death or dismemberment I don't like the disclaimer at the ends okay so we if you know what franchisee is basically say McDonald's is a franchise company so basically McDonald's give you their branding and stuff and then you put up the money you basically buy a McDonald's restaurant and that's what they're doing a pretty fazbear which is probably where they went wrong with all the animatronics and stuff so how to a two step guide to restaurant management use catalog mode to purchase items animatronics and other supplies then use blueprint mode to place items up great items and upgrade your floor plan okay I'm ready let's do this let's become a franchisee of Freddy fazbear's what I've always wanted to be day one let's see how much cash you had leftover after purchasing your franchise package okay great that should be more than enough now let's get started on your left are your product catalogs you can unlock more expensive catalogs by simply purchasing items for your pizzeria okay use the arrows in the bottom right of the item window to browse the products for each catalog when you're finished shopping click the button labeled blueprint mode to place your items you can switch back and forth between catalog mode and blueprint mode as often as you like before opening your doors to the public suite when you're ready to open your restaurant for business for the day click the button labeled finished in blueprint mode give it a try and do some shopping okay so basically is this like wait a second is this like yes like a tycoon game you know like restaurant tycoons rollercoaster tycoons that's cool right or to go back to the catalog we've got um loads of different catalogs but only the dumpster diver Weekly is available which kind of includes stuff like this the discount ball pit which is absolutely terrible and increases our liability risk paper cups and paper plates you can obviously get different upgrades single stage stage for one light animatronic too like animatronics sanitation station but we've only got a hundred dollars to spend this is gonna be difficult of cooling units a duck pond I like the duck pond and then bucket Bob is haha fuck your pops the best animatronic ever guys this is so like different and unique if you are enjoying this so far leave a thumbs up because I feel like this is going to be quite the game like really really cool what else do we got mr. can do mr. hugs the Hoover number one crates we can't unlock these though I'll look the paper pals atmosphere plus one there are only $5 I'm gonna buy that and then we should be able to put them down right are they on animatronic though oh you can't just you can't place them what's this sponsorship offer my risk is three I have ten play tokens left of great disre larger floorplan a few upgrades right let's do some other things I like the discount ball pit but it increases our liability risk I kind of like it though let's buy this can we put it down anywhere wanna put this here there we go fast rating 50 boom you can add safety straps clean and polish at a coin slot play test so we play test the ball pit oh my goodness what oh geez okay we need him to jump in there is this guy as well he's kind of cute I don't have to do is blow my minds oh no I killed him it's so funny right now now now now now now now now now no I'm sorry sorry round three come on I'm gonna kill you this time buddy oh jeez I'm not doing very well here am i I don't know who this new guy is but I keep on killing him come on I need to get at least one point I think this is rigged yes I got 200 points that's not talking about this is so weird I got an extra rating for that do I can I play test it more than once I feel like I can do better yeah 200 points because it increases your Foust rating but also if we're doing this for the kids as well they have potential to die which is horrible right I got to that's better I know I miss silent it goes after I forgot how many rounds there are although I've got 600 points though I think there's five rounds is that yeah that's it 600 points okay that's not so bad it's better than before and my fast rating goes up to 850 all it's using my play tokens no a liability is quite high so I'm a little bit worried how much money do we have we need a stage right I can't afford that I'm going to a single stage let's buy that and then that's just gonna place there I can put animatronic on it now that's what I'm talking about which animatronic should we go for bucket Bob mr. Karnes ooh mr. hugs or the number one crates or pants fan item condition very good this one's got a liability risk I think bucket Bob's my favorite guys he's got entertainment value of one that's perfect and let's add him straight into here buck your poppers arrived guys up to 950 rating what is this fist time pop soda have a popping good time at this time pop this time pop Inc is offering to pay for advertising your staff in your establishment to either say yes gives us 250 dollars give me that moolah and then they've just got like advertising around that's not so bad right right we need some more things let's get a balloon barrel we've got a new catalog as well boo boo a foil party set speaker said his stuff is so expensive oh my goodness look at gumball swivel hands he's a legend he'll give us three bonus revenue as well oh my goodness look at this what are our animatronic options happy frog mr. hippo Ned's bear pig patch and candy cadets whoa I feel like going big with gumball swivel hands I'm doing it I'm doing it I'm placing him on the stage let's see what happens wait wait no I need to get you out of here I can't please things haven't got the right storage I messed up I can buy the stage though it says fly this I don't know why I would fill my place of animatronics because it's obviously not gonna be great is it oh oh he's not even another metonic I just wasted my money on a stage as well fantastic what else can we buy we've got $15 left can we buy anything else I don't think we can oh we can buy the paper cups and paper plates I can't even say it I think we've spent all our money guys We certainly have we've got paper plates tables a gumball machine which will give us extra revenue and not sure what the play tokens are let's see what happens when we click finished what's going to happen here your restaurant is now officially open yeah that doesn't mean your job is finished however a lot of work to do while patrons eat their pizza in the other room okay from your terminal you have supplies to buy papers to print and repairs to make know once you've taken care of all the items on your to-do list you can log off for the day and get out of there money for supplies and repairs comes out of petty cash oh no hurry about it coming out of your pocket we've got you covered the only money you have to worry about is if you choose to upgrade any of the equipment in your office now on to other matters something to be aware of is that the ventilation system and your terminal are pretty loud and okay event you from hearing things in adjoining air vents ah no problem if there is nothing in the vents however if you feel that something might be in the vents you have a few tools at your disposal to buff you can shut off your terminal and the ventilation system at any time to decrease the amount of attention you are drawing to yourself also shining your light directly into a vent will most likely prevent anything from jumping out you also have three tools available from the terminal itself there is a motion detector an audio decoy and a secondary ventilation unit keep in mind however that you can only have one of these active at any given time now get to it simply log off when you've completed your tasks for the day and you can go get some coffee okay fantastic so um I guess it's blowing my mind look at these pictures as well this one's a really creepy one so we have in the bottom right hand corner we have the heats but we're not gonna be able to hear what's coming at us activate motion scanning select a room to activate music silent ventilation is a secondary ventilation since the runs in the background creating minimal noise oh my goodness we to order supplies as well but I have like no money right what's that oh it's like dial-up internet oh my goodness this is going to be so difficult and really difficult I can't I don't know what I'm gonna do do I need to order all of these things ah no no this is a youtube skip oh my goodness oh I got give an extra money and now it's messed with my system dude that's annoying that's so annoying haha okay I'm gonna order all these things so I can turn things off I can turn off the fans and listen but there's no cameras and there's nothing else but I can turn my computer back on order some cups and we should be fine but the heat is going up really really quickly you I need to I need to figure this out quick what's a really hot temperature is that 80 is that hot I don't read oh oh yeah 80 talk 80 talk quick turn the fans on but with the fans you can't hear what's going on oh man my brain okay so we need to complete all these tasks before before someone jumps ours I don't really know turn off the fans and just click all these things and see what happens I'm very nervous guys very nervous activate motion scanning let's see what happens so this is the thing he said you can only do at one point right you can only do either motion or audio you can't do both at the same time let's turn the fans back on okay I think I'm getting it it's still scanning alright can I do some tasks while I do this as well come on print what kind of ancient technology is this my goodness right last thing to print and then we've got a couple more tasks it's still during the motion scan why is it taking so long to scan the motion I'm kind of nervous that I haven't actually heard anything yet I keep turning my fans on and off so I can try and hear but I'm not hearing nothing and there's like there's no power the only thing that you can the only thing you can affect is the the temperature right maintenance unclog the toilets please and then I think these are the only few tasks left but look you can't even you can't even block the vents they're just gonna be straight up attacking you if anyone even arrives I am so on edge I can also buy upgrades as well but I already got two tasks left and then I'm done here oh man oh man it's good it gets so hot in here so quickly I don't even know what I meant to be listening out for either and you can play music in each place okay maybe there is no motion maybe that's what it means oh this is weird this is so weird so it all geez no put the fans on it almost four guys almost 90 degrees up in here okay Ivan's are done just the bulbs to go and let's just keep playing music arounds this scan for motion as well I'm guessing if it would come up if there's any motion right that's what I'm thinking right replace the bulbs I think we're safe I'm pretty sure we're safe this is just like a tutorial it's my first day on the job the first day I'm running my own restaurant and I'm done I'm done right order supplies log off great job it looks like you're getting the hang of this yeah now let's just focus on getting you through your first week thank you here's a big party here Saturday and you should view that day as your ultimate test okay make it through Saturday and you will have proven yourself as the successful entrepreneur that we all know you can be thanks buddy thanks man no regulations on completing your first day bang however your job isn't over just yet oh there is another aspect to your end of day routine and that is inspecting and salvaging any animatronics found in the alley outside the back door things are found here quite often and while we aren't sure why what we do know is that they can be used for parts which can mean a much needed revenue boost before starting your next day okay of course as with everything else in this line of work those benefits come with risk the safest thing to do is to throw it back outside but then you get no money for the salvage okay is to keep it and you run the risk of certain negative consequences namely death to the item in question not be as docile as it first appeared great if you do decide to try to salvage it then you must complete the maintenance checklist during this testing phase check on the animatronic frequency if you feel that it is becoming unstable use the Taser provided to you you can use it three times without damaging the hardware every use over three however will decrease the items salvage value okay before you is an animatronic found in the back alley we are unsure of its origins it is your job to complete the maintenance checklist before claiming it as Salvage or if you choose to you can throw it back into the alley where you found it and forfeit payment please make your choice now okay so basically we find all of these animatronics in the alleyway we can either do the little minigame thing the the process to be able to fix it use it in our restaurant I guess and get $500 or we can just throw it back not get the money and be safe cuz I'm gonna guess I'm gonna throw out there that if you salvage the animatronic successfully then he becomes a problem when you're doing your shift because we didn't own any animatronics in that first level and nothing surprised us nothing was motion-tracking I'm gonna guess that's what happened I'm gonna try and salvage you interested with the maintenance checklist yeah member use your company as you taser to return the animatronic to a neutral state if you feel that it's becoming unstable or aggressive okay you can only use it three times before it begins to damage the animatronics yeah resets value fine begin audio prompt in three well here we got one so we need to zap it if it gets rowdy seems to be fine seems to be ok this guy is freaky right so he had no response begin audio prompt in three two this is actually terrifying to look at any clues of him going to jump away he's okay he's fine okay two down three to go you didn't even get to the next one in three two one here we go I can hear it did you hear that I think he's okay I think he's fine document result I can hear like I can hear clicking no something is our ones no no dodo dodo dodo so it does the opposite so when you hear the clicking you have to zabbix it's like winding down oh no right we've got 26 visitors we made 200 and something dollars we had one lawsuits and now that thing is loose oh no oh no we're in big trouble guys big trouble what happens a young boy suffered debilitating external and internal injuries because of the conduct exhibited by fazbear entertainment he broke 100 bones and suffered severe internal bleeding while patronizing fazbear entertainment what although he didn't notice his broken bones until he got home his parents believe fazbear's should still answer is no no no no I don't think so so I can settle and make them be quiet for $800 which I don't have or do legal fees for 425 I still don't have I think we could fight it on - a - but it's gonna be fine gave it your best shot you went all in you put all your eggs into one basket and I did the thinkable you ran out of cash while we encourage entrepreneurs to follow their dreams we also recognize a lost cause when we see one no there are no do-overs and we trust that you know your way out but before you go take this certificate of bankruptcy now do everyone a favor and get lost Ivo fired's so if you have - a tool you get fired yeah it's just crash the game it's loose you just crash the game ok fantastic beautiful it's dead the game was gone how interesting is that though so you get one shot and then you just run through wonder what happens if I fire up the game again it literally just throws you back you must have to do it all in one go that is unreal that's actually crazy right this game is cool it's really cool so there you go that is the new five nights at Freddy's game lots of people recording at five nights at Freddy's 6 a lot of people are saying it's not five nights at Freddy's 6 but it's a way fuller game than I thought it was gonna be so I'm gonna call it 5 nights at freddy 6 for now anyway guys that was our first attempt if you would like to see me attempt some more attempts of running my own pizzeria with my animatronics then let me know I think the only reason I failed is because I got - as soon as you hit - you're done for but I'm not sure what else I could have done but hey that's where more videos come in so if you're excited for more of this and really really enjoyed this one then let me know by hitting that big fat like button that'd be greatly appreciated and it's time to be the first video you see mommy and you're looking

amazing with all my death points as well it looks it looks even better hey welcome back it to the unnamed series what I've happily called the greatest Minecraft series you have ever seen that's the official name now last time we built this amazing pink treehouse don't worry if you're not caught up you're gonna see it all today I was just about to say I think we're pretty much done which is a complete lie we're not completely done at all but we've made some progress enough progress so that we don't have to deal with nasties all the time because it's winter it's dark pretty much 80% of the time which means there's monsters absolutely everywhere oh and just as an added kick in the teeth nothing grows in winter so we're gonna try and solve that today I kind of just want to sit and stare at this it's so beautiful but um you know I need to sleep my health isn't looking too great so let's do that right now Kapow Kapow what please please are you kidding me I just I lit up the whole thing underneath my tree so this would not happen this is the worst day ever I think I say that every time I play this game where are you where are you you think you're being funny huh you think this is funny you want to kill me again I don't think there's been an episode where I haven't died so oh you're right there how can I sneak Lee get this guy oh hello no I said not no um no cold callers please can you leave thank you I don't even have any arrows well wait a second my sword has some abilities I completely forgot we can give it wait how many how do we know how much we've got two ability tokens blood last courses enemies have come with it weakens and blinds enemies heels the user back a portion of the damage dealt oh that's amazing let's do that yes now now I need to be very very careful one arrow to the face and I'm dead ha public what did I just say what did I just say so annoying why is my bed missing or obstructed I actually slept in it the other day pack this pack is supposed to be a peaceful farming pack but no it has other ideas for me it just wants me to die a painful death every single time I load it up even if the sky is pretty it just wants me to die all my stuff is just exploded all over the place and I never can really keep track of what I was doing has he gone now did you just shoot me and leave do you think that's funny you think that's really funny don't you thank you buddy unless he climbed the ladder and is waiting to ping me in the face again it could it could happen sleep do not let that happen again my home is here see we've cemented it actually was was that the first time you slept in that beds that might be why that's uh no it's snowing again I hate this so much but look how majestic this sauce looks so plans for today I am oh this reminds me the fish way to go to the fishing hole today it's Tuesday so that should be okay I also need to pay a little visit to you left because I need to build something else and I want to move everything from down there up here including tree Oris because he needs to keep an eye on this place right I'm also gonna steal some things as well be right back I'm on bum bum bum bum bum turn away you don't want to see this if I turn my back on you that means technically you haven't seen me thank you for the leather buddy greatly appreciated haha I think I got away with it well there's an angry dog down there what's wrong with its eyes at no no no not again not again not again I hate these things that is the main reason why I stole the leather I'm gonna make a full set of leather armor I know let's not get too crazy but I need some kind of armor otherwise I'm gonna keep dying over and over again I have like no hearts no nothing apparently we need a church to be able to get hearts you can actually buy hearts from a church which sounds a little bit crazy and weird but it's true and where did that angry dog go that's a little bit terrifying but hey you know what that was free it's absolutely fine he won't miss it Willy he'll be fine absolutely fine right now I can take on this skeleton wherever it is hopefully anywhere Jesus creepers down there too this is just the just a scariest pack ever it's supposed to be nice and peaceful about farming and stuff but no it's just oh oh what just happened there what has happened actually aren't they like father and daughter I'm pretty sure let's skip that so I actually really want a fishing hole because that means that I can make money during winter and I think I can afford one I just need 16 little logs and I also want these as well I need to take all of these things we can finally get rid of all of this nonsense right here absolutely atrocious thanks for being my home for like ten episodes though really appreciate it need to take all my valuables up as well this is gonna be a long process but it's gonna be worth it at you have more valuable than I thought I did to be honest 16 logs I have 17 that's perfect let's grab these and let's grab ourselves a new blueprint the fishing hole is coming in and hopefully I am able to buy a fishing rod as well which would be good and start making me some money because the cows and stuff just think gutting it you live I would like to purchase the fishing hole thank you sir what does it look like it looks absolutely beautiful oh geez I thought I heard a creeper why now why when are you open as well I don't think he tells me hello when are you open oh he's open now okay so fishing net place in watering give a fishing rod I really really need this but it's 75

rods you can't actually see it it's just my face a diamond fishing rods let's hope that this works and that means I'm not gonna go hungry anymore thanks buddy where should we build this I feel like you should go I don't know is this like a diving board thing where does the water come into it I'm so confused I think I'll work best if I put it there yes and then take out those blocks and doing this by the way because apparent you can catch fish that are better in the fishing hole so let's shift the right quick let's break these blocks right here and hopefully you'll if will do his thing I think I can hear him already now let's try out the diamond fishing rod as well I want to try it from a safe place so I'm gonna try it from G yeah here should be fine right it's oh I fell off let's try it from here see if we can catch some amazing fish this could have been a biggest waste of money in the history of this video and the series but let's let's try is it getting dark already I haven't even tended to my animals and stuff oh did you see that it went under I didn't actually do anything that was weird come on yes oh I got a muskellunge I don't even know what that is but I got one look

come on allow me to set it now and say that BAM yes da perfect right let's do this nonsense real quick and then we'll get back to some more fishing how's it going guys how you're doing sheep I hate you there was some cow treats as well unfortunately these aren't for you you can't even try them milk milk milk still can't milk them more than once buddy what's going on Oh have a friends I don't even know what that achievement is so many fireworks like goodness I have no idea what that did I'll be there for you haha that's funny I'm friends or one of these guys and I have no idea who it is let's brush you sheet because I haven't brushed you for a long time there we go beautiful right there was a creeper stirring around here this was an Enderman as well which is fine let's just pop these back and let's go back up to our house sleep a little bit and see how much money we get I got one single fish which is amazing come on please be a 1000 goldfish it was Oh actually it wasn't that bad I'm pretty impressed right I also want to test out this sword and also my armor just because apparently this gives me health back which sounds amazing I'm not gonna let you hit me though to find out how is the fishing hole coming along actually looks like it might be done is it done you live you legend he's already done it I haven't got any torches to light it up otherwise I will get stabbed in the back by something but look at this this is cool actually made the little pool itself as well let's see what we can fish from here I got what's what a message in a bottle that's insane what is going on I didn't know you could get these right I'm gonna have to put some water in a bottle and quickly drink it and hopefully nothing stabs me in the back and then we'll see what's inside this thing we've got a secret message in a bottle from fishing that's crazy what does it say boom dear fans hi sincerely shadow climber um that's possibly the weirdest thing that's ever happened uh so I was gonna be a little bit better than that no go light let's let's fish some more that was weird a bone fantastic this is actually really cool because you do get loads of weird stuff you just need to listen for the sound and then drag you dragged your rod in there we go we've got a catfish 51 pounds that's massive and a bass 25 pounds amazing Oh boots no way we've got ultra rare boots I don't know what the difference is but I got them and more boots I didn't even need to steal them I just could have fished them a log as well driftwood okay can I use that for anything it doesn't even play the song anymore cuz it feels so bad for me I've died twice in this episode already and my bed just doesn't work that's fantastic hopefully you didn't blow up the fishing hole right that would have been awful please protect the fishing Hall I don't know actually no it's it's slightly broken just don't take my fishing rod oh my goodness this is such a mess such a mess Bam Bam Bam and I'm missing my pants there they are thank you no one wants to see that pig I sweat you're gonna have to get out of here I'm sorry I'm really sorry kind of not sorry this is not good at all look at it it's properly broken do I put it I think I put it upside down right like this is it fixed now I think it's fixed now well I got my fish back my driftwood back you can make it oh wow nice okay so you can make it into oak wood planks I don't know why you're so excited about that but I did luckily I didn't have that many things on me I'm just gonna carry on fishing this feels higher up but hey you know what it's fine I'm just gonna keep on fishing a tin can Quebec you can smell - into iron that's amazing I'm just gonna keep on fishing till we can find what is that a treasure chest no no way a treasure chest that's amazing I mean to throw that my goodness look at this a full-on treasure chest let's see what's inside there is an emerald that's actually a pretty sweet I like that I like that a lot till all this is great Oh a goldfish wait a second can I you turn into a gold nugget oh that that feels mean I can turn that into raw fish fill it as well bass raw fish fill it catfish raw fish fit okay so this is a good source of food as well I kind of want to put the goldfish in a bowl can I do that let's search gold fish no you can let you just do that maybe bowl bowl no what is that a futura block that's insane fish bowl you can actually get a fish bowl but I don't think it's gonna is gonna house our goldfish so I know what to do with it we are going to put it in lights and frame that's literally it ohyeah we can eat it what happens if we eat algae Oh No okay no adverse effects whatsoever that's perfect how relaxing is this fishing up sticks fishing up fish fishing up boots this is great what was that a brick a box what can I use this box for can I use it for anything oh it had a piece of stone in it this is so random what was that we have another goldfish great we're gonna make a goldfish collection it's happening okay it's getting dark I have a nice array of items right now so what I'm gonna do is see how much all of these fish get me and see if it's a viable option without handing any of this stuff I got a lock box it's why I didn't realize right let's sort this out one two three four five six seven eight nine fish so nine fish have gone in let's see how much money that gets us overnight I'm gonna leave my animals for now hopefully they don't die let's see what happens hopefully it gets us a lot I'm gonna keep the goldfish I don't want them to go I'm gonna keep them let's see what's in the lockbox as well we're fishing up all kinds of hidden treasure we got gunpowder interesting we can also change this into normal wood so we're fishing up resources as well this can be smelted into iron blocks which is why on ingots anyway that's amazing we can eat algae which is great we've fished up some sticks to make torches this is great and we've got boots that we can give absolutely everyone I'm gonna be the most popular human here and emeralds we've got an emerald as well we got three that's impressive right I'm gonna do something I am going to spawn points because apparently that's broken and sleep there we go sleeping done Hey look it actually works that's so cool do some more fishing I want some more buried treasure ow no no I am gonna SAP life from you let's see if this works it does did you see that I gained the health back was that due to my hunger because I'm an absolute beast I'm not sure but I took those arrows like a champ right in the back of the neck actually there's one thing I wanted to try which you guys said in the comments is their shields there is I can make myself a shield why would I not do this what is that dog did you hear that dog look at this dog this is the dog I was talking about earlier it's so angry it's chasing the skeletons away why is it so angry that's amazing I am NOT gonna argue with that but he's protecting me that's perfect right so you guys suggested to make a shield so that I can protect myself from the skeletons which I am going to do 1 iron and I think it's wood as well we can use the wood that we got from the UM from the fishing hole there we go shield perfect yeah there we go can we serve a shield that's the perfect addition to try and get these skeletons out of the way let's try it out let's see if we can find any oh jeez no not you not you definitely not you there's one there's a scallop on right there hopefully the creeper isn't following me but we should yes be able to block them yeah go on fire you punks get out of here ha ha ha that is great I also need the bones as well to grow my sakura trees so whatever they're called you know ok the shield is a great idea thank you guys let's also light up this right here because the fishing hole is feeling a little bit dark I need to get some dirt to fill in the gaps as well because you know we died let's do some more fishing I also didn't take no what money I made actually I literally have no idea it was at least a thousand though that's good Oh an apple how on earth did I fish up an Apple that is random ok I have plenty of fish I have 1 2 3 4 I have 9 fish and how many pairs of boots six so I'm gonna gift some pairs of boots and I'm also gonna put these fish away just to see how much they actually make just because I didn't pay attention last time 9 fish to goldfish let's go give some shoes away you live I'm gonna gift you this held item thank you I will give you these I appreciate this no problem UNEP did you actually take the shoes I don't feel like you took the shoes where are the very rare ones let's give them away no you can have these ones buddy enjoy I really do appreciate it but I could not accept another gift from you today you're not fine I will give them to you don't want to give them to I'm gonna give it to this guy the ultra rare boots go to you Jim enjoy buddy this is a decent decent gift Jim you supposed to be more helpful than that boots for you as well Johan you want some this gift is good thank you buddy Jenny hey don't mind if I do I'm just a little bit little bit peckish thank you but don't worry I will give you these boots in return gifts out item a good friend you are no problem I'm giving boots out to everyone aren't I the best yeah there might be a bit wet so you might have to dry them out first actually I'm gonna give some to my fishing buddy just because he's gifted me the amazing ability to pretty much fish up whatever I want thanks for the kind gift no problem buddy I see you later I want some more bear treasure hey we won't know the message in a bottle let's grab this turn that into bone meal let's see what it says BAM oh it's an error code yay how magical what a meaningful message I'm so pleased that I fished it up guys again sketchy it's getting sketchy I'm out here I've done a lot of fishing I got some more messages to read hopefully they work but I also need to put all these fish back in here I need to make a hopper desperately that's 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 okay 20 fish let's see how much money that gets us oh no I need to sort my animals out wait a second does that mean I get big milks from you why can't why can I milk you I can't milk a sheep I can't milk them that's random I'm out of here right 20 fish five seven seven nine let's see how much this goes up and more importantly three goldfish Oh before we go to bed actually that's smell the tin cans and let's open these messages that split them out first just in case oh are those coordinates 9.17 north 1989 east what let's know that down and then how do we even find out where that is can we look it up on the map I have no idea we'll figure that one out don't worry and I grind up my armor every morning and eat it for fast okay great you eat diamond armor I could use that actually that would be handy instead of eating it ah new day new death probably I got some more shoes as well that I can I don't know do they level up maybe at different times I'm gonna give some of my old shoes and try out these rare ones I wonder if they level up quicker oh I almost forgot about the gold again 8,200 say twenty fish got us up two thousand five hundred that's pretty good considering we were making no money before I see you buddy I'll see you down there you okay oh geez he just hit me he just hit me where is my shield where did my shield go did I do I sell it by accident umm I've lost my shield oh well let's make another one don't do that again okay where is this Punk where is he hello oh geez there he is I could take all the shots buddy don't you worry this is an amazing idea such a good idea like you can't even do anything and I'm getting I'm getting health back when I hit him crazy I'm actually fighting them with my brainpower this is such a massive improvement in myself what is going on over there did you see that there's flames is that one of those baby creepers again there's like flames coming from the Waypoint what is happening what is over there yeah it's a baby creeper why do they spout flames is it because they can make bigger explosions maybe oh geez yes the shield is great it definitely does a bigger explosion if in doubt block so you live actually I need to talk to you I want to see what blueprints we've got to work towards we have the clock maker the church I kind of wanna unlock the church like by hearts I don't know how expensive they are but I'm really interested in buying it actually you know what else I need to do I need to look into immersive engineering so engineering we need to craft a engineering manual this is none of them there it is Engineers manual it's a lever and a book so we need to work on that a hundred percent I think I'll do that in the next video though just because we need a whole episode to explore that wait a second wait wait a second what is wrong with my cows I think that's sick guys I think my cows are sick that's exactly what this is oh no this is bad this is bad news Jim Jim yeah I need help how much is medicine one thousand I'd have to buy three of them then we just check this is the case yes that is the case I need to spend three grand on my sick animals did I fail you or something what did i do what did I do wrong I did pay attention oh I didn't brush them I didn't brush them the key to a happy cow is brushing how could I forget I'm sorry guys I'm sorry please forgive me I guess I could brush you too I think I was supposed to brush the Sheep every day but it also makes me incredibly hungry The Hunger goes down whenever you do anything in this pack that is why couldn't milk you wasn't it so we've got a medium milk we got a small milk are you gonna give me a big milk cuz we're friends now you're not ok it's fine it's fine I'm not taking it personally how are you eating all of this fodder so quickly as well your your beasts ok no mystery is just loads of fish which is fine and actually I'm gonna make a hopper now I think I have actually you know what I don't think I have enough Oh hopper is okay I thought I was worried it was gonna be loads of blocks of iron but it's fine it's not we should be able to craft that just so I can plop them all in I'm pretty sure I can do that Jade mentioned that before and all of this oak wood has come in really handy today I'm impressed right let's grab the hopper let's pop the tin can in here because why not and hopefully this works otherwise Jada's lied to us here we go let's try this I think when my knees get rid of this button that does not look like it's working does it if I put it on top that should work right yeah it does okay right we can put that in there and hopefully that means we'll get our money that's way quicker perfect right last thing I want to do is grab myself some some sticks just because I want to make an item frame oh no oh no my chicken my chicken are completely forgotten about the chicken is he dead please don't be dead chicken he's still here oh thank goodness I'm so sorry I don't know if you have any food left I feel so bad I really needs I really need food I don't want this I don't want this guy to die right where is that leather let's grab this and hopefully this will work let's do that that boom and I want to put these somewhere I guess I could put them on there but eventually I want to make them into a like an aquarium yes this is perfect we can now have plans to make an aquarium awesome this is also the secret button it doesn't do anything right now but maybe in the future it will 7100 okay we're making like 2000 every fishing day which isn't so bad considering it gets dark and I could have made no money if I didn't have the fishing hole but look at our kingdom there's a baby spider down there as well first we need to get you up to the treehouse at some point but for now guys I think we've had a lot of progress today we've done a

hey guys how's it going welcome back to another stream where today I had nothing planned but I've wanted to do this for a while I wanted to jump back into the escapists too so that I could go ahead and try out the new custom prisons in the game because we've completed all of the prisons they're included in the game also prisons that aren't included that are downloaded through DLC we've done those as well so we're pretty well-versed in this game but now you can download prisons you can also create prisons upload prisons online as well so I wanted to jump into some of the hardest ones today and see if we could actually escape any I have no idea if we will be able to but I'm gonna give it a good go hey guys I can see you're bouncing in how's it going let's flick over to the escapists - lets open it up this get the music coming in and let's do this so um if you go over to here it says custom prisons you go onto the Steam Workshop if you do that it will just allow you to browse everything are there's tons and tons of Prisons on here which are pretty cool there's only a few that are really really good I guess but today we are starting off with subscribe I've got to I've got Alcatraz and I've also got the shangkun state pen now this one I think was a competition prison I'm not too sure but Alcatraz I think this is the one we should try straight away I'm have fun in this prison took five hours it's called Alcatraz because I've got the idea from the island Alcatraz in San Francisco now what is cool is I've actually been to Alcatraz not because I was locked up or anything crazy like that but because it's a it's like a tourist attraction now and I went to San Francisco not so long ago so let's do this let's hit empty got a load of cool little prisoners and guards over here let's start the game and let's see what happens I have no idea what's gonna happen but I really wanted to try out some of these prisons today I don't know how many we're gonna be able to try out today maybe just the one I don't even know if we're gonna be able to escape but they're apparently really really difficult I wonder if we can escape in a boat or whether we can escape in something else be pretty cool but take my picture buddy and let's get in here okay let's take a look at the map it's not gonna be a massive prison just because it's Alcatraz it's it's not gonna be a big one there's two floors there's a roof there's a vent awesome question is are there any payphones let's actually see what we've got in our desk first we want flour paint broom handle and rope which is contraband apparently and let's head straight into here now if there's no payphone which I don't think there will be there might be some problems up in here but first let's grab ourselves some of this some of these what's it called the favors and let's start earning us some money a beautiful painting he wants Wow a candle of course a razor blades yes of course look at this we've got like deck chairs that we can just chill out on I like this I like this a lot we've got a sign that is getting in our way is this oh look the gods stay with us this is a guard door that's pretty cool what else have we got I'm just gonna do a little bit of exploring looks like he's he's doing something what are you doing Jegs you're okay buddy actually I might need to move my a facecam real quick so let me just do that I usually put it down the bottom so let me just move that real quick move this all the way down er otherwise talking about to see the map which would suck for you guys there we go much better much much better that should allow you to see the map because it's pretty cool that you can see that as well right I like this number plate number plate that I'd be interesting we need a number plate we need a brazier blade I also need to learn this prison there's loads of like cop doors which is quite cool we should probably get studying as well just to get our um just to get our intelligence up apart from that this is gonna be a standard Prison Break I think that bounds in that's hilarious that's so funny haha oh man this is actually a really tiny prison apart from going up and down the stairs there's a random barbeque here as well I like I like yeah this is gonna be a standard prison break I think so we should probably get ourselves just as much as we can in intelligence and materials because we're gonna need to either dig screwdriver or pickaxe our way out of here I think the wall is gonna be the best way to get out of here but of course we're gonna have to do it without getting caught which is even harder of course and we're an Alcatraz smaller prison doesn't mean it's easier to find things but also means that is gonna be easier for them to find out the way we're chopping down the walls and stuff how are you guys doing I've wanted to do an escapist stream for so so long just because it's got to be the perfect game to stream right just because you've got um oh no he's tired at least we're close to the showers and then I need to raid wait where are showers I thought the showers are up here are they upstairs let's have a look see where the showers that we could probably just look on here they are going to be um yeah they're upstairs okay this isn't gonna be too bad I don't think a guards outfit would be sweet oh look there's the CCTV cameras everywhere as well another guards door there how on earth do I get in these showers guys this is crazy but yeah um this is the perfect perfect game to livestream just it takes so long sometimes some of the times that I records the escapists I can record for like an hour or two especially on the later prisons trying to get an escape in one video it's pretty intense yeah that's why I'm in prison because of the dab the other day huh is that why right I'm actually gonna quickly do this so these are back now this was broken earlier so I didn't have it on but I've put it back oh my goodness oh geez II just started beating him up for no reason come back here he's got a comb I could take the comb I'm gonna take the comb you didn't see anything with Dermot you saw nothing at all am I gonna get in trouble if I go in here because of the security cameras I don't think I am I think I'm gonna be okay I'll do he's got chocolate he's got nails he's got a box beautiful didn't need the box but that's fine I've also seen a lot of you guys getting the escapists for Christmas because it is on it's on PC it's also on PlayStation in that as well so if you guys skate this for Christmas hopefully I about to give you some tips and stuff at the same time it is job time I have no job which is fantastic I need to find where is my where's my cell my cell is up here I just need to hide some of this stuff all right let's get rid our screwdriver file chocolate can go in there whose lighter is this it's somebody's dudes sock in my outfits painting candle spy the candle isn't it yeah all right let's go into job period first just because we need to otherwise we'll get in trouble what time is it in England it's 10 minutes to 4:00 p.m. so probably very different so most of you guys unless of course you live in the UK who knows right job time done I never understand why we have to do that I guess so that we're in one place at one time let's raid some more things we've got some some errands to do we got bongos we've got a string I don't think I need any of that stuff either who wanted the bongos I keep pausing it by accident uh you where's dabs what a name we're just talking about that the dab that got me into prison again every single time he just crossed me dabs I've got this for you buddy enjoy yourself we need the candor let's go here oh I got the piece of string perfect I just need the wax now awesome this is a cool little prison I like it I like how its compact but it's also pretty um another file at CARFAX I need to craft the candle jeez okay let's do this this and this Kratz boom baboom where's the person who needs what yeah as I was saying this is a cool little prison Alcatraz it looks like we don't have any contraband detectors as well which is fantastic if we had contraband stunts elapids IAM grad contrabands - no no no I wanted your chocolate buddy but wanted your chocolate we had contraband sectors we would be in trouble it makes it so much harder it's a lunchtime let's go munch you munch I need to do as many of these as possible just to buy as much stuff as possible I just want to check that there's no payphones in here I can't remember what they look like but because this is a this is a fan-made prison I don't think there's going to be solid trees up here the job rooms over here they've got kennels as well interesting nope none at all right these guys are fighting a good tip as well if there's fighting is to just oh my goodness is a three-way fight is to ransack their body it's just because you could grab something pretty interesting that's just paper though so that's not gonna be that that's not gonna be that useful is it no steps steps no I want your know I wanted you whoever's on the floor nah I was trying to get whoever was on the floor and they weren't having it you're on the floor as well jeez washboard and a hankerchief I don't think so right we need to find Jude sock which is a little bit random also by doing the collection the collection missions another job time geez they are running us ragged already yeah by doing the the searching missions you get to search everyone's desk while completing some stuff for money which is quite goods I need to I feel like I need to go around the perimeter as well I'm a little bit worried that they're gonna release the dogs on me look at this thing oh no no no no I'm not I'm not doing anything I just need a sock and a mug and a magazine that's all I needed can you excuse me please I need to get to dad's desk suppose my summons get out of here perfect you didn't see me she actually didn't see me that's crazy Oh duct tape I knew that was a reason I checked this I'm gonna put the comb back I'm gonna grab this there's a trowel as well sorry the brush is gonna have to go this is some crazy good stuff actually for digging holes as well not so shabby Oh what's this you can go upstairs onto the roof but it's blocked how do you escape from the roof is there a way to do it let me know in the chat guys if there is a way to escape from the roof like if you can craft something to kind of abseil down that would be pretty cool because I've never done a roof escape before I know you can but I don't know if we're gonna be able to because there's fences and stuff you know what I mean we've got too much strong because we have got a rope can i craft what is the file and duct tape that's lightweight cutters isn't it I think I need more intelligence is there a way we can get out of here there's yeah actually how do we get out of here because there's just water I'm not sure how we have to escape this if there's water everywhere we can't craft boats and stuff but there must be a way out of here can we just go out the front that'd be pretty insane these guys are just beating up on each other let's see if they've got anything in their pockets literally no one is cept no one's paying attention to these guys at all don't they're going upstairs there they go look at them haha you have this and this I will take those because I can make what a putty with those right let's make sure we don't get in on big trouble need to go to exercise time chicken dinner that's not gonna help us get out is it a chicken dinner that'd be great though I'm pretty sure there's a way let me see if there's anything in the in the old crafting recipes let's go out to our cell for a second sort this out I have still got contraband on me I wanted to make a poster just so I can cut my way out what's above me it's not a vent above me I feel like I need a red key that would be awesome I don't know guys I don't know I need more intelligence as well shower time geez I feel like the clue is gonna be on the roof if you're going to escape Alcatraz and get on the roof there's an underground roads grappling hook that's the one let me see if I can craft one of those I don't know what it does though helicopter rides okay we need to go on the roof don't we we need a red key well let's do it let's do it have you got any money to buy anything got 80 coins I need battery it would be amazing because I can get batteries I need a paper clip as well though don't I Robin is selling a load of rubbish fantastic what do you sell him a load of rubbish fantastic all right we could get our strength up and stuff but you know that's not good either that's not good either let me take ya I need you up oh geez these guys are out of control I need to just increase my intelligence dinner time as well this is some intense schedule guys especially since you've got like two job periods as well it's gonna get pretty intense real quick just caught the officer having a shower that's a little bit awkward you're gonna play multiplayer on this app maybe maybe there's not much I can do all of the I guess I can do other multiplayer escapes at some point because those were some fun ones battery that's why I was just talking about seeds don't need seeds have you got a battery on you sir no you got a comb I mean a comb could be good actually thank you all right battery is good we also need a paper clear but duct tape and something to get rid of all this stuff I don't think we're gonna need a screwdriver you know just because there's no vents there's no ways to get in the vents here no we don't need a Ben we don't need this I'm gonna flush this away actually can I give it to someone who should I give it to let's give it to you because you sell things fun's oh I'm gifting you a screwdriver enjoy thank you buddy right it's free time let's see how we can get out of here apart from the roof I can't see anyway I'm gonna increase my intelligence and then we can go and explore need to see if there's a way to get out of fix there might just be no doors you might have to go through a wall but we've got some time it's okay we need to learn about this got ourselves a 17-2 into cuttings it in select I need some more intellectual be able to speak properly I'm trying to read your I'm trying to read the chat at the same time as doing this but it's difficult super duper good 52 come on is he getting tired he's down to 25 it's gonna be a bit more tired we could sit on the Sun Loungers that'll be great come on come on there we go one more we need 14 more look him laying down it's so cute bet you're not going to escape what I'm gonna do my best buddy I'm gonna do my best my very best the best there ever was so I'm gonna do oh look there's a generator we need to explore a little bit of a look yes a generator down here but what would that turn off I guess sir all we need to turn off okay we need to get in there definitely so we need a Sian key and we also need a red key he's got keys on don't we so the reason we need to turn the generator off is because upstairs on the second floor there's CCTV cameras and you're about to see how long it can sometimes take to get ourselves what we need for the keys but it's pretty intense sometimes let's do this these get ourself at the 70 just so we can cross some things and then we can try and get to the roof it's gonna be difficult but I think I'm gonna be able to do it just because we don't know who has the keys and they just have random keys at random points and then if we get caught we lose all our stuff it's a little bit upsetting but if you guys have any suggestions let me know in the chat that'd be amazing or if you've completed this prison before who knows come on come on get to 70 get to 70 get to 70 s not gonna do is e 69 69 that's awful come on did I can I dye my hair a galaxy color maybe maybe I'm not too sure it's kind of galaxy last time wasn't it right study up buddy you got one more intelligence point to get there we go right what do we need to do let's have a little bit of an explore of the perimeter I don't think there's an easy way to get outside you know or if there's any way to get outside we're proper stuck I think the only way out is going to be the roof oh there's a red key door here actually look at that sneaky sneaky let's do a quick perimeter check is roll call again fantastic we should be fine we haven't got any contraband on us all right let's do this the lighter yes I'm gonna grab a lighter cuz that can give me chocolate baseball bat sure where's the lighter one oh is that gonna be up in the guards room I hate it when you have the guards ones because you need a blue key to get it a blue key no you don't need a blue pin you need a red key it's fine we're good I actually need this lighter so I'm just gonna grab it boil sugar and cookies right so now we can quit this mission that's not gonna be great for our reputation but it gets us the item we want to make chocolate I need paper apparently I'm gonna grab it don't when you need anything else see that these are the cameras that we need to shut off and there's two sets of doors that's what we've got to do to get out of here guys who needed the piece of paper oh it's the painting oh jeez okay let's go back we should be able to craft the chocolate now and pick a guard to smack down but we do need talcum powder as well actually so maybe not so you can combine these paper I'm gonna keep right that's sleep productive first date I've got to say I've got to say that wasn't so bad let's just get ourselves a role cool after I check for what's in Bobby's desk where you are dudes what's inside exactly the same as before I need talcum powder desperado there's anyone selling any that'd be fantastic saying duct tape and a lighter I'm gonna buy the lighter just because I can get another hot chocolate going there's a lot of people selling things what a party boom I didn't even know you could get that man's just selling us putty that's she phenomenal I did not know that you could do that just by party another lighter chocolates Jude which a mission no I'm not gonna be any one up okay that's actually pretty good we got putty already that means that if we find someone with key that we need we can do that right away we've also got a second lighter so we can melt down this plastic we are running out of we are running out of things here to put in our contraband you know I'm gonna do I don't think I need duct tape for anything right now I'm gonna crack myself some cutters just to get rid of three contraband and then we can melt this here we go melty melty crafts that's molten plastic for you got our putty as well and then we can also craft this that is not what I wanted to do this this Ness craft hot chocolates with the hot chocolate is a band item I guess really weird that's amazing you can buy a putty though it means you don't need to find yourself there's another putty I'm gonna take it this is great so we need two keys that's gonna be the that's going to be the goal of today we need two keys we need the cyan one and the red one to hopefully get onto the roof we also need a guards outfit which we can steal two words of putty that's great who should we eat shoe should we knock out first we got free time and we've got the opportunity to knock some punk out oh my goodness there's two in there officer bounine told you no no no I thought I was gonna do that then and then they walked across maybe I could go upstairs oh no I can't do it upstairs either because they're security cameras I need to be careful with this real careful so I don't to lose why I'm not gonna lose my party am i okay he's going in there fine I need to kind of corner someone anyone through this way that would be handy all right where are they where are they gonna be where they're by themselves they were all kind of behind their doors in the stuff some in the gym upstairs I don't would be the best but there's the security cameras up there only in big trouble right I might do this now do it do it do it do it he's got the red key quick Kraft perfect put this back lighter I'm gonna steal I'm also gonna steal this as well let's get back let's get back come on come on we got this we got this put it I just did it I just did it tonight I've got the guards outfit though oh come on buddy don't hit me don't hit me I just want to put the guards outfit away come on come on oh I did it I actually did it yes you know what hit me I don't even care haha we did it we got the red key beautiful we've got punched for our time but it's fine so we've got one red key which is all we need to get to the roof but I think if we do that we need to shut down the generator or do we direct can we do what I'm thinking is we don't need to because if we get a guard if we've got a guards outfit if we have one of those then we should be they wouldn't even think that it's us right that's what I'm thinking anyway right let's get rid of windows jobs I am they snitched on you I know I know what's wrong with them I think we're doing pretty good though to be fair we've got a red key already that was potluck sometimes you can go round around in circles finding the UM the red key I don't know I don't know if we need to cause there's two doors would you have spare putty to be honest let's craft this right now let's craft listen this boom red key fantastic what's got another lighter which is great so we can make some more plastic I don't need this rope I'm just gonna get rid of this rope go away but yeah I don't know whether it's just go for it because I don't know use too much of my door I will take this thank you get loads of good stuff actually let's do a little let's do a little lucky up here shall we I'll see what we need to do right so these are the double doors if I'm wearing a guards outfit I don't know if I get um if I get pinged by them do you know if you guys know then then let me know in the in the chat because that wouldn't make sense if you're a guard and you go upstairs you shouldn't get pinged by the CCTV right but then I don't know what's upstairs cuz you're gonna lose 10% each of geez why these out hello snow guys what are you doing are they gonna sniff out contraband on me no that's unfair okay we need to be careful pose Wow but upstairs you let you have the roof and that's it this is open I want to try it I'm just gonna try it but I need to do at the right time I need to do after roll call before things get real sketchy at night time we can go out the front as well maybe nope you just go into the control room it's good that we have the key on top of the guard now as well alright let's just make this a normal day let's but that's um let's behave ourselves as much as we can steal as many things as we can or what should go to lunch time I guess we could do some what's that what are they called we could do some of the jobs not jobs favors let's do some of the favors just to get ourselves a little bit more um more money just in case we do fail cuz this could go very well or it could go very very badly you don't get pings nice okay perfect we know exactly what we're gonna do then don't we can you excuse me sir okay so you don't get caught perfect so you need we can just do this if we escape literary within like 25 minutes that would be absolutely insane can you excuse me please I need to grab something so polite even in prison even in prison let's grab that yeah I grab a cup as well that's great and we listen me the fine art brush first need to go to my job so enough to generator just to be sure the Rope can craft the hook okay oh yeah I did just do that didn't I why did I do that why did I do that okay that was an idiot thing to do we must get some more rope later just unlock the customization item guys watch outs yeah what do you need to be careful of these dogs those I am worried about but I want to test that actually oh there's rope in here yeah let's test it so if we do have let me just graph this quick I've got a painting right if I have contraband on me did the dog sniff me out yep they do okay I'm a hundred already perfect so we need to literally run upstairs and then we turn it after me stop tell it on me you punk give you your painting enjoy buddy enjoy yeah they're literally just yeah okay the dogs are gonna be a problem the dogs are gonna be a big problem yes they're hunting me down right now ow how many officers there are what's mutters oh my Guinness looks beyond saving Wow not sure I'm beyond saving but just leave them up cuts my bruises I've got an escape plan I didn't actually see what time these love sleeping was comedian mates outfit let's go this way yeah I'm excited we might actually be able to depending what's on the roof we actually have no way of seeing it depending on what's on the roof we could be goods I do have the rope now which is goods actually did I did I save the Rope I don't even think I did I need the comb those are dead right now desk wasn't there disgusting but it's exercise time that's upstairs isn't it it's upstairs no it's downstairs showers are upstairs there we go where's our friends that we need to give this inmate outfit to where you're at you are this guy nice hat buddy I have razor blade as well man those dogs they're the only thing I'm worried about apart from that use a contraband pouch I see your buddy I see you of the great ideas we've got this that's the wrong desk but I'm gonna take this anyway haha how the wire wouldbegoods just in case I need to zapper for later there we go yeah I'm the a contraband pouch I think I should be able to buy one so let's do that isn't it funny that a mug of hot chocolate is contraband but a razor blade isn't not sure that that's how it should work really but hey let's see if who's got a contraband pouch for sale 35 absolute bargain absolute bargain we will need to test this out though just to check that this doesn't happen we don't need to give this to you there we go I need a piece of contraband that I don't mind losing wires not even contraband nails ass grab nails shall we this is just a test just to see if the dogs don't sniff me out yeah let's see I'm going I'm going as well I don't know if the dogs use up your contraband pouch because the only way I know of using your contraband pouch is through the contraband detectors but there's none of those in this prison oh I'm going the wrong way keep forgetting there's no door there alright let's have a look dogs I got nails in my pocket and I want to see if you're gonna find him have a look here where are they where the puppies hey puppies how's it going I can't even go in there blue Fergie I know it worked I think it works blue is not smelling me not smelling me at all great okay we have the perfect plan we need to wait till nighttime and we're out of here guys I don't need these nails you can drop these on the floor hey enjoy Oh No he watched you watch me do it he watch me put them down no uh we can have a well-deserved meal now let's grab a meal let's sit our butts down and let's sit back and enjoy ourselves great I'm excited to see what's on the roof considering there's two red doors between us and the roof it's pretty scary stuff right let's I'm just doing a double check up in here so yeah it definitely shows us the red doors cuz it's weird patch here and I'm just worried the there were doors on it but there's not it's absolutely fine when can we do this I'm getting a little bit impatient I don't need the flour free time I could do it now I guess it is risky but I could do it now I just want to get rid of a couple things I mean the broom I'm not gonna need the tin of paint either all right I'm flushing you flush flush flush goodbye thank you oh geez whoops did not mean to do that let's put that in there that in there contraband pouch we have should I just go no I'm gonna wait I'm gonna wait just because I'm pretty sure after free time it's gonna be roll call do I need a lights or anything I do everything is really cheap in this one as well really cheap you're gonna take a few more favors destroy the tube of glue oh geez he's got a whiting someone read the post on the floor don't even like me why is that yeah I'm gonna do it now don't worry I'm gonna do it need a bed dummy oh yeah I need a bed dummy you know what's we just go let's do it let's do it we got this we got this it doesn't even matter cuz we've got contraband detectors I'm going boys and girls ladies and gentlemen let's see what's on the roof let's do this quick switcheroo there we go we're on the roof we are on the roof hello there's a helicopter there's a helicopter we did it ha ha ha we escaped Alcatraz oh my goodness I'm so pleased so pleased we got a as well that was lucky so so lucky I am actually amazed that we managed to do that's so quick literally took us how long 13 minutes Wow Wow you know that is actually the reason we managed to do that is because we found the red key so quickly hey that wasn't so bad that wasn't so bad at all now this one this one looks like it could be a handful this is I actually didn't think I'd escaped prison today that was no editing no nothing we did in 13 minutes thanks for your help guys as well because you guys helped me because you said about the guards outfit not being detected by the cameras so thank you right should we move on to another prison I think we should this one I don't think I'll be able to escape today but I'm gonna do it anyway welcome to shanked and State Penn your new home for the foreseeable future since I've been warden we've had a few daring escapes among us and due to the prison had undergone renovation to make  ships little one make it secure from escaping okay let's do this look how many guards there are look how many prisoners there are let's go we're going into another one we do the red one has been chosen you missed the escape don't worry you can scroll backwards in this stream if you miss some bits you can scroll backwards don't worry right don't go anywhere guys we're trying to escape another prison now that's I'm actually shocked that we ready to do that all right take my picture buddy look at this look at this bad boy this is massive there's contraband detectors in this one there's sniper towers in this one as well last one was a warm-up this one's massive two floors there's a roof the roof probably does not have itself a beautiful a convenient helicopter up there but it's fine all dudes look at these security cameras oh no oh no look there's double contrabands as well dude I'm gonna deliver the bottle of milk - chomps that's easy modes give it to Robin okay this is easy Robin where are you pretend flower Shore sure it's gonna grab all of these delivery driver this is amazing delivery driver ones are the best because you're like already here a roll call you need a mug okay who's gonna give me delivery drivers all the time deliver the fruit to Healey Road I've got so much money already I got myself 75 coins yes delivery driver again who is who needs this who needs this is someone over here deliver the bar table to Niko there we go we just made ourselves 100 $100 not bad hi this is prisons massive this is gonna be one of the toughest ones we've done I think there we go but hey at least we've got one escape under our belts I'm gonna go snooping off are we gonna get caught by these doesn't it like it a battery duct tape and a trowel fantastic only problem is how do I get that back to my cell without going through the contraband detectors I'm not sure if I can I need to go I can okay perfect is this similar to the is this a remake of the other one actually I feel like I've been on this bit before right we need to be so careful perfect perfect perfect good start where is he gonna send us next it's gonna send us to job time which is up here this place is huge absolutely massive there's red key doors through here job times through here what jobs do we have in this literary - that's not good as ever that's not good at all well I need some intelligence as well let's do the boring stuff first and then we can get to the juicy stuff looks like we can get outside so let's have a quick look outside first and then we can go for it but Wow one escape under our belts and not only a prison escape we escaped the one and only Alcatraz one of the the most the real-life equivalent of this one right here the unescapable prison I think when I went there it only said that one person escapes and they still don't know where they are which is quite crazy they've probably been playing the escape is for so long that they can escape prison themselves ok 43 job sorry the showers nearby I don't know if it's ours in nearby and there must be upstairs I like the downstairs perfect I think I can sit here though skids way slow mode on because there are so many people here it just has to be I'm sorry just getting some getting some lightning bolts back and then actually while we're getting some lightning bolts back let's quickly take a look outside just remember look up here what can we do out here we've got barbecue area this is a pretty nice prison if I do say so myself looks like our perimeter escape could be just cutting our way out of here oh no is there moves all the way around is that it looks like there might be other rules up here I can't even see ya there's walls up there maybe digging under them let's see if there's any see if there's any doors around something down here we just go and check that out definitely it's free time so we're gonna check that out anyway have you ever have ever seen a prison with a fountain and a lake I didn't think so that's pretty impressive to escape just flush yourself out that would be an amazing amazing way of escaping right don't think you can that would be great if you have any ideas for escaping for this one guys cuz you did tell me to go to the roof in the last one if you have any ideas for escape and then let me know in the chat that'd be great but I don't know how well we're gonna get how far we're gonna get through on this I just need to get myself up to 70 I remember in the old escapist in The Escapist one your intellect would slowly deplete over time that made the game so much harder than it needed to be like so hard alright let's go and see what we got some free time what is going on down that bottom left-hand side of the prison what's this you can just go up the balcony okay that's not so bad all right down the bottom left wasn't it there are purple keys though and these guys are fighting what you're doing oh they're shooting him did you see that yeah boss woman you could have caught that bullet looks like we have literally a way to get out just here front door escape anyone should we go for that what we need to do though we needs there's a purple key exists it's not a thing I don't know if it is we do need a purple key and we also need cutters that's pretty much it and a guards outfit and do it out lights out which is between I think it's even 1 or 2 p.m. not 100% sure should we do that those we do a front front door escape we have got vents as well actually it's a good point where the vents leave the vents only leads to vents are only leading to each other's cells that's it we only have vents to each other cells that's not really helpful at all unfortunately that's a good idea though I rarely use the vents just because they're quite risky yeah let's try a front door escape if we escape to in one that'd be that'd be unreal to prisons in one stream we just need a little bit of luck that's all you need a little bit luck with finding the key for starters the purple key I think is one of the hardest to find we can't do it in daylight we could camp out and we could put a bed dummy and actually we might not need the purple key at all if we get a bed dummy and then just camp out here outside the whole time that might work there's only one way to find out will that work though let me know so I don't wanna get shot for my troubles what are you doing delivery driver I can deliver a cake sure give me this I can take the cake for myself whose cake is this is this yours Tony this is your cake buddy nom the delivery driver one for the best look at this you can make so much money from this is it jumbo given the delivery driver ones so many favors ok we do have a fashion victim located guards outfit for Nikko that would be amazing you know where the payphones are I don't think there's any payphones on this one just because it's a user made prison don't think there's any payphones it's a job office they're like the little is symbol no payphones guys we're doing this alone I need to do some more favors get some more money about 150 which isn't so bad I haven't been checking who's getting um contraband it either probably because my desk is most of the time pretty goods so I don't worry too much all right what should we do I guess we need to buy some things we need to steal some things as well so let's just keep I've looked in this desk governor let's just keep looking for stuff this is the baton why are they both searching that desk that's weird we can take a whole we could do that'd be great Oh another battery that's perfect a cup awesome sorry sorry hundreds y'all what's what have we got hundred for that that's insane no no no you know what just beat me up you're gonna beat me up anyway leave me alone leave me alone I will punch back I'll punch you buddy leave me alone I'm just gonna run it I'm in solitary confinement fantastic this is the worst place to be tell me take me I'm gonna need a guards outfit where is the guards outfits over to the right somewhere I'm gonna miss exercise time if you don't come and get me guys and then we're in big trouble and blame on you play more just dance that'll be funny by the line stream it's so tiring though like when I don't do much exercise anyway doing a stream of Just Dance would be insane why where is this exercise periods through here nice so we're almost quit we're doing pretty good actually we need stun-gun actually don't need any of these things these things are not complaining but these things seem so cheap cheap even Oh 25 or deep dude dude why you so angry I wanted to buy something from you I swear someone just had a pile for 20 for less than 25 did they that's 25 yours is no get off what do you have a sock I'm trying to get these people are just a sock fantastic shower time just down here perfect I can check all the prices of everything 25 seems to be the cheapest for a file which ain't so bad I can buy two of them right now it should be amazing 25 again a lighter as well so we are picking up a lot of cash we got 135 coins 25 you I think 25 is gonna be the cheapest this is buy two of those and get those back oh no we're not about to get them back 25 25 35 for a contraband pouch yeah you know what what a putt see as well he won't it's it won't it won't tell me I've got no imagery space contraband pouch is actually perfect in this situation there we go I'm glad that we can buy them just because otherwise we're gonna be in big trouble man how am I gonna do I have enough intellect to crappies now I'm worried that I don't I do okay perfect contraband pouch battery battery foil I'm not even gonna need that foil battery cut what are you looking at buddy not doing anything I have nothing to do here hahaha we need the guards outfit yes we do and we can get a guards outfit from this job which is great so we're gonna do that in a minute now contraband pouch was nice sneaky move I like it where do we get this guards outfit from where I play get the sock I don't need the sock yes I'm making a live video it's a lot of fun make a live video orange how compounder in blue that's actually good and a file as well need to get this through all the detectors and stuff it's hard doing it this way at least there is a way to get there without the contraband detectors going off it's longer but it's way better you late to the stream do not worry guys if you're late to the stream you can scroll backwards and then just catch up as it as it goes it's not so bad right boom boom that means we can now make was it toothpaste actually which is the one way you make I always get them confused putty is toothpaste okay so I don't actually need to glue at all so I always get confused I always think that you needs the glue but then I accidentally make paper mache it's really bad haha right what am i doing while goes in there we need to get this to somebody who needs this you better not be in oh where is he where is he sorry about it you're in there Nikko yeah come to me buddy I need to actually I need this don't I sorry I'm gonna steal it Geron - that's a treat mug from Neko I don't know if I want to do that I don't wanna beat anyone up because that's a fads make a poster that means they're gonna be able to grab us some duct tape that's perfect as well so I'm not gonna do these missions I'm just gonna use them to get what I want they just need flimsy cutters in duct tape tasty I'm not gonna need that right now though there's so many desks that we can grab stuff from so it's not actually that hard another file as well that's great I'm gonna cancel this mission I'm sorry buddy I'm real sorry I'm kind of not but there's so many desks to explore let's just do our no and they're gonna if they catch me they're gonna just pounce me though I don't know why it gets up so quickly I don't lose this stuff I don't lose this stuff I don't wanna lose his staff well let's go let's go let's put this back I don't know for how much intelligence I have I need some intelligence to make these sturdy cutters and then I can do it you're more bulky than this prison I like it I am NOT as bulky as this prison we've got so much of this stuff this is perfect ah yes this is going too well I'm a little bit worried this is going too well I need a lighter what do I need this for I need the crayon for a certain mission I pretend flour I mean I could do that I need some money anyway just to grab some other stuff well I think we're good hello sir you seem to be on the floor you got nothing anyway it's fine oh please go away McDermott I don't want to see you here ever again man I don't know if this is gonna be a good idea more toothpaste more toothpaste I'm worried so my plan is to just literally just cut through the front door my problem is unless I get the purple key I'm not gonna be able to get out and my worry is that if I don't I'm gonna grab that if I don't do it the purple key way I'm just gonna get shot by snipers which is worrying me a little bit right let's put all this together there we go pretend flower who wants mother who wants the flower I think we can do this I reckon we can do this where's my friend that needs a flower where are you you doing up here oh you're outside I was like why you waitin solid tree did you you did something bad didn't you we wants a cup of more chocolate yo that's amazing you don't know how good that is I need to change this

evil villain let's do this the delivery driver missions are paying off dividends we can buy things from people as well looking for a waterpot see my friend I can find your water putty in and steal it Cameron I got too many favors let's get rid of Oh deliver the tube of glue I can do that right now can't I Robin needs to go over here how much money I 155 that ain't so bad oh no quick quick quick quick put this in it take I'll need the pee face locate a makeshift double-bass I will grab that hopefully they don't see me these security cameras aren't so bad actually it's got lots of sugar for some reason who needs this come on steps where are you I can't see on all these people where is he hello where are you oh he is in there he's in there somewhere where is he is this him it's that guy up buddy I've got double bass for you it's what you've always wanted happy late Christmas enjoy buddy all right what are we doing what are we doing a cup of molten chocolate I certainly can do that right now we've got a healthy amount of money what's white you moaning at me stop that whose desk to get in surgeon I keep forgetting to check that but I need to grab this molten copper chocolate and let's do this then we're good let's go and put this back into our desk that means we can knock out a guard if we do need the purple key we can take it a few jabs at it and knock out a couple of guards because we are gonna find a water putty in a second as well which is great let me just see if I put it back in my desk safely I need to be super careful here because there's so much just so much stuff around I might throw away the foil in the trout I don't think I'm gonna be digging anytime soon so I now can get rid of that mission I now can do the water potty mission oh it's gonna get me to craft it that's lame let's go this way so if I'm going quite trying to concentrate on trying not to walk through all the the contraband sectors by accident luckily this stuff is not contraband which is great we haven't had to go upstairs yet either I don't think we ever need to go upstairs so what else do we need we just need I think we've actually got everything so far apart from the bed dummy which is easy to craft anyway you know I'm gonna grab that stuff now give me your stuff give me this thank you I wasn't doing anything is it two pillows and a bedsheet so let's grab that and then let's do a quick recap of what we're doing yeah you're not going to search my desk why is there two what do I need this yeah craft the water putty boom now I'm gonna cancel that mission there we go right I need your pillow please sir thank you I'm gonna put this down and then craft myself a bed dummy there we go I've got a lot of contraband now though actually the water putty isn't contraband that's fine let's go what are you doing Smith us get out him up get out of my self bed dummy wait did we not have the officers outfit I thought we did I swear we had it oh that's annoying we're gonna have to buy one okay a bottle of milk I guess we're gonna need to knock out guard anyway so let's try that we need the key if possible if we can get the purple key that would be insane then we then we can escape this then we can escape this dying garden dying who do I need to give this to are they outside yes they are why would you need me to deliver you some milk I've stolen someone's milk guys bad she's stolen it from them alright let's these guys are just being a little suspicious and sneaky ad she they're fighting okay can I give this to you please can I give this to you please I can't give it to them and that's because they're fighting I want to give you your milk I stole it I can't interact with any of these guys they're just like properly glitched out there is no purple key are you sure I'm pretty sure there is a purple key and wave these guys just like actually fight into my pension I just want to give you this that's all I wanted to do that's all I wanted to do stop stop this right now I'm gonna search if there is a purple key in two seconds leave me alone leave me alone I'm trying to give you milk bro I feel like if I go close to him he's gonna punch me or he's just gonna follow me this is awkward it's like a just a line of people oh my gosh yes it works you know what get out of here jeez that was annoying yeah this is set this oh yeah I'm just gonna quickly search if there's a purple key purple key escapists to just to see if there is one yeah there are our purple keys public you can be used to leads oh you can lose you can be found on guards yeah you can't find them some kids I just need this guy to be picked up so I can give him his milk I do need some more intelligence actually just do that ID he's got up to 17 just so I can craft the better snippers and then we can do a couple of shots at getting the key what's good is most guards have a lighter on them so we can use that to make a second cup of chocolate yeah we just need a purple key and then we're out of here luckily there's a lot of space but we have to do it inside so though he's gonna get shot which would be well less than ideal right you know what I can't get in there that's a blue door what they're doing I am going to try it now why are you in why are you in here what are you doing you don't want to be searching my desk get out get out wait a second where is all this stuff going I definitely had a cup of chocolate where did it go does it get deleted if you don't do the mission if I do this it doesn't delete my milk that's so weird I had I'm mad I'm so mad I had the chocolate ready to go it's gone actually gone that's so annoying so annoying well fine right the putty stayed though I'm losing my mind I'm actually losing my mind did I just not pick it up I definitely picked it up all right let's try some mission showing medical mess she still needs card game he wants a hankerchief try out some more of these destroy this magazine take this tub of talcum powder and deliver it okay I will do that deliver this bar of chocolate to ride Donal might steal it actually did the guard take it I don't think my god I like I didn't have it I didn't um I don't know I'm confused so confused maybe if you don't put it inside I don't know guys have no idea now just deleted two missions as well some reason yeah let's do that it's lunchtime it's lunchtime right I've got some foods I'm so confused how that didn't work I have got bed dummy now though so we're kids lighter thank you sir thank you very much right let's knock out guard the coffee drank the coffee drank the chocolate what's what does they even mean I'm gonna try knock out guard now let's see if they have any kind of keys on them you are sorry like CCTV cameras though not on that I want this cup of chocolate boom boom boom it's my favorite thing in the game we do need our water putty don't need that for now it's gonna change to something job time what is it what is it what is it exercise time okay okay I'm gonna put this away I'm gonna flush this and then go to exercise time gonna flush this up here I don't know what you use foil for actually alright let's exercise this stretch those limbs let's get them nice and loose hardness like a we've been slept yet I think we have it feels like a really long day right let's see what we can smack down we need to do it in a very discreet location and also a location that doesn't have contraband detectors which is gonna be almost impossible can't go in the showers the showers would be a good idea we can go in the showers we can't go in the showers is blocked we if we take someone down we're just are you know what let's just do it officer Sarge is gonna get smacked sorry I'm sorry you've got the red key you know what I'm gonna do it anyway just in case boom boom boom and boom I'm gonna oh my goodness red key mode okay I'm gonna get detected but I just want to get it into my into my desk quick quick quick desk boom I've got one key at least I've got the red key just in case I have got another wad of putty so it's fine really really wanted myself that purple key though really wanted it it's okay it's fine I just got to smack down to the max at least I've got the red key now the red key is usually the one I desperately want as well watch it the red key door down there we could try a different escape route but surely there's walls there red key there red key there okay we could chip through the walls but can you if you dig do you need what I need timber to get under red keys not bad you know red keys not bad at all I kind of prefer the cut out the front method though I think that's gonna be better that's one we're gonna be able to try it today anyway at least we have two options to do whatever we like he's got some bongos I don't think I don't think many people in prison say that they need to find some bongos let's grab those we need a cup that'll be great thank you very much and let's get these two Healy Oh actually let's do job time first cuz Healey is gonna be in this job anyway red key this way that's weird red key to have let's start searching some desks I need what do I need a lighter I guess I need a lighter to make another molten chocolate there it is boom smashed it and I'm gonna get smacked down again fantastic isn't this just the best I need a timber brace what even just for oh my goodness tell me look how many prisoners are prison guards are after me do I need a timber brace just dig down one across two and out one do I need it for that much a bit stop it stop it I need to deliver this he's outside no buddy I needed to deliver the bongos to you there were so many officers chasing me down that's insane right I still think we should attempt to cut through the front fence today I think we can hide without getting a shot as long as we're in a guards outfit I'm pretty sure then we need to wait till lights out and then just cut through that fence boy then we're out of here I feel like there's gonna be some kind of thing in our way like a bullet to the face I don't know all right where is this chump is the outside it's gonna be outside his knee I just need to deliver these bongos to you buddy that's all I want to do free time perfect his equalist again he might be glitched again they're all up here kind of glitch oh geez you just got smacked down buddy where are you why are you hanging out up here you planning an escape no it's just chilling by the lounge's great what's up yeah red key up there detectors out there there's another place you can cut out up here I like I like but you do need a looks like you need a cyan key that's a bit terrifying let's go and recce the place one more time just cuz I'm a little bit worried why is there a one half a star security as well still weird oh look you need two keys to get up there that's insane my so grab a job from this guy is that a tiny book yes I'll destroy the magazine don't worry all right this is where we're gonna go well it you're just gonna cut out here and leave that's gonna be my plan I don't think this can go wrong we can hide in here and as soon as because there'll be a bed dummy they won't discover us I think this is gonna work this has to work it has to every good if I could get the better cutters though I need some duct tape I think nope need some duct tape need some duct tape I forgot about getting the cuz forgot about it come on let's grab some more actually this is check what we need I need I definitely need duct tape I don't know if I need another file though let's have a look-see what do we need no we just need one duct tape to make the best cutters and then we can get our butts out of here I need to buy some things from somebody that's at least this to do this mission quickly first so we're doing pretty well so far this is gonna be it we're gonna do it I just need to grab this and then flush it don't I get out of here put meself some more money to go to spend on things unfortunately there's literally no one selling anything no those guys are fighting what's upstairs literally just this there's hardly anything oh there is something what is that way no idea there's a vent we could use the vent I think this is gonna be the good a good way to do it and do one more one attempt where's all the shops are people down there I just trying to find duct tape desperately and grab this as well actually the pen sheets just laying on the floor that's hilarious ha ha there we go this needs to go to someone what am i doing where are you where are you Oh is this person selling duct tape please no the problem is roll call has all these things around it so if we buy one we're gonna be in trouble I just really desperately need one there we go grabbed it let's just put this away come on come on come on come on come on no no no no no this is bad this is bad this is really bad can I put it clip it down here and just do that I think I can do that are they gonna grab it they're gonna grab it no I think the cutters might still be able to work though even though they're lightweight ones I think we're okay man it's gonna be too difficult to do otherwise I'm gonna try though I'm gonna try we could do this we can do this actually no I can't do this can I need to do it a rolecall because otherwise all the doors gonna be locked I don't think there's a way out now let's have a quick look nope they're locked okay I messed that up let's do one more day then now give us a chance to get more lightweight cutters that's fine all right let's take a snooze snooze you lose you love the thumbnail the stream thank you haha I do too anyone want to sell me any kind of duct tape I just need some duct tape Frankie my man hasn't got any duct tape Jude hasn't who's this Cameron he hasn't either Jenkins Jenkins got some that's good if we can get some of Jenkins I need to deliver this someone whose is this ship there you go perfect right um yeah I need to

Leiter fantastic I will take that out what are you smacking me I haven't done much to you stop it leave me alone leave me alone dude you're so mean oh my goodness everyone's coming in the amount of times I've been beating up is unreal so far this is actually hard get the public key as well yeah I could get the purple key but it's risky I do need to try and knock some people out failed to do that I don't if I'll be able to but yeah the purple key is super rare we've already got the red key which is really really good but to get the purple key is super rare so I'm not gonna hold my breath I can't plug the toilet don't you worry I got you just need someone to sell me some duct tape that isn't inside this tiny place I've got the money for it I got 170 dollars coins whatever you want to call them camera and you let me down is there anyone who's gonna have it there's a lot of desks to search though it was really really good because no I'm not doing it I'm not doing it I'm not doing it I'm not doing it because that means you have just way more chance to find things because sometimes in the in the prisons that don't have many prisoners it just takes so long to find certain things it's not that fun when you're just trying to rinse as many desks as possible in a day so this is much better here we go here we go here we go let's try and find this duct tape there's so many guards so many any secret chest lying around I don't think so look how many are just here what's going on killer guards yeah I could kill a guards let's see if we got the materials I think we do I'm gonna do it guys you told me to so I'm gonna do it I need okay I haven't got any chocolate fantastic I'm gonna have to grab some chocolate I swear stuff keeps going missing from my desk I'm almost positive I don't want the trowel either you know yeah I'm gonna get rid of this need to just remember it's in there yes just need some chocolate boys there's a glitch duct tape wrong Rover got duct tape literally just in front of us that was amazing I didn't even notice I was reading the chat right let's craft these there we go so that reduces our contraband as well there we go so we got sturdy cutters we need oh we we wouldn't been able to do it because we need a guards outfit so we do need to knock out a guards which means we do need some chocolate desperately don't be looking in there I think you keep stealing my things I need chocolate chocolate chocolate chocolate so I could try and buy some actually need chocolate and a guards outfit they've got loads of contraband jeez right are you selling chocolate you are boom you're a legends absolute legends right who should we knock out we need to choose someone who haven't knocked out already I think we're only knocked out one person we also need to steal their outfit and get it back to the base in time this could be the cop this could be the person quick craft yes and then let's grab this I've got two spaces as well this is great great news oh my goodness things are going down their focus is on someone else no I can't go through there there's someone in the showers I could jump them but I have to go through the contrabands detector I just need to pick someone and hope that they have the purple key I think I think it's gonna be you or if I might beat you down already he's not happy with me already so I might have done but no it would show it would show the key wouldn't it someone's got the key already right where's the key where's the key where's the key oh jeez there's definitely someone with a key above their head there it is okay perfect hello you seem to be inside my um you seem to be inside my honors to Sian key you know what let's do it oh geez not any deeds I need this I need this perfect you know what I'm just gonna give it to them back so I don't want to get done for that perfect nothing happens here nothing happens we've got the guards outfit haha that's fantastic right one more piece we need is the purple key but I don't think we can don't if we can get the purple key we're gonna try because that's the only thing we've got left to do really until oh no no no no PC okay I thought it's gonna search my desk because like I was worried then the boat isn't good enough to float I have no idea what you're talking about and why twice it's by sitting here are you okay I just unlocked a new thing as our but yeah we don't have much to do apart from knock out guards and hope that they have the right key on them let's do this roll call another roll call super glue whose trooper glue is this I need to return it to you it's yours there you go right do we need anything else what was we just thinking we need something to knock guards out with so I guess more chocolate or see if anyone's wanting any weapons okay let's grab that you have got putty I don't really need putty or duct tape tubing don't need tubing vent cover definitely no dead rats makes it double base don't need that right you need so many random things okay you know what we're just gonna have to wait until we just have to wait until role cool like the evening roll call we have everything else just last time I didn't realize that I didn't have a I didn't realize it didn't have a what's it called a guards outfit but we're gonna do this we're gonna do this we shall escape we should escape nicely and in one piece hopefully the only other thing we can do is literally I need duct tape I've got duct tape now let's do a final check just to make sure pretty sure I have duct tape though yeah we got the sturdy cutters those are the best ones you can get we've got the bed dummy which are going to put in here and then the guards outfit which we're gonna camp with so we have everything we need officer Mac I wish I could knock you out right now but I need a cup and some chocolate so I can't do it your pig is an escapist what is your pig doing in prison dudes oh there was a cop in there let me grab the cup boom gonna get put in back in prison inside prison for stealing cups alright exercise time I think what I need now is chocolate but I don't have anyone selling any then we can try at least punch down one more guard let me see actually I'm just thinking in my head if I if I'm going quiet that means I'm thinking it takes me a lot of a lot of effort to think Sam I need you Sam coming up Sam some are we start punched someone jeez everyone's in a fight you guys are crazy but you're not selling chocolate Cameron buddy you send in chocolate Cameron Cameron Cameron he's not selling chocolate Frankie is selling chocolate thank you buddy what I was gonna say is we could just walk out couldn't we yeah we could actually do it all right we can't you smack down one more guard now well there's a guard den here a guard is dead a guard is dead how's the purple key oh no I'm in trouble I am in trouble I'm in big big trouble okay let's quickly craft this and then put it on the grounds y'all that's lucky that's so lucky why was he on the ground why was he on the ground like that yo did you see that did you see that we literally just found him on the floor and they're going into lockdown okay that's fine you know what absolutely fine it wasn't me a key went missing it wasn't me it wasn't me I left it on the floor it's absolutely fine lockdown could be a problem for later though we found that though that's so good haha I'm impressed really impressed look at these dogs these dogs are trying to find the key the cops are beating up everyone oh my goodness absolutely a Nathan Lee oh we're go down to zero I hope that goes down to zero yes yes that's amazing that's actually amazing we now have the purple key as well we don't need this chocolate no more greatness has happened make plastic I can make plastic I need oh no I don't even know if I need it though I need a comb but I don't even know if I need the Keeks if I do it the way I've been planning to the whole time I should just be able to camp out and change what I need to but hey we can see if anyone's got a key no we've got the key see if anyone's got a comb that we can melt that was amazing see what I mean about luck sometimes it's just the luck that you need has anyone got a comb no just need to snoop just need to snoop a little bit of a comb then we're good calm River if anyone has any in their desk I would have picked it up I usually do pick up the plastic maybe not but hey escape attempt is coming in I am so hyped for this I wouldn't do anything sir nothing at all just move along move along come on I need a comb or a toothbrush that's a mug I don't need a mug okay I still can't believe that luck we were just about to try and knock someone out but the pub would he the purple the purple key does exist as you've just seen it's a real good it's actually getting towards nighttime and then we're gonna go for our escape you know how I either have two socks though why is everyone in my wise one everyone in my business don't want you in my business we just need to remember to put the bed dummy in take the cutters with us and the guards outfit we have a contraband pouch as well that'd be amazing okay we're good we see to get through this day oh you've got a comb on you but if I get caught stealing I'm gonna be in trouble you know what forget it there we go I got the comb Oh luck has been crazy use a spoon I couldn't use a spoon but this way was more fun I just got absolutely destroyed so I was just checking something come on just need to wait out this day and then we goods is the escape is free unfortunately not but there's lots of sales on steam at the moment so you could get it in just cheaper which could be quite goods in the Steam sale or it's on Xbox some ps4 I think that's actually I might want to switch soon as well well let's go made this plastic still got those bed sheets on the floor and still no replacement sheets so awkward so unfortunate right okay they should mind their own business right I don't want to craft illegal things in front of them purple key mold beautiful look at that the purple key does exists you guys doubted me but they exist they do exist what am I gonna do now sorry IQ quit quitting the game by accident I just need to wait free time and then during roll call I need to attend a roll call put the bed dummy in the bed and then I'm done get out of here yeah that's pretty much it I'm gonna take the pouch with me as well just in case apart from that I don't really know how else to do I'm just waiting until the right time I'm just gonna triple triple check my route so when he gets a roll call roll call this up you're going collect my things and then go down left out of these doors and then down again and then when you head straight to this place down here are there's a searchlight okay we need to be careful of the searchlights and just chill as a guard until 2 a.m. until the lights go out and then that's it easy mode then we're out of here but yeah these lights are troublesome very troublesome I don't know when lights go out whether those go out as well because what these do is they will give you a hundreds one hundred heat straight away do I need a weapon I don't need a weapon I just need to cut these things and get out that's all I need to do and I'm pretty sure they're only take 4 cuts and we're goods I'm stuck stuck by a random bush that's our route though I think it's coming up to roll cool next we need to prepare ourselves let's do this it's our prison escape attempt and we're gonna try I'm sorry sorry I didn't mean to hit you in the face I'm so sorry oh here we go roll call activated let's get out of this pot this puppy boom-boom-boom bed dummy how you doing I'm gonna put you in there snuggle up nice and tight contraband pouch almost forgot that out of embarrassing wouldn't it what else we need to do I just need to not get my desk searched as well because that would be annoying but let's get out of here contraband pouch is being used you need to look out for the lights as well but as long as we're a guards and we're hiding we're fine This Is It this is it this is it are you ready I hope you're ready because this is gonna be the prison escape of a lifetime hopefully it works I'm gonna changes my guards outfit now and my heat doesn't go up I was worried that the guard towers makes it so that your your guards go up they're gonna search my desk they're going to search my desk this could be it this could be it we could be done for out of all the times for them to search my desk I don't need the purple key guys of all the times I searched my desk they choose now hopefully the bed dummy fools them otherwise I'm in big trouble this could be it we could be done we could be done don't notice the dummy of all the times they searched my desk now over the whole stream an hour and a half we haven't been desk searched and they do it now come on yes this is working this is working okay we need to look out for these spotlights hopefully the spotlights turn off and then we can just cut through return to sell again what what's going on why is it telling me to do it again oh is this I think I need to wait until 1:00 a.m. because if I cut then the towers will shoot me try to get a gun I don't think you can't get a fake gun in the escapists - but you can't get a real gun that would be like insane looks like the the bed dummy has fooled them though I'm just waiting for the snipers to go to beds and then we can get out of here if we could do two of the hardest prisons on the workshop in one stream that'd be phenomenal I'm worried that this was way too easy well not not really too easy but I guess we're just running out the front door right what happens is that it is that it lights are out does that mean lights are out I'm gonna wait till 2 a.m. just because I don't I don't know if it's gonna is gonna kick me out let's just see oh wait the spotlights are gone yes oh no they haven't I thought the spotlights went I was like yeah we're gonna wait till 2 a.m. we're gonna wait till 2 a.m. and then cut this cut this bad boy get ready guys get my shears out ready to go and we're gonna cut our way to freedom we've got 30 seconds to wait these spotlights need to go away though cuz that makes me nervous oh man oh man come on come on we can do this I always get so nervous no matter how many times I play The Escapist and escape something I am I always get nervous escaping come on come on come on when it hits 2:00 a.m. I'm going for it if it doesn't allow me to cut these wires then I am done for right 2 a.m. perfect let's why are these being so pesky these searchlights there we go yes we haven't been shot okay the searchlights are coming in this is good we're actually gonna be able to do this I just need the searchlights to go away and then we've got this come on come on come on one go go go go go yes yes this searchlight is gonna be an absolute Ponk but let's get out of here yes yes yes we did it we did it that took way longer but we did it guys oh I guess leave a thumbs up if you are watching right now because we just escaped the two hardest prisons on the workshop that is crazy two custom prisons in one and a half hours that is Mads that is so mad we did this one shanked in state pen and Alcatraz broke we did it we actually did it I didn't think that would work I'm so happy guys that was phenomenal I am so happy that you guys were able to join me for that let's get to a big camera there we go put the sub counts back on because they're alive but

either sides Bam Bam place down the flowerpot and place the other flower in okay that's easy enough boom and boom you do realize this is gonna summon a flower goddess right this is gonna be insane now keep right-clicking the flowerpot with a stick you should get a new flower the new flower drop it in the water and the goddess will spawn that's pretty crazy here we go it's happening yes goddess is bounty okay let's grab this flower and it says drop it right look look at it Charles I'm gonna make you sniff it sniff it without big nose of yours and here we go oh I was gonna say I don't think it works hey how are you uhm this is new this has never happened to us before I feel like I'm in a very very magical land right now apparently we need to speak to you how's it going hello my dear I'm not sure if I recognize you have we met um no we haven't is this your first time playing yes it is well they're nice to meet you I am the harvest goddess I like to tell you a little story a long time ago this land we live in and something was removed from their houses by a crazy storm forced out their homes now I hear they want to return back home where they belong but they need your help oh and just to let you know I will poof after a while you can always respawn me with the goddess flower I'll leave you one every time I leave I think that's all I have to tell you for now see you later where are you going what you gave me eight goddess flowers but hold on a second why hello my sweet it's nice to see you I've had a lot of thoughts about how we can get the town started so we need to make a town that sounds pretty cool I've heard rumors about a fellow called you LIF is an excellent carpenter he and his sister have been looking to take on a project and this could be the right thing for them Jade would be a perfect fit too as she loves nature would be a great asset for getting started I think we just need something to entice them perhaps if you can FET me two dozen dogs Oh logs and I have something for you that might just work okay two dozen logs that that's that's simple I pay to have lost my axe so two dozen is 24 I think oh she's disappeared right we got 24 now we need to throw this goddess flower back in the water so that she appears I'm gonna do it near here just cuz I've a built-in Waypoint right hello got ass I need you there she is right I got you two dozen logs oh hello again if you've forgotten we're looking to bring her first village is a town I just need two dozen logs and got the logs here they are perfect just what we need thanks a bunch I've got the perfect thing for you right here this is a structure blueprint you use them to select the area you want a building to be built you'll see a ghost image of a building when you have it selected once you've found the spot simply right click if you live isn't moved in yet he'll appear and get started working on the building right away I don't know why the goddess's voice is like this I'm sorry voices aren't my strong point you just have to wait a little while for him to be done and don't worry if he dies from some tragic accident he should respawn when the day passes over and get back to work immediately I think that's all I have to say so I'll leave you to get the carpenter house built oh one more thing before I forget once he's done building Jade should move in she normally hangs out upstairs I suggest that you go take her a flower as she has seeds she'll be happy to trade for them great I've got a oh my goodness are you kidding me dude this is insane look at this that's crazy Travis we are about to start and embark on an amazing adventure we're about to start our own town this is pretty crazy this is a big step for us a big step for mankind and I think I'm just gonna put the Carpenters you know here I guess here we go I'm placing it down I did it Hey it's you live sub you live sneak a right click to confirm right click to cancel I think oh it's it's in the hill a little bit let's see if I can Oh let's see if I can go in sides yeah it's kind of broken right click to cancel I'm gonna cancel it cuz I want to put it somewhere where it's not gonna be in the hill there you go that works sneak and right-click to confirm then you'll if who is currently inside the building should start boom go you live go look building this is mad I didn't know that this is what you did this is crazy trust you excited it looks like it I've just realized I don't have any food this is bad there's nighttime right pigs I'm coming for you I just earn an achievement level 2 press L with a weapon or arm in hands get started oh oh my goodness what is this abilities that's crazy so you can add things to your weapons that's cool right this light of this place that we don't get

Friday no way he's got sticks he's got a lever sorry buddy it's not pushing me I need to sleep is someone upstairs as well they said someone might be upstairs hey look it's Jade you have fake beds they have food ah this is the best place ever this is where I'm gonna lay my head for tonight yes don't judge me you live get back inside your house what is it because there's monsters down there really fine I'll just sleep down here there we go what a beautiful sound to wake up to so she said hey where did that come from did he do that it said I need to give her a flower so let's go for a daisy I'm sure she'll like that and then we'll see what she says hello this is slightly awkward but I've been told to give you this hey looks like you I can't even God told me all about you I can't wait to see the town grow I think the goddess wants to thank you for helping us out so you should go see her but afterwards please do come and back and visit me as I have something I'd love to show you okay Jade's thanks for taking my flower right this is our God s pool we can make this better later on but I think the goddess would like to see me there she is say God s how's it going well done dear this town will be but no time with you at the helm getting things done will probably cost you some money though so I'm happy to give you a starting gift of 1000 gold I hope you spend it wisely anyway you should be off to see Jade again now thanks for the help yeah I got me some money thanks God s this is too cool guys this is really cool hey EJ Jade hey as promised I have something to tell you about crop fun has anyone ever taught you before right she wants me to grow some turnips it's all about farming and making money in this well you have to water your crops otherwise they'll die she gave me a watering can guys jade is the best so this is a different kind of hoe i think i'm not sure how you craft one of these but we need to start making some things goddess watch me work apparently this does it in three three by three things so there you go that's that and she gave me some seeds yeah she did look hearty turnip seeds grow in three days let me see what happens yeah I'm a farmer I swear if you trample on these ha ha there we go right we need to water these bad boys now how does this work I see it goes like a darker color that's nice what did I say what did I say if you guys ruin this stop it wolf you've been bought onto the team and you trampling my crops right that should be done now let's grab the goddess flower back so we don't want to lose this right I'm putting down fences if any of you even think about even three even on these crops there will be there will be consequences especially uterus that's you Jade don't be sabotaging me ah so she can trade me a hoe if I need one right this is sealed off this is now not to be touched by anyone now we have to wait three three days your sword has leveled up to level two that's cool gives me an ability token sets enemies on fire stuns enemies or poisons them I'm setting them on fire definitely so the more you use each swords the more they level up that's nice so now if anyone does trample my crops I'm gonna whip them with this and they're gonna be on fire so I'm gonna sleep bye I'm sleeping in the day but I think that forwards time yeah you can still sleep that's actually really cool I love that cuz it my turnips are looking way better come on get out so I guess a day is passed when they are dry because you have to water them once a day look at these are they done they're done I love that feature that means you're not gonna spend too long waiting for things otherwise I would have had to wait three days nice I got ourselves some turnips I wonder if this is the amount that she needed it must be hell oh wow you've done a fantastic job growing these hearty turnips I'm tempted to take them for myself but you can keep them I don't want you to have wasted your time on me I probably should tell you you can sell whatever you grow for gold you just need a shopping bin if you want them you can buy them directly from my brother's shop when he's open for business to use them all you have to do is right-click with the item held in your hands they should be ready to be shipped in the morning you'll get gold for everything you ship if you don't want to ship everything by hand just place a hopper next to the bin and it will happily inserts profits go to ever place do it just to let you know though the turnips you've been growing are really worth much you'll need to grow some others which you can get from me if you want to make more money I do have a small supply but I'm happy to trade five flowers at any time I would suggest though that you talk to my brother and get the general store built as soon as possible the people there should be able to show you much more variety than I could ever as the last reward take this sickle something about dead ones oh look at this I have no idea what it does because I missed your talking but thanks I got more turnit seeds too these ones take five days but do they are they better ones maybe oh no what's happening why are they disappearing what happens what happens why did they go oh no wait my sickle disappeared as well this is not a this is not good if you look at four buildings I'm afraid I'm only available 9:00 a.m. till 5:30 Sunday to Friday so you're not open Saturday that's good cuz it's Thursday but we just need to wait a little bit okay so I need shares to trade for another sickle but I don't know why those turnips have gone on weird if I water them they just disappear this isn't fun let me see if I can trade these uh turnip seeds yes great Koopa okay so if we water it first it seems to work that's fine 9:00 a.m. buddy how's it going I need you I need to talk to you I've got the blessed blueprints around I want to shop with you so you can buy Adamo art six thousands gold a shipment box Oakwood general store yo you can buy so much from this dude you can buy stone beds deco bench clay what this is cool this is really cool so shipment box should be first because I need more money so I guess I need 16 logs right I got myself 16 analog how's it going I need this yes so this is the box that allows me to ship stuff off I think can I break this I can okay I'm gonna put this here there we go ah there we go I'm putting them all in so I can either eat these or ship them off only problem is I can't check what was inside by scent of some turnips and I guess we just wait till morning and see how much we earn guys I think I'm pretty

Are you sure we're not, are you sure we're underwater hold on a second yeah, that might actually be the ocean floor could be the moon though right so we have the whole breach with flooded the Engine and oxygen so we have oxygen which is a good start. Uh what does this say? Here's a small gift to repay your meddling. I hope you don't mind. I kept the pin for myself doctors or What are you talking about? What's in here a grenades? What doctor Zor has given us a grenade. Is that not gonna explode is this gonna explode um I'm just gonna put this here ah No, it's gonna explode. It's gonna explode.

Wow um... You guys love this game. I'm gonna be honest with you. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did the first Oh geez I need a drink. I have no fish. Oh geez means go get fish. Are you a Bladderfish? You a bladderfish. Oh, what's this look at this thing. Can I capture it come here come here Ah, there's one come here come here right now gotcha Gotcha, gotcha so I need supplies. We've got a big trip today; a big mission. I need to craft some water. There we go and then we need to go ahead and heads back down I think because oh geez that does not look good does it at all that looks better. That's much nicer right last time. We got a message because we repaired our radio, and we've got a crew report in 425 meters away, but I need to prepare for a 425 meter swim, so what I'm gonna do is I think I'm actually gonna put a locker down here because I'm Desperately running out of space if I put this just down here It should be fine like right underneath the pod right? That seems pretty cool to me And I'm gonna put stuff in here that I don't mind losing just because it could be really really dangerous But in this air definitely not putting gold in there the peepers can go in there that you I'm gonna need food then I can Just keep the locker underneath my escape pod. I think that's the best thing there you go. That's much better I can't put the creature again. This is what we need though we need fiber mesh and Lead's Because radiation is building And I'm not sure if radiation is gonna be near the other people so we need to work on that a hundred percent leave one More piece of lead and we need to go and grab some more of these But the different version because we have the knife now which is quite good Let's go we need to go to what I like to call the drop off That's right the drop off. Which is right here. Looks exactly the same as the drop off in Finding Nemo because I need these Apparently you can cut these I think yellow cuts vine with a knife ah there we go nice Yeah, I got the epic music and everything I'm not too sure how many of these we need I need to watch my oxygen is it going down it is going out Okay
I need the blueprints blueprints blueprints radiation suits we need to creepvine samples for a Fibermesh so we need four of them to get a radiation suit and then one piece of Lent okay That's cool was that LED silver. Yo silver. I think we needed that for something called a whole fish as well, okay They kind of look like the other ones, but not they've got a whole instead of an eye Yo, okay, what is that? What is that leave me alone leave me alone that thing just hurt me, bro What do you what is that? It's coming for me huh no no no no no Leave me alone leave me alone about it ammonia. Oh geez come on get in y'all are terrifying, right? I'm scared I can make fibermesh now, so I feel a little bit better about myself I can't find lead though like none of it. Oh look a Pathfinder tool deploys Holographic Pathfinder discs used to map away back out of caves or hard to navigate spaces Maximum 20 discs per path that scores like a waypoint system. We don't need creepvine samples for that I'm making myself another waterproof Locker because I'm just running out of space so Quickly I was want to make sure that punk is gone because he scared me. He was enormous there We go I can put them all down here which is gids Okay, so this knife can actually grab a lot of things. We got some coral tube sample and acid mushroom spores I didn't mean to get those I wanted this Coral shell plates. Yep. I definitely shouldn't hit that Yes, yes, yes, okay So these ones are better read the sandstone ones for better or and you realized that okay? We got it. We got it It was in this random tube also I've accidentally swung almost 200 meters in the wrong direction, so this isn't gonna be too bad of a trip I just want to be prepared with water and food and stuff Otherwise we could die and I don't know what happens if you die I think you lose everything in your inventory, and I don't really want that to happen right can we do it now we need Wait I've got one LED. Did I put it somewhere else I did boom radiation suit let's go yes Build me this suit look at it imagine, if these are real I guess they are with 3d printers and stuff call myself a radiation suit a radiation helmet and radiation gloves That is pretty awesome Look we've got bass things y'all we can make a bass an alien containment with no ingredients an Aquarium did we only just get all these things. No. I just didn't realize they were here to be honest Okay, so to build things need titanium and LEDs Actually, you only need really titanium for all the tubes and stuff. That's pretty cool That's really cool, but for now we need to wait all day and go over there Or I could just you know what this is go now They were nothing to lose apart from our life their sea glider is damaged I don't know if that means that we need to bring materials with us But I don't have any and hopefully we can trust them, life pod 3 Please don't please-don't kidnap me ;-; This is probably the furthest we've been so far away from our base What kind of cool stuff we got around here? We've got lots of lots of green. That's nice and big Oh jeez that's the kind of bit me earlier, or look is the sea pod hey guys how's it going what? What do you need from me right now? Can I get in here?Hello? Guys? Sea glide fragment oh That he dead guys only thing anyone's in here yeah, there's definitely no one in here. Oh geez abandon PDA Downloaded the data Open data box Got a compass as well. I don't know what else I can grab from here. I don't think there's anything else here uhm Oh, this is bad. This is really bad I thought that was gonna be some hope in that, but it turns out everyone's dead. Also. I feel like I'll choose them I'm gonna die I'm gonna die! Please don't die like this not now D: I feel like we can Where's the compass all at multi-purpose room ingredients unknown compass we can actually buy a compass displays compass heading on the HUD Ah scanner That's what we needs need a battery and titanium because I want to start scanning these things I think those are what you need to be able to grab yourself like the blueprints for like the vehicle bay and The sea glider and the sea glider is going to be Incredible I think I think we have everything we need for it. You know No don't leave me alone. Why are you always after me? I thought you were nice doesn't let me cut in his vines jeez okay. I'm gonna make a Pathfinder I knew I grabbed the creep vines for some reason there we go and I'm also going to make myself a scanner which is a battery and Titanium need some acid mushrooms from my supplies I think I put them in the you know the reject lockers down here there We go battery nicely done, and I think we have what we need for the scanner already Yes, we do perfect plenty of titanium to go around There we go it can be used to synthesize Blueprints from salvaged technology and to record alien biological data sweet. Oh man I'm excited for this self scan scan myself yes So scan complete Vital signs normal, that's good Thank goodness right we got a message I can just see on my right-hand side. Let's listen. This is Avery Quinn I'm training ship sunbeam Aurora. Do you read over? Nothing but vacuum Use all the terrorists ships they run low on engine grease to send an SOS you often helped. They don't pick up Aurora I'm out on the far side of the system, it's gonna take more than a week to reach your position Do you still need our assistance over oh man? I'll try them again tomorrow Damn charters gonna have us blowing our credits running errands for all Tara So That was a distress call Or an answer to a distress call from the Aurora, which is the you know? This thing over here, which was in distress. Let's face it. I know and I've lost my position Where's the no there? We go that's better? We actually have some things are listen to you from here You really think it'll carry two of us your regular seat glide toes a mass of 80 kilograms are over 30 Kilometres an hour the Power Cell a rig to this one should double that you think there's something out there. That's faster. Oh sure And that's assuming it doesn't overload three metres from the light body you're calm about this I'm seeing the engineering problem if I stop seeing the match I'll be terrified Okay, so that is from the people that we just went over to The blunt there, I don't think they survived no one survived I'm the only survivor so far come here bladder fish you can be my friend But I'm gonna go back over so I can scan this thing because I need a C glide I need a fast Here we go should be down here somewhere are there's one of them big stupid sharks as well So let me scan you buddy can I scan you oh geez here? He comes scat scan scan him just got him I just want a scan you scan you scan you I just wanna did it. See you later, buddy Why is he protecting this life pod for right? I'm gonna scan this This is perfect Overall progress 50% so I need to find another one and this too I can scan this 33% so I need to find three of those Where can I find oh? What's this? This is salt? Thank you. Is there another sea glide piece out here I have a feeling there's not going to be unless it's like deep inside any of the seaweeds That's annoying actually I've seen these before and I think they were over near where our Base is like over this direction, so I'm gonna swim this way See if I can scan anything else Cuz I want to at least see if I can cry off something major today doubt of that Oh, he's sweet. Done. Pretty well so far. Yeah, look look all this wreckage. Oh a trash Can I don't think I ever got excited about scanning a trash can before but I can get new Blueprints quite doing this. This is so good. Yell it. Here's a cargo thing nothing inside though You can scan pretty much anything, which is crazy. It gets you all the geological data. I'm not sure why you need it I guess it just gives you more info. I need to find all of these Cargo, crates to see if there's anything inside yes a c glide fragment. I got it new blueprint right Let's see if we can find any other Things a beacon fragment nice. It kind of just disappeared for some reason a grab trap yo I'm discovering all these crazy things right now got it got the synthesized grab trap. What was the other thing for three new? Blueprints, where are they there you go see glide knees battery? We can actually build one of those now a grab trap uses artificial gravity to attract light objects and small creatures The beacon will need one more the vehicle Bay we need two more. This is awesome, right Let's go scanning scan everything in the ocean you can scan pretty much every creature and I'm guessing it gives you like loads of info on it as More cargo boxes down here. What do you got? What do you got B? Yes the vehicle bay fragments? We need one more of those oh That is madness this is where I was before that is absolutely crazy. I wonder what happens if we go near it Should we do it. We could scan it we can scan everything in the ocean oh? my goodness I Don't want to die here though. I just want to scan you Just want to scan you there. We go reef back Scan scan scan scan. There's a lot of scanning. It's a big old scanning mass Come on come on come on come on come on yes indigenous life-form the reef back It kind of cool. I like you. Hopefully you like me too. Cuz I don't want to die here alright There's more cargo down here. Please have the pieces that I need No, no you're not being very helpful right now. I've already got the C Glidewell happens. Have you scan it again? We have it all we get I'll do that's amazing so we need to look out for these cargo things 100% and just scan everything in sight oh, we've got another message Let's take a look shall we or a listen even hello la Aurora, this is some Dame again. We just picked up a massive debris field I didn't know how bad How many of you? Like I didn't know We're now on route to your location We're gonna bring you all Sunmi about Nathan some B. What else can I say? the only time I've had to rig this big on a rock that small was in VR and I Case o is some beam an Aurora Aurora's when we came from and it sounds like some beam tried to save us But I don't see them anywhere, so I don't know if they survived right what have we got here We got some deployables we can do a grab trap I need a seagull ID though so I need a battery and copper wire Do I have enough for both of these things? I need my acid mushrooms again, and I need sir two three copper or luckily we have tons of copper ore right? Let's do this battery Fabricating then we're gonna grab ourselves A copper wire we can get some of those with two copper ore and we got ourselves a see glides This is insane guys. This is big. This is big news Look at this thing That's what I'm talking about Yes your safety Please pack supplies for long journeys and stay within five kilometers of the nearest Life pod or habitat I think I will I think as well the compass will be a good thing to craft copper wire and a wiring kit It's actually pretty expensive. We've got ourselves a C glide now It needs to charge as well, so we do need to keep that in mind It says we have another blueprint to trash can permanently deconstruct unwanted items and safely released their constituted sums into the atmosphere Should we just craft one of those for the lulz? Actually, no what we are we can afford a wiring kit So I'm just gonna build the compass now because if we're going on longer journeys. I'm definitely gonna need it I think it just installs it straight away We good yeah, there. It is displays the compass heading on the heat shoot D. There. It is right below our meters That's cool. We're also losing power. I'm not quite sure why right should we tie it try out the C glides? I think we should I don't know how you recharge it. It's also nighttime LEDs bring it out. We got another message Why did you ruin this moment? Oh? No, this is Ozzie from the cafeteria what the hell guys they didn't want us this might happen Our pod was almost crushed by this seamoth Bay on the way down now We're hanging on the edge of a cave system, and this grim look and snake things trying to beat through the hole Come get us already No location uploaded to PDA how far you away, that's the question you are are you're under attack but um Okay, so they're 100 meters below the water And they're under attack how am I supposed to attack something when I can't even get rid of those exploding fish? Yo look at this thing. This is cool. Look. How fast I can move around now This is so good. It has a light as well This thing's powerful very very powerful what I want to find is another one of those Cargo boxes because I'm only one blueprint away from doing the vehicle bay, so I want to find that what is this? What is this a scanner room fragment? Oh jeez ah ah no no no no quick help me. Let's get out of here Why are those things always attacking me? I was trying to scan something. You're so rude done it scan a room okay We can start building some epic base soon guys. We just need the materials to do it. I found another cargo box Nothing in its beacon I think we can grab this. I don't know if we've got this already You don't that's good beacon again um Come on. Come on be nice to me be nice to me. No there's nothing in these man Yo look, how deep this is oh? I'm actually getting freaked out. This is scary Super scary do I have enough oxygen to do this like go down this far? I guess I do if the C glide right it's running out of power pretty quickly. Oh jeez they're under attack. They're right there What's attacking them? I'm gonna get some oxygen back, and I'm gonna come back down I mean it could be something from the past They might not still be under attack, but they might have some good things to scan and stuff So let's take a look. How's it going guys? There's no one in here. Let's grab this Can I grab this I can't grab this can I scan anything in here it's literally exactly the same pot as ours But there's nothing here Yeah, that was definitely from before man. That's good. I could be me next a seamoth fragment That sounds like some kind of cool vehicle. It is how many of those do we need I missed it three. Okay? That's not bad Local Scouts show a nearby cave entrance depth 90 meters leading to an unknown environmental bio ward passing 100 meters oxygen efficiency decreased Okay, look at this oh My word that looks insane, okay, I can I use the tracking thing here the path finding tool. How does this work? Okay, so literally just does that I mean It's not bad. I need somewhere where I can find this again though from our pod. It's directly West so we can remember that for later. What if I just do this I can fire these out and then hopefully They'll make sense when I come back. What is happening down there? Look at these things. Oh dude those things are crazy. We find all kinds of mental things Okay, I need some food. Oh, yes, I found it actually found it. I'm gonna drown, but I found it yes Oh, that's perfect right. Let's get back to the hub because otherwise I'm gonna die this seed light is awesome, right? We've made it back We're alive just about I need to make myself some water real quick And I also need to make some food cooked bladder fish I mean Sounds tasty nom nom. Okay. That's better Not the best though all right we can now Do the beacon ah? Navigation aids that's perfect. They're really cheap as well and for a mobile vehicle Bay if fabricates vehicles for raw materials We just need some lubricant and a Power Cell a Power Cell is two batteries in silicon I think we can craft this like right now first. I think a beacon would be cool. It was West wasn't it I'm gonna go West and see if I can grab myself. Well--that's deploy the beacon so we can find the underground habitat I just need to grab some fish so I can eat right It was right here, so if we deploy this beacon I don't actually know how you use them There we go beacon done beacon name new Underground thing there we go, okay, so now we can get back to this way easier which is perfect I got the wrong thing. I need the seed clusters right let me just nom-a-nom there we go it back up to a good amount of food and water and now we can make the lubricant, I need this there we go I also need my My titanium ingot which I accidentally made last time is actually coming in quite handy now and a Power Cell Yo, stay away dude stay away, No. Why are you even near my base? Just one of my mushrooms for my locker you crazy person yeah, that was a bit mad, okay I think I just have enough copper to be able to make this Power Cell Boom, and now we can make ourselves the mobile of vehicle Bay I have no idea what this does apparently through with vehicles. It looks pretty sweet sounds pretty sweet I was expensive, so let's see what on earth we do with this we place it down release vehicle bay I Did it I did it guys there it is climb? Use vehicle bay Look So we just need to research these things then we can start building them. Okay. That's awesome. We made some pretty good progress today We got a brand new suits. We got a brand new sea glide loads of other stuff Oh my goodness a compass a compass We've got a compass lots of data banks to catch up on as well, which is crazy right today. It's been phenomenal I hope you've enjoyed next time we are going to go over to the Aurora Which is the big fiery mess over there because we have our radiation suit now I've been promised It's absolutely insane So stay tuned for that if you like this series and want it to continue Then please we make fat-like as well if you're excited to go and check out the craziness that is the aurora and for our progress Today leave a big fat thumbs up that we greatly appreciate it, and if you haven't done so yet Or if you're brand new to the channel and you want to see new content every single day then please do consider subscribing to join Team TDM! Apart from that. have an amazing day. You're awesome, and I'll see you all next time. Good bai :D 
The time has finally come Luigi has taken over. Hey guys! Dan here, and welcome back it to my favourite game of all time: Super Mario Odyssey But just for today, *especially* for today, it's gonna be Super Luigi Odyseey Because we can now play the mini game Balloon Worlds *reading screen* "Try talking to Luigi anywhere you run into him." I have no idea what this is This is the brand new DLC for Super Mario Odyssey, you guys want me to play it so badly I forgot it even came out, but here. We are playing. I don't know much about it I know it involves balloons brand new minigames in possibly every single world and Luigi's bright green bowtie What more could we want? Let's head into the game. We also got new filters in the snapshot mode for all of your Instagram needs WHAT! Hold the phone! "Special outfits incoming. Check out the shop to find the musician hat on the musician outfit." "Sunshine shades and sunshine outfit, and the knight helmet and Knight armor?" Oh my goodness! How do I not hear about this!? Next objective "Collect more power moons." Yeah, just a couple hundred Wait what? Since when was I Luigi anyway? Have I always been Luigi? I don't remember having this! Either I've forgotten something or it's added in a special outfit just for us. Oh my goodness guys. I've forgotten the controls *laughs* There's a way to do like a really cool jump. Ah there we go. *pause* ooh *laughs* That was close! There he is brother Luigi! How you doing buddy? What's going on? You only have one balloon, though I thought you'd have more oh How do I do Luigi's voice? *yahoo from other video* Dan: yahoo.. Okay, I think I've got it. *weird voice* Huh, what? Another me? *regular voice* That's terrible! *laughs* *weird voice* No, wait! Is that you bro? Whoa! You really threw me through a loop there aha! *regular voice* kind of sounds French, I'm not gonna lie. *weird voice* Hey, bro You saved Princess Peach, huh? So proud of you, SPAGHET! *normal voice* I'm just gonna go back to normal voice This isn't working. "but enough of that get this, bro I came up with a new game I call it Balloon World! Balloon World is a game where you search for balloons hidden by people all over the world! You want to connect to the network?" Yeah sure, let's do this. Actually that reminds me. So all the balloons are hidden by other people? That's pretty cool! Alright then, let's begin! "First we'll move to the starting point. SPAGHET! You play Balloon World by hiding and seeking balloons. First I'll show you: Find It. Try to find the balloon I hide." Luigi, bro? Did we go to the same school? That sentence doesn't make sense. "You have 30 seconds to find the balloon and pop it. Once you leave the starting area, Find It will begin." Okay, I think I can see it, though, Luigi. This isn't really a hard one, is it? *giggles* It's right here. At least they're starting us off nice and simple. Here we go. BAM! Yes, congrats, no problem! "Nice work, bro! Here, take these 50 coins." Oh, we get coins that means we can save up for the Knight outfit, and you get a time bonus, too! That's an extra 65 coins. *reads* "So this time I hid the balloon, but in the real thing players from all over the world will hide the balloons!" "Oh, also when you're playing Find It for real, I'll need a few coins from you. Sorry." *stutters* WHAT! So do I earn coins or no? "And did you notice for each three coins you collect you get an extra second added to the time limit." Okay. That's cool. Okay? Let's try to hide it. *laughs* Look at his face! So we can hide the balloons, as well as find them, and we earn coins every time someone tries to attempt to find it (the balloon). That's cool! And you have 30 seconds to hide it wherever you want. Let's do this! Right, where should we hide this thing? I feel like I'm not that well versed in parkour, so... let's try up here That's terrible. *mumbles* Where do I put the balloon? WHERE do I put the balloon? It has to be somewhere- it has to be somewhere difficult. I have 10 seconds! Can I place it, like, down here? Is that mean? Yup, I can't place it down there *laughs* Oh, man. I lost coins as well. whoops.Yeah I'll play again. I need a plan! I think I'm gonna go up there This isn't gonna be the hardest one in the world. I just want to find balloons I don't want to place them. Come on Luigi-Mario. You've got this. GO (x8)! I wanna hide it up here! I wanna hide it up here! Place it there *strange voice* Okay, this is super easy! *laughs* "Way to go bro. You picked a really good hiding spot." I'm not so sure. Ah, here we go, so these are people's balloons that they've hidden! Is the star level their, like, experience levels? So, for example: 33 stars is a very high level, and with a Japanese nickname. It's very important. It means it's going to be difficult It kind of gives you *laughs* Annie's! Annie's is right there! Come on, Annie. Who should we go for? Uh, let's do Alexander's. "Pay 10 (coins),  but reward 50." So if I find it, I get 40 profit. This is awesome I love this! Right, so it's gonna be in this direction over here It just gives you an arrow, but it doesn't give you where else it is. Let's go. Let's do this I'm guessing it's gonna be, like, up ways? "The arrow will display when you stop moving." Oh, it's like up there Where is it? Where is it? It's on the roof! How do I get to that roof? Oh jeez, I've got 11 seconds! NO, I've wasted 10 coins! I can't remember all my parkour. I don't want to do this! *timer buzzes* I failed... I absolutely failed. Look at his face! He's happy, but I failed. Agh, this is costing me 10 coins every single time You know what? I've got an idea. OH NO, it's changed! I was gonna go for the one that was, like, literally outside the circle. *laughs* So it gives you the time, it gives you a higher amount if it's more difficult, I'm guessing? Let's try this one Let's do them in order. Buzz-bee, let's go. 76 meters. Let's do this. I think I can see it up there... Okay. I think I know how to get there. Let's do this. I'm pretty sure it's up here. Come on! Come on, Luigi-Mario You've got this, just jump up here. No, UP! MARIO! You're gonna give me these coins back when I fail, huh? Is that what you gonna do? It's right there (x2)! I've got this! YES! Pop that! Oh, this is cool. Heyyyyy, I got 50 coins So I got my money back from the ones I failed before, and when I fell off. And I got extra time bonus as well. So for all the seconds you've got left, you get coins too- nice to know. This one's 18 seconds, but it's 205 meters! Let's try this one. Yeah, let's do 10 coins and let's see how far we can get away. I'm gonna ping I'm gonna ping! There we go. I think it must be over here. It must be. Go. GO! Go! Where is it? Where is it? Where is it, Where is it, Where is it? Is it up here? Yes! It's hidden in the tree. Oh, I thought it was gonna be, like, up top, and you had to jump up. But I found it! I did it. Give me them coins. Thank you! Right we need to go and see-oh! I cleared two in a row. That's 10 more coins Nice! AND 50 more coins. It's just dishing out these coins! Yes! "Getting a higher rank means you'll get more coins." Okay, cool, "So keep playing Balloon World." I certainly will. I need to go visit somewhere for a second... Oh, you lose the streak bonus. Okay, that's fine. I want to go to a different world anyway, because this one I think is gonna be one of the hardest ones to do. Just because it has so many levels and stuff. You need serious parkour skills, and I'm feeling rusty. "Right now, you'll earn extra coins by playing in Moon Kingdom." Okay. That's good to know... Right, I want to go to the Hat Shop real quick. Just because there's those extra outfits I want to see how much they are. I need the knight outfit desperately. Hello! I would like to purchase your wares. Can you sell me what I'm looking for? You can't. Can you? Hello. It's Hat Guy! *laughing* Look at his, look at his swish face. Got some great new swag to sell me. Perfect! Umm Mechanic? It's not what I'm looking for. Waluigi cap!? That's cool! What about the Waluigi... um... Outfit? Is there one of those? There's a doctor outfit as well. I need to play this game way more! Oh! Ooh, it's-it's 8000 in total. I thought the skeleton was, um, expensive. I know what I want. I want the Waluigi cap, and then I'm also gonna change into the skeleton. Just for now. also This DLC is completely free, so if you already have the game you can just check it out and get it. It just updates automatically. And I'm pretty sure you get the Luigi suit just for free, because I'm fairly sure I didn't unlock this Oh, yes! Look at this! If I did, I'm completely wrong and I'm sorry. Right, let's go to a different place and try Balloon World again. It said more (coins) for Moon Kingdom, right? How difficult could this one be? I guess it's in Zero Gravity Which is quite cool, so let's give it a go Oh, it looks so cool! Waluigi is one of my favorite characters by the way. Mario is just such a good game There he is! I see him! "Bro, you startled me! This outfit is kind of...um.. how can I put this?" "I mean, it looks good." *Dan laughs* "I'm running a special to get more coins." Okay. That's good. Right, which balloon should we go for? Look how many coins you get for these! We can get the Knight thing in no time! If we-if we find them, of course. Right, let's try this one. It's 424 meters away, though... Reckon we can do it? Absolutely not, but let's try anyway! Right, 424 meters let's grab this, and let's go. Maybe we can go up here? Let's go up here. I've completely forgotten how this game works, so I'm at a disadvantage already. Let's go up here We're definitely going in the right direction! Definitely. Is it over near the castle? It must be. Come on, where is it? Where is it? Where is it? It's not gonna be in here is it? It might be. It could be! It's not! "You mustn't, you're in the middle of a game," it says! NO! Where is it? IT'S THERE!!! Quick! Come on, Mario! Come on, Mario, you got this! Get it, get it! YES! Ohohoho *laughs* Oh, my goodness actually said zero on the screen I thought I'd overshot it because of the gravity. We did it! A hundred and two coins. That's a ninety-two coin profit Yeah, and my rank has gone up as well. I got 150 coins extra. How many did we need for the Knight outfit? I think it was 8000. What do we want to do next? We've got... We could try this one. That seems like it might be pretty hard, but it's got massive coin rewards. The highest coin reward is Pedro's, which is *pause* that way... There's Connor's, which is also that way... Hmm, I feel like that's gonna be on the church or something 530 let's try is gonna cost us 75 coins, but we can get this back at the end. Don't worry. Let's go This is gonna be tough, isn't it? Go Mario, go! You've got this, buddy. We have to do this! We can't go inside anywhere. We have to make sure that we do this properly There we go, and where is it gonna be? Where'd reckon is gonna be? It has to be this way It has to be. Is this the quickest way to get around? I need to watch some speedrunners or something, because I have no idea. Come on. Come on, we've got 15 seconds. No, It's getting further away! Is it up there? It might be up at the top. Maybe we need the Frog! Get the Frog! Get the Frog! It's gonna be up here. Isn't it? OH JEEZ! Oh my goodness! There's /something/ up there Where is it? It might even be... Oh, I can see why he lets you look around now. I'm gonna try that again It cost me 70 coins each time, but I'm ready for it Hey guys, I messed this up already, sooo we're probably not gonna make it. It's worth trying. Oh You get extras for coins! An extra second. I completely forgot! You get extra seconds for these I should have hit them all. Come on Mario, stop messing around! So we definitely to get that frog at the end.. And then I'm guessing it's gonna be above the castle. No I've completely messed this one up Oh jeez. Let me stay still, and see where the arrow sends us. Yeah, it's up there. I think it's gonna be on top of the clock tower. Let's do this again. Right, this is a hundred and... *pauses* 170 coins down the drain. Come on, Mario. Let's go. We've got this Please get as many coins as we can from this, too, so that we can get our extra seconds There we go that's better. I don't know which is a better way to travel this, or this (jumps differently) I feel like this is way better. Yeah, it's definitely better. Okay. I feel like we're making better progress We're gonna have 10 seconds by the time we get to the end of this, but this one is DIFFICULT. Come on, buddy. come on. Come on! I need your powers! I need your froggy powers. GO! To the skies! Ha ha oh My goodness why? It's-it has to be up there How else do you get up there without being an amazing frog? Jeez, this is hard. SO difficult. Okay, there's one that's this way. Let's try this one. This is difficult I need to definitely up my Mario skills because I haven't played this for a long time So, we need to get working on this. Okay, there's a flower up there that we might need... Can we jump while we've got this? We certainly can let's go. Okay. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Are you up here? I'm gonna get the arrow It's up it's definitely up, but how do we get up there? I can't get up No, how do you get up there? These are so difficult! Okay Luigi. Give me a sec. I need to practice this. Aah there's a wall jump here! No way, I was just about to use some kind of weird technique that one's not gonna be available anymore No! Luigi. Luigi, I need you back buddy. I could do this jump, but that's pretty much it look at this Absolutely insane. I love this game. Wait, there's a dog with a space helmet!! What! Look at this dude! *laughs* Did you *laughs* did you see his jump? Are you kidding me? What are you doing here doggo? This is the cutest thing ever. Look at it spin! Oh my goodness. Hmm. I think I can get this one. I think I can do it. I need some coins back I need to refresh this amount. I want to at least try and buy one piece of the Knight armor There we go. *smack* No. NO! *laughs* *laughs more* I didn't hold Y for long enough, so I didn't bounce off the cap, and I've lost ten more coins 'cause l fell into the abyss. Yes, I want to try again. This is stupid. There we go That's better. Pop that balloon! Give me the hundred coins back you stole from me. We did it! We did another one! Alright, let's keep on going. We need to complete some more 'cause I'm failing quite badly here. I'm gonna go this one I think I know where it is and it's got a high reward. It's got 39 seconds on the clock as well I think we can do this. Let's go. Let's go We've got this now that I know that there is a jump bit in between I should be able to do it We've got 15 seconds. There we go. Nailed the wall jump! Come on then. There we go! Let's grab it. With seconds to spare! That's what I'm talking about! Yes! That's the one that we were supposed to get before. I got some more coins. That's what I'm talking about Thanks for clapping, Luigi. Right, let's try and hide one of our own There's not many that go this way, so let's see what we can do here We've got 30 seconds to try and do it. Maybe it's because this one's super easy. I'm not even sure.. What is that? Why is he firing his massive nose at me? Okay. I'm gonna put mine... Uh.. yeah, I'm gonna put mine just here. It's gonna be super easy, but it's gonna earn me some coinage, okay? At least Luigi liked my hiding spot. Right, let's go to another place. What was my favorite one? Let's go Seaside Kingdom. Skeletal Waluigi has arrived. Okay, here  we go I've got 24 seconds to find this one. I feel like we need these flowers. There we go. Is it down here? It's down here somewhere. I think I just saw it. No, is it this way? There's the heart Where's the Loon (short for balloon)? It's four meters away? Where is it? Where is it? No not like this? I was literally four meters away from it. It must be so close to me right now. Maybe it's on land? Let's go. It must be over here somewhere. It definitely says down, but as soon as I go down, it's-it's gone Oh, Oh is it cheekily down here? Come on I need to grab more seconds! More seconds! This must be it. This is so cheeky. There it is! There it is! Quick, grab it! GRAB ITTT! NOOOOOO He's looking right at it! At least we know it's down here now because we can grab the coins I'll make sure to grab every coin this time. I think we can slowly do it. Yeah, there we go This is working. This is working. Let's not dodge it this time, and there we go! Look at those skele-bone feet. We got it That was clever. Yayyy. Oh look, we got 250 coins. Our star rank went up as well. To 5? We skipped two! All right, what do you want to do next? Uhhh I kind of want ones that don't seem so far. I'm gonna go for this one. 65 coins and 220 coin payout Let's go. Alright grab this guy. Grab this guy, and let'sss go. It's definitely gonna be over here somewhere No, he only goes this high. No! Right, we're gonna have to change tactic. Let's do this. I reckon it's up here. It has to be up here. Sir, have you seen a balloon anywhere? Where is it? Where is it? Show me. It's this way! Go! Go it's behind here. It's so behind here! quick! Quick! QUICK! *strangled voice* WHERE IS IT? Hey, it said it was through here, right? It must be up there. Let's try that again. Here we go Let's go Rocket Man. You've got this. Now we need to find ourselves... this guy. Go up. It's so difficult. Especially cuz you're spending coins each time. It's definitely around here somewhere isn't it? It's in the box! IT'S IN THE BOX! I didn't realize it could be in the box I guess you place it  *stutters* I guess you place it there when the box isn't there, and then when the box reappears it's hidden. Clever work, buddy. I like it. Okay. There's one this way a 56 coin reward? That's so low, why is it so low? Oh, it's right there. I can see it. Come on! You've got this buddy the reward is low, but we can still do this. Go. Go Go! Yes! Oh, look at that extra 70 coins! That was worth it. AND two in a row? We're up to a thousand coins and my rank has gone up. That's 1200 coins. We're making movements guys Let's make it three in a row. Where could this next one be? 30 coins over this way. Let's give it a go where you're gonna be there's so many hidden compartments on these levels. Alright, I need some help from this guyyy, and we're gonna go over here. Yeah, this is good. Not good if you get trapped on dry lands. It's down here somewhere It's definitely down here somewhere. I need arrow help. Where's it gonna be, buddy? Show me Over here? Mario, I wish you could swim a lot faster. Come on. It's gonna break my streak. We're getting further away! Is it under there? That's a heart. There's a gemstone down here as well. Don't tell me it was on the laparis, please I'm gonna see if it's on this laparis. I don't think it is 'cause I don't remember seeing it, but it could be. Okay, it's not on the laparis. That's fine. Then where is it? Go on, show me with an arrow. I need a-I need a fish to do this one. It's in here somewhere. It's up. Left? Where are you? THERE IT IS! Go! Go! YES! Oh, I didn't realize you could hide it half! *laughs* That was half hidden in the ceiling. That's a clever one too. People are creative. We were so close last time We got a rank up as well. We're making movements on the ranking board. Right, one final one. Where should we go? Oh, Martin, this one is far. Let's go! 336 meters? Let's do one more to finish this out, I know I keep saying that, but it's kind of addictive. Let's grab this guy and fire across Come on, speedy as you can be. Look at that distance going down. It's gonna be over here somewhere It has to be. Okay keep going. Keep going. Keep going. There it is! I see it. I see it. It's just down here. Yes Pop! Give me them coins Luigi. Yes 116 coins! Even though I failed loads- I'm not going to show you every single run that I've done-we have made some serious bank today! Guys this is an awesome, awesome addition to the game. And it's free! It's free. Up to number nine! Look at all those coins! I don't know where those just came from. "The balloon you hid in Moon Kingdom got popped." No! I mean, it wasn't that hard, was it? T o be honest? I wonder how many-Oh wait, was that the coins that I got a moment ago? It must have been. You know what, guys, that is pretty much gonna wrap up the brand new Super Luigi Odyssey DLC. the Balloon World DLC for Super Mario Odyssey, as I mentioned already a couple of times it's completely free if you own the game already and adds so much to the game it is unreal. It'll unlock new areas for you you've never really tried to experience before. Test your parkour skills to the max, and you can also test other people's skills to the max as well.

so guys I'm gonna be honest with you I have no idea how this video is gonna turn out because I have to be in London again in a few hours it's been an absolutely crazy week so I haven't been able to prepare videos in advance but I want to check something out today and I wanted to involve you guys because I don't know if you noticed but a couple of days ago I did the jelly bean challenge and while I was ready they're there while I was editing it I was wondering whether any remixes would be made of it well yeah it happened again let's head over to youtube.com and let's type in the red one has been it chosen look how many different things come up dantdm reacts 1-hour SuperSpeed high-pitched video reaction times to each other you know what I mean but let's give it a quick search top result is the original which has 14 million views and then me reacting to it underneath 19 million views that is a lot of you time for one single remix but if we click on the person who made it earth yes something will come up this is his channel and look top video three days ago dantdm sings his outro let's see what happens so so it's kind of a similar thumbnail this is the old one this is the new one and it has the red jelly bean in it so I think this is a new song involving the red jelly bean instead of the red one has been chosen so I thought I'd sit down with you guys and react to it because I'm interested to see what's going on okay here it is would you guys go on a pet snake or a pet turtles should I pick turtle should have known people love turtles oh it's red let's see what happens I didn't realize it would be that new outro song I don't know why because that's the only out tripod for a while did you see the little dantdm move as well that's cool right that's what should the whole thing I promise I won't keep stopping it ready that's what I'm talking about everyone do it I know you do I know you're doing our home here we go I am going to regret this no three or one that's great that's a lot of fun I love that is that done himself again I didn't see my intro this time I've sung the outro in kind of weird jellybean moans hmm I'm actually interested to see what else is on here we've got the one hour it's that real yeah it's real it has 92 thousand views why why are people watching this and for a whole hour we also have super speed high pitch that could be fun as well you guys been tweeting me this video dantdm Singh Star Wars for ages so let's check this one out too shall we [Music] wait there's a whole channel hold on there's a whole channel that just does dantdm dubs is that for real kind of kind of it does a lot it is Trump as well as the the let it go for an hour anyway I'm getting distracted let's watch here we go [Music] what is going on what while all the other people around it was Jimmy Ferran there what were you doing kind of freaking me out in the goal I another thing I wanted to do today was read your comments so it led some read some when me and my friend were flipping bottles my friend flipped it in dabs you know what I did no what did you do I flipped the ball on his heads edit I didn't dab good for you good for you grow a bit um it's actually impossible for me to grow beards this is as good as it gets I fun facts but I don't have this I look about three years old so it took me ages to grow this I used to have a patch that was just bold fairy ages so I'm pleased with just this I tried to grow a beard once and you guys made me shave it off so what can I do what my fries yeah I do actually well too bad boy knows I love fries look there it is reacted dance EDM sings his outro let's see what happens three hours ago three this is why Dan isn't a surgeon oh this is comments on my most recent brain surgery video by the way that was yesterday if you haven't seen it go check it out up and this this is white Dan isn't a surgeon if I saw him performing surgery I would be overexcited do a bunch of stuff eg autograph selfie TC remember this video and run away screaming but what if you were the one getting the operation would you still want all the autograph and stuff then remember the video but then you can't run away because if you need surgery and I'm the only one is applied to do it then this could be you yeah I definitely should not do surgery ever again he wants get surgery from dad not me yeah smart guy smart guy hold up those Sam Sam Dan you are so good that you could be a surgeon someday I feel like with the winky face he's maybe not taking me seriously please play man-eater it's available on Steam man-eater steam you were cut away from your mother's body and left to die in the unforgiving waters of the Gulf Coast no there is a vr version of this game play it oh I've heard of that I think I might do that even though I did say I wasn't gonna do surgery again but I might be better with the VR headset or worse there's two comments on this page that say to more fortnight I believe fortnight so much but I'm just so bad in it like really really bad I still ready have one win and I play like over 150 games so I need to get better and then I'll make some more for night videos I do love the game though there's also comments about among the sleep I'm sorry it's been a couple of days a new one will be out tomorrow 100% a million percent it will be out ok I really wanted to do two videos today but I just don't have time so I need to go Dan try the surgeon simulator law Dan try the surgeon simulator a any addition there are a transplant and teeth trance like what surgeon simulator a and E the anniversary edition comes with new iron teeth operations and no way it was actually nominated for a BAFTA that's insane dude what is that what is that I need this I am bread - that's cool ok we're definitely doing that you could operate on an alien and take out Bob's teeth wait that's not Bob yeah I definitely need to do that I'd be insane dancing yeah best surgeon of 2017 not sure if that's true but thank you ah what's making me make that noise fake channels please be careful this one has 18,000 views and it's not me it's not me don't make me come and get you fake down CDM will have words again ok yeah sure back in your hole oh yeah love that that's that's all correct I am giving that oh no no I have not even signed in I would have given that a like and a pin I'll do it in a minute TDM is slow lucky because dantdm called him I know well he kind of did dan is a T Swift fan I guess maybe those are the comments adjust oh yeah I like that I wish I could meet you in poison okay this this worries me for two reasons firstly it says meet as in like meat that you eat which is worrying me and P us io n could even mean person poison prison yeah where I'm going of this use a spellcheck boy you are dantdm what okay we're back on the other surgeon simulator video are police you're under arrest what why for murdering someone well I never done nothing that's a double negative which you killed someone you're under arrest for life no it is so confusing but I think that means I'm going to prison I need to go so guys I wasn't lying to you this video is gonna be weirds I think

that all grim brindle in what you doing is she gonna save him that's it that's such a cool frying pan yeah she saved him ok we need to I'm gonna put him back inside the safe spot anyway just in case localized by Nintendo switch if you haven't got it on the internet which definitely get merit or to see just cuz it's the best even if you've watched me play it dude there's some big damage yeah even if you watch me play it it's so worth it there's so much to do the jerseys are playing with rock a you silly boy they send you back there we go believe in yourself says General of the diamond encrusted frying pan maybe we'll get our mole home cooking again who's she gonna serve it to herself I like hits I mean if I could cook for myself by words I mean I can cook for myself but not right

it was great oh no two people didn't like their food but he leveled up anyway yeah it's such a fun game you don't even have to watch the whole thing there is a story behind it but you don't have to watch the whole thing to understand it oh no people want to spend money he wants the adventure armor I mean he's pretty cool it's not that expensive it does increase defense by four I'm gonna give charrisse's leather robe and grim wants the Polka Dot gear I think I'm gonna Ford all that stuff let's do it you got a drone nice I still don't have a drone I should get a drone I know you can get really small ones now that take me really cool images so let's go for yeah we got to go blue that's grim looking like a little I don't even know like a maid I think they can get everyone what they want for Christmas even though it's a couple days after it's fine it's fine don't worry about it the leather robe is getting rid of the polka dots but I don't really I don't really mind let's choose a dark blue for you sir no I can't sort it I can go and equip it in a second it's 700 for you Jim wants a HP but I'll have I don't really want that chica green can just steal them let's go blue boys are

of here let's go let's go forth and try and impress the princess nice got five different clothings for the thief back in polka dots and let's get out of here oh look at that we made loads of progress so we're trying to make it to here I'm not sure what here is but let's go there might be some story up in a second guys but we're gonna have to get down to business first look at them they're matching polka dots it looks so cute what's grim up to waked prints and B oh that's what we're doing we're trying to find the prince the other prince was neighbor wasn't it I completely forgot can we go back

we're not gonna find Prince sounds ever we're on the move getting the groove fork in the road uh I'm gonna go down I think let's see what happens monsters or chest monsters or chests it monsters we messed up well we should be fine with this what applies poison butterflies or moths and a mole this should be easy mode come on grim slice and dice we hit them all which is good choices gonna sharp is lightning ability zaps the more that is that's the mole out of here and that's it I told you easy mode you don't mess with teams Reyes ever few more rounds I don't know about that that's not which too many monsters upon ourselves you know what getting monsters isn't too bad because you can get the gold but if we're fighting over 300 gold in a chest speaking of which do we have gold an MP suite Wow

buy I guess oh nothing really that's fine don't want that armor then dantdm no you don't want it that's fine let's go we still need this fruit tray us might get stolen by the Dark Lord I don't know he always got stolen by a flower just now so it could happen oh wait a second I want about all this it's got pink on it the gold ones give you gold but I want to see what this one does what's it gonna give us maybe an item were they cold tasty stuff maybe they give you food let's see what happens wall of damage oh my goodness these things are a bit crazy he's stealing HP bananas oh that's perfect

increase their relationship during a battle as well really cute probably likes oh that HP went up as well and they can give each other now that the music took me off god is like some dubstep going on in the background dude right let's bring chairs back I think you should be able to survive a hit if he does get hit lightning though they're still alive why is it I just you just do this I didn't even speak properly why did I choose to do this come on gem you got this okay that one's out the other one hasn't even hit that much at all though we should be able to do this ten more damage yeah it's pretty close not as close I would like it though it's because they keep hearing us but if one it's to be way better I want to get as much HP up as possible nice an extra four damn TM has a lot of health alright this should be it one more turn and we're done there we go one more attack and we're done I like it 171 faces rescued or body parts what do we get snoop radish and arrest nut Bradish with extra leaves so the purple ones give you foods and the the gold ones give you gold makes sense let's go let's do this he didn't keep the pink hair though I know why not even phenomenal what's this mushrooms these are easy right let's chop these bad boys we got our health back as well did we get out back after every fight surely not extra damage sure his eyes gonna explode this is new skill oh my goodness that was insane try Aras well done buddy well done that was beautiful you were worried you exploded them all that was mental I like it learn backflip occasionally dog physic dodge physical enemy attacks so grim come back for it now great got some mushrooms a little bit of money and let's keep on going we need this fruit I wonder what the fruits gonna be we have to choose let's go up I did down last time and I'm gonna go up this time I think it's the difference between finding a chest and not or finding a different size of chest I think I'll dude a big flower and rocks which one is it going to Zack though who's it gonna eat if it doesn't eat the first person that attacks it no it just keeps on going oh you should have played with the flower dudes oh he's getting it again Joe's must be tasty Wow must be as pink hair that he's hiding Jenna's gonna show off that's big damage when they show up they really do properly show off and I think it's dead now that's good the rocks are fine Taurus is back we should be able to rock this easily still playing with a rock I like it this is such a fun game guys even though you don't do much during the battle you can do if you want to but even if you don't do much during the battery it's so funny to watch good school random events so they can do whatever they want then they look they earn new skills and stop during so funny Jen's but level 9 does she learn a new skill no bone xxp though let's give it to gems got the lease let's give some more to her a bitingly bit a team that must be from the flower we've got a lot of food I like it we don't find a chest though shut it one down always go down right is this fruit here I was thinking if everyone ate the calming fruit do you think we get rid of all the fear and worry in the world and choices like now it was bought this on all of a sudden I'm just saying if we do find this calming fruits we should grow more get people eating it and then we can take over the world as its benevolent overlords what no stop talking like that Genesis dance in a way being amazing just messing haha stop mucking around and keep looking how far is it gonna be to do this this is hard on the legs there's a lot of running in this game ah we went up last time let's go let's go down again I'm feeling down I really want to chest just to get some gold I don't really want to come back you know we got monsters again two flowers that mean two of us gonna get eaten this could end badly guys they haven't got a health as well here we go eating grimsey and if chars gets eaten again that'd be hilarious yeah in mp sweet good job buddy oh no dantdm and grimmer Bini in wait what oh it just means they can't move do they get hurt though I don't think they do do they attack or is it just taking away to all Yelly do 8 damage 9 damage okay that's that's worrying as definitely worrying what do i do what do i do one of them is almost dead I'm gonna use sprinkles actually it's we've still got quite a few let's get up to 20 20 20 that's perfect Graham is tasty I wonder oh look it's spread it out that's fine I don't know why you did that though I guess it means so we can eat someone else so you can't really plan not bad not bad Bowers guys perfect okay we've got this did he tastes good tastes good grim grim gets revenge by smacking the other one not bad not bad he's sick hey that's why I'm talking about 116 experience more gold no food no chest either we messed up twice could've got a double chest oh wait this might be the fruit is that it no that's leaves looking suspicious though is that there is that it it's exciting as thing ever you got the Karman fruit perfect easy quest easy quest oh my goodness let's spend some let's spend some money and oh my goodness they are such good friends dad avenge when a friend Falls flare up in anger with a vengeful strike so be honest people don't fool that much if out of anyone grim fell today so that could be quite useful Oh check on the team let's see what they're saying I won't trust to get his pink hair back that'd be great and for my next trick I'm going to do my impression okay let's do happens terrible oh that's uncanny grim

watch out I send you back here and let's get you set on fire with a flambe I like it when they show off because they do so much damage that's 31 with one hit that's insane I think that's it certainly

doing to you who is this I feel like we've met this guy before it's all we haven't a naughty imp he's not really on what I was expecting something crazy dude not as crazy as I thought I was gonna be okay let's say I'm on fire just for just for just for giggles that's a big slash as well I like his eyes the North TM is a hilarious and he got trapped what did you see that it's that he dipped Gemma's heart in darkness but it didn't affect her because she was too cool Charles Jones doesn't show up flames dipped Grimm's fight into dark oh my goodness what what does that mean what does that mean look at look at Grimm's eyes on the bottom screen what has happened what do I do is he gonna attack us now he checked this up what's wrong with you grim Oh No he's acting mischievous oh dude that's kind of cool yeah all these mechanics are hilarious yeah that's what you get for tripping us up buddy and he doesn't attack either he took me down - yeah I'm trying to duck okay looks like we're gonna have to naughty mischievous knees on our team right can I heal him I don't think I can so he does the dipping the heart sings of darkness and also attacks there we go he can't have much HP left surely no in such a funk how do i heal his heart oh my god so much damage so much damage no no no no too slow okay he's actually not doing too bad yes screaming back to normal go and slice him get revenge that's what I'm talking about that was a 14 damage revenge attack not so bird jump slash big jump slash Grimm's going dark again look at that a mischievous pun he's so evil so evil and he's tripping us up again absolute tink Oh No that was the last straw do they fall out friendship that was weird that was really weird right let's do this let's sprinkles as well I just want to sprinkle up this man right yeah I could already gave up all the way one what come on keep going there we go because one attack ensures Wilma's dies what is that weird dynamic there's like a blue line between them so they don't like each other now for some reason it gets under it it use a trip with her up on dantdm we need you he's doing so much damage no two of them are evil now and he's tripping them all up what do I even do he's so close to dying as well um I don't know what to do I could bring yeah I'm gonna have to bring down TD I'm out of this I was gonna spring him all the way up empty sprinkles get him out of the safe spots can I put him back in and then he will not trip us up so much damage he's poking everyone they're gonna start falling out as well James acting mischievous snap out of it he's gonna slapper oh my goodness that's fantastic I'm cooking okay we definitely need some home cookin good good good so Grimm's having a rest and he went back to normal okay does work perfect I'm gonna HP sprinkles left now though so you're just gonna have to go all-in on this guy and see if average I think we got it come on is it an MP sweet I like I've got em please sprinkles I've completely forgot come on flambe big smack dancing and flicking out spur okay this is good because dantdm would get killed oh jeez oh look at her she is phenomenal she dodged it and blocked someone else's attack yes yes oh thank goodness for that team TDM win and that was that was close that could have been way worse but we did it we saved the king yet again give us some money dudes give us some money for saving your butt grim devil's food cake very rare okay there's everyone's eating cake today at you my only have three so someone's not gonna have cake I'm sorry let's see what happens oh no no no no never what punch wait what happened stole the face someone stole her face goodness gracious me what are those things sans you are a terrible terrible person look at the don't cry stop crying come on buddy he's out of here please don't marry that chump mum's dead save me see you later buddy great to see in even though something bad just happened his daughter's lost her face doctor Baltimore he stole away my beloved beautiful face I thought it'd be him I saw him heading towards the nightmare tower where is that oh there that's I like the tower but there's evil inside I'm worried I'm so scared but I must pursue the fiend wait here Zelda oh he's off why is he with his butt like that I'll save the princess okay but we go so angry we could just have Craig on our team and you could just squash everyone that was so good he has no idea what's going on you punk and the face is gone she can't say anything she can smell something but she won't be able to communicate still got our nose but she hasn't got her eyes or mouth oh this is bad look you can't even talk to her just nothing try to impress the princess and she lost her face whoops let's see what we can do guys I feel like we're doing pretty well today we've only lost one person Craig how do you feel the princess please how do you even know and neighbor too I suppose let's get out of here and let's go alright shorter this way isn't it look Gemma and grim have this weird blue arrow now I'm guessing that's because you kept tripping her up he didn't like so many times as well oh look at this dude this is creepy the nightmare tower oh man what's gonna be inside hopefully some good chests we didn't even get any money from Craig we got something beforehand I guess so I can't be - can't be too upset and nightmare tower is here this is cool looking really cool looking but I'm scared about the monsters that might appear it could be some pretty sweet ones this place makes my hair stand on end it feels like the ceiling is pressing down on me it's okay if you're scared you know cut scared huh never hahaha look at his face little pink actually yes I'm terrified poor guy I was surprisingly honest of you let's just say you princess no don't get out of here let's do it her face is gone whirring super whirring whoa every we can do that yeah I didn't very I didn't press it very well right which way oh we can go right or we can go up right doesn't look like it it goes anywhere but there might be a chest I'm gonna go right like if there's a chest I have to get it pink Charles to sell you one's a cat let's see what happens the car team beautiful huge sides a bits come on show some nightmare cars we've got sleep in a nightmare castle let's just ask him for trouble bow breath no monsters yet I feel some coming up there they are I thought so what's it gonna be imps and clouds oh no oh okay this is gonna be tough I think we can do it come on grim chores can lend a hand for the start the M oh nice and it's not so bad but I don't like those clouds very much they scare me Oh when it's gonna do this isn't it Grimm's unaffected so whenever it does that I'm just gonna put them in the safe zone because then they can't just be pesky and it heals them as well nice this is going well coming down to the end slice-and-dice yes and the in just get out of here it might take a bit more damage all first quarrel this is cuz they're not friends Jimmy now have got down that Ridge I wonder why that happened it must be because they've got a blue relationship all the dead okay that's my team TDM when we're close to 200 so we've got 14 left how much experience we get cake though we haven't had to eat any cake I'll be what cloudy floss instead that's fine all right found them in okay it wasn't a chest there so maybe we didn't make you up I should have gone the other way shouldn't I what let's look at the best friends they were like three levels in one video stream level 10 sacré oh that could be dangerous take damage in place for a friend they won't lay a finger on you I don't know how I feel about that one because they just kind of do it but we can't spend some money now I need some cake so let's continue I would love that well now Gemma seems a tad miffed at grim the best thing for them now is to sort their differences in the same room put them together and they'll surely calm down let's hope they make up soon okay I'm gonna do that she I haven't changed the teams in a long time so let's switch these two so try us and grim at ryerson dantdm grim and Gemma I should work it out that's better let's eat some grub let's dish out this cake showing we have we don't have oh we do have cake let's give one to you now we go find it delicious perfect I want to make sure as many people that cake as possible devil's food cake is gonna go to you very to content of course it's cake one more cake this is the very rare one let's give it to James the chef so let's have the cake what look up boost my goodness two levels of magic and then Grimm is going to have this mushroom saute not tasty I'm unimpressed right all done full bellies let's spend some money what do they want though outlandish uniform that's cool it goes up 4 points the wooly robe kind of Christmasy very Christmasy and it's a monster just $9.99 damage okay I'm gonna prepared for that oh all that spicy look at

don't mind fighting more of them so we can afford to expensive things now I'll know okay this is less attractive well wind blades though is good but it's not amazing for the MP those combined they're pretty interesting though the problem with this is that they're gonna start making us evil and stuff which isn't gonna be fun but I feel like yeah we're doing okay we need to get at least two of them by the way home cooking is good the creepiness intensifies I remember that so funny right Grimm's eatin MP sweets versus sad why are you sad buddy shir he's gonna cheer trio's on I like that come on

gonna grab this picture and see if it disappears I can't grab the picture and see if it disappears but my mom is in there I'm guessing or maybe she's not maybe she bought a tattle-tale before oh jeez look there's a smash in the wall was that me when I threw my blocks at the wall I think it might have been let's try and replicate it huh there's a broom but why are there huh why there's so many doors in this house what is going on is this an office it freaks me out this opened by itself Teddy help me out please hello mom another door how big it what's safe yes please Teddy do you know the code for the safe maybe we should find it be rich and then leave mother by herself the code must be here somewhere or maybe it's in this freaky room hello that's a lot of drawers why does mum need so many coats and why is that hissing noises can you hear that it's like some weird hissing noise sounds like there's a snake in here what can I use to I need to unlock that door but I don't have anything to drag there I guess I could use this chair maybe come on share don't do this to me you can fit through look you're not stuck come on okay it might be stuck just a little bit yeah that's not gonna fit through okay we need another plan is there anything in these drawers cloves cloves again which I guess they can climb on these weird pot things they probably have expensive watches in but what else can I use nothing else pulls out far enough mommy's gonna be so mad where I am Ont fighters in the morning Oh could I reach it if I pull this out all the way there we go that's the stuff unlock perfect well kind of perfect I figured out the puzzle but there's also weird noises coming from here is that mom mom hello oh why is she got a pan door under her bed that's a little bit weird she really really needs to clean up her clothes as well this is pretty gross mom I'm the two-year-old here not you she even in there I don't know if she's in there you know guys let's find out mum mum

you crazy what's wrong with you there's an oven glove on the floor there's drips oh my goodness this is not good is it can I just can I just leave I just want to leave this house guys I'm out of here I can't even get out no no I want out what was that I think mom's playing a little bit of a trick on me is it Halloween it's at April Fool's Day ah that wasn't fair was it that wasn't fair at all I'm going back to cruel mode just so I can get out of here oh wait good is it was terrifying what is happening what are all these random doors what is that what on earth is that and why are there more coats I'm walking in I'm doing it I am the baby that does whatever it wants in time and space this is so weird whoa so I travel back inside she can't hear us and she seemed so distant maybe it's more like a memory of her yeah maybe yeah this is my memories isn't it can I grab this I can I've actually traveled to time on a pretty special child I'm a superhero of some sorts dude what is this time to open the imagery so I can use this at some point it's pretty cool I like it is this a slide if this is a slide I am a happy happy boy here we go let's get in and let's go down what's the worst that could happen oh my goodness open it just kill the child here we go yo what are you alright hello sir how are you he's just gone he's just going see you later buddy I have no idea it's little bit weird though isn't it it's like I don't know what is it like a weird wizard kind of world made of sand and planks this is so weird and there's a house through here to play house what's that doing here no idea I'm guessing I'm in some kind of like dream like a dream like nightmare worlds that's just a figment of my imagination it's very cool though but the house kind of scares me teddy it kind of scares me a lot how do you feel buddy do you feel safe I don't trust those eyes I'm gonna put you on my back just so I can keep an eye on you because I don't trust you it's all what's in the door this is locked I might be able to open it from the inside if you help me up okay yeah go be gone bear maybe I can trust you after all open the door please sir don't tease me come on open the door open the door oh here we go it is open what is this whoa what are you doing teddy blocks a machine this has given me real hello neighbor vibes listen there it is again what it sounds like it's coming from behind this door okay there must be a way to open it there must be but it's all made of pipes and it sounds like these are connected somehow okay let's let's open this there's nothing inside so anything else we can open maybe these drawers no is this something to do with the blocks no tell me what you're doing be careful it requires a sword yeah maybe anything we can use well of course we can use this right let's see what happens probably shouldn't put my mom's locket in there but let's see what happens it's only a dream right right close the door perfect and move this around let's see what happens I liked it it gets you to use the mouse movements like I'm not just clicking and moving the mouse as well did it work oh my goodness I think it's working look look at this but tons oh look there's a bear button and a human button which press it together buddy use your brain we have to press bolt at the same time that's what I just told you Teddy ready go yeah the same guys actually insane okay so our memories unlock the door B if we can find more memories like this it might bring us to her yeah maybe that sounds pretty cool like we need three more okay perfect so guys I actually think this is a good place to leave it um what I wanted to do with this game is make this initial video and if you guys liked it enough I would make basically a let's play that's almost unedited and uncut where we just play through the game maybe make it as second videos throughout the week on the weekend and stuff like that maybe even stream it I'm not sure but this is a very cool game I really want to see what happens I want to see what's through this door and if you do - please do you big fat like that we greatly appreciated if you want to see little Teddy again with his weird bug eyes and also leave a like if you want to stick around and see what happens in the rest of this adventure then please do subscribe and join team TDM today for daily videos apart from our guys thanks for joining me in this first episode of the game I hope you did enjoy it and I will see you guys next time good bye [Music] 
ah other guy is terrifying I'm gonna use him hey guys how's it going welcome back to fortnight now I wasn't gonna play this game again on the channel because I play a lot off-camera now I mean a lot and before I recorded again I wanted to get good at it which hasn't yet hasn't happened yet but I do have this snowflake umbrella now which is good that means I won for a second time twice but the reason I am playing in today is two reasons one reason you guys love this game you tell me to play it again every single day on Twitter and Instagram and comments and all that good stuff second reason is they've got a brand new game mode which is called high explosives that's right I think you only get access to grenades and RPGs maybe grenade launchers as well but there's a lot of explosions that are gonna happen in this game mode I haven't even tried it yet it's only out for like five days so I thought I would give it a go especially of this guy because I bought this guy ages ago and I haven't used them yet if you do enjoy the four night videos and were like see some more leave a big fat thumbs up that'd be greatly appreciated subscribe if you are new and let's play so my favorite place to land at the moment is that the beautiful either Aniki acres or fatal fields either one I don't know why I just really really like them but this is gonna be different because we're only gonna be able to find explosives we also need to hear out for explosives and probably get our building on points so we can block the explosives looks like everyone else had the same idea as well this is a bad idea this is a bad idea this is a bad idea are we going to guys did I get them today YUM I got him I got him but where are the explosives did I load the wrong modes I have no idea I have no idea I don't know what I've done wrong there are gonna be people absolutely everywhere get rekt punks okay I'm not cracker is now literally levelling up before our very eyes we're gonna take this and we're gonna leave that's he's already taken this and the ring is super duper close it's like it's literally on us you know I think I chose the wrong game mode but it's absolutely fine we've got a good start two kills already that's way more than I'm going videos before right there's someone destroying those towers should we see if we can get them I think if we build stairs here there we go we should be able to do this oh I saw me first you definitely saw me first Wow got him Gordon got me hasn't got any shields which is kids oh jeez no no stop that stop that right now he's throwing grenades like above my head no I was trying to drink my potion you punk you only had 70 health left as well I'm mad let's actually choose the right game-mode this time well sir they're gonna be bringing the silenced pistol in soon which is crazy and sneaky silences so literally a ninja game mode which sounds incredible and only gonna be out for three days on January the 5th this is mad oh my goodness yep yep there's definitely no chase these explosives already now I'm just just a lonely ugly Nutcracker look at this this is going to be insane guys what is happening there we go Aniki acres it is again this is gonna be scary tic tacs I'm going straight back into the back of this house let's go I need something explosive that'll do thank you very much that'll do thank you very much I'm going straight to the roof because there's usually yeah here we go someone wants some someone wants some who wants some huh you want some get rekt Punk get rekt oh geez this is insane actually insane let's see if we can kill them I can hear absolutely nothing what is going on here guys someone's firing at me who is it is it you huh is it you oh my goodness I hit the chair I hit the chair hello Oh get out of here I don't like you goodbye no four days biggest fail is me they were knocked out as well and I was like I got to I got so excited well at least that was my like little intro to the whole thing that was a little bit just a little bit crazy I wasn't sure where my brain was at I wasn't sure where my aiming was at I wasn't sure where everyone else was that but that was fun same strategy I'm going straight in let's grab everything that we can that is perfect we're blowing up any punk that comes in this house ooh legendary grenade launcher don't mind if I do ammo don't mind if I do no they're scared of me aren't they that's what's happening there's someone running let's see if they go for this chest down here I think they're gonna let's go let's go get them get them get them Oh got 50 of the help as well that was insane oh geez oh geez someone's coming this is crazy absolutely crazy I take so long to load as well you have to kind of like guess where they're going well whoa whoa whoa whoa ah this is the most ridiculous thing ever come on reload reload reload reload reload no please 24th is definitely done in squads oh my goodness this thing is insane I'm just playing used to get to my XP and then one demo play normally I think oh I landed this one a little bit wrong I landed it at 20 very long run Nutcracker run that there's three chests under here and we can't let anyone else get any others that's one come on number two that's kids perfect number three amazing now let's not get blown up and we'll be fine no no no don't you blow me up you little punk no no no no I think so yes gotcha I'm not gonna make the same mistake as last time let's just finish him off nicely come on I need to reload this is the slowest kill ever that's so funny right let's uh let's play this properly shall we not that this is gonna help much but it's at least gonna give you some kind of ground to shoot other people there's someone this one right there here we go here we go it takes so long for them to get there so long someone's firing at me someone's firing at me no that took this game is insane the person behind me killed me this game mode is just nuts three games two kills considering that's a squad based game I don't think that's too bad my goodness I'm going back to normal because that game-mode stresses me out was the other game Oh too much for you as well yeah I thought so this one's much funner okay let's try again clean slate new place same Nutcracker let's do this okay chest good let's grab this bougie bomb oh we haven't tried the boogey bomb yet I got a kill with this the other day and it was hilarious it's so funny because there's definitely someone in there can we go to the top and just destroy them I want to use the boogey bomb let's see if we can do it here we go where do they not come up here I saw dust are they did come up here hello hello I'm gonna throw this and you're gonna die that's how this is gonna work okay let me go yes hello that's hilarious get no no no no no I messed up I definitely messed up let's shielded their shield it that was the stupidest exchange ever ie actually boogie bombed them and then missed every shot I mean that's that pretty much sums up my fortnight experience we've got the kill it's the right wait we lost some health but it's fine oh my goodness this game is gonna give me a heart attack alright sniper as well don't mind if I do alright let's rearrange this okay there we go right I really want to put a trap on the roof just so if anyone comes up here they get absolutely destroyed by the way small disclaimer I hate to burst rifles like a lot ringers on us this is good I felt I feel good about this game could do us some health in that though waise check these always there's nothing here did you hear that someone's here someone's definitely here where are you I think that in this building here like I'm standing on I try to see through these gaps to see where they are thing is if I jump down and that then not in there I've made a big mistake hello hello there's a medkit in there as well I need that there you are there you are okay I saw you I saw you okay they're in there no this game oh there are 100 100 I was never gonna win that I needed grenades where are the explosives when you need them okay I'm pretty so up for this game and you know what is really rare these have not been taking you I think we might have Aniki acres to ourselves and we grabbed a flippin grenade launcher that's insane right I'm coming into this one this game is the one we need to get top 10 if I don't get top 10 and we so mad no one's even taking this loot yet this is crazy Oh jump at soo I like it and another untouched chest which has no lion but the bandages will do circle is a little bit away from us but that's not so bad we can make our way around to to go another boogie bomb I don't know whether to get rid of it though yeah sure I've got a med kit it's fine yeah we need to get a move on guys this is this is gonna be tricky how is there only 30 people left already that's insane oh no we desperately need to go like desperately oh geez I get too distracted by why could loot so I'm just like oh what's this ooh what's this and then I just get killed by the storm with no kills see what I mean I mean the storm already I'm gonna have to use my med kit now you know what since I do have a med kit I don't really want to read run headfirst into dusty depots so I am going to just run around the edge a little bit oh there's someone over there I'm gonna run to those and kill them can you see them they're right there we won't be able to loot them but at least we'll be able to kill them this is never a good idea but I'm gonna do it anyway here we go yeah there we go he died right on the edge of the storm as well so we can have his stuff mm let me just quickly make some walls just so we don't get collapsed by anyone I want to heal up real quick and then we go to his stuff this is going well too well perfect I think he had yeah he had another med kit as well that's insane do I want grenade launcher or sniper I think I'm actually gonna go for shotgun because I'm terrible with a sniper basically oh my goodness the next ring is far we have got to get our skates on odds on someone being up here pretty high we also don't want anyone to come up from behind us oh there's gonna be someone on the top there isn't there oh jeez look at that look all the building this happened in this one this is insane right I need to shine US launch pads I think I'm gonna launch pads if I can actually build guys I hate it when he does that right we've seen a lot of new stuff today we're gonna launch pad as well I might just wait until the storm is really close just to make sure no one's here and let's go launch pads that was an incredibly good idea because otherwise we would have been completely destroyed but now we need to be even more careful okay you know what I could be stuck in the storm again it doesn't matter doesn't matter it's all right so I got myself another med kit right this is gonna finish on fatal fields I'm probably in the worst place possible whoa okay I'm hearing shots already there's someone shooting from here are we gonna get another storm kill I think we might do yes haha right I need to go I need to go I need to go I need to go someone was following though actually I'm gonna pop this here I have to where did I get to from I have no idea this better do it quick enough come on come on come on we've got this there we go right we have to storm kills that's insane actually and said he killed that guy as well okay what is gonna go down here I could use the resources that'd be great I'm gonna go up on this building and probably bills let's see is there anyone else up here I think we're good I can't check that guy's loot that's the only annoying thing about killing people in the store but we did it we got to storm kills two more people need to die to get to top 10 and this is actually a usable game yes problem is I need to I need to cross fatal fields to get to the next place I might actually go around this way let's do this it's going to nighttime as well my least favorite time closer people have got the same idea this is gonna be treacherous really treacherous but least the storms moving super slow now so we should be okay I'm sure someone's there already but I'm gonna give it a go I'm gonna go up to the top and see if I can destroy them risky risky risky did they make it to the top surely they did surely they did no yep they're there they're there okay can you see them yes oh I guess that is such a good kill such a good kill I need to build desperately I thought there might be people coming up behind us but there isn't we would have seen them by now you know what I am gonna take the sniper I think the sniper is better than the rocket launcher right now this is tense seven people to go watch in a decent position but there the ring is not on us which is bad right let's not make any silly mistakes okay we're going in for we're in top five okay this is way more than a usable game where is everyone else we need to check it out I'm so glad that guy had a sniper I don't think there's anyone over there there's a Supply Drop down there which I'm sure people are gonna go for but apart from that I'm not gonna move to the last minute I don't know about you but I can see like no basis at all so guns surprisingly quiet down here I'm thinking oh there's someone that there's someone there right there soon we can get them it's a sneaky snipe can we get it nope we're good right we're gonna have to get moving I think my goal is to steal that guy's base or I can just build my own I think I'm gonna build my own no one's gonna follow me from up there yeah this was build let's be super safe that was not the best base building in the world but we're gonna have to take down this felled tree come on tree destroyed destroy it's going to give us our give away our whole plan but hey you know what I'm just happy to be here the next ring is on guy is bass how have I not seen anyone else yet this tree is in the perfect position by the way like absolutely perfect shots are going down no one has died yet that's actually crazy someone said someone said where are you where are you there you are okay needs a concentrate need to concentrate need to concentrate got you all the headshot is in okay I am in big trouble right now because I have got in the storm there's people around I am going to die pretty badly I think okay Wally's distracted I'm gonna go this way come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on no it's risky no oh man I didn't know where to go oh there was someone down there this guy's got like the best base man we came forth we came for that last one was tricky because if the circle came to the other side this guy would about to move towards me I could have bought a built a bigger base but hey I messed up I could have done better this guy has to win surely oh oh it's going down it is going down oh my goodness okay hey there we go good job buddy well done we got killed by the winner I mean that base was pretty spectacular we had she got like we got four kills in total but two of them were in this storm why would you do that it's just my style I guess fine fine I'll do another high-explosive not crack around to finishing off the see how this goes remember I'm by myself other people are in squads of up to four so it's really not gonna go well oh this house has so much ridiculous in it look we've got grenade launchers we got ourselves rocket launcher and someone's already trying to explode me who is doing that to my home I forgot these are here always forget the tires are there thank you okay I'll take the shield not so bad and the legendary grenade launcher don't mind if I do hello how are you I'm just gonna blow you up there we go eat snowballs oh my goodness I got him I got him I got anybody I'm so dead I'm running I'm running away I didn't see that to the last minute and then the chimney was coming down on my head oh my goodness quick I want to go up there quick quick quick good job I had that shield right there's someone over there let's go let's go snowballs let's do this and one for luck yes I got you I got you I got you oh so I got one person I think the other person is down there somewhere I don't really know where where did you go huh where'd you go I need to finish you oh hey hey how's it going see you later oh my goodness they actually protected you bye finally got the kills I deserved I probably shouldn't be out in the open because I'm a little bit scared but you know what we got two kills we're doing all right why does this always happen to me okay that's pretty far away I'm gonna try and lay low for as long as possible I think we have this to ourselves what's crazy is you're not really gonna be able to be shot in the back because you can hear the rockets coming from literally miles away so the chances of you getting shot in the back are very small what should happen to me in this video though there's definitely someone over there are they by themselves though who knows who knows come on come on come on this is so dumb I got him I got him I got him I got something did he run bro did you run from me no he's that is that no oh boy that was close this guy he's just running away thinking he doesn't know where I am that's amazing this mode is great and so dumb but guys I think that's the perfect end to this video I hope you enjoyed it was just a collection of highlights of me playing over the past like hour and a half or so if you enjoyed it and we'd like to see some more please leave a thumbs up that we greatly appreciate it if it's happens to be the first we think you seem I mean please you can say the subscriber jerk joy shame TDM today poor daily and video is far from that guys that was a lot of fun I hope you enjoyed it too and I'll see you next time good bye 
that's right I got my Christmas hat on and that can only mean one thing it's time to go back to prison now I know you're thinking hold up hold up Dan what are you talking about Christmas does not mean prison and why are you going back to prison again you've been back to prison like 24 times what today is a little bit different I am volunteering myself to go into prison because I've heard about this brand-new Christmas prison that needs looking at it's called Santa shakedown this modern clean prison has it all state-of-the-art equipment high-tech security measures and an overly theatrical warden more concerned with putting on an extravagant pantomime and the well-being of his inmates look past the tacky decorations and an opportunity to escape my present itself this sounds interesting we go back to prison I love this game you love this game let's go oh yeah I forgot they've actually released the prison editor as well which is actually amazing because it means anyone can make any prison they like and you can download prisons online it's insane well let's get back to that later here we go the Christmas music is a play in and I have volunteered myself remember I was not arrested I volunteered myself to go into this prison today and here it is the stage which used to be the gymnasium that's that's interesting there's a trapdoor in the middle as well so we check that out oh oh oh is that Santa's office who is that look look at his head yeah that's that's not Santa here we go a very own Christmassy little prison cell I'm glad they allow us to have our very own decorations that's that's very cute I like it right let's see we got to work with timber and that's that's terrible that's really terrible just put that in there though I had to learn how this prison works I'm guessing I'm going to need it some money just so I can get myself a nice little bit of hello again my twin is back how you doing buddy but yeah I need to get some money go to the payphones and see I can get out of here guys I think we have a problem I am I don't think there's any payphones here oh no I like this though we've got like a snowman and a Christmas tree the music is phenomenal oh there's different items as well we got wrapping paper I'm gonna grab that just in case we need it I'm not sure what we needed for but I'm at least gonna try Hey look the warden I like you I like your antlers buddy they look cool right first course of action seeing as there are no payphones whatsoever we're going to head to the theater just to see what earth is going on here there it is the big old theater now it looks like there's a trap door right there but I have no idea how you're meant to get there what is all this stuff I can't open any of the presents I can't get in the top ah there's no chest behind there or anything so I'm not I'm not quite sure what on earth I'm I look there are pay phones oh thank goodness have a look top of the naughty list it's behind you or ex mace you can make an ex mace is like christmas-themed weapons as well how much money do I have 25 I need to do some jobs I'm so glad there's pay phones cuz I'd be lost otherwise look at this cardboard Christmas tree is all it's amazing right I have myself 75 coins I'm gonna buy myself the top of the naughty list hints because the other one is a multiplayer one boom whatever gang according to see the warden last week she pretended that she hadn't seen it there was a to-do list on the wall with a list of what to do to get Santa to appear what I don't know about you but I think the chance of Santa turning up here is slim to say the least if you get a chance go check it out it's hilarious oh and while you're there take a look at that cushy little lounge the warden has made for himself how the other half live ha that fancy looking fireplace must be where he hopes Santa will pop out from ha so I need to get into the warden's office how do I do that apart from being being bad where is the warden's office it's it showed me on the intro ah it's up here let's go and take a look here it is we've got vents that can access it we've also got wait can we just walk in do we do we not have to yeah we can let you just go in hey hey buddy how's it going to you the warden nope nope your bill see you later bill bye so we can just get in here whenever we like place treats for Santa okay there's a lot of presents in here do I get in trouble if I'm in here by the way bill doesn't seem to mind at all where's the to-do list - here it is note to self don't forget to finish the letter to Santa and put out the treats for him need to get a mince pie and some milk and the carrot for the reindeer according to my nephew if I put the letter with my Christmas list in the fireplace the contents will go straight to Santa maintenance disagree in a flagged it as a health and safety violation maybe take it up with HR so we need a letter mince pie milk and carrots how on earth we get those things is there a crafting recipe for a letter to Santa there certainly is a letter and a piece of paper pretend carrot as well I remember that from the previous Christmas prison that's cool I seen a letter in someone's cell definitely I can't remember which one it was but there was a letter in someone's cell earlier there's also these random chests everywhere I think we should be able to escape this today but we just need to find the right things oh my goodness this is great let's take that back and that's that's part of the that's part of the letter that's also part of carrots that's amazing and the mince pie is a tin and also some mints where do I get those from there's also something to do with a pantomime horse as well that must be maybe the multiplayer escape I'm not sure but that's what this fabric is for that's that's so weird oh wait a second what is this you can get inside the guards desks without needing a key I mean you get in trouble but I can at least take a look in I just need officer Brown to move and then I should be able to get in there I didn't realize you could go in there that's cool I'm just gonna wait here and see what happens can I sneak in now let's see let's go in it worked okay we can search the guards desk apparently the guards stay here now we've got duct tape wrapping paper in a pillowcase I don't think we need any of those things but I'm gonna take what am I gonna take I don't think I need the fabrics I'm gonna take both of these I'm just gonna see what I can get away with let's just see if we can go in here oh I think it worked let's search all of these desks we've got a lighter I don't think we need any of those things and then finally we've got this which contains the letter and some other things we don't need that stuff no no wasn't me was not me there's also a chest in here and a random shower so there's like a guards quarters here that's that's pretty cool we got shot at trial I don't think I need to knock anyone out today so we don't need that just yet I can just take a shower here though with um with no water oh no oh no I messed up I've messed up big-time I need to get downstairs I forgot about the duct tape you'll never catch me punks you'll never ever well you might catch me but I won't have much stuff on me right let's see what else we need these crafting recipes are confusing me we need like a letter but how do we how do we get a letter there's no crafting recipe Bert let's uh we also need some oh we needed some tissue ah there was some in the previous desk and a green pen let me do a quick search I need to plant something in here anyway Oh green pen that's what I'm talking about and that could be it a favor as well Secret Santa so good that they're getting into the Christmas spirit right I just need a I just need a piece of tissue paper then I can get myself the fake carrots already and then I need ice to need a mince pie I'm guessing you're gonna need like a special mission let's see if any of these guys have got it no there's literally just Secret Santas that's all and I need to craft things oh my goodness I'm starting to think we might need some keys to get into oh maybe not we can just we can just walk in ZZ it just is too much of Christmas there's nothing in it but at least I get access to it scuse me guys do you have access to mince pies at all do you hankerchief that's what I need I don't think I need wrapping paper at all do i I'm gonna take it anyway so actually I can go ahead and craft myself a fake carrots I'm pretty sure let me just put them all in I don't know if I have enough intelligence yet I do return current okay that's one of the pieces that we need hmm I wonder if any of these guys are selling anything we needs I don't see anyone selling anything for you know the mince pies but I guess we'll find out soon would be handy if they did because I have no idea where to get it from right let's sleep get on to a new day and try and find this stop oh oh look I've just found the pastry case uh what do I need to get rid of I need to I need to grab this otherwise it's gonna disappear I don't get rid of this grab this we've got a pastry case okay we just need to find just found that randomly so I don't really know where you can find the rest I'm guessing you just need to keep checking desks is that it anyway I need to raise my intellect so give me some me some time and I'll come back a much smarter man guys I found bananas I could make I could make a banana pie instead of a mince pie with that would that go with that buying no ok I'm now much smarter human being than before I need to do this this secret santa mission which is collecting just stuff to make a makeshift sledgehammer yeah that's right because I don't know if the Secret Santa opportunity allows you to unlock anything Oh birds you know why I said it like that bars pretty excited if you couldn't sell I got mints okay that's good can I make a mince pie now I want to make it here we go I got it that's beautiful now to make something less Christmassy I just need to make a sledgehammer and and then we're fine but as I was saying I don't know if this allows you to unlock any other items because it's one of those missions that you have to do three of them to complete I'm gonna take this I'm then gonna craft myself the sledge hammer I think I have enough intellects I do there it is absolutely just atrocious intimidating all of those things I need to give this to someone as well who needs a sledge hammer this is part of a Secret Santa remember where you just give gift to someone in the dantdm it's for Hollow oh no that was someone else who do I give this to Oh beat up dantdm with the sledgehammer okay dantdm I'm gonna smack you real hard buddy I know he's going to his job yeah you're gonna have to wait till later we have to put this away now because I don't to get in trouble for this so you know what the last thing that I need I've got mince pie I've got the carrot I need the letter to Santa which I'm not actually sure how to do because I've got the letter but I don't have the like the written part to put inside not sure how to do that and I also need some milk as well again not sure how I do that it makes me sad when people don't appreciate my generosity crafts a makeshift sledgehammer and teach dantdm why they should appreciate that friends forever tisha I'm AIDS you know I don t yeah you should appreciate these things believe you don't a friends forever t-shirt needs to be taken seriously buddy are you kidding me I'm coming for you I'm coming for you right now high damage low speeds high range I haven't got the fitness of strength for this so I'm just gonna have to hit and hope I'm gonna keep everything else so it's gonna be fine if I get caught but I need to hit this guy desperately huh got him got him got him got him oh geez quick get him get him he's already knocked out that didn't count nah leave me alone leave me alone no no no no no no no I can't believe I didn't get to finish him off I've only got three heat and this guy is chasing me down this isn't fair I'm gonna put the sledgehammer away right mince pie carrot check I don't know how to do the letter and I think I'm gonna be late for dinner it's not a good day and I can make it I can make it I can make it it's gonna be close but I got it yes I feel like I just need a pen and some paper to craft the letter Shirley that's all you need the problem is there's no crafting recipe in here for a letter it's all just it's just telling me to do this where is it and what is this room for unless there's a mail job like a mail man's job then I could understand it right attempt number two hitting myself with a sledgehammer oh no he's going to roll cool like right now why I just need to hit you buddy I'm gonna take him out in one you ready yes yes kinda know why you hitting me buddy I just need to get this guy there we go almost there oh geez I need to not get hit one more time so we'll die okay they are distracted where did dantdm go here he is I'm gonna smack you buddy got him and now I'm dead I did it though I did it I kinda wanted to check what was on him just in case he has a job that I need to get the letter from but that's the thing I'm gonna check next jobs board what we got yeah mail sorting who has that job Jay bomb I need to get in there somehow but I'm not sure how Jay bomb you need to lose your job buddy oh jeez I need to get back so quickly quick quick quick quick quick I'm gonna mean shut up come on yes I made it okay right I think I needs I literally just need that letter and the milk I need to steal someone's job and it ain't gonna be pretty I wish I had the sledgehammer still you know what I might actually be able to craft something that could knock J bomb out and then here's to hoping he actually has a letter on him I just need some chocolate and then I can get it or a paper clip and then I can make bazap ax then I just need some milk and then I'm pretty much done here what it's a Christmas list and it was just chilling in here I am dumbfounded but also extremely appreciative of that now I just need milk I was just about to say I just need to find milk in a random chest somewhere because that's just a randomly generating item that I know from playing the escape is so much and there's there's the paper grip that I was looking for okay I don't need that anymore I just need milk now this is this is going well some would say - well but that's let's find out let's check all these random desks just to see if they've got anything in them check it or you got for me you've got the chocolate eye they need it as well you kidding me I got two ways to knock someone out I don't actually need to knock someone out anymore I just need milk I got both mince pie things in there I don't need that anymore I'm finding some incredible things but I don't need any of them just give me giving them out steal my milk yes milk that's what I'm talking about ah no one's stealing my milk today I'm stealing theirs right okay I think we're actually are we done here I'm not quite sure I feel a little bit pensive and I'm not sure why because it seems almost too easy which is crazy I don't usually like to say that because I will mess something up right we have pretend carrots we don't need the chocolate mint spy the letter is what we need to craft now so let's quickly do that Christmas list plus letter craft it is a letter to Santa very very cool a fact we need something else milk carrots mince pie letter is that all we needs is that all we need to please Santa the big being here's I guess so I'm not really sure what else we need to do we just need to go I guess we can just check at the warden's office because that's where the that's where the list is and I'm right next to it so let's check it out real quick it's the warden bill I don't really know I feel like it's not Bill and he just chills out here let's have a look mince pie milk carrot and letter to Santa is that it is that all I need to do then Santa will visit me in prison let's see what happens I voluntarily sent myself to see if Santa exists in prison let's find out I need to craft the mince pie I'm pretty sure buddy I have one right here I have one right there we go oh oh okay what do I need next milk okay let's do this add the milk very nice I should craft a pretend carrot that will fool him there we go I need to crop the letter and put it in the fireplace I don't know if I want to put this in the fireplace I spent ages right in this but you know what at the risk of missing exercise time getting in trouble and being put on the naughty list here we go yeah we're just gonna chill in here as well and just wait for it to happen oh my goodness there he is hey dudes can you help me get out of here please are we gonna mug him oh goodness we are dude what look at him I feel so bad actually feel horrible am I just gonna get out of here in the santur outfit that's classy kind no that's not classy at all like I'll do look we can steal his sleigh as well haha wow we knocked Santa out took his took his outfit and then and stole his reindeer which the only appears to be four of them there's usually more but it's fine I guess he doesn't want to risk bringing all his reindeer to prison again it's Santa I get up here we go let's launch ourselves into the air and fly away get out of prison and you know what I wasn't meant to being here in the first place so let's go only problem is when they do find Santa I might be sent straight back to prison because man I heard Santa one of the most important men in the world and there I go look they can't even believe their eyes where's my present this is orchids okay there it is buddy right in your face we did it we got a I feel like I'm just really good at this game now I mean that one wasn't too difficult in the previous Christmas one you had to do a lot of getting behind certain doors and stuff I feel like I may be missing a very cool ending with the pantomime cuz you have to make horse and stuff because you do actually have to buy all of the things you know that was fun I love to the music in this one I say that all the time about The Escapist but the music in this one was particularly good and that's some and that's the sense of prison done I've kind of like did I really just do it that quickly it took me 40 minutes which I guess isn't so bad I'm fairly sure this is a free DLC so you guys go and check it out hang out with your friends and try and get the other escape that I didn't have which I'm pretty sure it to do with a pantomime horse which sounds great so guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did a big fat thumbs up or like would be greatly appreciated and it has to be the first thing that you see mommy please do consider subscribing to join same TDM day for daily videos part in that guys thank you so much for watching and getting involved with my investigation into the Santa prison I think it's safe to say that we succeeded we got what we wanted we wanted the info about whether Santa visits prison it's true he does pretty probably shouldn't in the future and maybe he won't ever again because I left him on the floor of a prison and took his sleigh whoops yeah thank you so much for watching you're the best our amazing date right [Music] 
ah yeah you guys definitely want me to play this on camera yes the welcome back to the escapist to where today we are so what closer to completing in this game there's only three prisons left which is mad and they do keep adding prisons cuz we just completed the wicked ward which is pretty awesome and in that video I asked you guys if you want me to complete all the rest of the prisons on camera or just go straight for the USS anomaly you guys said yeah you definitely want me to complete these on camera so today I thought it'd be fun to try the aeroplane prison because we've got Air Force Con and also for tundra left and I thought we'd do a little warm-up by trying to escape a plane prison yeah it sounds a bit crazy let's just go in and just as I thought this is going to be one of those where you kind of have to sneak around and try and get off the plane kind of like when we escaped on a jet ski that time so it sounds like fun let's do this hey my outfit I'm wearing yellow today looking good and is the front of the plane whenever we could actually like take out all the guards and just fly this plane home I think that'd be amazing okay so I'm gonna put this to you guys very very quickly I'm gonna change myself to escape this prison as quickly as possible because these ones the kind of stray away from the traditional escapist gameplay usually aren't too difficult so let's try and get out of this plane as fast as possible I would like to skip this now here we go we've got some time left and I have no idea what we need to do let's interact with this though escape tip it's gonna give us the escape tip for free I like that okay it's vitally thoroughly read this through you want to get off this plane you kind of need to be cunning and crafty but most of all brave okay I can do that that's the computer that controls this thing located north of this plane you're gonna need to somehow affect it to accelerate your plans for freedom okay that sounds pretty interesting there's also another one here multiplayer I don't have friends I told you about this oh jeez oh I'm sorry about a hundred already what No leave me alone that is uncalled for Mac Mac are you kidding me right now I get beat down for just walking out of my door you're my hit list Mac you're my hit list the literally didn't put me in my own bed again I want to read this plane crazy now and suggest this if I didn't think it could be done would you have to speak around not be seen by the guards while you try and seek out all the items you need what you're looking for can then be combined to give you a parachute I know I know it's crazy right once you have what you need let's just say there's a door just above and to the right of the starting cells luck okay so I think we can escape right here if we get a red key can we go on the plane's wing look at this if we go out here that'd be amazing but no I think he means here I need to craft a makeshift parachute to be able to do that right let's see if we can find out to do that makeshift harness components parachute it needs three rope and it's not a bedsheet I could do this give me your bed sheet suck up thank you that's definitely what we need okay we need to wait for you to go because Mack is not my biggest fan and let's sneak around okay I'm gonna sneak through here this is going to be an absolute master course in crafting a parachute where's my rope there's none there we got string I don't think that's gonna work where do we go next it looks like we could just take this plane to any location and get out of here quick quick quick quick I'm gonna be in trouble I'm gonna be in trouble give me our there's nothing in there no okay there's toilets there's lots of seats this place is an absolute mess are you kidding me I'm gonna grab this Can I grab this before he grabs me quick quick there's nothing in here what I'm sorry no I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry let me find a locker is a locker here's a locker interacts they'll never find me okay there's three floors to this thing we've got still a bunch of time left let's go let's go up and see what's there we've got some kind of you know what we got a desk there's a games console there as well that's awesome right one piece of rope down two more to go hello guys do not tell on me and I will be your best friend I want to see what is in here there's nothing that I need a bottle of medicine a broom handle a crowbar don't come in here do not come in here I think we could I think we could right we've got the guards kind of hide away look at this they're our own games consoles and stuff right I'm going downstairs there must be some rope down here oh she's not it needs not go downstairs oh there's a desk right here I didn't see that no no no give me it give me no why where lockers where are the lockers there's a locker down there I think I can get inside in time ha ha ha ha didn't see me respect the baton no no not okay luckily there is a desk right next to us it said component desk it has a contraband desk there are no contraband in here this is mugs and handkerchiefs these guys are strict around here jeez all right let's check this one what's gonna be a sides show me rope perfect any more rope around oh no no no no I use my locker get some I look against my safe place breathe it's fine it's fine then I'm gonna see me see no idea can I take a shortcut through the kitchen I definitely can there better be rope in here if there's rope in here I'm out of here oh man a sock could we use a sock instead where are the other desks

rope you know you want to yes yes I got the rope I actually got it okay I need to craft uh this this this there we go and then this and this crafted right oh geez no I need to run out of here I need to run how they put it in our main slots and then I'm just running he's going down this way okay I don't even care I'm just going come on come on didn't see me here we go the biggest escape of the year and I'm out of here let's go I told you quickest escape so far let's leave Go Go okay I don't think that went as plans did it how do you know what it's looking pretty good yes buddy we are out of here I don't even know how long that took it's gonna tell us though seven and a half minutes I still gotta see okay thanks for that I got an a last time man right there is definitely another way out of here there's two ways to get our peppers in so we're heading back in and we're gonna play again just to find out what the other escape route is now they said something about the computer at the front right I need to do something that affects the computer located north of this plane so are there any crafting recipes for that maybe a stun gun would that work consume at trees wire paper I think we might have seen all that stuff you know let's see if we can find it I feel like we've seen all of those components right paperclip check we've definitely got one of those I don't know how I'm gonna hold all this stuff that I'm gonna do my best it'll be good if we can get the batteries first we could definitely double up on batteries we've got one battery and that's it I don't need a banana I'm out of here is this the computer sabotage auto pilots maybe I can force it thing to land oh you need a circuit boards no what a stun gun might be pretty fun anyway definitely saw a circuit board last time no I didn't think you were gonna see me oh this is not good this is definitely not good look at I'm closed the door behind you chumps right let's look in the contraband desk there must be a circuit board in here there's not do you steal socks here socks are considered contraband kind of establishment is this right nothing in there either where is our little security friend gonna go is he gonna go up or down he's going up okay you didn't see me no you didn't see me you didn't see anything no how did you dogs cover that way quick quick quick quick quick quick quick open it open it that must be a circuit board in here no there's a wire though I'm gonna take it don't get out no he's gonna find me he will watch me go into the locker and he can't find me why is that medic standing on a case what is wrong with you okay there's definitely nothing in that chest either okay what are you daddy got it they must be bored because there's not really anything else happening I don't even know

I hit them oh he hit them again no they won the fight you take my hammer off me now let's take me all the way back to the beginning so I think the first escape was one of the fastest but this one ain't so quick when I kept the circuit board from last time one-hit ko to me what woman is too powerful way too powerful all right I'm gonna go down and see if there's anything below what have we got what have we got give me no they spotted me no come on give me the sake board well there's a lot of stuff in there um not a sake board though right I have no idea where I'm going old cheese look at this inflate raft yo if I had friends that would be amazing okay there's another chest up here I think I can grab before he hits me please show me just got the circuit let's go let's go I've got a baseball bat just in case I can't see go away tooltip' go away you're scaring my chances of escaping this place here we go right let's give the circuit board to you an energy module would overload the oh geez do need one of those I need one of these I see one more battery there it is there it is okay I've got it I've got it I just need to actually I'm not gonna craft it yet because the only thing they can take off me is my baseball bat no leave me alone oh man I need to crop this quick really quick let's do this this this craft and then put it onto here now I just need a screwdriver and the plane will have to land oh please be in here please be in here you know you want to know put a crowbar not work the same I can't even remember where it was and this guy's after me no leave me alone I

great time to force these birds to find somewhere to land here we go am I gonna do it myself I actually can't fly a plane okay where we gonna land I'm thinking New York I'm thinking the Bahamas I'm thinking Hawaii Oh yep you definitely broke it not sure you should break a computer that should keep a plane in the air that would be bad where we gonna land just in a desert you know what that's fine I'll collect my mother's later this guy we did it that was not the quickest escape ever but yep see I got an ass butts the first one was so I'll take it so what does that mean that means that we've got ourselves just oh wait we got it one small step for an inmate one giant leap for a correctional facility job roots is far you are skilled escapees but now it's time to face the final frontier get ready to blast off to a prison which is literally out of this world and okay we actually unlocked it I thought we'd have to do the four tundra one we haven't done that yet but I'm not complaining guys we're going to space there's no doubt about it I'm not gonna put myself in for tundra prison it looks cold we're going straight for the space prison if you guys are excited then please leave a massive

I've got a confession. I, umm started recording two minutes ago and realized this camera wasn't on so um hey How's it going about a minute ago? I was blind and exhausted from being hungry, which was uh, which was terrifying that here's a clip? Guys I've made a terrible mistake I'm exhausted okay, so basically when you get your hunger all the way down to one apparently you almost go well You go blind. I didn't realize that that's bad Yeah, wasn't the funniest experience of my life was it Trayaurus at all, but I tried to borrow this dogs googly eyes He wouldn't give them to me, but hey. You know what it's absolutely fine We have got a whole harvest of tomatoes ready to go because today guys we are building a blacksmith And hopefully something else as well the big problem is I need smooth stone and smooth stone Is pretty hard to come by like really hard to get because I don't have coal 'Cause I don't think it spawns in the natural world But what is exciting or slightly upsetting at the same time is summer is almost over But we've got lots of crops ready to go so hopefully we'll be making a lot of bank very very soon Umm, Yeah, that's only got five days left, which is pretty exciting this has three days. Wait, they're tomatoes. Okay they're tomatoes I've only just harvested them these have, uhh, 20. Oh my goodness 20... 22 days! That's nuts! This farming stuff is gonna kill me gonna be the end of me Trayaurus you hear me you hear me right now, right? That's watered. I'm all like, really hungry already. How's it going Jade? You good? What you got to say actually? "I would really like to start selling flowers but I heard That's  for a future update whatever that means" that would be good if you could sell flowers that'll be great But then kind of defeats the point of me giving you flowers, right? Is there anywhere nearby that kind of looks like it might have Coal I think I need to go on a little bit of an expedition I think I might go over this way, which is that way right? I've got a single pork chop That's all I have have a feeding tray as well for some reason Because I need coal to make smooth stone to be able to buy this mine that we need Right let's uh, let's feed the cows. That's all these guys out Let me do all my jobs and stuff have you given me an egg yet, sir I think you have I see you right there. Thanks buddy. Thanks for the egg. I I appreciate it chicken feed goes Here, I don't know why I've got this extra feeding tray. Does it go here? I mean I might as well Let's put another load in here, so it takes ten a time. I didn't realize that also I made a grave mistake I made the hay from the previous buildings into wheat and then I made that into bread But apparently week gives you a hundreds like a hundred each time and bread only gives You like sixty it gives you less anyway, but there's three wheat that make bread, and I just messed up, okay? I could have made so much more money chicken. Right, I think I've done all my job so far. I need to brush and milk my cows as well, which are actually having a delightful time I think right brush brush brush brush brush. I don't think I actually need to click. I can only click once which is good I want to make sure that when this cow actually ages up It doesn't go all like it doesn't disappear because it hasn't got a lead right now because I can't afford one Slimeballs would be great to have but I don't have them right now Fodder I don't need right now. I guess I could feed them by hand right there. You go. Enjoy enjoy I'm already getting really hungry. What's that about that's insane. It's gonna have to eat this up I don't have any more food anymore So lets put wheat, milk and eggs in there I could sleep and then go on a journey I think I'm gonna do that should I? I think I've done all my jobs. Let's sleep Wow AHHHHHH Okay, how much money do we make? Got six thousand one hundred. Okay, Youlif I'll come back and see you later, buddy I don't need to see you right now. I'm headed off this way because I haven't headed this way yet I need piggies I need food cuz otherwise I'm gonna get real nice, and oooh actually Cuz my sword has the flame ability I can cook these right up. You're not hiding from me buddy! Slice, slice! I'm coming for you as well. Don't you even think about running away there we go It's so good with our own fire sounds little bit crazy, but it's true So we haven't really been past this where I took a bit of that tree. We've got more Um you know more bees which is a little bit scary more pigs which is good I'm just trying to find a mine or something that has coal because I desperately need it Oh, oh, I have one single torch which was a great idea wasn't it is that a cave spider again? Please be a normal spider. This is copper ore, it's from railcraft. That's really random. I just want the normal stuff None of this fancy ore, I just want, I just want coal! Yeah, this is a normal spider, so I'm just gonna chop this one real nice there you go you seem quite powerful Oh, he's got the eyes. He's got the eyes. He's got the Shinigami eyes. Oh geez I just need to kill him There's a creeper coming as well. He's elite. Oh the creeper's got googles as well He's like an elite spiders does he give me more stuff? Hopefully doesn't hurt me more one more hit and you're dead slice Ow, yeah, he did hurt me you drop cobblestone randomly, or was that me. I know there's a creeper down here Where did he go? I'm just gonna risk it. I can't currently there. He is. Oh my goodness. Why? He's an elite as well! He's got so much health. I just need you to explode buddy, please please cuz I can't survive by myself his eyes are so funny Why do I go on that adventure by myself huh? Why? I need some of these torches. I'm such an idiot. I'm back. I'm back right. I think I got shot by something else. I'm not too sure hopefully I didn't lose much because Actually you know what, I don't think I even had much to be honest I think I'm good everything's here crop reader my Goddess flower. I don't have a Goddess has flower anymore That is hopefully it's in a chester home. If not the goddess is lost gone forever Which is a bit of a shame? I was gonna say I don't feel like that creeper should have blown me up and killed me, but I completely forgot that they are over Oh geez okay? Now. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good They are completely overpowered, and I am completely underpowered because I have stone tools five hearts and no armor There is coal in here though, so I'm gonna have to do it. Can you guys yeah you guys saw me great This is a normal one. Thank goodness there we go. That's much better. Oh Jesus These things are so scary. I just want this let's not aggravate the skeleton and hopefully he'll leave us alone Oh, this is a lot of coal. Oh my gosh. This is the best looks like he's leaving us alone He's just chillin over there if the bats tell on me that I might be in trouble but I think I'm good how much does this get me it gets me a grand total of oh Jesus even more 22 and the Skeletons still hasn't noticed me. There's so much down here This is perfect as long as I get home alive that I'm fine Good thing is the mining doesn't seem to hurt your um your stamina Which is great, and thus Callebaut left me alone right at least? We know where to come if we need copper Don't we all my pork chops? She's almost left that behind I'm leaving this horrible place right so I do need to do my chores. How I got my yeah got my watering can great Okay Let's put this in there so I can actually start smelting more cobble stone cobble goes in there Perfect and all the rest goes in here. I've got chores to do okay chores are done You'll if I need to speak to your beautiful face, and what have we got blacksmith is 16 wood But a hundred and sixty smooth stone that is hold on one six zero divided by 64 It's two and a half stacks of smooth stone cobblestone fine, but he wants smooth that means I just need two boringly Just keep mining things looks like this is going to be my next hour and a half trying to get all of this Okay, they didn't actually take that long. I don't have enough I almost got enough, but I need to make some more furnaces Just to make this a lot quicker bam bam bam And I guess bam I could just put them all in here I need some more definitely and then I just need some woods, and then I'm good this 100% to be enough let's pop that there we're going to need loads for the next building anyway So let's pop as much as we can in here, and then I think we're good so we just need to sleep and then Yeah, the dog is fascinated with the furnace so while that is still working we need to go and growl I think it was 16 wood Which isn't so bad because the other ones are pretty crazy the amount you need to get and the reason I won the blacksmith is Just in case it gives you like a really good axe to be able to mine faster because the harvest what it's called It's called the harvest festival mod Which is what most of this pack is based around it gives you different tools to do different things Like the hoe is different and stuff like that how much smooth stone have we got so far You'll if I'm about to make an extravagant purchase. I think I've got enough It'd be embarrassing if I didn't wouldn't it pick all these up. Oh, I don't think I've got enough yet I've got oh so close. I need like 30 more I might even need some more money Oh, no. I'll be even more embarrassing wouldn't it sir fear not I have a single tomato over here that might be able to help me out God. What's the bill buddy? What is the bill seven thousand yeah? I need some more money, so I'm gonna go to sleep because my tomatoes grow in the morning worried about summer changing though Okay, we're good. I was OH Hey stump I was worried that I would literally gonna wake up to loads of dead tomato crops When they were just about to spawn me a lot of money, but it's fine, it's good We've got them all might be the last tomato crop that we get though because I think either tomorrow or the day after Definitely not three days the tomatoes will just die cuz it will change from summer to autumn I think this grass is almost ready as well actually 9 out of 11 year it's close do we have enough now. We should do definitely. We're almost out of coal again, though We've definitely got enough right are you live I need to sleep after putting all of these tom-toms in here Or I keep forgetting to do the rest of my animals. I'm sorry Cal. I don't mean to neglect you I'm just busy planning the future. I know I know it's deep real deep. I will brush you for acceptance It's gonna be okay Don't you worry ok buddy, and I'm also gonna milk you for your goods, but I'm gonna feed you first apparentiy It's better to feed them from your hand and it seems like it's doing the trick. Do you give me big milk yet? Though you don't it's not very nice of you chickens. They neg perfect. Let's say hi to the chickens, but the chicken And I think that's it little bit of extra money there we go and the day starts again is it gonna change - um - autumn or fall for you guys some of you guys anyway Nope still some up, and there's a couple more TomTom plants as well, which is great. We've got 8,000 pounds That's phenomenal Or gold should I say it's not pounds at all let's pop this in we to wait for you live to wake up Let's do some jars, and then we're building something new guys Can't wait to get me some sprinklers because it would be so much better It's exactly like when it's raining Which hopefully it will do all the time and fall because then you don't you let you don't have to do anything the grass is Ready tomorrow as well some of the wheat is almost half done This is great news things are looking up things are also looking a pretty. You know pretty scary you lift is open How's it going, buddy? I need to buy a blacksmith off of you. Bye. Hey it worked Okay, so some of you said that the the buildings unit will actually break stuff down because he's so ripped It's unreal So I'm gonna test that I just don't want any weirdness inside the houses if you know what I mean Cuz then I'm gonna have to go in and edit it myself. It's gonna be real annoying I don't to break anything all right. What does a blacksmith look like it looks pretty cool. Actually I like this building How is that looking? I like that our town is based around a river it looks beautiful I think I'm gonna put one more gap in between so I just need to move This over to the right And then we can get you lit building and hopefully that um that theory that you guys have actually works We're gonna move it there gap in between looking beautiful. It doesn't go that far back Really, but um hopefully this stuff all disappears because otherwise I'm blaming you shift right click you left Your left buddy there. He is he's coming over. I love doing a little montage of you lift when he comes to work on something Is he uh? Is he stuck I think you might be stuck on that rock I can come and save you buddy It looks like you're doing all right by yourself. Are you stuck yeah? He was stuck okay there. He goes He was stuck on a little boat. It's okay. It's fine if you can't move a boulder them a little bit worried about his other antics but How every this is okay new leaf enjoy buddy do do your best hey, you know what you guys right? He even builds air so that means that the blocks don't even matter so I didn't even need to make massive holes For these things it's gonna be fine right why is building that I'm gonna Go mine some stone and then and then do something else Probably brush my cow or something hold the phone is you live done. I think he's done already He's got buns on the outside and everything blacksmith Friday to Wednesday 10:00 till 4:00 So it's not open on Thursdays. Is that it it's a weird way to put it. Hey De Niro. What an amazing name? I'm just gonna call you Dan. What do you got for me to steal borrow coal? Oh, you're a legend an absolute legend. You've got larvae in here as well. How's it going? Dude? If there is anywhere else? I'd rather be than here. It's in the end. Did I tell you about my adventures there? Oh wait, have we even met I'm the Nehru the blacksmith Do you need any help I certainly do I do not know anything because I think this triggers a tutorial Which means they give me free stuff? Basically, I'm leaching off of these poor people that's good then I'll be happy to teach you the first step is to get two tools To the stage where they can even be upgraded if you notice They have a percentage bar when this is at 100% bring them to me I'll also need some altar work with as well as payment for my services I'll work on them for a few days, then you can have the tools back fully upgraded How do I get the materials I need I need to head down the mine taking with you a hammer you can find nodes down There which can smash with a hammer to obtain or anyway. That's about it I hear Brandon the mine as a gift for you, though. Oh I've got a hammer. Yeah, we're gonna hammer sweet. I don't actually know what to do with this Oh, yeah, look think what kind of like experience buzz the hoe the sickle can I upgrade my watering can I can dude. I need to talk to you right now right now. Can I upgrade this? Remember Brandon the miner wants to see you Brandon doesn't even exist yet How could I speak to someone who doesn't even exist dinero come on you just or me to? Spend more money speaking of which how much and what else do I want I'll have more building for you as your town grows but but our did you just closed you did didn't you punk right? What is this hammer do can we? What can we do with it is it literary? Just only used in the mining dimension because that's pretty boring so apparently this gives you smooth stone. I just fall in a pond This gives you smooth stone from breaking these rocks. Let me see what happens Nope didn't give me anything like at all. This is the mysterious hammer. Oh, it's awesome Which means all the plants have died? Fantastic, I'm sorry guys it had to come at some point see you later. You serve me well tomatoes You serve me real. Well some would say too well, but I would never say that that means though We need to upgrade ourselves so that we can get ourselves some better crops for autumn Actually our grass is ready, but I don't actually know what to do. I can't right quick I Think I'm supposed to sickle them, but I don't want to break them. Yes, okay, that works Beautiful yes, okay. We got a new crop. That's beautiful. We got 27 Fodder is that is that how it works? There now back to 111 days to grow fodder. Are you kidding me? I'm just gonna put one in there and see what happens how much we get overnight That seems like a pretty bad deal to me. I don't know about you and cuz this autumn I think it's darker in the mornings. That's pretty good detail right there, okay Thursday to Friday 9:00 right I need to speak to jenni in a second because there's fodder in here as well So he gave me fodder. He also sells Faunus Why I feel like I did that wrong which is annoying because they were literally there for 11 days Jenny I need to see what crops you've gotten off for today. We have Eggplants we have carrots sweet potatoes beet roots grass Doesn't make grass though does it should just quit fodder and wheat? Okay, okay apparently carrots the best it only takes 8 days though, but I don't know if it kind of replenishes Let's buy some eggplants just buy some carrots and let's see what they look like I can't carry anything else anyway. Let's also buy some As you know I'm gonna buy more carrots I had a comment how much space of God Kaye carrots carrots Let's put beet roots here there. We go and all of these need water that makes sense oh, no I've gone blind again I'm like I'm all tired and stuff right let me eat this there we go Am I gonna be known not blind in a second. I'm gonna grab some carrots as well Some more carrots. Why are you down here? Anyway? It's a little bit weird that you like deal in the basement It's very strange right carrots, and there's buy some more eggplants as well cuz I feel like they might be the ones that So they grow for 10 days, but then they go back to 3 if you know what I mean so carrot all along here Which is great, and then we've got a bag of eggplants down here awesome Busy busy day ok so I need to talk to you live as well. Hey Gennaro. How you doing buddy Ah look you can buy a goddess pond Why would I need to do that anyway mining? Huh 64 smooth stone 64 logs and 6000 gold I just need to get to 6000 Gold's the rest I think I'm good I've definitely got Cobblestone, I don't know how much smooth stone. I have let's find out shall we 24 so I need maths 40 I just need 40 more cobblestone. I need the words, but that's fine I'll be able to find that ah let's see how much I think I've done all my jobs I'm pretty sure let's see how much one piece of fauna gets us one 137 gets us up - I'm worried it's gonna be nothing why did that happen? Why did that just happen it gets you one Literally just one. You can't even sell it for anything grass is terrible so bad. You know I'm just gonna put this fodder into the Actually can't craft anything with it. I don't think so right Let's go feed it to our cow instead that was a waste of 11 days. Oh, no cause it's dark in the mornings There's creatures everywhere. Why is this happening to me you better get off my crops, No Are you punk come out and let me deal with you properly? Why oh geez I just I just hit my dog. I'm so sorry he's gonna be mad at you now Haha, you have bit to shreds Punk there. We go good job, buddy, yeah Oh look, how weird this is I mean super slow? I? Can't even eat white why can't I eat? Some of this happens to me something's happened to me. I don't know what's but that was so weird well just realize this guy has an anvil and also I want to test the theory that you can actually just use this I Guess not I failed I forgot as well. We haven't checked his shop yet You can buy milkers animal brush shears you can buy a whole from him Can also buy an axe which is one thousand which I might actually do you can also buy all the ingots a blast? Brick, which sounds insane redstone engineering block a soul cage What's sturdy casing and literally all the ingots you could ever need now? I need to pretty much research all of these things because I don't know what all these mechanical parts are Immersive engineering and storage drawers are the good thing is an axe I'm gonna buy the axe Why is she is 1.8? K. Can I sell these to him I'm gonna buy the axe. I'm gonna do it I'm not actually sure what it does. I think it does something with the twigs. Let's see what happens does this bear any fruits No, it doesn't do anything. What is it? What do you even do there? It's wig around here somewhere I feel like I've just wasted a thousand coins on an axe to see what happens does it do anything Special if it could chop trees down like literally from the ground, and then you know like the tree felling mod That would have been amazing but apparently It doesn't do that right all of these plants need to do me a solid because I have 18 gold to my name You guys need to grow and give me six thousand pounds. That'll be great so have the wood. I have the stone Hopefully as well boom boom and I think there's more in here Yes 64 out the stone as well, so you guys need to pull through okay. Please give me loads of money Okay, so apparently this axe breaks these yeah Sweet, okay, so when you get to medium. You need the copper axe that's quite cool So I can get oak wood from breaking the debris same with the hammer there has to be small rocks That's kind of cool not worth thousand, but conical Oh, my goodness guys guys my cow has grown up look. I went to go ahead take the weight Where is it? Gone? Where has it gone? You okay? There? It is look the cow is an adult now That's crazy, right? I need to bring these cows inside because they don't like it in the rain because it's autumn is definitely gonna happen more often I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Where are you attached? I don't even know where you're attached. You're attached here. Why are you doing outside? Yeah, come here right now behave yourself. We've got two massive cows actually that means we get two milks now, right? I'm pretty sure it does. Let's see what happens. Hopefully they like me enough. There's one B - Yeah, I'm also gonna steal this wheat off the wall because desperate times give desperate measures. I need money I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Okay, okay mama done told me to watch out for those guys. That's fantastic that was great. Thank you for that Thank you so much. It's really really helpful that you blew me up like that I mean Look at this mess. This is outrageous How did I lose loads of stuff as well I've got the watering can Where is all my stuff like seriously? I think it's in here. Please be in here I will be so mad if it's not how did that get over there? I was just looking for you I was like that's probably the worst thing that I could have lost my 64 stun and 64 spruce wood But my goodness that was a close one. This is now an incredible mess which isn't isn't pleasing me I didn't even come from it. Just blew me up out of nowhere, and now you've both got the googly eyes on What is what is happening here? Are you all kind of conspiring against me? Huh? I think I have everything that I got the the hoe the hammer the axe the sickle everything that I can't get back I've got which is fine two days, and I get some money here We go this should be the day that some of the things are ready the carrots are looking great. I think that's them done Yeah, it's them down. Okay and You you literally lose them. Oh my goodness watts I'm so confused So you grow them, and they don't come back carrots are not the best. Oh geez okay. We're learning though. We're learning We have to plant them again if we want more oh Sweet potatoes. Those are done - these ones look better though because they probably give less money But yes sweet potatoes are the best Eggplants have two more days I bought some more stuff so two more days and the eggplants are done. We definitely need to buy more sweet potatoes Let's wait to the eggplants are done though because the sweet potatoes we know will regrow eggplants have Two more days here those, so let's try that first. It's raining, so we don't need to water those either I've done all my chores and stuff Right, let's sleep and see how much money we get we've gone up to 4600 Whoa? That's actually loads Way more than I thought it would be today Will now be known forever as eggplant day look at these beauties. We've got more sweet potatoes as well These sweet potatoes are on fire guys Right eggplants for days. Let's see how far back they go eggplants are the one Eggplants are definitely the one they make more money. I think as well I'm pretty sure they make 20 more than sweet potatoes But they just take an extra day to grow I'm happy with this So happy right we should be able to afford our next thing soon Ryan probably is in here Perfect oh those can go in there as well. I'm gonna go and buy some more seeds I can't because it's not 11, but I will do it's pretty far. Gone to 20 out of 28 That's not really worth the money either to be honest It's better to get the other ones But quicker because you can get so many at a time so note to self Eggplants and tomatoes are the best I would like three of your greatest eggplant seeds. Thank you so much these are gonna Make me Millions right. Let's just destroy these carrots cuz they suck and then it'll put these down like this Oh, this is gonna. Be great. You pipe down spite. I don't hear anything from you ah Money speaking of which that's sleep, and we should be able to afford Hopefully our new place, which is the mining thing? I am literally 200 short I might be able to get these from milk and eggs actually oh geez oh geez I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm gonna die ah Did you see that skele burn? He hit me for so much damage, and he was really fast, and he's bludgeoning my crops What's wrong with you sir, okay? He's actually on fire now. Hahaha you think you're so smart. Don't you oh jeez no. No no oh? Just dodged my head. Oh, my goodness. You die please Thanks, my goodness. That was not cool. That was not cool at all right Let's pop this eggplant in here that should give me enough money I'm pretty sure anyway BAM six thousands the question is did I need seven I don't know the real question is how much money am I gonna make from all of these Eggplants these eggplants are amazing remember the cucumbers that we made yeah These are better cuz they're purple and worth more things just seem to be working out Stern today Eggplants going in sweet potatoes going in as well Beautiful rather than you lift show me what you got. Please don't say it was yes. I got it. Bye Yeah, the mining Hut is here. It looks pretty big, but I think we're gonna put it again in line back here I don't think I need to put it in line this time. It's like a corner thing You know what that she looks pretty sweet there. It looks really cool. Yeah. I like it here. I like you here a lot I'm dying of thirst. Let's quickly start building this thing I say we've I mean you lift because he's the only one capable of building it Let's wait a second well more than a few seconds and let's see how I got two bottles of dirty water without even knowing it Oh weird I've got like a glitched wall of water That's so odd. Look at this so apparently you can't eat the same thing over and over and over That's why it's making me eat slow Because as no hunger value for me anymore because I've eaten it too much also I think you would if it's under the ground right now can't quite hear him, but hope he's alive down there I just need him to build this huts I'm worried. He's not making any progress at all okay, so weird yet slightly worrying thing I've advanced a day, and I can't find you LIF Anywhere he's not in here. I can't hear him building. He hasn't respawn. Which is why I went back and slept again I'm worried about the man. I've lost a man. I've lost our man. You live and I can't listen you can't hear him I Can't hear and building a tool. I'm worried that he's like deep deep underground building, but um I've lost him. I was hoping to show you the mine today, but I think I'm gonna have to see if it's working Or if you lifts working, but for now I've lost him, but it's okay. We'll find him Anyway, I keep thinking I've heard him like building something, but then I don't know whether it's just me walking on something like this. I have no idea I'm a little bit worried about him, but we've lost a man I'll put like missing posters around and see if we come back next time to not only a brand new you LIF Well the same you live just freshly Prepared and over your mining Hut as well because otherwise I've wasted six grand and two stacks of items would be terrible so guys Thank you so much for watching this episode if you're enjoying this series as much as I am playing it as always a please leave A thumbs up now be greatly Appreciated and exams to be the first bit you see I mean please do consider subscribing if you haven't done so yet And if you would like to join seem TDM for daily videos apart from that guys.

So I was just doing some practice, a little bit of warm up. And yeah came across a 4 kill game start with a top 15 So let's see how this goes shall we I'm pretty sure someone just died over here "Guns Shots" Yep, there's something going down Where are they there they are I see you? "Guns Shots" How did all of those miss are you kidding me, this is a blue ar! *Gun Shots* There we go that's better, right Hahahaha I'm pretty far away, so I'm going to take the bandages just for now just in case I need them I'm pretty sure I will do but we already got three. Okay. This could be the end no launchpad either I do have a campfire though, so This is gonna be risky though. We're dead we're so dead it Just needs to not take two off of us, and then we're okay. I think. okay. It's doing two guys It's doing two I am going to prepare myself a campfire right now. This isn't even gonna work. I'm stuck I'm literally stuck here out in the wilderness, and I'm gonna die. That's it. I'm dead It's over see you later. This is it. I'm gonna die Well that was an interesting start to the video. Hey guys. How's it going Dan here and today? We are back with some more fortnite battle royale you guys been spamming me to play this because season 3 has begun as you can see I've done some games already but There's been some interesting changes the main one being this there's now challenges now the were challenges before But now they're weekly challenges, so they unlock weeks at a time, which is really cool But there's way more of them first up if you don't have the battle pass there are free pass challenges like outlet opponents play matches with friends which I don't have.... lands and named locations winning a match all that good stuff But if you look at the battle pass challenges There's something that caught my eye first up one of the challenges is to visit a lama a fox and a crab What but the one below it that I thought was even more interesting It says follow the treasure map found in Dusty Depot, Dusty Depot is somewhere I never land, so let's try it shall we. OH Man.. They've got the dragon glider. Are you kidding me? I'm buying that right now They got a dragon glider?Are you kidding me im buying that right now So we're season three they've also added some other cool stuff So you can now change your back bling so for example the Black Knight normally has the black shields, the teddy bear has the cuddle bow, but now you can put them all on different things I think the red shield looks amazing on the red Knight Black Knight You know what I mean, but we also get the contrails, so these are like I'm just gonna call them Trails because they're trails that come off of you when you freefall they're awesome I have unlocked rainbow, and I've unlocked the ultramarine right now ultramarine look amazing on the Black Knight And you can also unlock loading screens and speaking of loading screens on my battle pass in two levels time I get this thing That's right the bright unicorn. It's amazing but apart from the Royal dragon There's also a red umbrella so When you win a normal game a battle royale you've got the normal umbrella in season one then you've got the frosty umbrella in season Two, but now you've got the red umbrella, which looks like this and it looks awesome I haven't got one yet, but now I have a dragon so do I really need one I'm not too sure worth noting though this rainbow rider right here, which I also unlocked has a rainbow trail as well Which is really really cool, right? Let's go into a game and see where on earth this treasure map is and what treasure is awaiting us Dusty Depot dusty Depot we head over here the bus is perfect for this. Let's see what's going on I am actually gonna suspect that loads of people are gonna drop there because of the treasure map But we'll see maybe everyone's done it already I have no idea what it is, so let's find out look at those trails It looks sweet, and I've got this sweet new glider. Oh my goodness Hahaha this thing is obnoxious Its massive, and I thought the teddy bear one was massive. This is unreal right do we have any yet? We have some one on the top okay.

Maybe hmm This is interesting guys I have no idea where this is gonna be and there's a guy right there, and there's a guy over there as well Oh geez don't take my kill don't take my kill who took my kill.

I literally have no idea where that is Oh is it that is it? This is it all of these things? I know I'm gonna get killed in some kind of dumb way just because I've got nothing on me. It's over here I'm pretty sure there's not a house with a car on the roof over there Where is this? There's one over there? Maybe but it's got to be in the ring, otherwise. We're done for okay? I'm just about to die guys. I just got hit hard it ends ends now I'm dead I try to I try to use the impulse granade to get them right now. We can focus on the treasure map OH Wait a second it's like the tree right there. It's the biggest tree on the map. Okay. I'm gonna head there I need to get some weapons and stuff try kill some peeps and then head to that tree I think that's it, but where was it it was between that the house with a car on the roof Oh, no, I forgot it already this dragon is insane Everyone's gonna know where you are with this dragon wait did no one land here Is it not that popular anymore or does everyone just go to Tilted I think that's more the case all right? Let's grab some resources and let's head up to that tree shall we yeah that tree is absolutely massive Ah someone's been up here already. They must be searching for the treasure as well. Wait a second this looks awfully suspicious What is this over here? What is this? Oh wait is this one of the it is? This is an animal this guy think's he's completing the challenge. Huh well, I'm gonna show him Maybe not oh That cheeky headshot oh my goodness right let's heal up and See what he was looking at someone else said there's someone else here gotcha noooooooooo! ughwa! okay so I think That is the hill right there that we need to land on I don't know if there's any chests there But I'm gonna go there anyway Oh, actually we need to find the house that has the car on it, and I think it might be down there I'm gonna land near you tree if you don't have any guns. I am going to die I can't even see you because of this glider right you do have a chest. Okay. That's okay. No one else is down here It's a crossbow. It's possibly the worst thing. I could have got okay, so that has all the other chests on it. That's interesting ah Look, that's the house of the car on it. Okay, so it's near a tree Near here between these two points right is it this tree here does they want me to find out okay? It's not this tree. I don't even know what we're looking for we're looking for a chest are we looking for I Don't know oh, oh what's this? Oh? This is cool collect He hey! Was that it? Was that what I got from that all of those deaths, and I get myself. I'm gonna die yeah, I'm gonna die here I'm dead. I got it. Okay does that mean we complete the challenge?

I want to do is llama fox and a crab I think I can do that I don't know. I know where the llama is I don't know where actually I don't know where the Fox or the crab is oh? Yes, we've got the loading screen. Let me just change that It's amazing I love it a unicorn llama with wings and a rainbow Perfect. Okay. Where is the bus headed? We should be able to do this?

We're not gonna be able to do this at all It's all the way over here the llamas just down there below the X where it says to skydive. Let's head there I can't believe how big this dragon is it's absolutely Insane so Fox anywhere around here and guessing. They're all gonna be There might be something over there. I can see it. I can see it the top right right there It's just Near the wailing woods. Okay. We found the Fox as I was saying I'm pretty sure that all animals built out of materials Just randomly around the world and as long as no one else comes down here I'm pretty sure we'll be okay because I'm fairly sure the llama has chests in it llama Llama, do you have any chests? Are you gonna? Make me build up or actually? You can edit these oh were inside perfect. We got ammo. That's literally it. Is that all we've got Okay, there's something up here got a revolver. I heard there were chests here Apparently the llama doesn't want to give us any Got a shotgun though. That's goods, but literally nothing else someone's been sleeping here, though That's nice, right llama be gone. Let's see if we can destroy this thing oh *evil laugh Oh there he goes see you later llama Anyone who's near here must be thinking what just happens to that llama llama destroyed that works, and now let's go find the Fox I'm guessing the crab would be somewhere. I don't know near the ocean like near the edge. Maybe down here 'cuz you've got one on the top left one on the top right and then one down the bottom I have no idea. Can you see a crab anywhere guys? I'm just trying to see it on the fly over I guess it could be near loot lake as well is There something over there oh

Clickbait   So I'm still wearing my #GotClickBated:D Rescue gear and I was gonna say that is not really applicable anymore because you lift the main man over there who isn't talking to Me for some reason He's been saved but actually thinking about it It is kind of applicable because I saved the game Because last time we're in a little bit of a crazy position where we died to some dark chicks in the mine I know that sounds weird, but if you saw the previous video then you'd understand the game freaked out a little bit I kept all my stuff which is good   I somehow gained some sweet potatoes that ain't plants which I am going to sell real quick because we are pretty much Rolling in the money right now, or wait a second wait a second. Wait a second is this done, it's done That's good, but how do I break it? Do I eat a sickle let me check you should tell me on the on the item wheat seeds? Requires sickle, okay, let's see how much we get for these bad boys Chop-chop-chop-chop Okay, one of them isn't done yet there we go how much wheat did we get? Let's see how much we get   Yeah, it'd better be a lot because we don't get to regrow it at all and it takes 28 days. Are you kidding me? That's in real and also you guys told me that you With the fish you don't sell cooked fish You can sell raw fish though so we need to get that going speaking of fishing I Really desperately want to build the fishing hut today and but I think we have to do the goddess pond first Cuz that's the only thing that um, Yulif is selling right now. Let me go and talk to him I'll see if he's forgiven me for burying him underground I mean I didn't bury him underground someone else did but I guess I gave you the job. You're okay, buddy How's it going building the best buildings for you, so we need 16 he's only got one blueprint which is weird 500 gold which we have and 16 logs we have three plus the five does it work like that. I'm not sure I'm hi Jenny. How's it going? I need to start making alternate foods. Don't I because oh wait a second eleven does this count? We've got we've got enough here. Let me see if you um if you'll take it. BUY   He did okay, sweet so oh my goodness this thing is massive I really want to put this in the middle over there cuz I think that will look amazing I need some food though because the only food I've got a pork chops, and I've eaten too many of them So it's gonna be all old and rubbish and it's not really gonna work very well, so I'm gonna try these blackberries Yeah, buddy that works, but again if I eat too many of these then these won't be effective either Oh, my GOODNESS. This is gonna look so good in here Yulif this is gonna be great What if I go down one more let's try this how does that look? It's Pretty underwater isn't it? haha, yeah We needed to be even higher than that my goodness needed to be up here Three blocks higher is definitely going in the middle though, so we can make like some kind of really cool lead up to it Does this work I think this might work? You know the grass is at water level? I don't know do I want the grass to be underneath. I just tried to jump on it. Ha ha there's never gonna work I think I don't know what I think I think this is gonna be good shift the right click you lift away Where is he you left go build the goddess pond please? I spent it's actually the cheapest thing We've bought. I think it's gonna look amazing. He's gonna take forever isn't he!   It's gonna take absolutely ages because he's in the water. Why didn't I think of this Oh? He's gonna take so long I'm a bad person right I need to do some chores and stuff ah Brandon. How's it going, buddy? What are you doing get back into your cave jeez I think he's going mining. See you later, buddy, okay? He's definitely making some work of this. I can see some things being built as soon as he's built himself a platform He'll be absolutely fine, but for now he's just gonna have to take his time swimming around He's got a pretty good reach on him though, so I think he's gonna be okay We just need to wait for that to be built and then um We can see what else he can build I really want to fish and stop just to get my money But for now, I just need to wait for him to build that Oh I finished working on your have a pleasure doing business with you Ah, thank you, but I've got a new one so I don't really need this one Do I he probably took some of my money as well oh? Man, no one here seems to like me any do you idea why Brandon? I am so sorry I'm tired of the people in this town. I just want to escape what's wrong with you. I could gift you something Would you like a fishing rods? I could give this to you Thanks, though nice. No problem, buddy. Oh look the other day when I was in the mines I heard and saw this strange fire-like creature. I wonder what it was What? No way, okay, so there's even creepier things down in the mines That's actually crazy right time to sleep. I went out and got a little bit more wood Just to see because I'm going to need more wood after this. Let's do a quick sleep See how much money we get three seven all the way up to Five eight okay. That was two thousand something so turns out wheat isn't actually that great at all It's all about my eggplants look at these bad boys look how many there are we've got so many now I'm gonna miss the autumn actually I'm definitely gonna miss the autumn because in winter as I mentioned in a previous video Nothing grows so literally nothing grows in winter So we're gonna have a big problem with cash flow if we don't get some more animals my animals are only making small amounts of food and stuff So were not gonna make much more so lets build as much as we can in otherwise were gonna small amounts of food and stuff So we're not gonna make much money from that so let's build as much as we can in order to otherwise we're gonna We're gonna be poor Dr. Trayaurus   and I don't want that the regrowables are definitely the best for the money because you Literally wait how long is it? Let me check? Ten days for the original crop and then three more, and then you're back for more money It's so much better because like wheats does 100 for 24 days That's insane and really just isn't that great we're gonna make so much money from that you'll if is getting on perfectly He just needs to speed up a little bit if you go on the platform, dude You can just we could build quicker. I said while you'll if is doing that because time does pass I am gonna go down the mines which I'm a little bit worried about oh Jesus a skeleton there No, oh you always got me. Yeah. I'm gonna go down the mines Let me just unload a load of stuff quick so one thing I now don't have much of is coal because I've used them all for torches which is gonna Be slightly annoying right the mines Let's go back in I'm bit scared that he did say something about some crazy fire monster The chickens are bad enough, but we need to level this hammer up I'm Guessing because I don't know what else you'd use for copper because the copper only sells for like what a piece which is mad Okay much of it. There. Is though. There's loads down here now. Oh no. Oh, no. It's happening. It's happening again It's again. Why these Punk's so crazy. I need my sword Chopper. She's wide to have so much health. What are you doing to me go away these things are crazy, dude There's a lot down here. This is the way to do it though Just chill on the ladder, and then they'll just get killed straight away They're so hard to hit dude so hard. Oh, the stone sword is levelled up. Okay. I thought it was dead I thought you said it's not now it is okay. Yeah, the stone sword is levelled up it is gonna die soon though I can't remember how to make a level up either which is a bit worrying. I think it's gonna break There's no point in leveling up a stone sword really it's gonna use my hammer to smack him instead hmm I think I'm at the bottom of the mine There's no other levels here. Oh there it is Sneaky, this is as far as I've got though So I'm a little bit scared that I'm gonna come across this giant monster. Even these things are bad enough I think if this ladder is underneath the mine wall. I'm not quite sure how I break this I don't think I can up. Nope we're good. There's one here. You know what I forgot to do There's this item while I was editing the previous video there's this item that I completely forgot to buy and it's called the escape rope I'm pretty sure it's Exactly the same as what's in Pokemon so in Pokemon when you use the escape rope no matter where you are in a cave it Brings you to the surface. I should have bought one of those. They're only like 150 gold as well I saw it in the previous video, and I was like why did I not buy it? I'm just gonna die to these stupid chickens instead cuz if I am close to dying I could just literally use the escape rope and leave. I'm running out torches as well, but hopefully by now You'll if has finished doing his magic By building the goddess pond that was really the only reason I came down here and to just see if there's anything else around I'm not seeing anything apart from copper. Let me get to the surface Let's see if you live stun and next time I will 100% being an escape rope Guys the chickens respawn they actually respawn. No don't kill me now. Please don't kill me now I'm gonna be so mad at you look at these punks look at him I'm just gonna keep one hit him over and over again. Cuz they're gonna come down and kill me What is wrong with these guys what did I ever do to you except for hit your friends? I hate those things so much So much, oh, it's so annoying you live hasn't even finished did he die You live what's going on. It's cuz I'm in another dimension. Isn't it? Oh? This is the worst day ever right? I've got my stuff back. I've also got myself an escape rope just to show you guys. How it works I just want to check that I've got everything my hammer is actually doing nineteen percent right now. It is cool Got my copper got my ho-hum. I guess there's so much stuff um I think that's all we had actually we didn't have that much stuff on us really now Let's see what happens when we use the escape rope. Hopefully it works and doesn't kill us into me three two one BAM Yes Yes Yes That's what I'm talking about right. I need to I need to stock up on those bad boys Don't I we've been down there so long that it's turned to the next day. Oh look at our money I didn't even realize we're up to 9,000 my goodness have we even had 10,000 in our account before I don't think we have I've just spotted the east bum he's grown a goddess flower as well Which is actually incredible hold on a second?

We need to be if if anything knocks me in this lava I'm done because literally everything in my inventory is something that I need so let's just grab this and get out of here Did I get I got it? Okay? That's good got blueberries as well right unicycle Let's go. This unicycle is actually in like amazing it does take damage though, so I need to be a little bit careful I don't there's black rabbits as well. Those are normal minecraft. I can't even remember This is where we were in the first episode. I actually think it is that's hilarious Actually it might not be I'm quite far away over here I want to go down here, so let's turn right and go this way. Oh, that's what I'm talking about Give me the call we need this so badly the thing about this pack is that you can't get normal things that Easily, so you spend loads of time trying to find basic food and also coal It's unreal, but also a hearty part of the challenge, and there's even more look where these pigs are guarding I will take your cold, please pig stop looking at me stop it. It's awkward I can't mind why you're staring at me, and now you're floating you think that's okay, okay? We have come a long Way just to find some coal and wait for you to have to finish the godess pond So I want to see what we can build next hopefully that's not it I'm pretty sure we can build fishing huts and stuff so we just need to wait for him to be able to do that and Now my pickaxe just broke. This is the greatest day of all time guys I think I'm gonna have to leave my unicycle behind I accidentally dropped it in the ocean No, no, no, I'm out of here. I'm so out of here. You'll if you'll if I'm scared. I'm out here. I'm cold I'm scared and I almost got blown up by a creeper. That would have been devastating dude so bad, but I'm back. I'm fine I'm safe. I you know what you guys have been saying this for ages, but I definitely need a house. This is ridiculous I don't have one yet, but I'm hoping that you live has finished the grass pond absolute legend I'm just gonna sleep real quick hums dad. Oh my goodness That was insane has he finished the goddess pond because that's looking pretty cool to me buddy guys I think you left might be done. He might actually be where's that zombie coming from yeah, we made it I don't know where unif is gone. Though you live oh he's over there. I wanted to come and speak to you How cool this is this is like proper nice water and everything it's got goddess flowers around it. This is cool This is very cool What happens that we throw it in does she just appear? Cuz that'll suck if she oh she does hey, how's it going? Please don't take too much time. I cannot stay for very long Whoa? She just gave me loads of strawberries Look how many strawberries she gave me she just gave me they're gone What you can't just clickbait me like that where they get all the money from as well. My money's good after 14 granny I was gonna say you're which but obviously you are on those strawberries back Give me this give me the strawberries back. She doesn't say anything else. Okay. Do not worry This does look ugly right now, but I will fix it in the future I just want to talk to my main man over here and see what he cannot See loads a cafe a church a clockmaker of fishing huts in a town hall Amazing look how much money this stuff costs though 32 grand 12 grand. Oh my goodness I can t afford the fishing Hut right now I just need the woods, so I am definitely going to old Jesus broke it one idiot I pressed the wrong button. Oh my goodness I need to watch back that edit and see when I got given that money I feel like she gave me it straight up just because she thinks I'm a fantastic human being but I could be completely wrong I'm not too sure I do on the strawberries back though. Those would have helped a lot I could have sold those turns out she clickbait me. I'm right. What do I need to do? I don't need this. That's gross. I need woods. I need a lot of woods look what I just found a ravine okay? I can't actually Waypoint this. I think no Currently where I am? I guess. I'm gonna call it ravine of course save done Perfect right the ravine is saved. Yes more berries mole berries I don't know if I can eat these, but we're about to find out I kind of wish I could take these bushes But I'm not quite sure how can I just pick them up? No, oh actually yes I can so if I take all of these I can Put some of these in my little village, which is actually get him pretty big now But I can put these in the village and use them as food survival at its finest guys and also You kind of get punished if you eat something ten times in a row So if you just mix up your berries all the time you can kind of not cheat the system But kind of which is good right you lift my good friend. I have Everything you need I think including the money, which is actually pretty surprising. I'm so glad I owe it sim Do I I don't have a lead he's right here. He's here the whole time, and he's gonna die soon Annie's googly eyes don't drown I need it. I need a lead desperately. I don't think I can buy them though I really don't think I can at least he's still here is on the verge of death, but he's still here And he's got googly eyes on you left. What's good buddy. I am going to buy the fishing huts Kapow Right so this obviously needs to go next to the water That was so much money, but yeah this needs to go next to the water I was gonna put it in the middle, but seeing as though I've got the the goddess pond there I don't really want to I guess I can just put it around here somewhere. How does this look? It's actually quite big and for some reason. I which isn't dying again This is such a hard pack to keep control of guys like as you can see I've died so many times It's not meant to be that crazy. You know the fishing out is sideways Where's the door the door is here? So it's on the opposite side to where you place it right no It's to the right so we need to place it to me to place it this way and that's how it's gonna be placed I Really, don't know where to place this guys. Okay? I'm thinking over there, and then we can to make a bigger part over there I'm just gonna build it and see what happens you lift me sir. You know what you live. Oh wait Go buddy go builds. He's going the wrong way isn't he yeah? He's in the water again alright Let's try these mulberry shall we we actually got 40 from all of those things. That's incredible munch them up. This is working well No, you can go away put the wood down. I just mind that that's mine go away Oh, I got emerald from that I didn't even notice guys. That's incredible right. I'm gonna put all the mulberry bushes down here Hopefully they grow if they do that'd be amazing cuz that just gives me an alternate way of getting food But I need to sleep cuz there's nasties around. I think everything is done. Oh goodness, and this is gonna be my garden fantastic Don't trample the things we can just come out come out come out come out. Oh you idiot. I hate you so much I'm gonna punch you real hard and the dogs are gonna bite. You as well get out of here, buddy Down instantly because i'm not happy with you! No one likes you no one likes you put the eggplant Down instantly because I'm not happy with you Gone dogs bite him bite him real nice there. there we go give me that eggplant  back Ya trayaurus  has got the googly eyes on okay? He's probably protecting his eyes from the rain without stressful right those are done as well So we can crop up these which is good But a boom right more space for But a boom right more space for Eggplants basically cuase the zombie trampled them so mabgn .     jcxny eggplants, that's amazing I'm probably not gonna buy any more eggplants. Just because I don't think i need them I'm probably not gonna buy any more eggplants. Just because I don't think I need them I am gonna make this into bread actually as well because I need some alternate foods What do I do now I've got coal which is good I can put all the coal in here this my friends is a difficult pack. Let's get into desperate times I'm gonna wait for the fishing Hut to open and then yeah, let's do after that is it I feel like I've died nine times go away. Just go away I have like nothing to give you you can't take my eggplants, okay? He's a hardened zombie for some reason And I'm just gonna keep punch you in the face until you die if you set me on fire I will just absolutely destroy you there you go get out of here I don't like you that much I'm gonna throw all of your flesh into the pond No one likes you always have so much copper by doggery know what to do with it if you can let me know in the comment section down below if you know what to do with copper cuz I feel like I Just have so much. I have two stacks in a little bit the junk as well I'm just gonna sell cuz I don't really want the junk and next course of action I guess is building a house and stuff because it's looking pretty gross around here. I want to tidy things up Just because we've kind of scented everything around this central goddess pond, which looks awesome, but it just needs tidying up Oh, Oh Jacob, how's it going? Just keep swimming? He says how you doing when does your shop open Tuesday? It's a Friday 1 p.m.. Until 7:00. Okay. He's almost open which is perfect Let me give him at least some way to get into his house, but you live the legend has struck again. Ah No way, can I sell all this stuff? Raw salmon cuz you guys said that you can sell you can sell fish I'm gonna take a stack of these bad boys Don't mind me we can we can catch you them later you guys said you can sell raw things Let's see if that's true. It is get in there get in there. Oh my goodness That's so much. If only you could can you throw on top no? I think you can top of them though so we need to make a hopper as well That would be part of the village improvement project 2018 Jacob I'm looking at your face in this one PM and come and get your fishing rods here if you please I'm gonna check The shop real quick so one thousand for a wooden fishing rod, which is great a great ripoff? We also have a diamond fishing rod for five K That's not too bad an alluring fish hook for long range Speed fishing and then an automatic fishing net placing water and give it a fishing rod. That's pretty cool It's seventy five thousand gold though, which is insane. Let's see what he gives us There's nothing like sitting then waiting for a fish to bite so relaxing Are you actually not gonna give us anything usually they tutorial me no I really hope it rains soon, or is it now Jacob you're pushing your luck, buddy I run a strict ship around here, so please be careful with your language and stuff right, okay, so We can actually buy one of these like right now I kind of really tempted to buy the diamond fishing rod, but I know that everything is really expensive from you left He's starting to rip me off So let me just tend it to my creatures, and then let's go to the next day and see how much money We've earned so I feel like it's gonna be a lot. I put loads of eggplants in I put milk I put eggs and then I also put in all of those fish which is crazy They probably only get one a piece because they're not very good. I'm trying to look for Jenny Just to grab and see if I can get any seeds. They're a little bit quicker to grow I need something that's like Eight days won't work six days. Yes six days to be perfect actually let's buy these Twice because otherwise autumns gonna run out winters gonna come and kill everything so we need to be okay Oh geez the googly skeleton in the house What it's a little bit scary are you guys? You guys can tell with that to see you later. I'm so mean right bam and bam All done all watered all ready to go that's perfect right. Let's sleep and let's see what enough happens here Hopefully the skeleton from the shop disappears - here we go How much money do we get? Eight thousand in total that ain't too shabby my my good friend so you if I think just went in here the skeleton Is up there still so I'm a little bit worried you left. I know he's in here. It's absolutely fine UNIF is actually closed today So I think this is actually a good place it to end I'm gonna end in sight you lift house So I'm a little bit scared of everything else, but guys don't push me you left come on Hope you're doing this video if you did, please leave a big fat thumbs up that we greatly appreciated I feel like this was slow But we also made loads of progress we built the goddess pond the fishing huts and the next time we are also going to need To do the the village renovation project 2018 which is going to be huge So if you join this series still then please make plans up thumbs up That'd be greatly appreciated and it's time to be the first, but you seem that me, and you haven't done so yet Please do consider subscribing so join team TN today for daily videos apart from that guys.

so guys you remember this video we'll do our beer unicorn or with them Oh that then resulted in this video yeah I'm sure many of you do because that is one of my most popular videos I have ever done and ever since then I don't know how long ago was over a year and a half ago that's insane but yeah ever since then you guys have wanted me to do the bean boozled jelly bean challenge and today I've got those but with a bit of a twist first up I have these different jelly beans called double dares which have some crazy flavors first got blueberry or toothpaste which you know what toothpaste is actually not that bad watermelon or snots the peach or cough medicine a cola or squid what lemon or rotten cheese or strawberry or fresh blood insane so the way this works is there are different colored jelly beans in here but for example there are two yellow jelly beans one set of yellow jelly beans a lemon one set of them are rotten cheese and I'm gonna delve deep into here and try and pick the right ones which is impossible because they're the same color but I wanted to pay homage to the video that you guys absolutely love and add in these which are warheads sour jelly beans I am going to regret this oh they do not look like jelly beans at all they look like little rocks of sour actually I'm gonna go get a bowl be right back I've got one here we go oh yeah oh they smell oh they do not smell goods oh I haven't even put them in my mouth yet and they smell disgusting right sour jelly beans going in let's mix them up mix them up real nice and just with the other video we're gonna throw it back again and play exactly the same game I'm replaying would you rather so the way this works is here are the rules we play would you rather but instead of choosing what I would pick I need to guess what everyone else would pick the majority vote forget it right I don't eat a jelly bean if I get it wrong I have to close my eyes delve deep into the jelly beans and pick just one which will either be a nice jelly bean or a sour jelly bean or something completely disgusting so if this really disgusting smelling bowl of jelly beans let's begin today's video first question would you rather be rich or famous well I don't know it's what I would choose but I need to go on what other people would choose what would they rather be I think this one's easy this one's either they're gonna be rich yeah not even have you Punk's now wouldn't you rather lose both of your arms or both of your legs that's a horrible question um what most people want to lose I'm gonna say legs because if you lose both your arms you can you can't eat you can't I don't know wash yourself you can't eat disgusting jelly beans but if you lose your legs you can get a wheelchair or some kind of car thing legs yeah this is actually nerve-racking would you rather be named after a car or named after produce what you mean like my name would be Volvo or carrots I think definitely free Oh veg surely what no you would want to be called like a jeep Range Rover but you wouldn't want to be called orange or carrot really really okay very guys I'm gonna close my eyes delve deep and pick one what is it it's a green what is green green is watermelon all snots I am NOT looking forward to this here we go it's watermelon oh yeah now's a close one my goodness would you rather be naked all the time or never leave your house oh I think most people are gonna choose never leaving your house here we go know what you'd rather be outside naked all the time you're gonna be the only naked person out there you could just video cool people FaceTime people from your house but invite people over to your house but no everyone would rather be naked a pretty close one but I've got it wrong so here we go I'm delving in orange I threw the thing what's the thing hello orange is oh it's peach peach is peach or cough medicine you know what I don't actually mind cough medicine that much but little peach let's see um it's cough medicine actually sin so bad it's like really really strong licorice and your boy likes licorice so that's another win for me if I pick another peach one I'm not gonna eat it because I like both those flavors that's there it's not that nice which wizard would you rather be Gandalf or Dumbledore this has to be Dumbledore come on people no you know what 53% 47 that's bad let's eat another jellybean it's what is it it's blue so blue is blueberry or toothpaste I don't see toothpaste being a bad thing so miss toothpaste definitely toothpaste it's strong my goodness but it's minty so how is that bad if you were to participate in the Olympics would you rather being summer or winter hmm I think winter has the coolest sports but summer is going to be warm people are gonna pick summer are they let's find out they are yes would you rather live in a tree house or living a floating boathouse ooh that's a good question to all of these are good questions let's go for tree house or but it's gonna be tree house goods a lot of people will be seasick then you have people that are scared of heights tree house yeah is it closed on though oh you know what these flavors might not have to be too bad but when they mix together it's not good would you rather go to jail for life I have the death penalty oh my goodness ah I think people would rather go to jail for life what that's so close ah 4% 4% jellybeans what you've got for me let's see oh it's red but this one this one my friends is a sour warhead let's see what happens Oh oh yeah yeah that's our oh how can something be so small yet so sour grows would you rather not be able to talk and not be able to walk everyone's gonna do not be able to walk what you can get a wheelchair and then be able to communicate with people guys it's red but this time this could be strawberry or fresh blood fresh blood insane let's try it ah no that's disgusting that was horrible no guys that is not what fresh blood tastes like Shirley that's disgusting yes ha ha ha all because people wanted to not be able to talk which is is weird would you rather never play computer games again or never watch any video on a computer again I would know oh my goodness what do I do because if I never play video games again I can't do this but then I'd never be able to watch any video on the computer like watch TV though right alright I'm gonna click never watch a video Oh logic just doesn't matter these people just choose whatever they want alright time to delve deeper nah yellow oh no yo there's no good ones you know why the good one is lemon the bad one is rotten cheese fun facts I hate lemon so this is not gonna be good either way please the rear orange cheese especially off the blood oh here we go where's it I'm not getting lemon how I get lemon what is that I know where that is not lemon it's not cheese it's just tastes like yellow well that gonna be worse would you rather own a pet snake or a pet turtle snake I should've known people love turtles love them brown Cola or squid squid how could how can they know odd you know what this is eat it haha oh my god that's disgusting hahahaha it's making my eyes water No oh it spit out brah mmm the taste is still going that's horrible I've eaten squid before it I don't like it but this is like a hundred times worse oh I'm glad that's over oh these are not nice these are not nice at all so what we managed to avoid I didn't know what the other one was we've managed to avoid snot so far so let's continue I think we need to up the ante we need to make this challenge extreme for every question that I get wrong I mean to to jelly beans I'm gonna regret this massively would you rather have an iPad or an iPhone they're pretty much exactly the same they could both do the same thing you can call people off on iPads you can you can draw things on an iPhone oh ha ha was there a real squid in there hello iPhone it has to be iPhone yes oh thank goodness who would you rather be a prince or princess or a mermaid or mer man you have a lot of power as a princess and you get cool clothes as well I'm going princess whoa yes would you rather have no thumbs or only have thumbs so it's either this or all of these are thumbs surely all of them are buns no oh no I didn't read it right I didn't read it right or made a mistake so you would just have thumbs or like this I'm an idiot of course you want to be like this are you kidding me with what do you how do you know we meet again my look is like grossing out right now here we go to jelly beans and they are going to be a brown and a green snot is potential here both the once this is either I'll no no it's squid it could be squid squid or Cola or watermelon or snot no they always make me caught I think that's bogus that that's both that's wait and snot at the same time because they're jellybeans they get all like saliva yah the squid one is disgusting guys I'm an idiot I didn't bring water up with me what's what's going on I'm just gonna you know what tap see that I have had a sink in my office I have never ever been so happy that was a terrible choice oh no no we've had this question before would you rather eat waffles or pancakes and I can't remember which one the answer was okay I'm gonna up the ante one more time because we're getting near the ends if I get this right then the next question if I get it wrong I have to eat five but if I get two right in a row no more jelly beans at all if I get this one wrong three jelly beans in one go waffles or pancakes waffles no three two door I don't even have a reaction now they're all just disgusting three wait a second that's 2% that's the closest it could be I'm outraged outraged three jelly beans and trying to pick three with one hands here we go what are they gonna be I've got two sour green ones and a yellow so this is gonna be mad sour with the potential added rotten cheese here we go hop mmm or on cheese mmm mmm sorry I keep coughing but it's gross okay was definitely cheese no no no why did I do this like all of the jelly bean flavors have just merged together in my mouth tap break okay remember what I said about the next question this next question will be the last one but if I get it wrong five jelly beans if I get it right I'm done here okay I'm done my saliva tastes like squid cheese and all other disgusting snots this is the best question to end on dramatic music please would you rather only smell like poop or only smell poop this one is a tough one I think I have the answer you only smell poop because if you if you smell like poop people will judge you if you only smell poop you just have to deal with out yourself Shirley oh no it's gonna be close I think I'm gonna have to eenie meenie miney moe okay eeny meeny miny moe catch stray Oris by the toe if we screams Kersey we'll eeny meeny miny moe I don't think this is the answer I'm gonna click with my eyes closed guys what happens what happens I should've fired my god that wasn't close at all five jelly beans fine here we go I'm gonna pick out and if we got one put it on the floor nope desk two three four and five what colors are they oh these are some horrid ones so I don't if you can see this but first up we have a sour orange second up we have a sour green they're moving which is a little bit weird we also have a normal yellow which as a reminder is evil lemon or rotten cheese which we just experienced and this one brown Cola or squid we've had two squids out these bad boys so far no Cola or the last one a normal green watermelon or snot in three seconds I'm gonna put these all in my mouth and end the video three two one okay that's a whole lot of wrong why is it so sour what is going on in my mouth I don't like it I will finish it for

this where they make the food is it's cursed I like a friend are you doing I don't have a key so when he's got that key but the key is like almost impossible to get right this appears to be the Mafia's excuse of food it certainly doesn't smell like it though you could probably taste some but you're not sure that's something you want in your obituary never out of that word before I would like your help I don't have the key ah can we go on the roof oh look at that squid that's so freaky we can go on the roof but I'm not sure this is gonna allow us to get in oh my goodness his mice hit the

chance only eight experience in 26 gold though which isn't that great but hey let's continue I kind of feel like I want to go back to the lever it's getting really dark and scary and I don't like it I don't want people to to Louise damage well what's that one in the middle oh it's a cumulus but it's got really weird eyes that's so odd right set your traps Troy wants to show off as well his lightning attack is amazing there we go the cumulus is we really need to get out of here because what are you doing let's go jump flash the point was saving MP yeah we need to get rid of those Kunis's cuz they feel everyone indifference so you're not gonna cry gems to cool gems like whatever whatever flambe that punk who actually really powerful why have we been so powerful look at this I'm not complaining but we're doing Twitter it amazing right now that's crazy that's really crazy still in one piece definitely you will smash that guys for some banshee tears and ninety gold that's actually pretty good and for people saying that we should put other people in the game don't worry I'm sure there'll be plenty more opportunities to put more Me's in the game hopefully in this arm stream slash video hopefully that'll be awesome alright found that in that's good everyone's healed up we absolutely smashed that guy's I'm gonna check on the inn and see what these guys are doing what you up to what are you up to I want to see what you're doing is their friendship gonna increase there's something round I'm gonna happen woo grim is cleaning why this is so good it's the best it's the greatest okay grin doesn't look too happy about cleaning though so I'm not too sure he seems to like you look at yours his face is looking smug as anything right now he's looking good they've learned warning as well so that's when they warn each other when an attacks coming so they take less damage which is cool yeah there we go just explained exactly what I said I am watching the chat is just going very very fast it's so hard for me to keep up with but I know you're there I know you're joining me for this and it's gonna be a good time don't worry right we can eat or go to the arcade or spend gold what is what does everyone want they want like new outfits and stuff grim wants oh my goodness a chef's dagger why would he want that though he's not a chef that's crazy choice wants the polkadot robe that looks very nice but it's very expensive as well HP banana we don't need because Grimm steals everything which is amazing and Jem wants the free uniform it will up her defense by four points um should I do it I think I should do that yeah definitely there you go go and buy it there is a risk that she doesn't buy and buy something else but she did it good job she's looking amazing our pink curry uniform you'll get to choose the color we do now our team color is blue so we're gonna probably yeah you know put it in blue we go blue when we can of course looking good though with means we only were 14 god but we did just get loads of gold right we've got Roulettes what are the prizes also someone tweeted me the other day because I wondered if it was impossible for you to beat the guy of rock-paper-scissors but it's not it's possible he tweeted the person tweeted me with a winning scenario was amazing right we've got the wet Marie the donut frying pan a giant helping of exp and some HP banana should we just do it let's go I like this one a lot better come on pray for the gold pray for gold pray for golds that's not gonna be all it might be oh no way that's that we are white we've done this like four times and got gold three times you know how much that weapon costs everyone get hyped oh my goodness I want a doughnut frying pan guys I am I'm blown away by my luck on this thing what can we do we can sell it but I don't really want to who should get it I think Gemma needs it look at that thing can you imagine having that frying pan in real life you could make like donut pancakes and stuff it'll be fantastic look how the fences got up by 2 which means plus the fall before he's got up by 6 and then her attack has gone up by 6 that's actually mad actually insane goes with her new outfit as well she got a new outfit and a new frying pan that's insane right I like the I like the roulette a lot now why could you I'm gonna play it two more times to see if I can get gold again so that I can sell the item that would be amazing let's start and then I might do one rock-paper-scissors let's see we could get some exp I like the the cool face in the middle as well that's cool okay this is not gonna be good HP banana not great I mean I was pushing my luck wasn't I Congrats it says you know at least we don't just lose our money outright like we do with the other one I'm gonna do one more one more spin because the rock-paper-scissors we can just lose our tickets whereas we get something every time this but here we go let's go gold let's go gold it's not gonna be gold it's going to be green blue whatever that color is and we get giant helping of XP I don't actually know what this does what does it do I've won a giant helping every XP oh I have to give it to someone I think gems should just get it I wonder how much this is gonna be though I'm gonna give it to her just because she needs to catch up with everyone else because she's too late the last one to the party oh my goodness 367 that's loads she is definitely on par she's caught two more attack two more HP oh one more defense she has got up so many stats learnt banana fritter improves the flavor and effect of a HP banana when eaten so they do increase the chef's do increase the food that's cool that was a good three tickets pens we got ourselves an item that's worth like 500 gold and we got some some massive improvements to gem stats that's crazy right shock rock or what forgot we got that we need to give out we've got three so I'm worried we can make Gemma's defense even higher which is mad you know what gems had a lot of love so far so let's give the choc rock took a rim enjoy buddy and what you didn't like who doesn't like chocolate dudes no way gobbling ham oh my gosh only two hours likes the gobbling ham you can keep that and then we're gonna feed what else should we feeds there you go you got one more attack and the band sheets here so they increased magic by two trails has a lot of magic Dan has like no magic magic I'm gonna give I'm gonna give it to Dan and then we can get on our adventure guys you don't like it either oh man these guys these guys you see went up one point how you doing guys nice to see you I hope you having a good day so far right let's set off let's do this we have no gold left and let's leave but gem has a new outfit buffed up stats and a new weapon as well that's pretty good that's really good actually right we can go and talk to this lovely lady right now I am kind of curious I'm gonna go back and go the other way I'm curious as to what the lever would do and I know we can beat these guys if we come across monsters so bear with me I'm just gonna do this quickly just because I know it's going to be useful which way we want to go up to the lever if you don't want we playing by the way we're playing me topia I've made a few videos on it before and then a stream about two weeks ago where you literally take all of your Me's that you create all you can create new ones add them into the game and they create your very own story it's an awesome game and is very very long as well so if you're up for a random game that's like Tomodachi life mixed with just a random RPG then definitely go and get it it's awesome right let's see what happens grim found an odds lever we have to pull it right we have to we have to pull the lever I'm doing it there we go oh what's he doing what's he gonna do oh yes I was gonna say did it do nothing a hidden path opened up that's gonna lead us to a chest good job grim goddamn buddy so we're gonna have to go back there but I think I have to make our way to the end first should be fine but I'm never gonna handy monsters we are gonna hit monsters but we can take these guys out I want to see how powerful gem is now because she got so many buffs and start this battle here we go Grimm's going in let's go he stabs him kills him straightaway and pulls over in the process that's fine no it's fine Joris is gonna fire her where did he get that he's been using lightning all the time right here's gem she smashed him in the face see look that is crazy good I like that a lot good job teen dantdm absolutely smashing it's absolutely smashing it's get in get it indeed we get some gold as well which is good because we spent it all is this game fun this game is massively fun it's awesome it's so random as well it's like exactly like you inspect for Tomodachi life but with a massive story instead of them just doing their own thing right this might be a little bit more difficult there's two banshees this time but as long as grim does that then we're fine if Troy Austin is lightning there we go perfect smashed one of the clouds already income dantdm slices one of the other ones I like his sword we've got some powerful and very creative wet weapons right now he is healing up though boat should be fine one against four and are for absolutely I don't know I don't know if you need to do fire trailer so it's a little bit o P but you know what we got rid of them anyway eighty-six faces rescued that's perfect if you can lag by the way guys that's not my end it's your end so just repress the stream reaction you fine oh look at that we got to bounce she tears and cloudy floss and 128 gold that's awesome alright let's heal up and let's get out of here we need to go and find the extra chests and then we can go into the castle and speak to the pretty lady so I have no idea what the pretty lady's doing they are gonna want some extra things though they could eat grub or spend gold what is Travis one he still wants his robe a Grimm wants the Polka Dot gear they could match look at them with our matching outfits looking beautiful right I'm not gonna make them eat anything just yet there's gonna set off for now I'm gonna collect up some food and then we're going to the chest anyway so we don't want to spend any money or anything's we don't know what we're gonna get in the chest how long we been playing this game I'm not too sure in total I would say like five hours maybe I'm not too sure it's a long game though like a really long game I'm pretty sure it's a long game anyway here we go big old chest that's open this bad boy we are not anything bad yet oh be Armour is that worth it is that better than what we've got or worse it's better okay sweet let's go blue B I'm liking all these colors the white one looks pretty cool as well we're gonna go we're gonna go I was confused red then we've got four more defense equip that was so worth it blue B pink pink sword what more could you want guys I mean I don't know I wonder if we're gonna fight some monsters well we are that means we're gonna get some gold it is good as the slides as well those slimes are annoying we need Grimm to slice them up he's not gonna do it if he sliced them and hit all of them you would have popped them all at once income shows with a lightning attack as well there we go that's how you did buddy free that knows gems all my Guinness Jen's B's hit them with us the frying pan absolutely smashed it I remember in the lot at the beginning of the last stream they absolutely destroyed us these banshees come on by come on buddies you've got this Crimmins looking energetic he's gonna smash them in the face trip over at the same time which he keeps on doing there we go come

for tuning in guys 30,000 of you are watching right now that's insane let's go to the woods wow this is far there's a lot of chests around as well I mean we could go right but I don't know what we go really far we can search the woods or we can go to what's I call it the arid frontier I'm gonna go to the woods I want that chest desperately let's do this look how cute this is like a really nice green color let's see what monsters wait within we have flambe so we can fry these pugs we've done these before to start this battle just destroy these guys lightning should zap them both look at that we're too powerful way too powerful everyone is balanced yeah even when I play any RPG Pokemon I like everyone to be balanced as much as possible and he got caught in a trap smacking done oh it did not come out that will finish him off there we go we've rescued so many faces today already that's insane doing good guys so over already see you - good trailers - Goods got some food got some money's we're out of here I just want that chest as always one of the chests ooh up or down I'm gonna guess up cuz that's where the chest might be I'm guessing anyway you spilled coke on your computer no rip rip that's terrible right is there a chest here there's not I mean there might be Wow get a lung full of this fresh air I might even got to lungfuls thanks trees for this clean air Thank You trees see what I mean when you're asking about how fun this game is earlier it is fun it's so random so random it's a hole in my shoe boy we can buy you some new shoes don't worry another one I'm gonna go up again I want to try and find this chest as quick as a flash it's getting a sunset it's pretty cool sunset through the trees oh the moles are back guys I don't like these moles at all they do too much damage to my liking and they dodge damage too which makes it doubly as hard what do you mean by faces so basically the story is the evil magician has stolen everyone's face which is why all these enemies have little faces on them every time you kill an enemy you save the face just like that and that was a powerful shot a really powerful shot maybe the moles aren't gonna be that much of an issue right that's safe spot someone just to give them a little bit of a boost of HP the other face is you can go back and watch the first episode to get a whole explanation of the story after this stream but it's not too hard to understand we're just trying to save everyone's faces because someone stole them pretty crazy story but it's a fun one we did it guys we did it what a breeze we're making progress straw to Sunday is a popular as well we must get them from the the moles we do know a lot of running yes we got the chest that's open this bad boy yeah I'm not a bad one yet oh that's so good that's really good Jevon got another new weapon look at that it goes up five in attack and in defense take that walk Jim smack people with it and they'll be amazing that's awesome that's really good now we're heading down and there's another chest yes open again a game ticket okay we could spin the roulette there must be some new um must be some new prizes surely and we found that in that was so good we smashed it we're doing kids this is good progress and people are making good relationships and stuff - everyone's healed up we're not even having to use sprinkles that's how insane it is continue playing guys come on but very in playing 40 minutes right so we've got an arcade spin that we can do what is the roulette prize an iron ones that's that's a one in 25 chance spin that

fluffed it right oh that's nice these are all really expensive I think I'm like yeah I'm gonna give dantdm this I feel like he had an Armour like this already was it the leather one it must be it looks good though in copper let's go to blue it makes the whole thing blue look at that it looks like some kind of diamond armor that's awesome if you just frying pan as a drying pan if anyone gets that reference your legends absolute legends right okay let's feed some peeps let's give this to gem cuz she hasn't had it yet not that tasty okay I think it looks phenomenal but okay I'll give this one to Grimm as well he likes it that's good and then wait who hasn't eaten yet I guess it's you and then it's gonna betray us as well right yeah there we go he likes it we've got so many banshee tears that means we're just absolutely destroying people there we go everyone's ready to go let's get out of here I don't know if you do actually need to feed them every single time but I do it anyway just in case level 7s all rounds Travis is gonna level up higher just because we won the XP wherever you made it to Oh up there's another chest there still I'm going for you I'm going for the treasure guys I really want the treasure it helps so much because we've won we've won a one item on the roulette and then we've won one in a chest as well Oh Gemma lights down TDM Toreros legs down TDM - what's gonna happen he does look cool in his new art only no Oh No are you two alright just fine hmm they're angry why what happens yeah pokemon meme that's what it was good job guys which way I feel like oh I don't know I feel like it's gonna be down I feel like you're gonna get the chest anyway let's go down just do the opposite of what we did before we're gonna find some monsters but we're gonna find some Oh peace and treasure as well let's see what happens rock mops poison mark we haven't seen a poison wash before the trip allowed to destroy these pretty quickly though release all these faces that lightnings gonna do it the poison must a little bit more powerful but gems flambe should just try them there we go haha the power guys the power piece of cape certainly was got butterfly honey 75 G's cannot complain the only way I can complain if I don't get a chest I'm gonna go up yeah I'm gonna go up I feel like up is a little bit more lucky if we hit a chest we're gonna

more is getting dark okay oh they're camping that's so cute it's not safe for everyone to go to sleep some home will have to stay on Lookout we will keep watch oh I think dancing him at the new armor he's gonna stay watch I guess I'll stay up hopefully nothing bad happens hey grim in your little duck out fear still awake certainly am is everyone's gonna come out in any way the two quietly kept watch oh that's cute I like that what is their relationship status now acquainted so cute I learnt warning that's a pretty good one actually because they do dodge the attacks like they get no damage whatsoever it's really really goods there we go spent the night and then dawn came so I like that I like those little um extra adventury bits it's so cool oh I just realized what happens so it's whoever stays watch doesn't get healed I should've thought about that I didn't realize all right what's next guys hopefully it on the chest let's do this no monsters let's get past this and then we should be able get some chests as well oh boys and not some banshees go on grim and he wants to show off slap them all good job buddy sure I was gonna lightning as well that's just such a good combo cuz it's like spread damage all over the place Oh poison I don't poison me though that would be horrible we were just absolutely smashing it I don't think Archer are you praying again everyone's crying Gemma's not though she's like nut don't him I like it this portray us away just go over his crying episode good job triage there you go now get back in there and smack some moss please Oh No yeah there we go look I'm all just crying I think I just leave the wall dad um isn't bothered twice that was really good quite lucky actually jump slash smashed it you're eating pizza a good choice it's making me hungry though we have made so much progress already banshee tears Gould's it's literally pouring in and we can play the roulette as well have we found anything else another chest I wonder what the bad ones are oh oh we got ourselves 400 jeez I wonder why would you leave the chest is there any reason I'm fouling in as well perfect I don't know why you'd leave the chest I guess some things can happen which are bad sometimes but you know it doesn't seem like they're too common what's their relationship now maybe sort of likes again learnt praise sure shower a friend with compliments see I knew you could beat it that's pretty nice nice and friendly I like it what do you want now let's go to the arcade so we have lots of gold to spend Travis ones are the new outfits Grimm wants the chef's dagger but let's see what we can win in the arcade first the ragged armor I don't even know that is so I'm gonna start and see what happens there we go that's a big gold section actually that's more than 50 not more than 50% Oh oh yeah that's what I'm talking about there can be bad guys in the chest okay that's not so bad so you always should open it right always ok Ragan Armour has been achieved I don't know whose that is it's down CDMS but I'm is it it's gonna be worse or better than the one we're wearing it's way worse that's so bad cancel that I own equip in that no I thought I won oh my goodness okay can you sell stuff or should we know we should do the rock-paper-scissors win gold then we be bowling with so much gold right Troy auras versus the computer we keep losing this one but I've seen that you can win it so it's not impossible here we go let's go which one should we choose though I feel like I'm intimidated by this hand sure iris is not though rock paper scissor sinners oh it's a draw scissors again Oh to draw again and scissors again no I lost I lost I should have gone paper I knew it got it for you no you're not anyone you just want to give me you don't wanna give me gold let's try one more 500 gold is a lot we both are a thousand gold down there we go I'm gonna go scissors again just because I feel like it's the winning one we do at the same time as tray or us we'll win ready 3 2 1 go oh do i do again I'm gonna paper Oh you pawn it's so hard so hard you don't got it for me don't even tell them don't tell it don't tell lies see any computer we couldn't buy it we couldn't win anything good in the ruler anyway yeah the ragged armor it like haft our defense which is insane right spend gold I guess who should we buy for that increases defense bike for that increases attacked by five that's a pretty good thing I'm gonna give him the chef's dagger here we go there's only been one time when they've not bought what they were supposed to which was annoying and it was tray horas how terrifying is that looks like something from a horror movie like a chicken with a dagger insane whether they save up more golds I don't know if I need to keep feeding them grub it's kind of annoying isn't it all right give some to Trey Oris I kind of paranoid if I don't feed them then something bad happens there must be a reason that they have stomach right surely right let's give this to you and then give this to I'm just giving it based on their lights now really I don't really care about their their stats that much when you down tiems got a +5 and HP which is really really good I couldn't random next time that's a good idea set off there we go now some of you two actually know the difference stuff in like in terms of the way the the patterns for the rock-paper-scissors I need to study that because otherwise I'm gonna keep losing my gold well not my gold I'm just not gonna win any gold all right skip the chest how am I supposed to get the chest and where does this go we're gonna find out I guess yeah check it with a chef's knife and very very scary very scary indeed or I should better take these guys out no okay maybe not this might be a bit more tricky I'm sure guys have got it though especially Grimm's new knife oh that's powerful tries to show off a lightning bolt okay the mushrooms are down already I thought we were gonna have problems of this but we're not we don't even need to heal guys oh maybe we might need to hold tray or hugs he's a bit of a wimp I'm not gonna lie tries to do him first assist no dantdm is doing praise nice Gemma what does it actually do though is she just feeling good about herself and do more damage than showing off she really likes gem doesn't he he's like showing off giving her compliments what a nice guy what a really nice guy 50 nice mushroom saute 100 gold don't mind if I do let's see if we can find more chests I'm guessing we're gonna get a fork in the road now no we're gonna get a chest straightaway that's open this an MP suite that's the worst loot I've ever seen that's terrible what's gonna be next Oh a bit of story oh it's a face whose face is that is that I recognise it oh my goodness boss battle boss battle coming in it's a Kraig Gollum Oh we've accidentally found the face I'm such an idiot I forgot the face was there I don't know why I didn't realize it would be there right we got boss by coming in that's I heal up real quick it's healed all the way I feel like this is gonna be pretty difficult especially if it starts summoning other people actually I'm going to save spot tre Oris actually no I'm not oh let's see what happens grooms chopping him up first he's gonna have so much HP it's unreal I'm gonna get Travis to attack first there we go I was like I swear I recognized him of course it is it's Craig geez guys becomes the boss though I could have gotten the other way into Skip's yeah I don't know why I would have done that that's powerful why he does two attacks and she dodged it okay our team is powerful right now really powerful okay Craig's almost down to a half health let this is carry-on we're bossing this 23 damage dude the flambe she's showing off as well look at that damage we've got this oh my goodness okay that's a lot of damage right there trust needs to move to safety that's a lot of damage okay we need to finish this quickly grimsy and the HP banana though because he steals things I forgot about that he's kind of stopped stealing things though for some reason dantdm chirpy yeah that was a big damage Craig's got about a third health I'm gonna keep him there I choose some sprinkles cuz I'm sure we're gonna get like we need to avoid big damage didn't survive because if we get knocked out that's terrible Oh Oh big damage oh my goodness okay that's a lot of damage let's switch you guys out come on tries help your friend out please need more HP bananas he's gonna steal so I've just said he's stopped stealing but I guess we've all got full items down TD I'm coming through the healing gems got a new skill home-cooking is she gonna increase the HP banana I don't even know what is she doing she is yes he's flaunting up HB madonna that's amazing that's so good oh jeez I'm getting squished Auto charge is dead no we should be able to finish him off though right surely diam TDM actually has an HP banana so hopefully he can eat it that's big damage when he dance again for the damage gems doing a flambe he's gonna be close it's coming down to the wire oh that's a big storm or gem avoided it no dad did you know that Peter guy didn't die Peter and I thought he's gonna jump in the way that had been horrible need more HP bananas Grint and goons are stealing all the time I mean I'm not complaining because did we do it did we do it yes we did it guys we've got Craig's face back King Craig is back thank everyone thank the team Tony gives us 1 face rescued added to our total but that isn't that is so worth it 100 experience plus 50% choices that can pretty upset I'm gonna give this to Jim just because she did the big old cooking and I was good a golden snake look it's served on her hands that's very good the Kings face flew off back to the castle good job guys well done I'm proud of you I'm proud of you found them in everything's gonna be refreshed that was amazing

be guess his guy's a copper goblet okay why what can I do with that woman's very pleased maybe it just increases their relationship nothing else what are they now maybe sort of like level 5 everyone's getting pretty well acquainted with each other now they spent so much time together I guess that's cute I like that right let's we could spend gold buy full like ah that's amazing look at that the polka dot arm I can afford it but I'd only have one left sure wants the iron ones should I buy that I'm just gonna buy it I need to buy it looks amazing although I am from Monsters Inc let's go for that's kind of a purpley color let's go for this blue there we go look at that that's so cool I like that stop going so quickly well some of the stuff we've already read so don't worry it just means that they've improved their relationship we're down to a whole one gold which is bad I want to see what happens when you kick the random button for eating tuck in oh that's cool they should have done that all along it might give them something they don't like but it doesn't really matter or one of them was the golden snake as well nice let's get out of here everyone's getting some good relationships going we've got a good attack going good defense good armor good clothes it's looking good guys and we can go back to Craig and see what it gives us he is a king so he might give us money he might give us I don't know a big hug he might let us sleep in his car so I don't really know I'm gonna find out though he might give us lots of gold though that's what I'm hoping for I don't have three Craig's in my world I switched them up don't worry here we go back on the fat Kings face I loved it the Craig is the best is a fat King that's the best character so I guess we're gonna come across characters that suits armies personalities more so we can just change up and change it all the time oh oh what are you doing what are you doing why are you posing with your meat that were amazed oh thank goodness he's looking at himself in the mirror the royal countenance is restored oh don't cry too much buddy you're gonna start rivers and flood the place accept our role gratitudes

right now we need to go this way all there's no those things there I kind of want to pop them because they give us so much money let's see what happens let's go to the arid frontier and start our next adventure the arid frontier it looks amazing actually looks like a Mesa biome for Minecraft I'm a baller I know I'm a boy in this game right then we need to get to the inn so we can actually buy some things trows wants a cat someone's not convinced you know princesses elders friends yeah he seems kind of unreliable huh well he's probably a good person right hmm here I suppose anyway let's go and find Prince sands so that kind of they're not into him either they really don't like him that much is the King making me hungry yes I am starving right now any gold line about be honest we don't need any gold buddy Charles need to calm down oh look at these no those rocks seen if they've already got noses they're our faces let's see how powerful these guys are or not they might not be powerful at all they got high defenses really high defenses dancing everything to show off in front of Jen I like it okay they're not so bad if they don't get an attacking that'd be perfect oh what's he gonna do oh he does damage to three in a row that's pretty powerful they're not too bad though as soon as we get to the end we can heal that damage off it'll be fine piece of cake there we go up to level eight for Trey Oris because we gave him that boost earlier not so bad 220 gold we've got so much hopefully things don't get too expensive now those if they do we're gonna have to use that money quite a lot what's happening now new clothes they got a match they look cute cold hmm yeah not bad the compliment went down well beautiful I love it when they get little relationships and they're like dancing around and stuff it's so cute the floor looks like cheese as well or chocolate or cheese in chocolate mixed together right we've got two choices here we can go up or oh we can go across or down I'm gonna go across I'm just succumbed to the chest do we have to go over the gap though that might be a bit weird my tummy hurts keep your chin up it's okay Monstars what's happening okay we got two moles and a nose Rock this should be okay I might sprinkle them though just in case people don't find an in I'm just gonna sprinkle them up to full health or at least a health it doesn't really matter too much I'm trying to sprinkle Trejo he's already got max HP that should be enough let's go let's smash these guys I want to see what's in the chest for damage that's poor it's not good start that's better though if they ducked that attack would have been in big trouble I guess the defense increased a lot yeah they're only doing eight damage per time now that's not so bad let's put in the safe spot though so we can go properly come here Lin himself up flambe has been really really popular for this stream guys are we gonna finish this off no he's gonna dodge it why is that why he's screaming a duck suit I mean why not it's powerful and he hasn't wanted to he doesn't wanted a new outfit yet so I guess that's why all right we should about to finish his golf now right he's dodging him he's being a bit Trixie see if Grimm can heal before we get to the end are we winning we certainly are whit we use the winning we always win always moles and rocks are bad they are the most powerful we've come across so far but we still destroyed it so far not doing too bad at all 190 gold some chuck rocks we're almost up to like 4,000 now I can't believe we went from literally just one and here's the chest here we go as open in so happens three games tickets sweet that's actually perfect let's keep on going though found that in awesome we can play some games it's gonna be amazing open 15 or more

lag by the way guys a good tip is to turn chat off oh you can do that by minimizing the chat just because that it's going so fast they it's just making you lag out so it turn the opposite point at least we've got Graham up to live away I guess but we didn't get the monster armor we aren't even seen what the monster armor looks like I can't believe that 50% chance of getting it and we missed out three times we're gonna have to spend god I'm gonna buy everything paper armor gimme hopefully they will buy the right thing yep she bought the paper uniform I don't know how that's more I don't know

I mean hi hamster how's it going hope you join yourself let's make this a different color our team color is blue but it kind of matches dantdm I'm gonna go pink just cuz a bit more magic does match blue does go with blue right and grim he wants the ceramic dagger things get more expensive it worries me but as long as we're doing we're doing chores for royalty it's gonna be fine there we go and we want to destroy all our opponents don't we there we go hand out the money let's eat some grub let's go Chuck rock let's go random tuck in guys grim didn't like the chakra got attack up magic up top not perfect well done guys we might be able to fit in a quick next journey yeah we can of course we can let's go I'm gonna test out our new team anyway because they look absolutely amazing like the five different types of sword that's a lot of money spending five types of dagger as well Grimm's had some decent upgrades five different types of robe it has a major shopping guys major shopping right let's do this ceramic daggers look amazing as well I kind of oh yeah that's what I want to do I want to destroy this guy so we're actually gonna have to go through the place we did just now to get back to the crossroads and go a different way we want two of these punks it gives us 500 each I'm pretty sure that's a powerful one oh ouch ouch that's powerful first assist you okay grab it's so funny they just love each other so much sort of likes level seven well we don't even need to put them into the the buddy base get well soon that's the highest level so far visit a friend in the same spot speed up their recovery that's amazing that's really amazing come on take them out guys we have to do this grim showing off again grim and Trejo sound like a super special bargain need to get these snaps out of the way good jump / I liked it that felt good ha the gold flambe because we get lots of gold from these guys it's amazing there we go I went how much gold ring to get for two I mean it gets a thousand let's see I don't think we get much experience there we go like we are running back there so worth going for so worth going for right so we can either go over the top this way or we can go down cuz there's a chest that goes down so I'm gonna go down let's see if we can make it is it 451 it certainly is in the afternoons it's actually almost evening for me alright let's test out our new weapons shall we we're gonna hit these and then we want to go down afterwards it's the big rock monsters the nose rocks even I think we've had rock monsters before they're a different mob this should be easy they do hit three at a time though which is a little bit terrifying dantdm has got a powerful attack now I think we've doubled our face collection today which is actually really good grim showing off tres he's gonna dance with them because that's what he likes to do I don't think rocks could maybe dance that well but you know what it doesn't matter he's dead it's fine here we go few more rounds he could've done yeah James caught up to level eight so everyone's level eight now learn spicy dish feed spicy dish front to a friend making them breathe fire on the enemy that's awesome I love all these new all these new attacks and stuff it keeps it really fresh you're not like rinsing all the same attacks like in Pokemon you learn new things all the time it's got a random battle maneuver as well so you're kind of just it's like all the battles are different they're really funny the story is awesome I love this game right let's go down we've gone right already it kind of makes you want to uh kind of makes you want to explore as much as possible as well your nose a little stuffy that's not good Oh a chest sandwiches we have had sandwiches before I didn't know you could get food from chests that's cool you want a cat I mean you're dressed as a chicken so a cat probably isn't the best thing buddy there's a skeleton armor no way that would be awesome someone in the chat just told me about secret skeleton armor right that's perfect we need all those slimes out of here as soon as possible perfect he heard me he definitely heard me in your face chump we want to do this without them attacking look at that they didn't even get an attack in we're too strong too strong I mean there's probably not such thing as a too strong but we're doing well more money is more chocolate what could what could possibly be worse better what's the saying I don't really know your cat is hitting on the screen and attacking okay okay trying probably trying to grab the sandwiches from earlier there we go Janet dantdm and Gemma Blunt lent our hand which is helping a friend out with the actions they're learning loads of things that can help each other out as I she's really cute right what do you want you want the polkadot uniform as well dan wants oh that's the monster armor I thought you said it wasn't good that is good it's 39 that word so it's there to save me so much money is it still on the roulette the ragged robe it's not on the roulette we're gonna have to buy it should we buy it I think we're gonna buy it it's by the polka dot uniform there we go good job gem everyone's in polka-dots well actually dantdm is gonna change out now let's get you in blue that's a big hat you could fit two of your heads in there that's mad just by Dante down the monster armor it's actually not that expensive it's the weapons that are expensive look at that that's so cool I love that what colors can we go for we can do like a light blue or a normal blue I like the light blue the light blue is cool 39 defense Dan seems like Opie right now upgrades them so they can hit more people at one time how do you do that can you do that check on team I wasn't meant to do that okay so we are actually in a pretty good space right now I'm gonna give them all I'm gonna save the food we have got sandwiches I could try out the sandwiches but you know what I'm gonna leave that for next time guys I think this is a good a timer to leave it we did so much today like a lot so much so we got lots of story we became we went super pour 1 gold to super rich in pretty much one foul

that's right I did it what you are looking at right now is the brand's new one-of-a-kind magic pen version - just look at it it's beautiful it's prestigious it is not gonna make me draw any better but it's gonna allow me to draw this is the old magic pen not quite sure what happened to it like how did that even happen the electrics are exposed there's no tip I ruined it so this one's officially dead and has been replaced by the brand's new magic pen and it is insane I've been inspired by all of your drawings recently especially on the among the sleep series and I just felt like drawing again because you guys love the magic pens so much you gave so many likes on the previous one I thought I'd sit down buy a new magic pen and tablet I told you I was getting serious about this look at the size of this thing and I'd sit down and draw what you want me to draw so this is my Twitter right here and I'd sweet its want to draw what should I draw now I'm gonna look through and see what you guys want me to draw cuz I need to warm this bad boy up loads of people want me to draw pugs now the problem with that is I'm not very good at drawing pugs regardless of how much time I spend with them I'm just not good at drawing them I don't know why see what is that Oh actually I know I pushed it this Tweep I've just had a really good idea I'm gonna do the dance EDM drawing challenge okay so if you don't know what this is I will search you doing the 38 day drawing Dan challenge I think that's right yeah there we go look so this is a challenge that you guys have been doing for the past of 30 days and I think it ended two days ago I mentioned it in my birthday video a couple of weeks ago and has some certain rules so I'm gonna go through some of these and also try and do my own we're gonna pick three days and try and do them I think this would be fun okay so here are the days here are the rules this is what you've been doing over the 30 days of November I just need to pick some okay first what I'm gonna pick is down in a dinosaur onesie let's do this I'm taking this seriously guys I'm doing what some of you guys do normally and you do like a lie blues sketch in the background just to get it right which is really cool so I'm gonna do that okay there's my mannequin guy and now I need to draw over the top in a different color to get this right I think this is gonna be cool so I need to draw a dinosaur onesie I'm gonna go for a big hood over the top and it's also gonna have teeth coming down as well I think that'll look pretty cool so it's like my head is in his mouth and we're also gonna add big eyes on the top as well so it's kind of gonna be like a monster and a dinosaur in one check this out it might even accidentally like a frog but we'll see what happens nostrils of course there we go okay this is coming together it's gonna be like a full-on bodysuit so we need to make sure they're all attaches together this is gonna be weird I just need to rub something else I've done this bit wrong I kind of messed up a little bit but you know what it doesn't even matter I am also gonna put a big old tail on there as well which is of course gonna have spikes on it yes I need to fix this there we go that's better okay so now I need to make sure it sits up so it's gonna have a zip down the middle 93 details so I need what do I need before I do the color I'm gonna add like a little kind of thumbs and fingers just because I think I look funny the eyes of course there we go and then I guess the heads gonna come in like this way big mouth and I think we need to color this bad boy now it's looking good what is it alike without the guidelines that's not so bad I need to add the hairline cuz otherwise I'm gonna be bold which isn't a terrible thing but if you looking at my hair right now it's not bold is it I don't want to have a zip as well but I don't really know how to draw them I guess that'll do I want to add some other bits as well I'm gonna add some toes because dinosaurs have toes yeah we go tail detail as well just like this I guess I need to make sure he actually has like a defining teeth section I don't know what style I went with here but aren't you kind of like it right there do some colors this green is actually perfect it's so dinosaur if I add in some yellow bits now because I think that just matches the green so well coloring the face yeah coloring done I'm not sure what to do about the top bits of eyes because I didn't leave enough green but you know what it's fine for now and shade this there I say guys I think I'm done I've got the shading I've got the colors and I still have two more to do so I think this guy is done so far I'm pretty sure you guys would have shown me up but that is my entry for um 30 day Dan challenge but down in a dinosaur onesie let me see I'm I'm just looking through to see what other ones there are there's this one that's super cool is this the dad as a chicken I need to do that one next all of these are just just incredible though I mean look at these they're insane oh look at that wow that's so good it's even got the little dinosaur blowing flames that's Matt and this one too it's good truly in my hand no way right time to draw it down as a chicken this is what I'm gonna use as my guide ah I think I need to add some hair on so maybe like this and I'll make more sense when I color it I don't really know I definitely went with the crazy-looking chicken look this is going to be this is gonna be a masterpiece I don't know why I really want to be like a super angry chicken I this is gonna be great I've got to put the belly on the dinosaur just remember so I'm gonna draw this one in so I do remember how to do it I'm gonna draw an egg as well just because I want to be popping out a little egg am i doing another egg up here as well might be a really cool background to have I didn't think of backgrounds last time no what color do I do a chicken chickens gonna be like white but I kind of guess I could do like a light blue chicken let's do that this looks just like this's looks crazy especially with the light blue and the animu eyes actually quite like this I thought the perfect background to add as well comedy if I didn't add a background before okay it's always fully colored I just need to do some details I don't really know what details to add I need to make the actually I need to make the eggs a diamond color that'll kind of do I kind of want to do like some kind of shine around the outside as well it will look good I promise it'd look really good shading is going on this has got to be one of my favorites I mean I've only drawn two but you know what I mean my favorite ones I've drawn with the magic pen me as a chicken looking pretty anime I just need to add like a really cool background and you'll understand how crazy this is gonna look I'm actually gonna do your highlights on the eggs just so you look super cool I've got six in that for some reason I don't know why but I tried to do a little swell there we go like diamonds chicken eggs from your man dantdm guys I actually think that's done I just need to add the background I'll show you get a big brush up in here hello hello is it during the brush oh that's weird there we go perfect oh oh look at the eyes I forgot to color the eyes it there we go that's a little bit better it's a little less freaky well is it it's kind of the same amount of freaky I don't know why that happened like that but that looks pretty cool to me it's like delayed it's so weird but I do like a sunburst in the background that looks insane I'm so pleased I'm so pleased I think I make it one better slightly darker in the middle and this this is up it's a masterpiece absolute masterpiece yes I've created the greatest thing ever that's me as an angry chicken with a pretty crazy background alright let's see what you guys created there's me as a Minecraft chicken I like that okay this isn't the chicken version but it's a baby me with the tattoos as well he's pointed at him he's hurt so proud whoa is that means a scientist that's awesome I love the style and the crown as well there's me the chicken I like that similar to mine but a little less crazy that means the unicorn that's mad whoa that's bendy that's so nice I love that that's cool to me as a rapper oh my goodness that's that's amazing now that's me as a chicken Dan's fan draws who I think actually created this challenge that's awesome I look how dedicated they are they did every single day I need to pick one more um I'm gonna do Dan as a cup heads not just as a car peds as a cup let's just put the chicken away so I'm talking like a big old mug my version of cop had a mug man I'm gonna do it really quick because of how long we've got left of the video this already looks at crazily derpy like it was not how I expected it to look nobody just realized as well why it is mug man and cup head have a straw coming out of them and then many people that drink from a mug or a cup with a straw like a coffee mug not not like a normal glass anyway I need to add in the hair as well I'm not quite sure how I'm gonna do it with the the cup in the backgrounds I think this kind of works right here's the concept let's get drawing it might actually need to draw the hair first because it kind of takes over everything else takes over the entire mug guys actually kind of like this like this little lip bit here because it looks like the edge of my real-life lip that's cool and completely done by accident also don't ask me why but I've decided to go for like spongebob no blinis I have no idea why as thing looks cool how'd you don't know what else to add to this it's like I'm gonna add some stripes to the straw of course but who else do I add to me as a mug um I feel like maybe like glasses or Oh an eyepatch I have no idea why I think one of the drawing challenges were was a pirate as well I was gonna do glasses but I changed mine store eyepatch that looks cool alright let's start coloring this bad boy I need to think of a background for this as well because I don't quite have one in mind as with the chicken I'm gonna go for a light blue colored mug the straw can be in pink and I don't know other color to use let's find one why actually doesn't look too bad by itself um a little card to do my no Bellinis I guess just in the blue color right actually maybe we should be wearing some kind of shorts instead let me give that a go with little hearts on definitely look at those oh my goodness this is perfect I'm actually gonna do the opposite shading on this one just because the cup is a different kind of color doesn't really need that much to be honest let's try lighting up the hair sooo yeah that looks much better I like that I could do both but I think like shading and lighting is gonna be kind of weird at once better shading on the eyepatch looking kids okay so I think I'm gonna go simple on a background for this one this one's just gonna be a straight-up beach lots of sands big old sea and some waves like really really shabby waves I've also just realized I've been using the pencil tool this whole time that's why the lines don't look smooth but hey I think we're good here by the way it's even incredible at this event just exists there's 2425 posts in this challenge which is crazy because it was all curated by you guys you guys came together as a community on Instagram and to make this awesome challenge happen so I thought I'd get involved and show off a few of your drawings as well because there's 2,000 of them and they're absolutely incredible all of these all of these they're absolutely amazing thanks for taking time out of your day out of your month to be able to create these it's a joy to look through first of all though let's take a look at my entries we have done in a dinosaur 1c which i think is pretty cool which I chose a background for this and actually did the belly but you know it's fine then and my second favorite is gonna have to go to the cup it was supposed to be dantdm as cup head but I just drew myself as a mug with shorts and an eyepatch I mean it's pretty cool then finally we have my favorite one the chicken I don't know why it just works so well with the colors the style and everything I hope you like it too

so much watching you the best have an amazing day and I'll see you all next time goodbye 
guys we need to talk about this game again for tonight because I have been playing this game like crazy i streamed it a few days ago and i wasn't doing too great but i feel like i've got a bit better there's not the main reason that I'm making a video today the main one is because I saw this on Twitter let me show you you see that that's right they've added a new item called the bush so this update literally landed yesterday on my birthday and you can hide in plain sight with the new consumable item the bush so today I wanted to play this game and see if I could find the bush now I played for like two three hours yesterday and I couldn't find it because it's of legendary legendary rarity but for good reason because it is good also I want to show you one more thing just before we hop into some games you follow me on Twitter you know that I got my first wind check it out no don't look at the matches played come on ten hours and seven minutes on the ps4 and I've got one win one I've also got this incredible shot I want to show you it was a sniper from really really far away I was proud of it and here it is check it out watch he's climbing up he's building up and and he's dead it was honestly is so insanely lucky and skillful one headshot from that far away also show you how skillful you need to be with the sniper to even hit someone but enough of that let's get into a game and see if we can even find this bush okay so tactics I'm gonna be super aggressive even though that means we're gonna get into a tire of gun fights which I'm not that good at I just need to find as many chests as I can to try and find this legendary bush oh and check this out yeah I've got me the umbrella the victory umbrella which you can only get if you win a single game of battle royale you don't know how happy I am to get this umbrella I'm also very high from the ground why is this why is this happening right now come on give me gold give me gold oh geez there's no gold in here oh no I'm so dead I'm so dead I'm so dead please don't kill me No well that's my game over yeah there we go I'm dead okay gold I hear gold there we go give me a bush give me a push that is not a push but that is fine did the gun just fell down here thanks for that there's usually go down here as well is there there's not struck on though that's pretty good even though I think in the update these have been nerfed the other shotgun is better guys I can hear more gold there must be some more in here actually it might be up there let's have a look it is right let's build a quick little staircase here we go here we go bush please no another shield potion I do not mind my other plans get a bush by the way is to wait until the loot drops come down from the sky on the balloons and try and grab it from one of those that's usually where you have the most chance of grabbing a legendary so I think they're gonna be there but to do that I need to stay alive okay there's more gold in here somewhere here it is no bush but we got a decent AR okay that's fine and grenades okay grains are always good okay remember guys super aggressive there is someone up there a hundred percent where are they where are they where are they they're right here I can't even get through because they built up ah god yeah gotcha you haven't got a decent gun yes okay they somehow did like a lot of damage to me no no that upset me greatly this is what we're looking for this I've never been too lonely Lodge so I'm going there what is that oh my goodness okay I can see why no one goes there there has to be gold up there but I really messed this up I think there's someone here definitely someone here okay okay okay gotcha come on come on come on come on come on I need the gold there's definitely gold here where is it wait it's in there that's so random yeah mine yes yeah is a bush oh my goodness okay I believe that just happened lonely Lodge reppin the bush okay right I never used this before so this could go terribly wrong I've only got 78 health but let's use it here we go so it's a consumable like a bandage and here it is I'm a bush I'm a legit bush are you kidding me this is great but also very obvious on the stairs so um you know what I'm gonna go this is ridiculous so ridiculous and we're inside the storm this could be the perfect bush game as long as I don't mess it up look I can just stay here and be a bush as long as I don't move I'm fine if I Krauts have even better I wonder how well we could actually just stay here because if we go over near the sea we're not even gonna be able to be supported because we know our back will be protected the only problem is I've already been shot oh wait a second it's the calling the calling has happens there's literally a shield potion right here now all we need to do is sit and wait you can shoot from this thing the only thing that happens is if you get damaged a single bit of damage whether it's from fall or from another player your bush will disappear but that's kind of why it gives you two but how insane is this all I need is a sniper I guess I should go over here I don't take damage we get we can go to this complex on the map but it's gonna be tricky I just need some kind of sniper and we're set for the game I mean just look at this thing I'm exactly the same as that Bush over there but I've got a person in it but we still need to be careful because when you've run your legs show as you can see so we need to be super careful still okay there's definitely someone down there I don't know if I could get them from here they're just behind that tree see they're right there right there I'm gonna try and get them see what happens nope that was terrible the bush has been exposed they have no idea where it's coming from they just like run off because they don't know where it's coming from the only thing is you to look at a ceiling zapper I thought it was a I though as a sniper the only problem is you do look very obvious in these situations she needs to be super careful like this like this like this I don't even know where that came from ah that may be jobs so bad I lost it no look at them they saw the bush and they took it what's this why are you not using the bush son why you're not using the bush and if there's a sniper around yeah I'm gonna be so mad at you no they're saving the bush they don't know what they're doing I'm so annoyed next time I got a bush I'm just gonna try and hide and just stay where I am though trying to regress why did I shoot that far away I doubt a sniper that person to be dead dead know what I just realized I couldn't see that person because I was a bush if you find a bush you need to make your game plan to just do nothing be a bush and I'm gonna find another one the lonely lodge though I'm going back because then we can just go to the wailing woods and be one with the shrubbery no there's other people coming here okay okay we've got some competition I'm gonna go to the house instead so I think they're going for the tower oh my goodness I'm against there's so many people here come on no that'll do though yes yes yes yes yes there's another one okay I need to get out of here because I heard gunshots it's my chance guys I literally searched for two hours maybe even three yesterday for this bush and I've only just managed to get it only problem is I need to get into the storm this time I'm gonna be super careful bide my time and see how far we can get by just being green again a sniper would be great but I can't be too picky we also have to look out for other bushes as well I'm talking to you okay I'm just gonna stay here because people are gonna come towards where the circle should be so just gonna keep my peepers out for people I can shotgun you know what's better than a bush by itself a bush within a bush this is great look at me no one will suspect a thing okay the storms coming in very slowly so bushes are really rare they are legendary and I don't know how I got to in back-to-back games but I can't waste this one this needs to be the game where I try and get I want to be at least top ten I think that'd be phenomenal okay storms coming in I need to retreat right on the edge I need to watch out for people still making it through but I think we're gonna be fine oh no that is not good why why does it have to be so far away dude there's someone right there they didn't see Ria's the push hahaha you have to suspect all the bushes now though it's really uh it makes you really paranoid I'm watching you over there I'll see you okay someone's died here so I'm guessing there's people nearby I just get my butt moving though shrubbery shrubbery is my friend but I'm still about half way away uh dude there's someone there there's someone right in front of me but I think they've just gone into that Factory I have to move though there's someone right there directly I can get them here we go here we go you ready got him what are they got what are they got what are they got I need a med kit I need whatever you have you got a sniper that's an assault rifle okay I am going to take it and hold jeez I don't know else to grab I'm just gonna get out of here that was mental though it worked oh jeez the storm the storm that is how the bush works guys you don't go aggressive you have to take your time and choose your battles I'm gonna stay quiet now so I can hear what's going on oh it's so close to me it's really close to me okay someone fighting over there I know I need to move in but I need to not be seen I'm such on the edge of the storm no no no no okay I took in damage so my bushes go on quick push me push me okay we good oh we need to run even further guys this is not fair and I know someone's around here push push there's a push down there okay Bush vs. bush how many times have I said bush what was that I thought that was coming for me I feel like 14 is acceptable I need to go top ten though I need to just go for it cuz if I get caught in the storm it will lose my health and then I'll lose the Bush which I don't want to happen the storm has not been nice to me guys we are ten top ten Bush gameplay right here oh my goodness oh my guess I don't know where the storms gonna be next I have enough wood to build if I need to but building makes you then super obvious because bushes can't build the some one right there can you see them they're building above me here we go here we go here we go I have no idea what just happened but this could be my calling if there's no one else around I should be able to grab this stuff this is incredible this is actually incredible here we go here we go here we go to watch no no no no copy over it can't be over no where are you no this is bad this is bad this is bad are we gonna write any to builds bill no no no he's right on the edge oh I thought that was it I was moving in to get the stuff someone died in front of me and then I killed them and then he kills me hahaha I'm gonna see if I find the bush one more time cuz that's too fun the storm was not nice to us in that round really really this is happening this is happening right now really I just got killed by a pickaxe legit got killed by a pickaxe yo did you see that it is pump shotgunned me down to ten health and then I said shot him with a pistol oh my goodness that was insane he must be so mad Bonnie - he'll like quick a the doghouse chest I really like this one okay I'm gonna have to slurp the pump there we go right I'm doing terribly I have no bush and I'm probably gonna die there's Yolo it I need a bush oh man okay okay okay okay yeah we are definitely gonna die I ran out of hell I robbed ammo no why I so had them on the back foot they had okay they had two hundred house okay new game is this gonna have the bush in because we have a crazy good location now it's not it's it's not even it's got great weapons by the way this is the shotgun I talked about earlier its acclaimed to be better than the other shotgun now I'm pretty sure anyway with the patch better than this bad boy here we go boys see what I mean the thing is crazy I took way too much damage then that was bad I hate gold up there let's do this I'm gonna put it in front of here just so no one else can come in give me the bush no okay try number three is there a bush there is not I told you they're rare we have been super lucky so far oh there's another one here yo this is the most gold chest let's go in a game before but still no bush shield potion is pretty good though where's the storm gonna land next okay I dig it okay the supply drops of just started dropping but I don't think there's any near us I'm just checking to see if anyone comes in from the storm nope we're good and the storm brings us ever closer together right there's 19 people left in a quiet game not gonna lie old geez why it's been a quiet game not gonna lie and I need to make my way across so I need to be super careful here don't trust the bushes guys don't trust the bushes oh there's someone there there's some right there I'm gonna have to go in oh that must've been so close I hit them dead on with the pump I shouldn't have gotten running in 45 I was this close to the second shot and there's a bush down there I'm upset number 10 though that makes another top 10 unfortunately I'm running out of time to try and get this record it and also upload it in the same day so I'm gonna leave it here for now I feel like that came with the bush earlier was so fun and shows how good the bush can be so guys I know we can get

So you thought that was the end of the neighbor huh well to be honest, so did I but it turns out I completely Missed that they released hello neighbor mods And they even had a whole competition and everything on December the 8th they revealed the winners And I thought you know what let's go ahead and play some of these hello neighbor mods because I love the game You guys love the game. I also just love modded games too, so the winner was dr.Hello So the winner was Dr.Hello which looks absolutely you know scary second place the subway looks pretty cool as well and third place Which is the one we're gonna start with today is called house designer So as you can see the game looks very normal right wrong there's a zero in the top left hand corner and that means we need some coins because Our house is empty apart from this one random wardrobe where apparently there is a coin which I've now collected So I haven't played this at all it took ages to me to Oh got a coin Took me ages to set up So hopefully it is worth it But I have no idea what to do apart from collect coins buy things for a house And I don't know if we should visit the neighbor as well I believe there's coins hidden in the neighbor's house Which is where the challenge comes from but I also haven't played hello neighbor on PC for so Long so I can't even remember all the controls and stuff. I'm gonna take a banana with me though. Just in case right Let's explore. Oh, what is this? This is a catalog to open press Q gimme could I not grab it? It's saying I can't do it open equals, Q. We do have plenty of coinage out here though, and oh the shop dude Whoa Who is this guy? Look at this dude. Are  you hungry, buddy This looks like I don't even know this looks like the neighbors freaky cousin. Do you want a banana there? You go? I don't think he wanted it.And oh and hello. Who are you? I did not know you were here so I can sell things Q is buy or sell, so I've got a chair for two dollars. I don't know what that is I think it's bread Takeaway cans one of them's three dollars one of them's two for some reason and a toaster for three dollars. We actually have five I'm gonna buy it. Yeah, can I buy the chair? Yes, yes I could buy the chair, okay, let's grab the chair, thank you are we gonna put this in my house. Haha Oh oh...what earth does happen to here? I am ..I've already bought a chair, but it's allowing me to....oh I have no idea What's happening here? I'm gonna place this here and apparently we can oh We sell the neighbors things I can see coins up the top. I'm so confused So confused oh it switches it off. I See that makes so much more sense look. We could just buy all the things inside our house is there anything for three? I need I kind of need a toilet. Don't I everything's pretty expensive thirty dollars for a TV I was gonna say that was expensive actually that isn't so bad. I'm coming to get some coins papa I'm coming in i wander if he's  hiding any coins around here actually can we just pick this stuff up and sell it I'm gonna sell his Chair I'm also gonna grab his TV as well and just um one vars or vase however you say it. Thanks, buddy See you soon if I can get out the door. I'm literally selling all of the neighbors belongings. Hopefully this works You ready nope no. It won't let me sell it unless I do that oh Yeah, it worked Saw it it for one. Oh my goodness. This is hilarious. Oh you you do that press Q, and then it sells it, dude That's assume I'm gonna sell all the neighbors things. Do I only get one coin for everything though What about this glorious TV? Huh? Yeah, just one coin fantastic still though. I really want to know more about this guy He's a little bit freaky a little bit weird there's cameras in here So I can't steer anything and he's just sitting inside a bucket He's like he's like a weird mix between the neighbor and also the guy from getting over it very strange very strange indeed What can I sell that's worth more money or look? This is open already? Let's go it just crashed It just died oh Okay, it's saved. We're good. It looks like all of the coins reset as well So I'm happy with that my chairs disappeared, or did I sell it? I'm not quite sure Oh, let's sell these where did this small doll come from as well. This is so where can I pick it up? I? Can't pick it up. Got this. I can't pick up anything. What's going on I think the game has already glitched out on me again I just want to I just want to put these binoculars down. Please won't let me throw him you have beautiful eyes well I don't know what to do now. He's off. He's out. He's like I need to protect my things. He's so normal. Yes Yes, I am and I'm taking all your coins. Thank you, buddy I can't I can't throw these things and I can't pick up new things either, so I'm not quite sure What I'm gonna. Do I'm gonna activate the catalog real quick, and then I'm gonna buy some things. I have 17 coins I'm gonna like this Yes, it's like I'm playing like hello neighbor crossed with the Sims. It's so weird. I bought a rug Yeah, okay reset the game. I know oh, it's back. I was like I thought I got ripped off I thought he stole all my coins Apparently I found out how to make the most of this game Where did that chair come from that that wasn't here before what's this mysterious blue chair doing here? I've never seen this unless what you buy in the store from the weird clown Creepy getting over it and a Hello neighbour cousin, man. Maybe that was it cuz I definitely bought a chair He's got another chair in stock all the bear traps is this what you sell oh? This is what you sell isn't it I need to get myself What is that a is it a bag of flour a bag of flour is $10 a bear trap is $10? I need to get some of these things Time to harass the neighbor and see what he's saying sir hello, I got me That's why it's crashing if he catches me. It crashes What can we collect for you kind sir that is that looks like a wheel of his car to me? And that's only worth $10 to you. Are you for real? That's gonna be really difficult to get we get a radio and a specific potted plants, I'm Guessing because I could buy these Can I not sell them two of these not the prices? We're gonna find out right radio, or a wheel or a plan let's see if we can find them Can I just take that oh? It's here? It's here. Let me grab. This yes, haha. Please give me coinage I don't want to buy a wheel. I just want to sell it let's see if this works. You ready Hold it. How much did this give me one okay Ripoff? You sir are an absolute ripoff. I wish I knew his name I wonder why he's wearing that weird Bowl as well Why would I buy from here if I can just buy from the catalogue? Huh, right?

I have a bed Oh, there's a coin hiding there. I will take that thank you. Can I just sell all this stuff like all of it I'm gonna sell the chair as well. I can I can literally rinse all this stuff for all the money. That's hilarious I'm confused as to why I would buy this stuff. I don't understand. What's the cheapest thing the toaster. I'm gonna buy this So the toaster that upgrades to the kettle So this is stuff that you can then put in your house on top of the catalogue stuff right yeah? I think so because there's definitely there's a toaster there just been ripped off by this man at least I don't have to pay for my eggs My eggs are just here, and I need to not get caught by the neighbor, but also steal his things This is gonna be like one of the hardest things ever I've also never seen this box before oh It's a shotgun box. I have never seen this That's so cool There's also a no littering sign here literally near every piece of litter in his house Which is also weird no no no, no it wasn't me. It wasn't me. Talk to your cousin about it, buddy I could even sell this For money not gonna lie to you guys this thing has crashed on me like a million times I just want to grab one mannequin and try and sell it and see how much money we get but I can't remember Where the first mannequin is I'm pretty sure it's like in here is It down this way it used to be here right.

raining but doesn't matter you live is staring into my face how you doing buddy welcome back your to the unnamed minecraft is series where we create a village out of nothing which we pretty much don't look at this place it's insane now you guys have been giving me some really cool tips the first one is like don't need to drink this dirty water anymore because actually we have to do one last swig here we go but apparently the goddess water pond gives you clean water oh hello I I thought you'd give me some clean water turns out you don't that's unfortunate hey how you doing by the way nature really is beautiful isn't it it is now we need to have words goddess because last time you gave me two stacks two stacks of strawberries and then you took them off me but I'll forgive you because you gave me a lot of money okay just don't let it happen again because that makes me really upset another tip that you guys gave me is with the hammer to upgrade it we need to get it to eight hundred percent but it's gonna take a while all the bushes are growing nice that's not what I was gonna say I was going to say that you guys said you can just like hit the grass and it does use up durability but doesn't really matter but apparently it makes the percentage go up let's see what happens hopefully it does otherwise I'm just hitting things when a reason nope that doesn't work either you guys are lying to me aren't you you lie in or maybe you just meant this grass could you just like keep mining up grass and then it goes over and over again what does it have to be some kind of mineral or rock it's still under 19% so I think it does have to be some kind of mineral or rock oh yeah I completely forgot we were supposed to do the village regeneration program today I'll have to wait till next time now cuz I've got some plans one of the biggest things is that it's going to change to winter very very soon so you need to make the most of all of these crops because they aren't gonna be around for long um while it's raining actually we can go and upgrade our watering can you also talk you can do this shift and right click to put them all in at the same time you guys just keep lying to me today it doesn't happen yeah I should be able to with all the copper dime which I should have over here there we go I should be able to grab myself a copper watering can because when it's not raining it can do a 3x3 grid at the same time which would be amazing hey buddy how's it going are you open actually I'm not even sure Friday to Wednesday 10:00 to 4:00 you're not fantastic so things are going well so far we've managed to try four or five different things and they all haven't worked so I'm just gonna go and sleep and wake up tomorrow see if we've got any more crops cuz we need to make as much money as possible right now and hopefully autumn doesn't end early because that would be super duper annoying hey eggplants that's what I like to see eggplants are the best we just call this series eggplant that's literally all we should call it wait is this service skeleton in here do you remember it from last time did you guys sort that problem out though you didn't know you didn't you still up there he's right there oh come on why does that have to happen right you live what do we need to work towards today we've got the cafe the church clock maker the fishing hole or the town hall the town hall is a massive 30 mm which is insane I think the cafe is gonna be the best but it's 16,000 because we could probably buy food and stuff from there the church I'm not quite sure what it's gonna do the clock maker I definitely don't know what it's gonna do the Town Hall is so expensive the fishing hole is interesting actually we should go ahead and start trying to fish today I could even buy a diamond fishing rod he's not open today then oh wait that's the miners where's need to go around the corner this is why I needed the regeneration project is there a sign on your there's an a sign hello hello are you up here I literally have lost him he's nowhere to be seen I can't even remember his name where on earth is he gone oh there he is he's like over at the fishing pond it doesn't say a sign on your door buddy we need to add one of those Jacob how's it going buddy right you're open Tuesday to Friday 1:00 till 7:00 Tuesday ages away man loads of people just aren't open on Sundays which is super annoying I feel lost where's my unicycle gone I've completely lost it yeah that was that was 1k well-spent this guy is open okay let's go and see you DeNiro how's it going buddy I can't remember what you sell you sell all the silver ingot for immersive engineering we definitely need to look into that because it seems to be that a lot of these NPCs sell stuff from immersive engineering which I'm not actually sure what it is I want to upgrade my watering can how how do I do that come on and see all of my wares no I want to top this I can do please come back in three days to collect your upgraded tool Oh three days though very three days without watering can DeNiro you're lucky you have a real nice beards because otherwise I'd be very angry three days so Monday Tuesday Wednesday oh man I only took ten of my copper as well and apparently copper ore is fifteen gold each so how much does ten gets to one hundred and fifty so a hundred will get you a thousand it's not that good is it we also need to grab ourselves more animals because winter is coming guys and we're not gonna be able to avoid it it's gonna be horrible it's gonna be fun it's gonna it's not gonna be a good but for us I mean the awkward position oh oh oh he gave me medium milk oh you're a legends an absolute legend that has never happened before so medium milk is worth I think 150 and the small milk is worth a hundred so that's like ages though since we got that cow until now the friendship is what determines how much you get so yeah that actually is a long time threads get medium milk then big milk is 200 G per go that's cool do you know what else we could try and do we could get one of those we could get a leads but we need slime balls for that the problem is I had two leads but they're gone I really want to capture that um tuxedo bunny should we go and see if he's around I have no sword on me but I have a hammer so I should be safe he usually is like around here somewhere hopefully ow geez I'm dying of thirst there is no way I came to get some water and he's just chilling here so we need a lead desperately I don't know if anyone sells one but I really want to capture this guy I don't think there's any other way to get slimeballs is there any other kind of leads that we can grab no that's LEDs I don't want LEDs Oh slimeball or slimming and buckets uh I can make them from this but I don't really want to do that that seems that seems quite that seems quite difficult it'd be handy if the farm guy sold a lead because he does give you animals so he should give you a lead right it's a shame that I've lost mine how's it going buddy are you open you're not when are you open uh 10:00 2:00 or 3:00 Monday to Saturday noise open on a Sunday you're lucky you have a good miss patch as well she's no open on a Sunday either you know what I'm gonna go sleep I'm just gonna do it I'm done I'm done here for this day it's it's a terrible day go 9000 gold which is actually pretty impressive but it's even more impressive because it's breached route de Guise I also actually I need a watering can now oh my gonna see sweet potatoes grew back really quickly as well it's payday we basically need to raise as much money as we can before the winter so that we can buy animals certainly can get their produce I think the best ones are cows and sheep because cows give you milk they give you a hundred bass and then the Sheep give you wool which give you a hundred bass as well whereas the chickens don't actually give you that much I think they do like I think it's like 5060 ish per egg so not terrible but not amazing either actually let's see how much a chicken is cause if we get loads of eggs then that'll be good wouldn't it how much is your chickens they are 1.5 K that's actually quite good isn't it 1.5 K and then we're gonna go and see how much the other animals are when actually since this cow gives us milk every single day we're gonna get big milks every well medium milks every day that's awesome well we could actually do is buy another chicken and get one of the pregnancy things and then buy a sheep that's what we could do but the pregnancy thing takes ages I think it takes like a week for them to be able to actually give you milk which could be a problem I also need a house like desperately I think I'm gonna buy a sheep guys I think the sheep's cost like five thousand those I'm gonna grab a sheep I then must need some kind of shears as well are there any kind of special shears the end of shears long grain sheep shearing okay so no but she sells things in the cafe that's crazy long range sheep shearing that's hilarious I think the cafe is only gonna build next but we need 16000 110 smooth stone and 200 wood so it's gonna be a little bit of a project buddy you kind of bleeding me dry here because I need animals I also need watering can and I kind of remember what else a fishing rods today is going to be an expensive day and I can't buy anything from him for two days but I need to buy a watering can offer you buddy every day of the week except Thursdays from 10:00 okay I think I can buy one from him at 10:00 otherwise I am completely done for come on come on come on yes shop perfect right I'm gonna buy 500 that's actually really cheap disaster averted I forgot I had these you know they have two days until they grow that's actually amazing so we have even more sweet potatoes right let's work this out shall we let's shop and let's see how much this is gonna cost me a sheep is 4k so it's actually better to have sheep than cows because sheep are cheaper but give you the same amount of money so sheep a hundred percent better one of these carrots do their horse upgrades in speed jump health and type that's that's cool on lead after purchase yes bye I got myself a sheep oh this is great he's got one armor look at his little face he's looking beautiful I'm gonna go and capture myself ain't nope you stay in there I'm gonna go capture a silver rabbit is he still there yes he is oh jeez I'm so happy hopefully you can actually grab rabbits on leads cuz I want this guy he's only got 33 health we need to keep him safe come this way buddy that's what I'm talking about yes I kind of want him to get the googly eyes as well I think they'll be amazing I think he will suit being right next to the goddess pond him and the goddess can kind of be in coots and help us out please don't lose any kind of health because I'll be severely upset guys look the new member to our village its tuxedo rabbit I found him in the first-ever and now he's finally going to be with us do I have any kind of fence I don't but that is okay how do I make these again I always forget how to make all these things because they changed the recipes from the originals so I'm always so confused right this way come on buddy you're going over to the goddess ponds don't worry it's gonna be fine be absolutely fine please don't drown I don't think I can actually give him extra health so I'm just gonna have to put him here I hope that he had she does survive but areas guys the tuxedo rabbits has finally been told jeez he's gonna drown isn't he what are you doing you're literally gonna drown it's only one block hi he should be okay if not he might die but you know it's fine oh my goodness he's gonna die but at least we captured him I need some shears to try out my sheep one thing I just realized his cows will give you stuff every single day but sheep might not switch could be a little bit worrying because then I've wasted four grand on a sheep that doesn't give me much stuff sheep oh there you are geez a fourth I'd left you there we go so that is one piece of small wool all Jesus bees in here the real question is does that grow back every single day I have no idea there's only one way to find out BAM we should get a lot of money today like a lot oh I need to speak to this guy quick and you see your shop I need to buy I don't need any of this stuff do I I don't know why you'd build your own mine oh look at this I own drill head that would be quite cool a mining backpack so you can have more inventory space and dynamite which is a little bit crazy I'm just gonna buy one of these just in case I go down into the mines today you're gonna close and I need to get to the fishing dyers well how much your where's buddy how much don't close the door on me oh no Tuesday to Friday I forgot about that bye I think I'll save that for another episode because we don't really need to fish just yet fishing is another great way to be able to make money in the winter because that's what we're kind of preparing for what else was I gonna buy four thousand you know what let's just see how much money we get when we sleep sweet potatoes almost ready as well so hopefully they grow we've got eight thousand five hundred s it's raining yay the sheep's hair hasn't grown back guys you have disappointed me not quite sure what to do about that I guess we can't afford another cow and when we do the regeneration project in the next episode what we can do is make sure that we have enough space for more animals because at the moment it's not looking too great is it mr. chicken how long does it take for this to grow back oh I've just done some research on my aminals bad news this sheep is only going to produce well every four days I kid you not and they also need to be brushed every single day good news is that the they can actually be increased in their productivity by giving them treats which I did not know also the cows do not need to be brushed every single day which is even better because that is pretty long especially when you've got more cows so it actually means that cows are way better of a produce than the sheep's so we need to try is giving them more treats because with the treats apparently they can produce milk up to five times a day you know how much money that is it's a lot of dying money so I just need to wait until 10:00 a.m. to buy some treats and then we'll test this Jim just in time I keep hearing the skeleton in here he's still in here isn't he where is he out the bees okay it is time so we don't need photo cuz we're growing that cows a 5k so I can't actually afford another cow which I think I'm going to do treats here we go sheep treats Cowell treats they're the same price it takes 24 Cowell treats and 7 generic treats per level up to a total of five products I don't actually know what that means but if I buy 10 cow trees so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten that will give me I'm trying to do maths because obviously if you're giving them so many treats and you're only getting so many back it's not actually going to benefit you is it so one treats and then we're gonna have to try and milk it each time two treats oh you can't actually give them treats oh I see so you give them treats per day and then they'll start producing more and then I'm not quite sure but as well the sheep will give you more wool each time you level it up may I'm just gonna try and give them as much as I can I mean this is this is pretty confusing brush.you every day even though you don't give me enough produce you take ages to brush how much hair do you want come on buddy you can't take that much brushing you just used my brush so upset I need to buy a brush from you now eight hundreds my money is going down like crazy right we need to buy a cow as well I think I'm just gonna do it I'm just gonna buy a cow there we go cow activated boom I'll take the lead off you thank you cuz I might need that later how's it going guys I'm gonna spread the love spread the love I also need to extend this I know it's gonna be a little bit crazy in here for a bit but don't worry it's gonna be fine it's gonna be absolutely fine I'm gonna brush you all it's gonna be amazing don't push me give me your milk perfect I'm stealing all that milks so inserts all the cows giving me three hundred and fifty per day which doesn't sound like much when you get the crops like this which we're not gonna have in winter I'm actually really worried I don't know how I'm gonna survive try reciting queer gonna die of hunger and have no money not gonna be a fun time at all I think I'm gonna sleep because yeah I'm gonna sleep because I think I get money and then I can also get my sweet potatoes and I can also get my watering can back which is exactly what I need I'm gonna miss you eggplants I'm really gonna miss you there we go sweet potatoes what I could do which is actually really bad is I could hibernate through winter you know like animals that you go to sleep for the whole winter because they don't like it well I could do that too but because I don't have any money makers apart from my cows and stuff it's an option I'm just saying it's an option so one treat a day one fodder a day I don't need to brush you I just need to I just need to milk you I do we need to brush you the Sheep rats you know I regret buying you I'm sorry in the nicest possible way I regret buying you milk you that's the big milk this is another milk this is another milk can i milk anymore no no icon or if there's like a cool-down period maybe because you definitely can milk them more than once a day I just don't know how oh you got my watering can yeah I do you realize that would come back look at this thing we've got a copper watering can which means I think we can water a three by three grid every single time I don't know if it holds more water either but we can't quite you know try it out because it's raining a lot good to see that the tuxedo rabbit is still alive because I'm gonna be constantly worried about this guy actually know what I feel like I need a little bit of a change of a change of outfit yeah wait you live what are you doing you live oh he was stuck in San did you see that huh oh my goodness what's why is he changed he's not God tuxedo anymore no this is unacceptably has got a monocle though so it's a little bit more acceptable but what happened to the tuxedo rabbit I'm so upset or what has happens I got changed into a tuxedo and he feels like he can't be the same as me so he just gets the monocle and stuff and a pipe hi this this game this pack is just so unreal it's hilarious well that was a little bit of a change wasn't it that's crazy I still can't test out my watering can either cuz it's raining look at all these cows there's so many cows oh no no no why are you doing why are you dying why are you dying I have a lead I have a lead where is it here it is come here stop dying come here jeez what is wrong with you guys you can't just be in the wall like that really these guys first and tuxedo rabbit changes and then disappears from view and then my cows stop teleporting through walls things are getting a little bit too crazy for my liking whereas he god oh no he's broken he's broken free tuxedo rabbit tuxedo riot Jacob have you seen him why is this happening to me where is he oh no no no no no no no no no no no no as he died did did he die succeed or did you die no this can't be happening the only one he's been here since day one I bring him to the goddess Pond and he drowns in it Jacob why won't you keeping an eye on him this is the saddest day it's a very sad day we could have to find a replacement now if only I had my unicycle ha ha remember where I left it uh I really don't and I know there's a skeleton in here so I really need to be careful don't mind if I do yeah Jenny it's a sad day I have lost your favorite animals the pigs no I don't care I'm sorry I've just lost a close friend where is your boyfriend know who is it where is your significant other I need to buy a vehicle where is he an outer stinks it's fine to wear the googly eyes you're so insensitive and so are you you have you your silly googly eye but what why I'm sure there are rabbits over this way and I'm pretty sure at least says the donkey is back up just in case where are all the rabbits is that Bo this is bone what's that's crazy I've just remembered where my unicycle when I lost it at the bottom of a ponds didn't I completely forgot about that I can't find any rabbits anywhere I can't find a replacement I'm sad people who've gone missing the rabbit has gone missing my soul has now gone missing I don't know where everyone is where is the guy who sells the cars and stuff he's gone the question is where is he gone and why and it's so dark and rainy another lead over here as well why don't all these leads keep coming from just gonna try and sleep it off and see what happens look a fuse at least I made some money today and it's eggplant day okay I'm feeling a little bit better at myself and I can test up my brand-new watering can as well we just need as much money as we can to get through these winter months because winter is coming in the next couple of days all of these crops are gonna die and we're gonna be left cold hungry and partly alone because the the rabbit died so it's not all bad at least I could hold right click to put all my eggplants into the shipment box I mean it could be a much worse day I just want to look over there and see him again but he's just not there at least you guys are all cozy in there not killing yourself right before I go new watering can at Kapaa yes Kapaa ok this isn't as good as I thought it was gonna be it does like 1 in 3 I thought it was gonna do like all three okay it's actually not that bad look at this yes you can do sideways or the other way yeah okay this is good I like it I like it a lot and then we can like level this up as well it goes up really quickly goes up like a percent almost every time but you started so up great oh there you are no way that's not the right guy is here there he is oh there he is quick catch him catch him what vehicles shall we buy next a car is a hundred thousand a plane or a glider is obviously a hundred thousand hot-air balloon multicolored car cop car wagon the wagon could be fun but it's ten thousand I need to save money right now I think the unicycle is gonna have to come back but I'm gonna have to decide next time because we haven't got any money I've lost a tuxedo friend and things just get a little bit scary before winter it's literally gonna be two days to winter maybe evil one maybe even tomorrow who knows but winter is coming so guys I hope you enjoyed this video I know we didn't get a ton done but we got some preparations ready for the next change in season next time I promise the village renovation project 2018 is going to happen it's gonna look beautiful around it just in time for winter to raise spirits and stuff so if you're excited and you

guys today is a big day not because I got a brand new apartment but because today we're gonna find out more secrets from hello neighbor I just realized we calling the neighbor all the time we don't actually know his name that'd be pretty cool especially be something like Jeff oguns allas or Pedro something something like that hey welcome back a - hello neighbor where today we are playing at the full Reese on xbox as always but this time we are starting axe 3 and where we left off last time was literally here in a brand new apartment we just woken up for a dream and listen yeah we're locked in but hey you know what we just need to figure out how to get out what is that on the floor that's an that's an apple core ok that's a little bit disgusting should probably put that in the bin but for now I'm gonna throw it at my door and rage I'm stuck oh we've got eggs I wonder how they taste what is going on in here there's something moving why are you moving that's so I guess we should look in here as well this is our bathroom fantastic that is not looking like a healthy toilet right there but that's a pretty disgusting bath as well so where do we need to go if we can't get out where do we where do we even go there's nothing here to collect we've got we got binoculars we've got a can we've got I guess the TV remote oh it works it actually works the TV's broken but at least they work fridge help me out here buddy that's that's not gonna help me at all we have is that an apple it's kind of like it's through the back of the fridge that's so weird yeah super chill I still don't know where I need to go but you know what as long as I got this music playing a feeling good oh we ring for help let's see we ring for help hello hello hello I need help please listen to this music how come I can put someone on hold of this music stop stop this is a serious situation I'm stuck my phone is now broken one I than my supposed to do oh oh it's this this is a letter dude how do I not spot that before hello ah here we go that says a whole lot of oh it said evicted I'm getting evicted I already just got this apartment is it cuz I broke the phone is that why there we go I'm just pack up all our things let's take a book let's take two books take two of our books let's take pretty much nothing else because there wasn't anything in that wardrobe and an apple that should help us to survive make sure you take the milk though you have to steal the milk yeah it's like might as well take this Apple because I've got nothing else left to live for what are you doing let's get out of here let's go trekking it's the neighbor that owns my my flat and evicted me just that I could move next to him so that he could terrorize me I think that might be a good theory here we go there's a bird oh geez I remember this so this is where we drive up to our new house right I'm pretty sure that's a weird place name I wouldn't choose to live there to be honest I'd have a pretty cool car though I like it a lot like the color I love the colors of just this whole game in general it looks amazing there we go oh it's not even built and I've bought this how much did I pay for this like ten dollars a heap insane I guess we're about to find out it looks like the the neighbor's house isn't actually built yet we're playing what happened to the neighbor's house dude it's a wreck oh why can't you go up to it oh it's gonna happen it's getting creepy vibes he's been following me I just realized [Music] who is that who is that oh jeez Oh send a man is that you what's going on run back to your house buddy go you've got this you've got this please don't no it's only a short way one earth was that but what I was about to say is I just realized we've jumped way forward in time we've gone from being a young boy into a young man now so the neighbor the first two encounters with the neighbour are long gone now so if he buys the house next to me let's leave we're done he seeked me out just so that he could move next to me when I'm older that's weird I'm gonna leave that alone now and look a brand new house I'm so proud do I have the keys not sure I have the keys where's our bell ringing oh it's the phone the phone right I'm gonna guess that the keys are in here there it is give me the key thank you very much and let's go in here I seem to have left my bag behind as well I did only pack two books and an apple to be fair so let's see what earth is gonna happen in here it's really dingy it kind of looks a bit bendy ish not gonna lie I've got a picture of myself which is nice so I have no friends oh something's creeping me out dude something is creeping me out so I answer the phone hello no this is creepy guys this is too creepy oh there's definitely someone watching me who is it well we know who it is I mean it's the neighbour but why okay he's just it's moving day you should be happy act 3 okay we haven't even started act 3 yet and they're screaming which isn't nice wait we what dudes did you fall you get beat up by baby I think you might be so why is the same situation happening again all guys look that's the car and he's crashed it into his fence is that what's going on here now this is the house do we recognize right and this is when we don't recognize this must be the house that we just bought we did pretty well for ourselves you saw what it looked like just a minute ago we have done pretty well we got multiple rooms it's looking good I recognize this is this the house from before I don't know what's going on but we're dreaming a lot and the neighbors involves that can't be good right okay let's see what you're up to what have we got here we've got a lot of stuff that we kind of just acquired because we know we didn't move of any of this stuff binoculars fantastic couldn't do with a flashlight though right so this house has the tracks with the bus thing that goes around the train I'm gonna call it a roller coaster because we saw the roller coaster before and that was pretty magical okay he's not spotted me he has not spotted me has he oh he didn't spot me that's fine huh what is he doing did you shoot someone okay he's trying to get through that door and he's not doing a very good job is he he's kicking the door he's pushing the jaw he's done a good job right this is the door that we do recognize a lot now I wonder if this is going to be the act with all the minigames in because before we had to do mini games to unlock super powers to allow us to actually do stuff in the house it's so dark oh my goodness Oh oh no sorry whoa okay it got a lot lighter that's so much better hmm let me grab one of these real quick I just need a plates it's all I need I just want to distract this Punk so that we can go exploring we've

experienced that before is he coming up he isn't that's good so the water room is exactly the same so we need to freeze this bad boy we've done this before but what are you throwing at me always down there okay I just need to open this quickly open it open it there we go so we've got this room as well which is to do with the Train a big old blue room with an exit down to the roof ah oh my goodness you jumped on me quick go go go on ahead up here this is yes okay this is exactly the same how on earth do I get over there do I need to really box up there I hated doing that so much and then there's this fake painting as well problem is I have like no boxes with me so I don't know how I'm gonna do this actually wait a second I might have just done this here we go know if any of you have played hello neighbor you will know that the boxes are the most annoying thing in the game more annoying than the neighbour and that's saying something I think I'm I've made it though here we go Jase No really come on stay tall stay tall do not wobble please don't wobble I need this to be stable oh geez right let's go for it no look at that it's the perfect tower no I'm building body I need to go down here don't I I think that's where I need to go oh please please oh oh I thought I'd ruined that okay let's go here I should be able to do this okay I'm on the roof I did not mean to do that that's annoying how'd she tell me to go up here but I've never been up here oh no what if I do this and then a hot yeah I need this mannequin thank oh geez really really you're just gonna just gonna be in my face like that are you right we need to not assume that everything is the same because it probably ain't wait what's in here there's a torch right in my face and loads of boxes see before that was a tennis ball firing machine that was stopping the door from opening its mannequins really annoying okay think he's just found me so let's let's release this I'm gonna put this down cuz you're annoying me I know you look sad but I don't feel sorry for you let's get this thing a moving I don't remember how but let's press this lever and hopefully something will happen big red button

just get up here let's just get up here and this should be over right let's see if this train will take us somewhere new ah this is different so we need a wrench again to be able to get onto the roof that's good because that means we don't need to keep jumping on that stupid train and if ever again I'm just gonna run down the track because I want to spend time in each location right we do need the gramophone we knew that what's down here we have got we've got this weird room here which I owe the gramophone is there should we just grab it I think this is the one that's I don't know which one this is I think it's the one that grows things right I think so but I'm not sure why you would want to grow things I think it's maybe to block all the moon door is there as well it's kind of giving you a clue about the chair isn't it cuz you need to open this block it with the chair and then you're good but it's not nighttime man it's really difficult to see I kind of want to jump onto this Oh got him we also have this with the code at the end we have this weird little room here which is now blocked up that used to have a door there and then we're back here okay things have got interesting we've got escalators elevators whatever you want to call them I'm gonna unbreak this door unblock that door even there we go we're now free I wish I had Oh cake yes no I wish I had a flashlight that'll be much better right the happy birthday thing still happens this still spins rounds let's unblock as many doors as we can just we can explore this house loads and I feel like you might be near me what happens if I turn this off turn it off there we go haha I don't know what I did but is gone and this leads underneath his glue stash interesting ah yes this is what I need a car remember why I need it but I might need it to grab a wrench I guess can I have this please yes gotcha there's also a lever there oh we get some blood in so many things cuz we can get through our weight on the other side okay let's just open this bad boy there we go we are learning so many things that we've just known from doing this so many times I'm gonna throw my milk was it this picture it was it certainly was he's put down bear traps as well the sneaky Punk right anything different about this parts we have doors blocked absolutely everywhere so we can now get in from here okay unblock this one perfect there we go we have ourselves right this is where we need to put the globe we need to grab the globe first I'm just looking for any other kind of keys or secrets or anything like that because I'm not

The burning question on everyone's lips: 'did the pug grow?' Well, as you can see, (come close, come close). The pug has grown! The water has got murkier, but the pug has definitely grown. But, um we need to see this guy out of the jar, but I didn't really think on how to get him out of the jar, So I had a genius idea: Chopsticks. Let me see if I can fish this guy out. Ew. I Thought it was gonna be squidgy. It's not, it's not at all. Oh. Oh. (in the background a dog barks) Ohh! Look at this thing! *laugh* That's disgusting! Oh my goodness, what's wrong with its face? Look at it! It has like, if you come around to the side, look! Look at it's underbite! His tongue is proper poking out! Now, because I'm an idiot, I didn't take a picture of how small it was when it started, but this is the packaging. If you compare it. It says it was gonna get to like six times the size. I think that's, I think that's close! This is like the size of the original pug. I think, maybe not six times the size, but it's definitely bigger. I think you were supposed to leave it for 72 hours, which is like three days and we left for four, It's looking pretty good, and also, ( Ellie and Darcie's barking continues) Extremely slimy, it's literally like it's just been born! It's kind of gross, but yeah, that was our experiment! Can you grow yourself a pug? Sure! Would it do much? No. Is it gross? Yeah... 
Yeah, that's right now back at it again troll face quest  now troll face quest videogames is one of the best Ones that we played there back with a brand new game, this only drops either today or yesterday I can't remember But it's brand new only 500 people have downloaded it as of today So we are gonna play through it right now and even like the title screen is hilarious PlayerUnknown's...Troll...Battle Grounds. I'm ready. You ready? No. What? Okay. Let's do this. Hopefully I know more of the video games this time because last time I feel like I didn't know many of them Which is really bad, cuz? I'm a gamer. Okay, this one. I definitely know this is isn't this the talking tom like the weird cat game I'm not sure I was supposed to be weird But it did end up being weird we also have to collect these frying pans Which I think items from the the troll face quest battlegrounds game. That should be out soon anyway. Let's start doing What are you doing? Take the paper? You need the paper desperately? What is it lets us see what this button does oh? my goodness oh You didn't just fail the level he felt something else my goodness hmm What could he need to do? I'm trying to look for stuff that kind of stands out? Talking Tom's usually talking to me not not pooping in front of me. So this is a new experience for me We press it once He squeezes press it twice he does it and then fails which I'm not she I don't know what to do I already leveled one and I'm stuck and trying the old pinch Maneuvered remember that from the previous games that seemed to work before but at the moment Not really working is it it's not working at all Oh? Oh, Oh, what's happening? I don't know what I did. I just kept shaking I Just kept scraping my finger across the screen, but I'm you know I'm not complaining. It won't let move on okay. This is um This is a water slide. I'm not a hundred percent sure what game this is gonna be let's see There he goes I think he missed the pool yeah He definitely missed the pool is this like a roller coaster tycoon game there must be something we can change Exactly in classic trollface quest style dive straight into the toilet get flushed, bug What okay with this did we win We did yeah, I have no words. Ah this is tomb raider, okay, so Trollface tomb raider let's press the golden trollface Nothing happens Tomb Raider kicks the golden troll face in the face It's not very nice is it there has to be something that the golden troll face can do to be able to stop Tomb Raider kicking him in the jaw oh my goodness oh my goodness oh My goodness what happened to Tomb Raider? And now surely she can't jump through now oh My goodness you could fly okay, okay, maybe was gone There you go troll face. I saved you from inevitable doom. Oh, dude. It's the akinator I completely forgot about this guy look at his brown trail of course. He's coming out of a toilet um Do I eat burgers yes, what yes, I do I do eat burgers have I used toilet paper today No, no I haven't there is it a fly no, it's not a fly What are you doing I always thought you were smart you are not smart you're just the toilet genie Okay, so let's say no to everything and let's see what happens there must be something else to this avoid achievement poop inator okay fantastic What about if I say yes to everything here? We go here we go He still comes up with the same thing. Can I just flush you I can't oh. Oh oh I Can't get out of you punk. Wait a second. What is this? You're gonna make me watch an ads. What's the beer in the troll cinema to unlock the next level What's fine yarn? I did what you wanted now. Let me go to the next level Oh What game is this I feel like I've seen it before is it destiny. Maybe I'm not a big player of those I'm not too sure Looks pretty awesome. Though. I'm intrigued by this. Oh, it's a frying pan I thought was an eyeball we have a scary-looking woman and a man with a pretty incredible bunch in Let's just see what happens when we tap them. Oh wait is this halo. It could be halo All this happened is he's covered his face. Let's have her She's indestructible no way Okay, we need to find another way to destroy bat lady ah No, no you guys supposed to do that no stop stop. Stop. It doesn't work his face So you can put his visor down? But can you do anything else can he get smaller? I don't know why you'd want him to be smaller and trying to do the pinches all the time doing the pinches anything hidden from behind No kind of swapped him out someone else not luck She can never remember how to defeat a dragon lady. I reckon there's a way that we can change his gun or something I'm just gonna kick it up Of course of course I need to get back into the mindset of trollface quest But how does this help us defeat a dragon lady, or are we on the side of the dragon lady who knows he's still going? Yes Behind every super hero is a man shivering in his heart-shaped pants, or you have a brother that is ripped Oh my goodness. Oh hold in a week. We we gotta kick this guy is this a pan it certainly is I don't know if I want to kick this guy look at his face. He looks so defenseless. You know others do it anyway HA! what game is this? What game is it when you kick a small person into the atmosphere? horrific oh I really wanna help this dude get revenge Come on. He's been over for some reason. This is not gonna work, buddy. You're literally making his job easier Can I not just hold him to make him a bit more just aggressive? Can I pop this guy his muscles? No, okay, right? We're gonna go for a big kick and see what happens just brace oh Oh, no. Oh, that's the most uncomfortable thing I've ever seen Now what do I do know what? He's got a small person attached to his foot for life Awkward, but saved the little guy so our mission is complete oh
My goodness is his little nightmares isn't it I recognized the yellow Like overalls you guys still want me to play that so I guess I should at some point hmm Tiny person again some cups and some meat Hmm why do you look so scared oh? Okay, that's why you look so scared. Why is it telling me to press this? Why would you tell me to do that you you help me kill the little person okay, big scary I don't even know baby man appears, and I'm gonna try and take your lollipop. Can I have it please no? Okay, what could I do to you? I don't want you to fall backwards. Let's flick you forwards nope have to take the meat take the meat you don't oh, I Always knew you as a musician look at his beady little eyes Is that it did I win Yeah That was weird. I don't even know what I did. I just like Preston hold which if in doubt IVA pinch Reverse pinch or click and hold I like the colours of this one. Let's see what happens is a toilet a palm tree and a guy on a motorcycle Wait is this what? Are you doing? You can't just do that? Well you said oh, it's uh, it's Vice City, I thought it was just from like the colors and stuff I really thought it was it is didn't say I guess we need to do something While he comes along is he is he gonna enter hello, okay? You just go up this tree go up the tree go up the tree. Yes Yes, haha Success. Oh, what is he doing? The longest tree in the world, this is the weirdest game ever so I can play it I actually did and now I have to watch another add to unlock the next level Hold on a second. How many levels are there in total? There's 32 so we've got one two three four five six seven more levels to do. We've better hurry up hey It's flappy birds. Flappy bird is already a classic. I don't even know how long ago That was that was a thing, but it's gonna be burnt into my mind forever Let's see that's actually that's a giant phone or again a very very small person how okay? What are you doing? What are you doing? Yeah, right? How can we make this guy win be the ultimate flappy bird champion okay? His face changed a little bit and that is why? because his bird is Stupid hmm. What would make you better at flappy bird bigger eyes Smaller Birds bigger phone not sure you need a bigger phone to be honest seeing a thumb bigger thumb bigger thumb I have no idea what this one could be I'm trying to tap the bird loads of times if you can even call that a Bird guys. I'm really suck on this one. It's hint time I did this before I held this before but how long do you have to hold it for oh my goodness Haha, okay. I did hold it for that long geez Flappy troll face is not a game I would like to play you can have to get a new phone every single time. Are you kidding me? Can you can you stop? Let's move on. Oh Jesus in Monument Valley so Monument Valley is like it's an isometric Almost in an optical illusion kind of game, and I mean this guy is but his mouth is extraordinarily large What are you doing?

I have to have a green cloud. Oh Wow okay I have no idea what game, this is actually is this the game That's on mobile, which is about a well a shark and weapons, and he has to like destroy everything I'm not even sure what it's called, but I remember seeing it.

Let's see what and shall we destroy him What's doing? You can't fight a shark like this especially when there has Rockets attached to its side. Are you kidding me? Okay? Level fails okay, these fish are picking on me, and I am NOT Happy about it so apart from weaponizing my shark to the max What else can I do he's not using his weapons they just like bite my tail and stuff And then he doesn't use any of his missiles just blow him up. Just kill him oh The old pinch the old Reverse pinch worked so it turns out They're not in the ocean at all this guy's in a tiny goldfish bowl If you could get sharks that small that'd be incredible. What is this guy gonna do those? Okay oh All three fish you decided to eat the coolest one that you own poor choice my friend poor choice Okay, this one looks like it's a game called papers, please I think it's where you pretty much work as this border control, and this guy right here He's looking real shifty is it gonna work no You are not allowed in do not come into our country But I failed the level maybe I need to try in and maybe I play as two shifty looking guy Trying to get in what could I do? oh You turn to the side, oh wait wait He's hit man put your head on the scanner do it There we go That's clever, that's so clever.

Today marks the start of an important mission operation save mah friend I'm in my outfit I'm ready to go apparently I changed my sleeves which I didn't realize I've got a cape on actually I have you know two capes on because I'm that serious about this rescue so you don't know last time we sent you live on a building mission and He never came back. He's oh ... Did you hear that? Did you you probably can't because of the stupid rain, but I just heard Someone building so my plan is today We're gonna try and find Yulif because the good news is that in this mod So if someone dies then they respawn in the morning, which hasn't happened Which means Jade Jade that Yulif is dead cuz otherwise? They would have respawned So my plan is to literally dig down to find him how you doing wolf punk? Oh oh my goodness there's two of them That's why Trayaurus is staring at them plants are looking good as well. We got a decent amount of money I can't remember what we need to build next because Yulif is a Disappeared let's see if we can find him. I'm just just a little bit worried III can hear him I'm pretty sure but he's so far down. I don't know what to do about it Let's remove these trees before he does that we can actually get the wood for it Then we're gonna do our rescue mission I heard it I heard it right here. Yulif I'm coming to save you buddy. Where are you oh? That could be it that could be this could be the easiest mission ever Yulif! Yulif are you? yes He must be down here This is different Yulif i'm digging you out, buddy I'm coming to save you this thing must be really really deep yes. Yulif. He's down here somewhere I knew he hadn't died kind of I just want to see your beautiful face Just to know that you're safe, but he should be reaching the surface soon right because he's close okay He hasn't made it to here yet I Don't know. Where is oh? Yes, Yulif. What's good. Oh, my goodness I found him. How's it going buddy? We were worried about you Well easiest rescue mission ever completes We only had to dig down a few little spaces? That's actually cool, so I'm guessing because Enough blocks for him to physically you know be there cuz you need to high blocks He just disappeared, but it looks like he's making good progress, so we need this to finish And if you haven't seen it yet this is going to be the mining hut which I'm really really excited about because that means we can get ores and I think that's pretty much it I'm fairly sure it is very own dimension as well and to finish our blacksmith mission Which is what we started to build ow last time we need to go visit the miner So we need to go and do that when it is finished. I'm so glad we've found him already I feel like I put on this outfit for nothing now wasn't really I just needed to be patient I didn't kind of think about though. I'm so happy to see your face buddy you have no idea look at this work He's doing though it's gonna look awesome, right? I'm sure we have some chores to do you don't normally like being outside oh my I'm feeling fatigued already. No. I'm thirsty, okay That's fine. Let's do what we came to do. We've got to brush these Punk's You know feed them do all the normal things milk them to get some money I'm sure we're gonna be able to build ourselves a new a new building soon even though We've only just built two, but I'm sure we could build another one what's good chicken. Thanks for the egg How you doing put you down? You've got enough food which is perfect nice. They're the only animals we have at the moment Hey, buddy. I haven't seen you around for a while the rescue mission was successful I know he's got his back to him. So it doesn't really matter right? Let's grab these we don't have to me to water anything because it is raining Which is perfect all these done as well money money money money money So the grass I'm still not sure about the grass it says 11 out of 11 But I'm not quite sure What is happening with them? We also got all these eggplants and stuff, too We've got the wheat which is very very close to being done five days What am I supposed to do with the grass? I'm seeing if you guys put a comment on the previous video on how to do it Okay, apparently that is all it does all it does is give you fodder, and I think it can grow a little bit higher Okay, maybe not it's just died. It's just died well You know what getting loads of fodder isn't necessarily a bad thing to be honest a bad thing is I am well I'm I'm all fatigued and stuff right let's put these in here fodder will only give us one per Thing so, that's terrible, but we can pop it over here so our cows actually have food for days which is goods I don't actually need these berries, but I'm gonna eat them anyway And I think we just need to go to sleep and reap the rewards. We just need you left to finish over there It's getting pretty dark as well, so I'm a little bit worried Things are looking good feeling good. I want to go mining because I haven't done much of that yet. How much money do we get 3,200 legendary absolutely legendary hey the sweet potatoes are done as well. This is the best season so far This wheat should give us loads of money when it's done as well. I actually cannot wait Okay, sweet potatoes go in there eggplant goes in there. We could probably get some more crops I just need to make a bigger farm is he done oh Jeez, there's a creeper right there. It's bothering him um Okay, what am I supposed to do about this you live I'm coming to save you buddy rescue mission part 2 oh No, I heard you somewhere. Where are you? Where are you? Are you kidding me? How did you get me from over there? It's throwing things What are you doing? How do you do that? No, this is unacceptable Actually unacceptable oh my goodness threw things at me Oh jeez there's a'm be swell, and I'm hitting my unicycle. This is not good, right Let's go and grab you lift some help shall we because this is not good is it okay? You know if it's fine coming up stop him stop him. I hope this you know what there we go I was gonna say hopefully this isn't the guy who just turned into a zombie because that would be a little bit horrific. Okay I think we're done here. We need to make this go away, and we're here check it out I think the gravel is supposed to be there. Hey buddy Brandon. What's good yeah hello there I just been down the mine and well. It was pretty terrible since you got me in this town. I may as well Just give you the junk that I found take it. I don't want it. What did you give me you gave me copper? Oh, okay. Uh thank you I think we've also got iron ore and smooth stone in here that is Perfect feel like you'll if made a bit of a mere earnest to be honest Is there a way we can go down any further? I'm not too sure right miners We're selling goods Monday today 11 until 4:00. I swear You'll if went really deep down unless he just oh geez unless. He just got really stuck can I sell copper I can oh? I don't know if I want to do that though maybe I do uh I put some things away cuz I've got way too much stuff on me right everything is a little bit of a mess right now Absolutely fine though. I need to go and see the blacksmith I think because he said that I need to go and see the mining guy which I've now done Aye sir, how's it going DeNiro? I completely forgot your name always happy to settle some fine tools I want to chat to you. If you haven't even upgrade just bring me iron percent or some gold and something to upgrade with Okay What do you so again you so ingots? You don't sell or and guessing I can just sell or to the Harvest Festival. Let's talk to oh He's gone there He is how you doing Brandon if I wasn't into mining I'd probably choose all three rocks not sure why three though What's your favorite ice cream? I? Don't like this guy I don't like you already Brandon you leave me you're my least favorite villager does have some pickaxes I could steal I just want to check what's underneath his house. I feel like there should be something underneath here Is there really not I? Really wanted to see what was underneath here Brandon. I need to wait so oh, it's 11:00 already okay, Brandon. That was fine Hello, sir minerals right here shop so mine floor mine ladder mine wool escape rope An iron drill head what on earth? apatite or iron boar a head a backpack Dynamite and and all kinds of I don't know how to use this dudes. Why would I build a mine? Do you not just find a mine Brandon? I'm super confused by you right whenever I'm down the mines are our cheese. You know what? Useless time to read okay, so I've had a look and I apparently need to build a mining Hill. How's it going, buddy? You're gonna sell me something else to K32 smooth stone, buddy see you in a bit. I'll go get some smooth stone Here is my cobble stone farm you thought this was all about farming crops and stuff right you thought wrong also Apparently when he gets to winter your crops Don't grow nothing grows in winter So you have to rely on fishing and also just your animals and stuff for money, which is gonna be difficult Which is why once get the mining thing going just in case It's way more powerful than just with animals who don't actually have that many animals yet I think that's actually quite a cool little task you know having it so that you are forced to not use any kind of Plants whatsoever. I think that's quite cool I'm gonna have to steal some coal from the blacksmith because I don't have much sorry buddy. Sorry. I'm coming in How's it going nice to meet you see you later? It's collar to leather as well, which is awesome should probably make some armor soon Just because I desperately need some or do you want to talk about well um well these uh? You don't wanna talk about anything. It's all and what are you guys doing? You just what is going on here? How did you even get behind there you guys okay? Everything chill goods goods I definitely need more space if I am going to make this a little bit of a better Farm because at the moment there's literally no space whatsoever I think I might extend it outwards because you need to bring them outside and inside all the time I'm assuming winters gonna be pretty harsh, so if I'm gonna need to rely on animals. I need to save up a ton of money Buy some animals and go from there. Let me see how much animals are actually how's it going buddy. What's what's good So you can buy a 5k or you can do the miracle potion 5k for a cow for K for a sheep? man dudes Expensive chickens though they might be a little bit cheaper I can't actually find out cuz she's closed, but then I need an incubator if I want to actually hatch chickens So I need to try that out I--listen need to see how much copper ore is because I'm pretty sure you can't use it to crafts I'm fairly sure how much of this do we need 32 for 27 come on me? Yo, check this. I didn't realize you could do this so if you pop cobblestone. You imagery just click it Just goes straight into the into the furnace. I didn't know that that's cool BAM done. You left sell me the mining hill I'm a little bit worried about how big this is gonna be Reds buy it and see oh my goodness oh jeez This thing's huge I might put it on top of that hill over there this might be this might be quite cool actually Oh, it's not even that big it looks big But it's just it's just not I want to put it all the way up here. This is gonna be sweet there It is the mining hell does it look a little bit ridiculous from over here potentially But it might also look pretty awesome, and that looks weird at you know I like it shifter right click you left. You know get out of here, buddy. Go go go there. He goes there He goes I love getting a little cinematic view is pushing my unicycle though I knew you always had a keen eye for the unicycle look at him. What are you doing? This is supposed to be an epic run and you're just running into all my things man's crazy absolutely crazy I also desperately need to try and find other foods hopefully fish But I feel like fish are caught in a different way in this modpack because no matter how long I wait here There's there's literally no fish action whatsoever it's so odd. Oh wait wait wait wait. It's happening yes I've got a bog-standard raw fish. Okay, so we can fish that's good well I'm gonna sleep cuz it's dark and scary to see how much money we get because I sold copper oh Oh That I might that might actually be really good that might actually be really really good. Oh, man autumns my favorite We just have autumn the whole time. Please I got a fish egg We're so fireworks. I'm gonna eat it. Why won't it? Let me? Oh because I'm full I don't actually need to eat ha ha now the reason why I'm doing this is because If you eat the same foods over and over again as we found in the previous episode it actually Punishes you you can't eat as quick You're right, buddy. Oh, he's having some issues, okay? Here you go go up to the mining Hill geez I thought you would start building already. He's disappeared again The man's gone okay there. He is he's right there. He's building blocks This time look at him such a trooper so with the mining Hill. I don't actually know what happens I'm pretty sure that is the dimension so you've got the mining Hut, but why would I need you no offense? But ain't no offense But why would I need him I'm a little bit confused Actually since I don't need to eat this can I sell fish, and you must be able to pop pop? Oh, you can't you actually card. I'm just gonna eat it in no no You must be able to sell some kind of fish because there's different fishing rods. I'm fairly sure yeah check it out We need to build the fishing hot those to be able to do it There's two different ones, and then I'm guessing the different ones catch different fish Diamond fishing rod sounds intense, so this one doesn't really do much. Oh, oh oh yes. Got myself a salmon Why am I so excited by this I have no idea? So all I need to do is wait for you lip over there You can just see the top of his heads beautiful man's finished the mining hill and then We're going mining that that'd be pretty cool won't it? He's only gonna built a tree it's getting too nighttime, so I'm a little bit worried things are gonna. Come and get me But he's built like worthy. He's built two trees three trees guys crazy absolutely crazy right you'll if I'm coming to light up your world like nobody else just because I Was trying to be nice I was trying to be nice, and I got blowed up why Stupid creepers always blowing me up. I'm so angry that just happens. I quoted one direction and you do this to me I'm so act This is why I need it to light it up. Is that everything I feel like that's everything. I can't believe that just happened I need to make sure that I've got all my appropriate resources that I bought and or Stolen from someone. I got my copper. That's good. I got some copper wool for some reason as well I feel like I'm definitely missing something like a hundred percent. Yeah. What was that? That was the axe? Fantastic when a creeper blows you up It just like it literally explodes every single part of your being all over the place I think that's everything I actually think that's every. I'll maybe not there's the ho just chillin on a tree. Okay, that's fine Feathers as well. I think that is everything now though. I'm out of here. Sorry. You'll if I'll see you in a bit I'm going sleep. I might just bungle this copper or in here before I lose it I hopefully you don't need that for anything else to see how much our money goes up I can't believe that just happens how much did it go up by a little bit, okay? that was not as much as I thought it's gonna be geez I might have just wasted all the copper ore ah kuwait kuwait kuwait go away any my sword sword sword sword sword sword ah Stay away from my family That's what I'm gonna. Call them. Good job there. We go you little punk, so uh yes the copper or could have made Some great things. I could have made a copper water. I could have given it to the blacksmith What are we doing? What am I actually doing? No, I knew that was gonna be a mistake. Oh geez At least I've got sweet potatoes and stuff to cheer me up. Oh my goodness Why didn't you guys tell me you probably were while I was putting them in you're probably like no You shouldn't be doing that buddy, and I didn't listen. I'm so sorry. That's so frustrating. It's fine We'll just get more about the mining Hill now absolutely fine, and we got some money for it, so it's okay Don't judge me two days till the wheat comes in though so we can get some more gold back from that ah what a fail Get in there eggplants at least. I know you give me loads of money for those Absolutely fine right you let fight you too, buddy. I think this is where the wall came from gonna put it back Okay, hopefully didn't blow up anything important. There you go. You're still building trees this man. Just loves trees He's decorating it with flowers. You know if you're so cute. I did order the keys orange trees though I don't know if you noticed, but I did order those so You know I'll forgive you. Hopefully they'll turn orange in the future orange would have been way better. Oh What is that? You deaf You'll if you're done. I think he's done. I don't know where you lift chilling. He might just teleported backwards I'm not too sure, but I think the mine is done. Yeah, the mining heals done. Let us see what is inside I'm a little bit scared and Worried can I dig this out because I feel like you look better in stone. I can okay, let's put this in stone Wait, it's growing back one piece of stone. That's all I've got There we go that's fine right let's go inside the Mayan portal. It says at the top. Let's go oh My goodness, it's dark. It's so dark uh Hopefully there's no nasties down here dudes. It is looking pretty Cool down here look at this This is mad. Yeah. This is the mine wall I don't know why I need to buy it though mine floor There's bones and stuff. What do I use to dig it up? That might sound like a stupid question. I'll look you can go even further down as well. This is crazy So do we break these? Yes? We do we got ourselves some junk? Okay perfect, so the walls aren't actually anything you just need to keep hitting these open and seeing what you get That's pretty cool. I'm just getting junk though which isn't that cool? This is a purple brach? What do you have inside you? junk Fantastic can I sell junk literally can't do anything fantastic right let's go down. Let's go deeper Hopefully we can find some better stuff it might just be the type of hammer that I've got because I sold You know my copper ore which was a bit stupid. This is massive down here absolutely massive Do I just get junk every time on give me something better? Oh what's this? This is definitely something else copper note gimme gimme gimme gimme Yes, I got my copper back. See you later. I like the pun very nice So it looks like we get junk from these terrible rocks, and then we find the other rocks to get better stuff That's cool. Completely different way of mining. Let's see what else we can find. Hopefully. There's no nasty things down here alright You can't quite see it, but that is definitely copper I'm going to take this copper to the surface so that I can go ahead and make the copper hammer Or does it need to be upgraded to a hundred percent first? I feel like that might have to happen so we have ourselves copper ingots Which can be smelted from copper grits? But you get it for hammering copper ore I think that's a different model II yeah the inga is from immersive Engineering at the or is from harvest festivals, so there's got to be a way that I can upgrade this But first we must sleep And I think I might need to I'm gonna see if I can sell this junk actually Let's just put it all in here because if it's just one apiece then at least we've got 20 There we go 5000 188. You'll if I need to find out how much money You need for the next Project and what the next project is gonna be I know one of them is the goddess Shrine or something like that these on the other day left just will be so rich you live is hiding from the rain Let's see what have you seen Jim? What you're not open buddy is no open Saturdays fantastic fantastic. All right. Let's check the achievement book real quick It should be in here because this will give us some kind of guidance. What's you next we done? You're morons poultry farm We haven't done the sheeps yet, so we can't take that one Make them an achievements, and that sounds amazing how do I get that achievement stands? Let's have a look we needs Literally an achievement book and oak planks or get a book and purple dye. I don't want to like use up my achievement book though. Do I? Oh, you can craft new ones. That's quite cool Look so you can do two as well one has a book one has no book I don't know if I want to do that just yet. Let's keep on going blacksmith Don Cafe. We haven't done. I'll call these Y'all this is crazy. We reach level two in the mining here. I think I've done build the mining huts. Oh, do look at this There's so much stuff so much stuff Wow right we definitely need to work on our house very very soon Otherwise we're gonna get lost and I feel like just having a house would be much better. Oh no I just gave him my hammer to repair. I didn't mean to do that dudes ah Wow, you took you took you took my things oh No forget. I'll just buy another one. I need to mine today today I want to see if the mining Hut's Resets every day. Let's have a look shall we let's see what's inside it does. Okay? It does reset That's cool. Wait. Why have I got ten hearts here, and why am I hurting what's going on no? I don't wanna die. No. I don't die. I don't wanna die don't die what's going on no No, no, this is not happening. This is not happening. This is not happening. This is not happening. This is not happening This is not happening. Why are you trying to kill me? Okay? It's not killing me all the way to zero Something's glitched out Maybe I'm thirsty yeah. I'm thirsty okay. My heart's have gone back to normal for some reason That's weird, so what I need to do is just get a hammer to a hundred percent, and then I can upgrade it I'm pretty sure but it's gonna take forever These this literally takes so long I wonder what happens if you keep on going down and down and down I'm gonna keep on doing that right now because this is our first time in the mine I Bought some torches with me gonna fish up the juicy stuff. Maybe we get more percentage for grabbing this I don't know, but I'm guessing the further down we go the better stuff we find Hopefully that's the case anyway. I am pretty deep down right now I'm not actually sure what level I'm on but I'm not finding insane stuff that I thought I would I wonder how far down you need to go. I also need way more torches. Why can I hear chickens? What? They're chickens down here Can you hear that? Oh my goodness? What was that I? Hit something. I hit something. I just got slain by a dark chick. Okay? I Need to be way more careful Like way way more careful. Let's go and let's not do that again. Oh jeez I need to go and get my stuff though That's literally all Sorry Coal, but I need more torches cuz otherwise I'm gonna be in big big trouble Alright, let's go. I'm in trouble. I hit it. I hit the first one with a hammer The second one just killed me, so I need to look out for those the mine is a scary place. Please have my things please Okay, I've got my things. I think I've got my things. Oh jeez jeez go away the dark chicks Just hitting me. This is actually mad. There's dark chickens down here. I don't know if I want to go down any further Okay, there's more. There's more there's more I'm just gonna stay up here and try and do it I can hit him with a hammer The hammer seems to hurt them a little bit there We go they seem to do a lot of damage as well, and they're really really fast, but all I'm finding is Copper no no no. No there's loads of em. There's loads of them. There's loads of them look These creepy chicken things go away, please I don't think they even drop anything. They just drop experience. Okay. We're definitely getting a little bit more Oh jeez is that on the mini-map is that another one I forgot that the mini-map actually shows us where there's enemies There it is there it is there it is. It's hit it hit it hit it there we go I dunno how much damage these guys do but I do not want to get killed by them again this thing's only at 9% That's unreal. I'm so far down. It's just like going down and down and down okay. I'm getting fatigued which isn't good It looks like there might even be like a person on the mini-map as well Which is crazy? Is that what that means? I don't even know that's that's weird, but yeah, I went really really far down in this mine, and I haven't found anything apart from Dark chickens, and the same old supplies look how far down I am I've been trying to get up here for like two minutes This mine is crazy, but I've got a ton of copper which is good. No. No no no don't do this Don't do this. Please don't do this please please Please no I Got killed I got killed, but I kept all my stuff I'm okay with that. I'm definitely okay with that. I am just gonna sleep. I don't know what happened it said I was slain by a chick, but I've got all my things and Everything is very very glitchy right now What is happening? It won't let me sleep. I will log out and log back in and see what happens. Please don't die Please don't crash and die yeah. I can't sleep anymore. Which is a little bit weird ah Okay, I wasn't expecting to end like this really so we've got 64 copper ore six normal copper ore which is pretty crazy All of our stuff is here But it won't let me sleep, but let me see what happens if I move the beds Let's see oh jeez I'm getting like really really fatigued now, and what let me sleep What I'm so confused and there's like a weird sleeping man on my mini-map to the right. Okay. I'm just gonna I'm just gonna walk over here. I'm just gonna stay inside, and I'm probably gonna die here You know what if I die will you catch me Johan? Thank you so guys I think I'm gonna pretty much leave it there things got a little bit weird I'm gonna have to try and fix this I don't know how I'm gonna fix this But I guess dying in the mine. Isn't advised well Hope you enjoyed this video if you did then please leave a fat like that be greatly Appreciated and if something to be the first bit you seen by me Please do consider subscribing to join team TDM and today for daily videos apart from that I'm gonna fix this and I'll see you guys next time go goodbye! 
hello welcome back to five nights at Freddy's 6 or Freddy fazbear's pizzaria simulator look how beautiful this title screen is it's also proudly showing me my certificate of bankruptcy which apparently is a collectible so um we got bankrupts but we got a collectible sorry this has been so long between the second episode in this episode this has been so many games I've wanted to play me hello neighbor all the good stuff that you've seen in the previous days without further ado let's just continue we've made it through 2 nights I believe there are 6 in total so let's just continue and see what's going down we actually have a lot of money right now and I've also been reading up on tips for the game because I haven't quite figured it out yet on the top right we have no risk which i think is very very good because the more risk that you have the more likely you are to get an animatronic jump you when you're in the night phase also I'll explain why I've learned about the night phase when we get to it but this phase no it really talks about to be honest I don't even know if you need to spend money here I'm gonna try and spend as little as possible I only really want to play the games to be honest but my there he is that's to do with the ending that you get so I'm assuming there are different endings so another thing that's been updated is the game itself remember that secret game we played last time let me get to it it's right down here just at the bottom if you slip your car in there you'll be presented with this which we've done before but apparently it's easier to talk to green guy now which we couldn't do last time for some reason there he is the man himself let's talk to this guy and see what he says this better be worth it come on you know you can't be here don't make this more difficult than it has to be is that all you're gonna say really I want to go in I want to go I want to go in green man cuz that literally all he says I did I did that for that Wow ok I'm out of here you're boring me green guy I thought you'd be more interesting okay off as rating is very very high right now what else can we buy because we unlock the 3rd catalog we can buy big stages which is unavailable for some reason a huge concert stage the ball pit but look at that liability I don't think so ladder tower liability is crazy carnival hoops ain't that bad riding Rockets lemonade clown fruit punch carnie on jukebox oh my goodness is so much and all of these animatronics here have liability so my plan is by as little as possible because I don't actually see a reason why you would wanna buy things I'm not a hundred percent sure what I will buy though is this I want to buy the carnival hoops what game is really really bad I'm gonna go and change this one so get rid of that and then there's ad in this boom can I play it I can let's see what game this is get twenty baskets to score the five-thousand point jackpots okay you have to just do this okay I see I see let just keep on doing this and see how we do this is very similar to the ball pit game I missed I missed I got nine that was terrible with 225 score this is this is part two but it looks it looks pretty cool not gonna lie I'm kind of annoyed that I have also picked all three advertisements so far because during the nights it's all to do with sounds so I'm gonna turn my headphones up I'm just gonna click finished because I don't really want to buy anything else I want to keep my rating my um my danger rating down to 0 I like mr. hippo it looks pretty fun I'm guessing I only need money for the lawsuits but with our ratings so low we should be fine let's finish let's just get out of here let's just get through the nights and see what happens so the nights here you just need to listen need to keep the fan off as much as possible and you can use the motion-detecting and the audio differently what I did wrong in the previous video is I put the audio here you don't put the audio here it drags it drags animatronics towards you so I'm gonna put it all there was someone there there's definitely someone there okay let's just let's turn the fan off and keep an eye on this oh my goodness who is in there though because I've salvaged correctly twice out of - oh jeez okay I'm gonna look in there and you could just get out here power off and what you have to do is if you see an animatronic and you hear an animatronic I can hear like this little 8-bit noise if you hear one then you just need to shine your light into the vent until it disappears I think this flickering has something to do with it is he gone now did you hear that laughter I think he might be gone now let's power back up no okay just just just just never accept the ads Oh oh okay okay okay yeah I was trying to tell you guys how to play the game and I fell badly I'm gonna blame the adverts thanks for the adverts and it sent you all the way back to the beginning perfect okay so let's continue does it just lead us here does it save what we bought it does save what we bought it saves our play tokens oh no no no no no is that did that go down I think that went down we only played one game right oh geez okay so when we click finished let's see next time if we fail if a play token goes down because if we get down to Sarah we die I don't want to start again so know one way to find out guys so I don't know what kind of a trunk that was I think it's it's something cool it's like magma Freddy or something like that but we need to keep him in way away he's right up here dude I'm gonna turn the fan off I'm gonna order some cups and just listen out so I might be silent for some of this video but this game is all about sounds guys it's very very important okay he's at the top right that's perfect so I'm gonna do this advertising print flyers I can't remember what upgrades I bought I'm gonna check in a minute but you can't flick between screens otherwise you're in big trouble this is making so much noise Oh see what's noise a big happy family I don't want you in my family you scare me a lot where did that guy come from because I have no risk I've salvaged two animatronics successfully and there's just this guy roaming around he's definitely a version of Freddy but he's a little bit scary okay my play tokens are fine that's good that's really good right so that obviously didn't work let's uh I don't even know what to do I'm going to turn the fan off motion detect so he's in the right place what about how do I track him and stop him from oh my god says to let's drag them up here reckon they'll go up there oh I heard something no just shush please don't kill me okay there's something to the right definitely something to the right the vent though the fan is going to get me killed you can go up to 120 degrees by the way what just someone's talking bro dude someone was talking someone was actually talking who was it who was it there's so many in there why is there so many in there there's like three okay they're up there I'm gonna do a task real quick cuz there's all the cups sort of the cups it's gonna be fine look into each vent it's gonna be all it goes to the degrees okay I forgot about that I'm gonna shut it down shut it down I've shut down everything please don't die please do not die okay goes up really slow when you get to the the higher heats I'm gonna have to turn it back on in a minute though because I do not want my guy to overheat smelt and die that would be terrible we have to turn it back on I'm gonna have to do it right don't think there are any noises let's detect anyway there was some in the right let's play some audio up here I think that works oh my goodness there's actually three in here we need to be so so patient I'm just gonna wait for the temperature to get down to as low as it can be and then we're gonna do it right here we go let's order plates simple simple task just be quiet there's this like weird 8-bit noise but I'm not sure what it is I think I'm done I think I'm done let's put the fan back on we're fine okay so when we turn the fan off they'll be drawn to the audio that makes sense when the fans on they could definitely creep up on us just like this just like this oh my goodness so the blips mean that the way it tracking someone doesn't it okay I think we're okay to do napkins if I die because of the napkins I'll be mad I can't believe there's three of them I literally cannot believe it three animatronics and I feel like I'm doing the best at least mr. hippo isn't trying to kill us okay let's go for utensils and plastic knife and forks if I can hear it's very very faint but I can definitely hear like creaking are we good just be patient just be patient I think we're okay I think we're fine let's go to motion @gs go audio audio seems to be the best one to track people because motion just tells us that anyway it's kind of weird oh I was just about to say those noise oh my goodness I had the fan on for way too long but so if they're any kind of sounds whatsoever I just need to I just need to lock it down guys properly lock it down why why do I choose these ads why did I choose these ads I'm locking it down oh that's coming left he's coming left leave me alone fascinating who is saying that seriously that's freaky that didn't even sound like it was coming from a vent that was just that was a straight up in my ear holes that is so weird right I'm putting audio up here you are going away from me right now no why why why stopped Arminius is getting really warm play the audio up here oh geez I'm so dead I'm so dead this is it I'm dead okay we're actually pretty fine I'm gonna upgrade this yeah I'm gonna do that and then I'm gonna go back to the audio screen see where we're at put the fan on for a little bit I'm not sure if the fan affects the animatronics or not I'm not sure or whether it just makes it harder to hear I think it just makes it harder to hear I wanted to buy the upgrades so that I can print faster because I feel like that took absolutely ages oh those noise there was noise a back up those are free noise shuffling shuffling shuffling oh my goodness where did that come from that was their fleecing shuffle shuffle in there please don't attack me these animatronics are so active crazy active too active no oh my goodness why why why why why why did I accept all these things please get my temperature down way lower so I can start doing some of these tasks they're only hovering all the selgeh this printer is still not that great is it it's still not that great at all oh my goodness there's so many tasks to complete there's like this there's like 10 I'm buying the plumber upgrades I have to okay that doesn't make noise that's goods I've done all the advertising and I need to talk less because otherwise I'm gonna die and I don't want to die ever clean their muffins boy clean them up I feel like I've got this it just takes a long time and you need to just be so careful the fan makes so much noise you have the the silent vent fan but it's it's just not good at keeping your temperature down it just makes it go up slower oh dude there was someone really close I think I'm dead I think I'm dead I need to have that I need to have the fan on but there's three of them just roaming around oh my goodness to the left as well how am I gonna survive this bulbs let's do bulbs should be fine shouldn't make much noise at all if you have to jump anyone just jump that jump the new guy this isn't me anymore cuz I hired someone else just jump him the new repairman so now we've done all the maintenance we've done all the printing we only need to do orgies we only need to do the ordering the cups and plates and all that good stuff and I think that's the quickest task okay let's do cups and then we've got four things to do then we can log outta here plates plates are coming in plates are coming in these are one of the most important bits of a restaurant I think we're okay we're good we're good we could put the fan back on I think I've got this I need to be so patient though this take me forever our there's three uh-huh come on two left there's only two left come on come on there's lots of blips going off which means they're moving around like crazy and I don't like it I don't like it at all oh my goodness no please don't come near me please don't come near me oh my gosh I've only got one thing left and then I can log out there's definitely someone up there why would they do this on the last one please don't kill me please don't kill me oh I can hear them shuffling dude don't kill me I don't want to have to do this again I'm pretty sure they're gone I'm pretty sure they're gone last one Pizza kits then log out B tickets then log out then we just need to do a salvage come on yes yes yeah that's I'm talking about so that one night took me about I don't know like fifteen minutes from start to end before you is an animatronic found in the back alley now we got the salvage that's baby oh okay this is worth $2,000 which is insane to know okay so while I was editing the previous episode what I noticed was every time you flick up the page there's a chance that they move so I don't know why I didn't know is that before because it's a miniscule movement and you're kind of distracted by the page moving so you need to check the page as little as possible but there's also just the option just to you know throw further thing away because otherwise baby will be released into the restaurant which would be you know terrifying oh it's worth like mm oh and I feel like there's obviously a reason why you would salvage them all the only thing that's putting me off I know the visual cues but I don't know the audio cues and now I know that you have to not put the page up and down too much because otherwise they're gonna kill you I am gonna go I'm gonna do it I'm just gonna do it begin audio prompt in three here we go up to one document result it's okay it's okay there was a no bargain audio prompt Emery I'm sapping your butt Oh see what I mean it moved from this to like teeth and eyes and stuff but oh man I don't know how many stages you can let it move before it starts to react and it's always better to zap them more than an audio prompt I think I'm okay with this stage one it's when they get to like the stage I could be wrong I could be completely wrong but let's find out oh geez oh geez okay document no zap yeah I think I've got this guy's I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get too ahead of myself cuz we've only done we've only done two haven't we yeah I know there's two stages now though so that's goods play the thing begin audio no if they react during the prompts or only begin audio doing this we have one more zap that we could do [Applause] do I want to do the Zap I don't think I need to do this out I don't think I do come on come on come on oh jeez this is terrifying it's so long that zapped the light went out oh oh my goodness just keep going just keep going I think we're good though there'll be three salvages in total stop the sounds dude stop the sound bro please the last one is so long come on documentaries yes yes we did three okay I feel like kind of getting this game now it takes a while but I feel like I'm getting it the South Beach it's true I don't actually know who is employing me let me just check my pay slip I don't have one okay right we're making money I'm making good money most money is making it from the salvaged have we got any lawsuits yeah I feel like we're being successful but I don't know if we're being too successful you know what I mean all right that's upgrades there we go look how beautiful this is sponsorship offer arrow thinks so toothpaste man no they only seem to do bad things which is not good right I kind of want to buy some things to make the next auction is there anything else we can play because I need to find out some more laws and stuff I don't think there's any more playable things here but we do need to start buying stuff to open the rare Pines auction but I think you know what guys that needs to be left until is it coming back it just keeps coming back no no I'm not gonna do this like it was never there wacky war toothpaste disgusting I don't think so I've got too much adverts up in here but guys I think that's gonna end it for today's video this game is it's tricky because it plays on your patients so badly let me know if you have any tips or hints in the description below whether you've watched someone else play or you played it yourself let me know any tips maybe things I'm doing wrong could do better maybe the points do matter I don't know if you did enjoy this video than a big fat thumbs up will be greatly appreciated leave a like that would be awesome and if this happens to be the first video by me please do consider subscribing to toy team TDM today for daily video is part of night guys thank you so much watching you are the best and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] 
Hi guys so today, I've got quite the treat for you today :) We're back in The Sims 4 but I'm not continuing any story not creating a new story. I'm exploring mods. :) I didn't realize that the Sims 4 had any mods. But I found some absolutely amazing ones that we are going to discover today now most of them occur in the (° ͜ʖ ͡°)create-a-sim screen. Interesting. So I'm here at the title screen. I'm gonna hit new game, and let's see what happens. I have no idea oh It's gonna happen look at this woman's face Why why, are you making that face of me? It's not that bad, so yeah, I've added in a few mods I've added in height sliders, which I didn't even realize wasn't in The Sims 4 in the first place extreme facial sliders Which means that you can pull the face to all kind of extremities! The giant heads mod, and where any object is hats Yeah, so we're gonna have some fun of this today I am going to randomize and see what on earth happens with their head is the head not working oh? Yeah, Uhuh the head is working! That is working so this is the big head mod It's kind of like it looks normal from the sides, but then you turn it, and it doesn't look that normal I don't know why it's gone so wide and not tall that's so weird, but I've also got the facial sliders mod So I should be able to pull other things apart, but I don't think it's working give me your face oh jeez This is so awkward There we go, it's working That's what I'm talking about. I think I can grab the What is that oh my goodness I did not know you could do that that is crazy oh No look at her chin her chin has been pulled all the way down. I'm so sorry, but I'm kind of not ;) I'm trying to do detailed edit mode, but this is just not working very well. Is it that is one crazy looking? Look at that chin That is unreal apparently I've done like a height mod as well. Oh yes I have so I give them massive heads and tiny bodies. This is perfect to make everything as small as possible She's gonna have big hands, but that's fine. What kind of I can even zoom into a head What kind of what kind of hair can we do that make it look even better we got the? She looks like she looks like a cartoon But I can't think which one we must have like an afro or something surely with a mohawk that looks pretty hilarious all those eyes I've actually created the ugliest sim in the world! Yes, found an afro. No way no way I want some full body outfits, Surely There's some weird costumes. It's like Freddy fazbear But way was a weird raccoon the raccoon doesn't actually look that weird to be honest the hot dog might yeah That looks a little bit weird actually a clown that works That actually works! Oh the hats *laugh* This is crazy. This is actually crazy look at the width of this sim. It's just unreal She's gonna have to have three doors in a row like a massive archway to be able to get anywhere. I'm astounded by this We've also got the llama which kind of looks like Where I is in the right place? That's so odd. I don't even know what this is But I've got a suits it. That's good. That's very good. Don't know what to choose. I think it has to be that right it has to be that one kinda looks weird But it's gotta be this. Let's give her a pink hair definitely what about Sunglasses yep. Yep Yep, none of these cover our eyes because her eyes are like outside of the sunglasses. I can't believe it We've created a masterpiece a tiny little masterpiece. We can also make them super tall so you can't even see their face This is the best thing I've ever done. I'm not even sure what else to do. Let's make the aspiration Popularity you are going to be a party animal friend of the world or a joke star I mean we're not gonna play much. I just want to see everyone's massive heads you're gonna do parties. That's what you're gonna Do you're cheerful you're also? You're also evil And Clumsy a hundred percent. Yeah, there you go What could the names be Lola crow the two things that come out straightaway? Lola's a good name and crows you know what I'm doing it. I'm definitely doing it You can't even see our face in the sims square because it's too small mother faces into small. She is just short Let's press play and see what happens Yeah, so we also need to try out this wearing objects as hats you Can you wear them as a mask or as a hat which is crazy? Why should we even go? I don't know. I don't know where there's a place that we haven't been yet Let's go to Mongolia promenades. Why not oh, there's only shops. Okay? That's a bad idea. There's nothing here either. What's going on I think this city is gonna be the best for finding the most people so Yes, that's what we're gonna. Do let's buy the haunted place Why not? I'm gonna give up money anyway, because this isn't a let's play. This is an exploration fully furnished. Let's go It's Scott. I don't know what the first tray is, but it's haunted so that's perfect for this human Yes, don't forget to pay your rent on time that is going to be no problem look at me look at this thing What if we created you can just see the top of her hat in the bottom left, that's amazing right? I want to try out this command things you do control shift and see to be able to make her wear an object as a Hat so, we just need an object, let me let me see what I can find, okay. I don't know what this is I'm just gonna put it on our face and see What happens is that a tree is that? What what even is that I've actually got a tree attached to her head No way, right we need to get out of here. Why are you embarrassed? What's wrong with you the have shame There's a fire live. It's a wonderfully wacky and downright weird this hat definitely crossed that line a Hundred percent and I'm kind of I'm not sorry at all. Let's go outside I think we'll be able to see this a lot better that is what she's wearing just a giant tree Okay, let's let's change that that's not fair no, that's massive I It says microscope station as the description But that looks like a um I was thinking telescope that is definitely More than I thought it was gonna be I walk around. Why are you going to bed? She's hiding from everyone? Nope, nope you're not getting away with this one. Let's go to the center of town come on microscope lady. Let's go That has got to be super heavy like a crazy amount of heavy Yes, Lola she's reached level 1 of singing skill can I see your little chin under I definitely can Beautiful this should be better there we go a green toilets. That's massive as well Why are they so big you can make them smaller I think? Yeah, I can can I make it even smaller than that No that that's a smallest that toilet gets It makes her look like she's some kind of weird nose This is the capability that the Sims can have it's not just realistic. It's also incredibly Incredibly freaky you ever seen this in the scenes before I didn't think so Where are we gonna? Take a little person next she could play some basketball. Can you join in I think so let's do some dunks lay it up Let's go. This is a this is a way to get over your embarrassment You just need to just own it basically look at the size of this guy because all this dude is he's absolutely massive my sim is the smallest and that sim looks like the tallest look this I Think their heads are kinda deformed as well. Yeah, they got skinny faces. That's hilarious. I crave a reach She's too small to do the dunk here we go Okay, she managed to get it that's just showing off now look at the size difference That is crazy. She's going in for another dunk. You can do this go on and You're a failure okay, I know this is going to be ridiculous This is the observatory it's gonna be oh it's not even that big look. It's a tiny size Quick run up here. Go. Go. Go. Go. I need to follow you yeah, she's even lost her normal hacks He's changed out of her. She's changed out of her normal clothes right let's go for 10. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness It's literally the size of a building that is on our heads How is that even possible? Go for practice some dribbling and let's see what happens here I don't know who you're talking to but stop it look at it. Just walking around. That's so weird What if I put it like 20 you can actually do it? I can't even zoom out far enough to see that That's so odd welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you I don't really know what's going on, but thank you try to find something a little bit smaller. Just so it doesn't look completely Ridiculous that was supposed to be a fridge but yeah, there's no fridge there a Boat the fridge doesn't work, but the boat sure go ahead look it's just It's just weird It's way too weird. I want to see the interactions between This woman and this giant man, just because I'm interested. I think it's gonna it's gonna be weird I should get them into a fight a hundred percent.

We go. That's much better. That's perfect right Here's our final few we have Ken Barnes Which is these are all randomly generated by the way Ken Barnes is the best superhero name ever you can't actually see his head It's like the the parents from Tom and Jerry you can't see their faces. He's a bodybuilder Athletic kind of gloomy ball so very childish he's a superhero is allowed We then have Penelope Shipman because she's kind of got a male hairstyle going on she wants to have a successful Lineage so a family that looks Goods and earns a lot of money She's romantic musical and also just a bro and finally we have evil genius Edwin guy the hoods Masquerade he wants to be fabulously wealthy. He also is a genius. He's evil and he's a kleptomaniac Edwin welcome to the team buddy the Barnes family everyone Look at that family picture Here they are from humble beginnings. Oh, yeah, I forgot about his face actually looks amazing. He's my favorite so far and then we have Is it Edwin I think it's Edwin? and you can't even see look at this is his picture is just his chest because he's Massive, this is random of what happens when he takes a shower I really want to see he's just so big he pops out the top haha That's great. Okay That's not working as its intended is it This is great. This is so much fun welcome to your new home everyone Not quite sure what you make of it, and I'm not quite sure what everyone will make of you But I'm sure you'll be happy here.

so a few times I have done at the try not to laugh challenge and I thought I'm gonna do another one of those I'm gonna do the opposite I'm doing the try to laugh challenge hmm where the rules are simple you look at stuff that's it's funny so that's what we're gonna do I've literally got in front of me a list of funny subreddits now I'd already use write it that much but apparently if for memes and funny stuff it's it's a pretty good one where on earth do we start I swear I just saw the word pugs I did I did pugs emoting in sweaters I have hit the Epiphany epitome I'm not sure what I'm using I have hit the gold mine reddit's pug emoting as a pretty princess I'm not actually sure that's a princess that looks more like actually that looks like you know 1m shooter gowns looks like one of those he's cute though she's cute whichever one is what's called pug emoting while wanting to be in your world it's ariel everyone that's impressive it's even got like the tail going on as well you know I've seen a lot of pugs dressed in a lot of outfits I've never seen a pug dressed as a pug Bailey if that's your real name I'm impressed one of the best pranks I've ever seen you okay whoops well I'd sweet that's awesome I thought the prank was the girls coffee Gainesville that's amazing that is honestly one of the best pranks have ever seen what would you do film it already seems like this is gonna be perfect on Facebook could you imagine it would be like literally discovering a superhero it would be so cool this article is called 40-plus cat thieves that were caught red-pawed and they'll show how I got here but I did and this guy that's that's actually impressive he's got milk dripping off of his nose he's stealing my milk and I'm impressed not unimpressed impressed I like that buddy hahaha what is what is that cat is that a cat or a lion they kind of look similar actually like the chicken in the cat look a very similar color I found one called Photoshop battles where the rules are you'd send an image and you ask people to Photoshop it and people were just like having a Photoshop battle basically the best Photoshop er wins this is an eagle standing on ice and he's asked people to Photoshop it that's cute ha ha oh no no oh that's awful good Photoshop though yes oh this is a good one how does someone get a picture of a hamster running like that it's majestic the acorns owners realize these are acorns damn Susie acorns oh yeah they can oh that's creepy oh look at these frogs Oh No Oh someone took it and made it real deep oh that's so cute yes I've got you buddy so the radish dried up pretty quickly I'm afraid so this is a try not to laugh challenge savage level 101 percents this isn't gonna happen is it what oh wow the music the music matches perfectly oh no the dogs get me every time he's sold no wonder he sold if he could do that good luck good work do it no do it do it he didn't do it I was right congratulate my boy ah I'm so disappointed robots no is this woman again we've seen this one already the slow fall is that already what it feels like ah you kidding me no I would not do that I don't even like chewing gum most dramatic panda ever go and show me your best acting buddy you got this let's replay this Oh are you looking at me huh what what are you doing all right face ah I've seen this thing before what is it gold I need to find more videos of that I've seen another video that made me laugh so hard of that before pink thing meme yes this is it here we go this is the greatest thing ever [Laughter] that's just the basic meme that's the original here he comes again what are you gonna do you're crazy man I just say what we see memes gonna walk on over buddy walking over come on in show us your best hurt the weak one that's similar to the one that I've seen but it's not as good that's the one haha I love memes so much because they're just something that comes from literally nothing and just blows up like the knuckles thing and this this clip has 2.3 million views that is insane I've destroyed one on the right that says I bet 1 million dollars you will laugh part 2 I wonder how many millions he's made fishing I try not to laugh but is the matter this is the try to laugh challenge right I've seen this one I've seen it already yes I used to know me our million dollars buddy wait did I laughs I think I didn't I don't do it oh the ultimate betrayal [Music] yes first dance is always all good well I don't know if this was gonna be awkward this was like a pretty hype one my words no doctor again what are you doing I mean I wish I could flip like that but that's probably the reason why I'd never do in public he just he must have just got married to that woman and the first thing he does when you're supposed to have your first evidence as a married couple is do a somersault double flip and kick her in the head and then drop her it's not a good start but I guess at least it can't get worse right this is not a good idea I told you whoa we gave it was insane though they kick the bag pop the bottle up and then backwards kick the bottle that is some insane skill wait no what is happening here when is this okay in school I'm guessing it's definitely not a karate class it's definitely a school oh no no no no no what is this okay well so you gonna climb in semo towels are known it's like a Terrapin or a tow I think it's a tarpon they're known for being slow but look at this guy he's going places a star Oh what do you even do for some of these I just really want to know the rest of the story like how did the turtle get up I need to know doing the swish is you're gonna do the ball trick no who's throwing the bottle see you dunking it it's going in oh no no if that's a teacher this is happening to him next show the moves yeah unacceptable how is it we always end up seeing a dab in these try not to try to laugh challenges how is that possible there's a dab in every single one no guys I think that's a safe place to end it I've seen one dad actually that was multiple violations we're almost there though I feel like the dab is getting less frequent I don't wait there it is it's in for tonight as

if you're watching this after it's live then still hello have you having an amazing day which ever day it is so today we're gonna be exploring some more of snugged snub it's now subnautica because i streamed it last week we had a crazy cool adventure and i think it's the perfect game to stream and we got some important stuff going on today if you're excited smash the like button subscribe if you're new to keep up with everything that I do I've got another video coming out after this stream so don't you worry let's do this I'm gonna switch over to my main stream and as you can see on the top right yep you can see it 37 minutes the Sun beam will arrive now my main goal today which I put in the title of this stream is to make a base because I'm severely running out of space for all my um I see things you know all my fish oh my my equipment my metal and all that good stuff I'm running out of space and I was like you know what let's build the thing it's good the habitat builder which allows you to build habitats basically you can build your your base up you can start using metal to build it it's super cool but then I loaded it up to try and go and get some silver because that's pretty much the only thing I'm missing to be able to make one and I completely forgot about this Sun beam thing that was supposed to happen I just completely forgot about it so I probably would have spent 40 minutes trying to find silver and then miss the whole Sun beam thing now if you're not caught up the Sun beam thing is where's the there it is some beam landing site we need to make our way over to there today in in less than what in about thirty minutes we should probably make our way over there because we got a message over here we don't currently have any messages at the moment but we've got a message saying that we need to get there to be rescued now not on absurd sure that we're gonna be rescued but hey it's worth it's worth trying right we might as well try but main go up today habitat build up needs a battery a computer chip and a wire kit so wiring kit requires just two silver ore which we need because we used our last ones last time and the other thing we need is table coral not one person sure how on earth to get table coral I don't actually know I really don't know but we're gonna find out I've also got super chats and I've got the sponsors active as well so you have a chance for your name to be on the screen and all shout it out if you do any of those and that is what is on the top right-hand side of your screen above the timer it's getting into daytime I've got a peeper in my hands and I'm ready to go find some 100% I need to go and find some silver desperately like really desperately and I'm not quite sure where to get it from hello oh it's you again I heard you can use peepers to make these guys go away right I don't know what just happened but I think he went away did that work I think that works anyway let's get out of it I desperately need to find some silver and silver it's from sandstone so we definitely just find that it's all over par Larry Kirstie plays a blessing of blossoms at dust and TCB thank you so much for your super chats and or sponsors your legends yeah I need to come in here I'll jeez I forgot about these I forgot about these don't blow me up don't blow me up what is - there's definitely too come on now geez those things are horrible I think I just saw one actually is this sandstone lions don't see I need the sandstone copper I will grab though just because I do need it I probably will need titanium this is Sam that's limestone as well I don't really need titanium not gonna lie to you guys I need sandstone but I'm not sure what it looks like that's limestone as well they're usually on these bigger bits right here let's see if I can find any around limestone again I don't wanna get lost under here cuz I will die which won't be fun I just need to find some limestone because there is it Sean so you can get it from there No ôhe is it sandstone Reliance Tony needs and being a complete idiot where did that go that's copper yeah I need sandstone I think it's gonna be a little bit lower than this let's see we can find any on the floor I'm just gonna go up a little bit and see what happens and let's go down also with the sponsors what you do get is you get like emotes and stuff kind of like you do on Twitch so I need to sort those out when we get our sponsor numbers up because I think that would be amazing oh my goodness that guy's the disease I've heard about this disease did you see that is eating metal which is what they do apparently yeah apparently you can get a disease in this game I'm not quite sure how I'm fairly sure you could die of it so I do not what's this mobile vide I do not want to get that so I don't get bitten by anyone with a big old disease do I that'll be horrible man why is it so tricky so do they pick up wait what is this is a massive wreckage do they pick up metal and destroy it that's pretty crazy you know look at this I don't know how I haven't seen this bit before it's all like mashed up can i scan any of this stuff no I can't scan this I can't scan I don't have scan creep vines cuz that's weird what is in here we need to scan as much as we can vehicle BAE again I just need sandstone dudes I don't even need our 90 water as well why is this happening yeah it looks like the eating metal I'm not gonna lie we just need to keep an eye on the time I really want to find this I really want to find this silver before that timer runs out because we're gonna have to make some time to actually go over there as well because a thousand meters away we do RC glide which is goods what's this it's a sandstone BAM yeah alright that's what I'm talking about we just need what we desperately need fluids so we need some bladder fish but that's what I'm looking for this is limestone I'm gonna break it anyway sandstone sandstone this is sandstone it's not it's lime something this is sandstone come on give me that silver gold I'll take it yes there's loads in here lead I'll take it anyway any more in here it's like the smooth stuff there it is I need to not get stuck down here as well come on gold oh jeez okay I need to get out of here cuz I'm gonna drown I desperately need a bladder fish I need to get a better water supply of water than just bladder fish I think you guys taught me about it last time we only need one more piece of silver which is kids very good Pokemon's reanalysis gaming Skrillex lava drooling Plattsmouth OMG beacon or bacon that's hilarious Timmy dark Aldo Sierra Madeleine at Kim a harmony TBN our Wolfie girl little homie I like that name I like it a lot Mason Parisi MB gamer chubsters game in at Jon champ little homie again Gianna and TCB 15 thank you guys come to LA soon I guess I would do I'm gonna have to at some point aren't I right I need to find a bladder fish before I die that would be extremely upsetting there were any bladder fish caught in my trap see this trap isn't working well if I don't have any bladder fish is it where are they all I should be able to chase them down in this isn't it Seagal I already got one of those I'm using it come on bladder fish this is not funny I desperately need water right now and I think there is a way there's one okay goods we're not going to die today give me that let me see mine grab some more I got 12 left yeah I'm literally gonna die oh there's loads here give me that give me that thank you right let's go and do this before we do die and grab this extra one on the way back there's so hard to catch sometimes there we go what for right come on we're down to 11 okay it doesn't go down too fast which is kids really really good seven second Betty Betty game is Joshua iron Alexis Brown I have just missed my base where is it you know I'm gonna drink this water before I do this all right here we go right about 30 minutes it's real life minutes as well I need water so you can disinfect water with bleach that sounds crazy oh there's lots of notifications and trying to keep up who did I get too many games Joshua iron Alexis Brown Alex Brenda furious gamer Ryan gaming Shannon Wilson chubbs to join Nick TV a loom Lego beast gaming Brenda furious gamer and wrath a guy how you doing guys right let's drink this water before we literally die much better we probably should eat something as well cooked peeper it is they usually are saving my life but for this time we're gonna just I'm just gonna eat him there we go right we're sustained we still need one more piece of silver what's the other thing we needed table coral have we got that in our data bank flora see I don't think I've actually yeah I haven't actually you know scans that much we just need to find this let's go if I come across any other any other bladder fish that'll be great I probably should make some more on truth I probably should make some more wasn't gonna say gun batteries that's what I was gonna say desperate you need some batteries just because we're C gliding about a thousand meters away isn't this table no that's cold she'll blow up there we go I'm not sure what table coral is I don't think I've come across it yet that's coral shell does anyone know where to get table coral from if you do let me know that'd be super helpful so I'm gonna need that to craft what I need what's that place to wear a minute ago it was awesome it was really gone I'm so glad we crafted that thing that allows us to have just a lot more breath underwater it's so much better so I need a battery for my torch as well which is bad I need to prep for this adventure limestone I don't need limestone I don't need all there must be some down here there must be there some come on give me what I need look yes got him okay cool now I need to find some table coral and get out of here fast there's some nasties down here it's the red stuff I know it's red but I'm not hundred percent sure where I find it see glad we got that right we have our silver which is perfect I probably need to go ahead and grab some batteries as well which I know you can charge at some point but we obviously don't have the charger right now you have to have some kind of from the Islands Niue near the base and trying to read and trying to read sandhya places okay I need to find it maybe I'll find it on the way to the Sunbeam I'm not too sure I know it's got to be red but you must have to find in different biomes because there are different vibes oh wait wait wait wait wait a second but uh we got it table coral boom literally just found it that's the luckiest thing that can happen to us today apart from being rescued maybe not too sure found it though but and trying to catch up with all of these oh my goodness Pokemon twins s b737 how's it going Elijah Shannon horrible girl what a weird name I'm joking I'm joking Jordan and a happy drooling platypus emerald wolf

take picture F no it's not F what is it ladies its PA deconstruct exits how'd she doesn't say reload maybe yeah there we go sweet so you've got one battery that's 45% and two that are dead which isn't great but hey we'll do it what's what out personal I need myself this habitat builder so I've got a battery can I use a dead battery that'll be sweet a dead battery computer chip and wiring kit so wiring kidkraft me one of those take my silver your punks buddy Amy retro robot Jeremy am bhakti how are you doing you never fail to make me smile thank you do I know the biggest sea creature actually don't I probably don't want to meet it though to be honest do I where am I so I've got the wiring kit I just need the computer ship right now which needs copper wire which I can make gauge Kemper Thank You Coley beggin 20 pounds British pounds please shout out my son at South when it'll make his day South one South one I hope I said your name correctly how's it going buddy I hope you're in a good day is that everything now computer chip and then we're done boom advanced wiring kit has just been discovered as well Warren kicked gold and a computer chip I probably don't want to do that right now right this is exciting habitat builder yeah let's do this nice look how sweet this thing looks let's go let's go ah you legend look at this we can actually build we can build I'm so excited base pieces multi-purpose room I need some more titanium we're doing this right now right now and then we can go on our adventure because we actually have enough stuff with us right now to be able to do honey it's uh more titanium I think I need two more on top of that is there any in here there is so we should be able to build this I don't know how you put things down so this is a learning experience right now a basic room in which to install a range of different components here we go I can actually put it down oh my goodness can I put it just anywhere I think I can I think this is actually really cheap because you can find this metal anywhere I'm gonna put it near where we are I'm gonna put it over here this is a nice little flat bit that we can do so I just put it there I'm doing it I did it construct oh my goodness I'm tapping it I'm making a house look at me I'm going I'm going that's a great gauged sham Pat TCB fifteen pixie Jordan Western and bellows Lima and Richard how you doing buddy thank you for that how do I get in to this room have I messed this up already do I have to craft the door or a ladder I have no idea what I'm doing and I need to go for the Sun beam in a second is there a ladder on top of that maybe I'm gonna see I can craft the ladder right now I need to titanium let's do this I don't if I have any titanium left titanium is really easy to come by though bill with the gun I will do what do I need for the gun I don't actually know the gun is why can I do that I need magnetite that's why I haven't built it yet guys I haven't come across magnetite yet all right let's grab all of this we have another message let's quickly play this that it might be bad news about some beam we've landed a kilometre from the crash site but there's radiation in between us and the rendezvous okay immediate assistance six out okay approximate transmission origin suite the grim yard Tony Elam sans Darrin and junior Alex kitty cat Nick cheese truck gamer Russ Candela Bobby Swift how's it going Braden and Pedro go to the Sunbeam I will I will don't worry you guys don't you drop the hatch so I'm gonna do that I can do a ladder as well apparently but I'm gonna go ahead and do it I don't even know if I have the hatch available do i reinforcement window hatch I need quartz okay I think I do have some of that actually and then we're gonna go to the Sunbeam because I don't want to miss our flight miss our flight out of here what sports board I do have some in here it's somewhere I really want to know what to do the creature eggs as well you know how good it is that we're gonna start building our um our house because I need storage badly how many courses dough needs I mean look at my blueprints blueprints go all the way down to the bottom I need hatch just one sweep this build one is getting dark but I do want to get inside this as quickly as possible and then we're going all right here we go hatch provides access I probably should have read their rides an access point to the habitat I'm gonna put it under here if I can or do I put it outside I'm not sure how building works on this Oh Oh construct this bad boy here we go guys I'm so excited we go in okay so we need to make this so add she has oxygen in it probably would be a good shout has no power as well I probably should have researched this we have nothing here why do you want to do that so basically at the mean I don't really need power here just something - oh jeez something - distorting Zin would be great fabricator endure grow bed Locker wool locker I'm crafting one of these right now small storage large freestanding storage let's grab ourselves some quartz and I'm very wary of the time as well I want it to be daytime when we do this big trip I just need some quartz so I want to build a big Locker then we can put as much of our stuff in there as possible we did it though guys I did what I came to do I'm glad Christian x-gamer shadow at Diamond Micah Bros dos 3.0 Michael Norris cupcake no problem cheese truck gamer and Karen how's it going I'll be able to read out loads of your stupid shots and stuff when we do the big trip just want some quotes in my life right now I'm not sure where I'm gonna find it you can find it in I think it's in it's in caves mainly I'm glad we have I probably should make another battery before I leave as well how long do you think it will take there it won't take longer than five minutes with it I'm kind of getting distracted by all of the fun we're having with building I hate it when it's dark it freaks me out all right we might I get some courts in here courts anyone oh great let's get out of here oh I always have to listen for them they sound insane quotes anywhere down here that's um got it right let's do this it's gonna make a locker and then what we can do afterwards is go to the Sunbeam I guess you probably should Karen PTR PRT X and Manuel thank you so much your legends your legends oh look at this okay actually go in there that's hilarious I'm glad we're starting this base you know I don't know if there's a better place to build a base but to be honest there's not really a bad place to build one just because they're so cheap like really cheap right big Locker but a boom where you pop this I'm gonna put it I'm gonna put it here actually I'm gonna put on any sideways peace build this bad boy and I wonder if you deconstruct if you get it back yes look at this it's not actually that much storage is it I'm gonna put the purple tablet in here I don't know what to put much else in there to be honest everything else I needs we actually made our first house I'm so proud are you proud you should be these lockers aren't actually that bad so I'm not gonna move anything from here 15 minutes until the Sunbeam arrives we should probably crash some batteries should have a let's craft one at just craft to two batteries I need some copper or I need to move some of this stuff across let's take this radiation helmets copper that's gold actually take what our valuables yeah let's make one more battery and then that should do us for the journey someone said to make a solar panel okay I'll do that I'll do that Victoria and champ Qin we how are you doing guys was I just doing let's go for see how much a solar panel is solar panel is quartz titanium and copper I can make that but I'm a little bit worried about the Sun beam arriving I'm just gonna put some stuff can you actually can you attach the escape pod to your house or is it just not worth doing let me know there we go right at least we have a locker now what just happened that was weird right we're gonna put some gold in here silicon in here lead can go in here just stuff that I don't need just to help me out do I need my radiation I'm gonna keep my radiation helmet on me just in case I need to change into it I think that's gonna be it and there's gonna be it for now yeah so I need power for this and power for this perfect I'm going to my blueprint and I'm gonna find so solar panel need to quartz one titanium a piece of copper I think I have copper already so we need quartz so much easier to see and titanium titanium is so easy to get you can go away I don't need to talk to you it's okay all right let's take this because we can just transfer that into titanium then we just need some quartz there's one bit here perfect and one of those things fantastic get out my way I love that I can get away from those things now I think I'm gonna leave it until seven minutes to go back to the sunbeam titanium titanium boom can we get copper out of this I think we can I was going to do that got some titanium she need one more piece of quartz and then we can make a solar panel I probably need a ladder as well don't I yeah I'm gonna grab a ladder too so that means we need a little bit more titanium there we go yeah there's a little bit quartz quartz quartz some beams in 12 minutes yeah we should be able to make that actually 10 minutes to be better won't it otherwise we're gonna be cutting it pretty close any quartz start yeah and that's what I'm talking about pick up the quartz right let's get back to our base then we need to make our trip to some beam which is going to be good or it's gonna be bad I'm not too sure I'm really not too sure Kauai boy Eddie the master the alonein Vulpix Michael Norris for Noi the wisp of Azarath that's a pretty sweet name Brandon flake Liana Elam and ESRI how's it going guys you said I need a what do I needs they got only freezes time for a small area okay cool the seamoth yeah I do probably need that but I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure if I'm gonna use it what was I gonna build by the way I was gonna build a nice be quick I was gonna build a solar panel on a ladder let's build a ladder first so we can get on the roof - titanium collects two floors oh maybe I don't need a lot of them where can I put the solar panel I can put it on here I'm just gonna put it there construct my dear I like how you can half build it as well wait I don't have copper or ami what I thought I had copper with me when we're going over here right 10 minutes we've got 40 seconds to do this it's gonna be okay we're gonna do it it's gonna be fine don't panic don't panic I'm just gonna go in here nope I don't want to finish the solar panel so we can get some power up I've just pushed my luck all over the place I've used it all no I've used all my copper right we're gonna have to make our way over to the Sun beam the Sun beam is oh geez I need water as well this isn't gonna go well I need a bladder fish I thought I was gonna have enough water I don't wanna mess this up I really want to mess this up I don't think it's gonna take that long which way is it it's this way let's go I'm just gonna do it we come across some bladder fish on the way great if we don't and then that's a fail copper I just got copper no way are there any bladder fish around here I desperately need some decent cave underneath as well I didn't know that bladder fish is there another way to make water oh no 9 minutes is gonna be pushing it I desperately need bladder fish though because if I die out there I'm gonna lose everything and I don't really to do that right there's bladder flesh a plenty around here and then we just missed it where did that one just go there it is it's so fast there we go got it did I I did I need some more and then we'll go don't worry oh whoa I won't miss it I'm pretty sure it's not gonna allow us to get away from here but at least we can try I thought it sort of bladder fish down here there's one it seems to be on this kind of area there's way more of them hello with 3b or not yeah three will be enough let's go home let's do this I'm scared I push my locker way too far up right let's do this I need sustenance Wright's shadow werewolf it's a birthday happy birthday derecha ski on porkin stein hilarious I'm glad you enjoy my videos stoner Joe NBA gaming take the purple tablet to the Sunbeam okay ICI gamer thank you a sloth and Master blader thank you so much guys that might actually save my life you never know right I'm not gonna need food I'm gonna grab that what you suggested so I think I put it in here see okay that's fine I'm taking this with me gold and lead right let's go to the Sunbeam guys I'm actually excited I'm gonna save actually just in case I mess it up all right where is the Sunbeam location it's over here wish me luck let's do this just checking I've got the tablet I got a med kit just in case I could make some food is fine it doesn't actually go down that much let's see what we can find how is getting low powers getting real low we'll definitely make this in seven minutes yeah definitely Kiernan ammo stuff Charlie how's it going guys we can do some scanning as well I don't know if we've come across any of this stuff before but it's definitely worth the check just in case we haven't I need to research other ways to get water as well so I don't rely on bladder fit bladder fish so much I also need to see what we can do with the solar panels obviously the power wasn't working for some reason so we need to work that out maybe you need like a generator or something not a hundred percent sure right let's change power source this battery there we go let's go and it's gonna keep on flowing we should be fine make bleach how do peach again not too sure I know you know I know I do need to find seamoth stuff that's a good point I'm gonna go under the I'm gonna go get some oxygen and then I'm gonna grab myself hopefully some more fragments of things if I go along the basement the basement the sea floor is what I meant fireball 381 thank you yeah if I go along the basement I should be able to scan some things to find as many things as I can on the way because I am early which is good always be early oh this an island this is the island isn't it is it I should have bought beacon with me this is the island do one on before Northeast's okay that is not the island we went to before definitely not we need to check that out later this is a massive mountain so that is northeast yeah we need to remember that if we get some time afterwards what is this just something yeah it wouldn't even tell me what it is so remember northeast guys does that sounds pretty intense look at this thing its massive oh and I see what is that what was that did it hurt me I think we just saw our first alien oh my goodness that was mad oh it's on here wait what aah aah boria's time he's gonna land he's got on landings go on land come on let's go let's go did you see that thing go and check my radio I can't look at it aah no I'm stuck on a tree oh geez I shouldn't have come out here should I I should not have come out here I definitely should have come out I've got to spend four minutes on this island Oh No okay this is a little bit crazier than I thought it was gonna be this is literally an alien island it's lagging a little bit's is generating new bits and what is this I kind of don't want to go near it but obviously I'm going to oh look another purple tablet I'm gonna take this sorry for the lag guys just it's generating new worlds or it's preparing a massive alien for us to fight not 100% sure oh my goodness I'm scared I'm actually scared I don't know what to do I don't know what to do why is it lagging so much it's scaring me that thing is lagging me out as soon as I point towards it it goes crazy but we knit literally just need to stay here for three minutes avoiding the big purple guy and we should be fine we did have a message as well oh jeez another crab I can fight the crabs the crabs are fine but the big purple guy I'm like no definitely not we could probably scan some things while we're here you know how am i doing tell me to sound myself but serious I'm bacteria what does that even mean oh why is getting tonight time White's have to do this to me why I don't like this I really don't like this oh my goodness master played a key on a most of Charlie chin way Lopez Wesley Ricardo Adam Fievel shadow werewolf ultra awesomeness yellow zebra beast crusher kinder blue happy birthday Roo Roo and Arlo how's it going guys see how I read all your messages super quick so I didn't get attacked by a big olds you know alien these aliens - these are cool right come on Sunbeam help me out of here I desperately want to go in there like a hundred percent the Sunbeam is like it's supposed to be a rescue vessel but I'm not 100 percent sure it's actually gonna work out that way I'm a little bit worried it just doesn't exist I did get another message but I was already here so if they've canceled on me I'm gonna be pretty upset luckily all my food is going down I'm gonna stop running around I'm just gonna crouch and that's it one minute thirty and hopefully we'll be rescued if not were a thousand oh my goodness look at it it's right there can you see it it's like on the left just below my FaceCam oh it went I have to turn to night time do I have anything good I have my radiation helmet on me I shouldn't be here I should not be here I'm glad I crafted another another battery otherwise that would have been bad got some silver as well which can't be terrible right 53 seconds the countdown to something is happening at least we know where this is this is good we need to craft the beacon and then we can come back to this at any but it is northeast of where we are in our escape pod what's gonna happen what's gonna happen Paul I really want to find out by also kind of don't I'm scared oh I'm hearing things hello something's happening something's happening that is a giant planet [Music] what is that noise oh okay I hope you guys can see that yeah yeah something's survived - Lee we see I don't know me too we broken atmosphere and we're descending towards the landing site great I think you're in trouble oh no I think I know what's gonna happen I actually think legit he's gonna get he's gonna get shy isn't he oh my god yeah hmm it's not good is it well there goes our escape plan I like this island and I do like no I don't I hate it that's scary so they've blown up now what do I do I've just watched my co-workers die what do I do I'm heading back I don't like this place I'm out of here the alien is also scaring me she's hovering around let's just go I'm out of here I don't want to see that alien let's just go keep shallow some beam is dead terrifying absolutely terrifying the olodum Vulpix to righteous dread and ember thank you guys so much Wow I let you don't know what to say oh he's an alien blimey he's actually needing behind me no no no no no no no no no yeah good fireworks right good light show that's how that's what we're gonna take from this oh man that was that was something I didn't think you was gonna be a good news but you know what we've got our home to go back to so it's fine it could be way worse got that already we do need to be looking for wreckage actually we should probably plan to go back there just because we need the wreckage to potentially scan other things that could be helpful so it probably should do that at some point maybe not now but in the future a hundred percent all right while we're here we might as well scavenge for things because we're going across brand new territory right now we haven't been here before I really want to go in that alien place but I feel like we're gonna need the radiation soup which we do have which is good but also some kind of weapon otherwise we will die did you see that guy creep up on us I don't know how we didn't kill us but I don't minds I want to find a vehicle base I need to find other things I'm gonna take as much metal salvage as I can as well it's change it to titanium can't carry loads though how intense was that guys that was actually mad I didn't think that this game was gonna be like this at all Oh almost crashed into him sorry yeah I did not think that I knew as a survival game why do you think the story was so good this is cool and I've already built the solar panel I'm just gonna try and charge it I guess it needs time to charge not a hundred percent sure man it's gonna take me some time to get over that let's go back through this tunnel and see if there's anything new down here got some courts I will grab some of this because I feel like I do need more courts the longer I go through let's break this as well that is titanium perfect we've done all this bit already we've got a need a recharger as soon as possible because I can't just keep crafting batteries especially when I need copper as much as possible ha man let's catch some peepers and let's eat them that's how we're gonna celebrate even tree fall fantastic let's empty our inventory and then we'll do it that was mad the alien was crazy absolutely crazy go inside I'll do that when I've got enough I basically got enough what's it called weapons and stuff right listen to this message while I read you all things there's an alien message oh my goodness I don't know what to say we have an alien message a ball poetry can give you food yeah I just bring you food drinks ass tread ember Cara ec gaming Dino dude thank you a Pokemon game a venule and khushboo how's it going guys um right what do we need food and water desperado what have I got me in retreat probably too much yeah loads of metal salvage let's make all of that into titanium real quick yeah this will be a video later guys don't you worry so this makes for titanium every time that's actually pretty good that's really good actually there we go sweep let's put this away in our storage locker so we got ourselves a base got ourselves a house there's still no power here look at titania my goodness alright let's get rid of the empty batteries and this for now just clean you two go and grab some food the tablets can go as well I desperately need food and water who wants it wants to get eaten huh I know all of you do and my grab trap let's grab as much of this as possible then we're gonna eat it does any of the eating give you water as well I guess it doesn't right boomerangs I don't think we've eaten boomerangs yet can you build another fabricator by the way that would be good if you have a fabricator a separate one alright let's eat I mean Gary fish true Gawain and crafting panda Ben Newell Jason rookie family gameplay hope you feel better soon assignment Kitty gang how's it going guys let's munch down on some cooked boomerang how you do so from food you do get some kind of water back that's good to know that at least keeps us tiding over for a little bit I've seen the reaper yet I haven't I've heard crazy things about it though I'm kind of nervous but kind of excited at the same time all right what's rebuild next we obviously needs like we need to find seamoth things which is something we just haven't done yet how do I connect so I've got a solar panel powers habitat oxygen generation other habitat modules so we need something pumps oxygen from a powered habitat to an attached pipe Network we need a base attached air pump don't we I think we do let's make one anyway yes so does it go on here if it doesn't I can deconstruct it so that should now have oxygen right I'm learning the building mechanics I didn't know you had to do all this okay she didn't warn me about oxygen which is goods but we have no power still how do we get power do we need just more solar panels fabric yeah you can build them oh sweet another radio as well medical kits indoor grow bed an aquarium suite trash can desk yeah how do you make more power so I don't want to keep building solar panels just in case you don't need them well I've got a solar panel I also have I have this now which I'm not quite sure what it does but hey we're working our way towards that I'm gonna go to another room actually scanner room I need to get myself a I need to get myself some more blueprints okay so you can do that I don't want to do that now though all compartments OOP your compartment rotate so you can rotate things that's goods so we could add a tube to this but I don't really need to so I just want another room I need another I wouldn't even need another hatch on it will I let's do that let's just build another room is that what I do oh the solar panels not done is it I'm an idiot I need copper I think I've got copper actually that's why thanks guys there we go sweet yeah buddy we did it sweet okay cool so what we need now is just to expand this bad boy our home away from home this is sweet right I am going to build another room I think I kind of like the tubes I kind of want some glass so I'm gonna do that right now and I'm gonna build another fabricate or anything yet cuz I don't think I need to I mean I could do I don't really know but glasses with quartz two quarts and in one more quartz to make a glass tube at you know let's just make another room this is do it cuz titanium is really easy to get hold of and I've got enough space for everything and then I guess what I need to do is I need to go back to that Island research the crash to see if they can scan anything and then we'll work from there aquarium we haven't built we need to endure grow beds it's pretty base pieces spotlight that really needs I mean we could get a spotlight we need a bioreactor at an alien containment those would be sweet right next course of action get enough water and food to go ahead and make a trip back to the island crap the beacon yeah powers at 75 that's sweet craft the beacon so that we can make a big mark where it's supposed to be empty are things perfect I just need some water I've got enough power I think actually do i how do i recharge batteries by the way guys do you know how I really desperately need that what's this cut you can I cut you thank you I've got an alien what is it I just I'm just stabbing it for no reason I can't actually grab it it's gonna grab the other things I'm trying to find the best food that gives you the most water so means I don't have to scavenge for bladder fish that much you doing let's grab a boomerang Gary fish I think is pretty good as well all right let's go back into our skate pods there we go all let me catch up let me catch up crafting panda Jason I've already done those Simon kitty Kang done I know dude LTG Eman Dorn yelled Damien and Trinity how's it going guys Betty games and jellybeans you can put the solar power anywhere on your base Thank You kyun fatality games wearing a shirt right now boy thank you Jeff craft mining times stuffy steam kauai melon skating Pikachu the blocks gamer love your subnautica videos Thank You tae jose x-gamer ex durant ec gamer there are no enemies in the gun what what hi Dan from ant plays how's it going guys thank you for the support I have glass I can actually make that glass tube already I'm not going to though what was I gonna do I'm gonna take this I was gonna make something but I've completely lost what I was doing oh yeah beacon copper Orin titanium so I need another piece of copper I need a battery charge if I don't think I've got the plans for one which is annoying I desperately need one alright this look for modules I can grab myself some copper from I can't see any down here let's go down here it was a cave down here a moment ago that I didn't even see before oh geez no no no no no they've read end they've reach end get out of here copper perfect that was a piece of copper wasn't it while I'm down here let's even grab some more more copper great just laying on the floor chilling creature egg which is cool I think I need to go back to the islands it's a bladder fish over here which I'm gonna grab coming out coming out there we go how long have we got okay I think we've got time to go back yeah I'm pretty sure we got time to go back it didn't take that long to get there did it where is my face got the copper I needed every single bladder fish I find I'm gonna pick up there we go alright I was gonna make some food I've just remembered I wish my graph trap would pick up more bladder fishes literally picking up nothing right now you know what let's move it I'm picking it up somewhere else I'm gonna put it I need to put it whether we're the bladder fish are I don't really know where they are yeah I guess I should put it in between each base so it doesn't go too far I mean let's try over here and see if that works five place go grab track go where am I going I need to go back to my pod I'm too excited about my new house that I wanted to go your probably empty my other lockers as well make new ones no messages which is good right let's make some water as much as we can let me see what the bleach is actually how do you make bleach salt and coral tube ah that's actually really easy right for now I'm gonna use bladder fish yeah I know I know I'm gonna see how much the Gary fish gives you water so I feel like it might be a decent amount gives you five yeah that's not so bad I don't actually need any other food so you know what I am gonna cook it just because we might go back to the island really quick but the only reason I wanna go back to the islands is to go for the the crash because you can scan new things not too sure it could be get into nighttime soon as well which I am worried about call these boomerangs yeah oh this is cool it's really cool art beacon that's why I was gonna do I need to make a beacon so I can find that Island again that's what I'm gonna do right now and we should have enough food and water to get there and back very very quickly right beacon grab one of those badda-boom let's go right we need to head northeast and see what this brings us we're gonna go near that alien again which I'm a little bit worried about but you know what it should be fine to be absolutely fine x-gamer X during it II see gamer and plays beast gaming super East chaser at random spirits Ben Newell beast crusher family gameplay porking Stein how's it going again a Heather Sam blue arrow place all night you know what I have heard about that game it does sound pretty cool so maybe I will give it a go actually I might be hollow nights I think they're both pretty cool it's fine as many of these boxes as possible as well because I need to scan a load a new stuff all radiation detected oops what where's that coming from I'm gonna switch I don't even have it on me okay let's go up let's go up why is there radiation happening what is going on how do I get away from it oh is it because I'm going close to there I think it was I don't have my radiation kit though she'll probably go back and get it but you know what it's fine I just want to put a beacon and get out of there explore the deepest caves in the creepvine areas you can find some cool stuff okay I'll do that in a minute I just want to paste this beacon so I don't lose this island and then we can go for that probably should have bought another battery but I really really want to find myself the battery charger like the blueprint for it because that's that's gonna be the most useful thing for me right now by far I think we should be good oh geez I don't know what that is I'm not gonna look definitely not going to look the reapers they're fantastic thanks for letting me know there's the islands this is terrifying look how deep it is as well so deep so dark right here is the edge of the islands I'm gonna place the beacon around the other side I'm also very wary of that purple guy coming back very very wary because he was invisible wasn't here and then he came out of that like nowhere I'm scared I'm very very scared I want to put it near here just because this is the craziest bit I know I can land here let's pop the beacon down and and haul butt out of here here we go okay I can hear him there is there it is there it is okay perfect right beacon is gonna go five here how do I name it I want to name it I want to name it name beacon named beacon Cray Islands perfect I'm out of here let's go yeah that's all I wanted to do that's what I came to do cuz there's aliens threatening my life right now there's weird orbs or all aliens which I'm worried about build a vehicle I need to still research the vehicle I'm gonna try and find some Oh actually yeah while we're here should we see if we can at least spot a little bit of the a little bit of the wreckage I think we might as well since we here I know it's dark and I'm gonna have to switch batteries in a seconds it might lag as well so forgive me if it does but big things went down already big things okay this is really deep look how dark it is I needed to turn to daytime as soon as possible otherwise I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in trouble where are we how close are we to the Giants lag best that is the tower we're pretty close probably too close right I just want to change this battery unload battery and then switch to this battery and switch this one to the other battery there we go I need more power to get out of here well look at this queue oh my goodness it goes all the way down no way oh look there's aliens those blue orbs are aliens I just wanted to see the wreckage I didn't know I was gonna come across some kind of alien underground base this is bad this is actually mad I'm scared I'm going back in though it's so dark that's what makes it worse but if I go any further down I think I might be in like massive danger okay we near the bottom we're at the bottom okay look at this stuff oh my goodness look how deep down we're 190 we can't go down further than to hundreds I shouldn't be doing this should not be doing this let's special equipment is required to collect this yeah we definitely need to find out what that is because it means we can collect more resources at the same time I definitely feel like I shouldn't be here but I really want to find if that was a wreckage anywhere and why is that people special I'm gonna catch it I got it that people is shining which is really weird there's lots of sandstone around here though which is kids like really Goods all got lithium your there's there's bigger things out here much better things out here I don't know what that was I smashed though how crazy is this I found something else magnet sites that's what I needed for the gun that is what I needed this is this is perfect I need to not drown down here though right let's go to the surface please good good stream thing I covered what it's called whoa okay Lennon crazy panda plush Biff skating Pikachu how's it going and plays again harmony I need to craft more solar panels thank you hacked my day Jurassic world family game playing arc idol gamer how you guys doing this is mad this is actually mad I just want to explore more of it it's crazy and we're finding some really Goods resources down here I can actually craft the gun now so let's keep on going down for a bit I've got enough power I've got enough food go enough water let's explore a little bit more I just want to find a little bit more resource because we made the trip over here anyway we might as well alright this is where we were a minute ago let's go a bit further down we might need a better mask and stuff for this oh jeez maybe not now look at here I kind of want to go close to it by I'm worried that it might kill me there's two they like the things from Avatar yeah I'm not going near him no no no no quick notes quick notes out of here I'm trying to listen for any like weird noises and stuff too I don't know what that was I'm just gonna grab anything they can with 275 meters below there it is our first alien sighting it's cool though isn't it look how cool is I'm not gonna look at in the eyes might be like an Enderman not too sure there's also another creepy alien right there or a fish I can't really tell the difference right now whoa look at that thing oh my goodness oh man the deeper you go the crazier you find stay safe I'm trying my best and definitely try my best the reapers teleport you okay that doesn't sound so bad but I mean it could be it could be like a terrible experience wait where's the rest of the mountain oh it's gonna it's gonna arrive I just got a low render distance man I'm obsessed I could play this game for hours dude just try to find everything on the surface not the surface on the surface of the ocean floor when we got here erna night perfect this is a great place to be actually because it's deep but it's kind of safe like as safe as you're gonna get diamonds I think so yeah I'm in debt of 3 million that's bad isn't it hey look at this it's like an underwater island I probably should approach this with caution but I'm not going up I'm going straight in what's down here stasis rifle fragment I've already done that but let's see what happens if we scan it might get some materials in exchange just titanium not terrible not the best whoa look at that guy he will definitely kill us a hundred percent oh ok I'm out I'm out I'm out always out that's the thing you following me no I'm good right that is what got that's what got shot out the sky I'm going back down then I'm gonna need water whoa this is getting crazy Jack and plays surface cucumber super II soul rules and desperate jet how you guys doing I'm gonna pop a medkit real quick so I don't feel like dying today and let's head down I know there's some scary's like this guy is he coming after me I can't tell ever they're coming after me or not but I need to scan this ship this is what I was looking for exactly what I was looking for here we go right this is the C glide thing was it cords I cover it I can t remember what it was called but it's what we're supposed to pick us up but did it wait wait a second this is a straight-up stasis rifle Oh prone to drill arm I've heard about this this 50% I just need one more yes this is called so this is like a big robot thing that you can build oh it's awesome I'm so glad we got that what else could we scan here open supply crate got a nutrient block fantastic that could actually do me pretty nicely I wish I saved one of my beacons now we're how far away from our original beacon are we not too far to be honest we can now make a prawn soup the prawn soup is actually crazy it's like a full-on underwater robot that's crazy I'm gonna open this as well take another nutrient block I'm I need to use that soon what's this Cyclops enging I've got a cyclops blueprint as well 33 percent right I need to go and get some oxygen real quick this is good this is so good we're finding if you don't know what we're doing what we're doing is scanning things get blueprints we can build them later on but this is perfect it's exactly what I wanted to do exactly what I wanted to do destro Jett zombie rushes Jennifer McFarlane Oshawott 1 &amp; Kegan lens how you guys doing I wish I had another beacon now and I can't spend too long here because I need I haven't got much battery left and water is running low oh geez that is not where I wanted to go this is where I'm to go I was good to say what the what on earth I feel like there might be something else we can scan here so we got ourself a new vehicle and a new blueprint for another vehicle I feel like there could be more but where is it that's a crate that we've opens there's a Scania is because why not just in case we need them in the future yeah look how creepy this is that this is actually just got blown out of the sky in front of our very eyes that's mad isn't it because another prawn arm what do we get if we scan these just titanium well I'm gonna check all of these cargo boxes I also need to not die or data box I'm gonna grab this another blueprint as well are my imagery is full I don't need this titanium and grab in no I didn't want that I didn't want that I want this perfect course we've got another blueprint as well which is goods we're doing so well today and another Cyclops engine we only need one more of these and then we've got it where is the other one I need to be careful it's not dying Lithia right drop this no no quick quick quick I do not want to die let's go get us to the surface see glide scan the ship do a self scan I will do this is interesting though I didn't think we'd be doing this today I read in toilet Mitchell and plays a mitra good gamer apex strategy how's it going Aiden plays nice to meet you guys forgive me for doing this so many times but if we get one more of the Cyclops I think that's two new ways that we could we can get around which would be amazing and then something we can work towards in the next video slash stream I'm gonna go a bit further down lithium you drop all my titanium look at this not quite sure I should be down here but I am I'm gonna see crabs - crabs I want to get out of here why am I stuck in here I just need to find one more of these engine things what have you wanted me to do a self scan so I'm do one of those it didn't have to do anything no it's not telling me anything I'd saved one more of those big engines I definitely need one why those pick that up there like in the scan this as well I'm scanning everything I find just one more of those circular engines please and it's not one of these it's like it's smaller than this I can't scan the ship come on come on give me that last piece give me that last piece you know you want to there's actually bits quite far out so there could be bits around here yep I'm going to die of oxygen soon I can't see anything when we're gonna snow no no no let's get out of here I'm pushing my luck definitely pushing my luck at least we know how to get back here because we've got the beacon I'm infected that's not good that's really not good I'm actually infected what does that mean though how can you tell oh it says Robert says infected I didn't realize I want I didn't read the screen okay that's not a good sign how do I get cured from it's from that do you know it's scaring me a bit oh my gosh I don't go into the park that thing I like under water dragons they're crazy well there's lots of little floating islands in here which is good means there's loads of things that we can discover lots of little caves and stuff too we have found an absolute gem of a place I just need to find a just one more of those cylinder things and then we're sorted for two new vehicles we can make the prawn suit which is good I don't actually know what it does but I have seen it and see what it looks like it's awesome alright let's get let's get to safety I need water as well and the cookies sponsor are you legend hi how are you I hope you're doing good I'll take this titanium why not Luke jelly beats kasi snot Fox gross lavatory us a crazy Pig and ender cookies again thank you guys will actually drop those pick up the bladder fish always pick up the bladder fish but only 100 metres away that's not so bad I should put my gyro thing out here the gravity thing there's so many more bladder fish they're doing things I read one for in terms of fish eat this oh no I went down that went down I'm gonna die oh geez quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick actually went down when I ate that you can make water need to make water need to make water quick quick quick water oh my goose honest died legit almost drowned okay let's keep on getting this filtered water I need to be worried that one of the cooked foods actually - SH - it's the OH decomposing so we've got it cooked for so long that makes sense I'm gonna eat one of these nutrient box I am going to drop this somewhere because it's just it's just rubbish we need to check I think the new plan that we got needs to be done on this mobile vehicle Bay I think so anyway let's have a look see what okay maybe not where's our new blueprints we've got more planters we know about all those scanner room we need to find a couple more bits here it is oh that's just the arm enables the mining of large resource deposits you need four diamonds which we only have two of five titanium and we have the lithium there was something I needed look at this attracts creatures to its location it can be deployed by hand or by submarine cannot be reclaimed that's cool we can make the stasis rifle propulsion cannon we need to research as well there's so many things so many things I'm going over to do this real quick just so I can put some stuff away we put some valuables away yeah I am the captain right we should have a valuable can you name these it'd be good if you could all right let's grab our habitat build up I'm just gonna make another Locker because we have so much stuff it's unreal I need to Titanium's there we go easy as right make this real well click rage Pro crazy big Malik's times to Alenia mr. jr g and TC b again how's it going guys right so you have euro nights magnetites lithium silver diamonds gold more gold copper lead quartz and put my variables in here no i just put all ores in here why not there's actually a pretty big Locker any valuables in here we have gold in here nothing else crazy led i guess i can put in the other one ba ba ba ba ba ba perfect what else do we have in this thing now do we unlock anything else I need to find a scanner room blueprints don't really need another solar panel right now star power is good we can make two floors as well which is sweet so you can put something on top we will eventually make one of these that's not too expensive aquarium that's cool that's very cool isn't it we can store that in the future we do actually have enough for that and then there's the trash carrot at the sign and shakes copper wire and a desk is just uh it's a little desk that's sweet so our next kind of thing that we want to build is where's the arm thing here it's a vehicle upgrade though I thought it was actually the prawn suit thing but it's not it's just an upgrade so we need to still find that vehicle the Cyclops engine we do need to research still I'm not sure where to what we should head to next I guess we need to just kind of go to the bottom of the ocean as much as possible so that we can just scan as much as possible I'm gonna make the stasis rifle next time just because I think that I'll be super cool bleach salt deposit in a cube we just get more coral tube samples but look at our new house I'm so pleased so pleased it's a beautiful place I also need to research a little bit more about the we're going to finds the rechargeable batteries I definitely need to grab actually what we're here nine eight nine there should be a few more where's my PDA 125 meters it's still there we've done these two why don't we go to live pod 13

our first alien encounter and we've made our our first little base which is over there which is crazy it's actually actually coming together I'm so happy next time we'll build the stasis rifle

some more later down the line but we'll find out more in this story the final battle cases final battles so I guess not the final battle with Jesse's new enemy brings the battle home to be content and the world may never be the same it is going to be insane I'm gonna hit this button and we're gonna start the last episode in three two and one let's do this here we go I'm so excited we're gonna get a recap because I can't really remember what happened it's been a while let's do this my minecraft story mode yeah it's gonna happen it's gonna happen there was a key difference between a good friend the bad one yep good friends do what you ask they enjoy what you make for them they never betray you Wow no spy betrays a perfect example of what we call a bad friend what bad friends include in no particular order Fred days I won't stand for a gratitude so I took my gifts away yes what I thought I found a promising new friend oh yes the perfect way to weed out the bad friends from the good to be became Jesse Oh friends the better version what yeah Eve or the ninja that was hilarious those are my favorite bits ever we went through the portal to the under underneath I think it was called that was pretty awesome and it adapts to the choices we make so depending on what we did it all comes down to this I'm nervous I'm afraid but I'm ready here we go what is that oh it's beacon town - whoo what he's changed beacon sound a lot as a name but we're Underground's not underground actually we're even further okay we made out we are underground these tunnels into town speaking of fighting at man I can't help but wish we still had Sara around I know she was she was a little much but having an x-men on our side seems like it could have come in handy um I can't remember Azara did which is really annoying sar has already done plenty in the fight against romeo and she's been added a lot longer than we have she deserves a break did she just go that's fair yeah maybe sorrows lucky big where she is right now she's not currently marching maybe it's been 10 the fruit counters didn't make it out of the underneath oh yeah at least to get up off the bedrock just to have the admin know we saved him Jessie when Romeo finds out what we're trying to do we've seen what he does I don't want to end up like Fred I don't want beacon town to be like Zoras town we've seen so many terrible things that Romeo is done I just can't even handle thinking about that happening to the others to our home yes things look impossible and they might be but I believe in all of us look how far we've come look at all the impossible we've already done is that good do this I know it seems hopeless but we can't give up now there are people up there counting on us we are not going to let them down here me yeah me let's do it yeah yeah I like how she's wearing her admin clothes still that's really cool I like that I wouldn't admin close but not with the admin actually in them I just want to steal his clothes pretty much or have like special Jesse admin clothes oh it would have got achievement into the ruins starting strong guys starting strong so oh oh I was gonna say sewing man but things to go real aggressive oh it's like no season to know why you do why the ends I'll do look at those admin iron golems those are cool they're really cool and they got like the Jessie thing going on as well the evil Jessie oh no please leave the pigs alone why he made them kill the pigs why why we haven't actually had much dealing with evil Jessie yet I'm quite looking forward to seeing what the others of thought of Eva Jesse where they've worked it out or not looks like he's been pretty busy building though by I'm glad they kept the cow balloon what are you nuts the best that's where the primary terminal is the giant floating tower with no clear entrance yeah probably we've gotta find a way up there might be a good idea to hit the map shop regroup or get some supplies yeah that sounds good the map shop just go to a map shop look all these banners by the way they're insane they've like got tons of Jessie faces on them I'm also not quite sure why I'm supposed to be doing here Oh guys and he is with Axl and Olivia we gotta hide what where do they come from Axl Olivia haven't seen him for so long ago reading exactly where we wanted to go then I guess we just can't get caught yep admin pig that would be cool it's solely to you do we really have to go up on stage with you in front of everyone you two are gonna need to do a lot less talking and a lot more agreeing if you want to be a part of beacon town not so sure I do actually in fact we were just about to head home I'd be very careful if I were you guys but there might not be a home to go back to at oh wow it's just so easy for something bad to happen to a town like champion City for example oh my kids that's maybe jump did he just blow it up I thought he was I thought he was joking he did blow up a city okay yeah he definitely boom Wow yep I got I didn't like you anyway but it's fine yo this guy's evil so they are trick the old friends a tricked by the new Jesse yeah he blew it up yeah he's a monster through and through and he needs to be put down oh yeah I guess you're right [Music] now how about you run along and get that firework show ready for the big team okay why what's Jessie wait she that you just said admin straight to his face maybe they do know that he's evil I'm not sure admits distracted that's good you should grab excellent Olivia while we have the chance and now get them run get out of that Jessie come on explain everything we have to get off the streets to the map shop quick that's insane that he just clapped and exploded the whole thing that was pretty cool I like that I mean that was evil that wasn't cool at all I don't know what to say admins a world beneath the bedrock use the whole series I mean I'm relieved that the Jesse out there is of the real you but but nobody else knows that what if everyone in beacon town turns on you ah with what just happened outside Axl and I almost did look the admin is good but he's not good enough to have everyone fooled right it's a pretty good jesse impression i mean a totally evil version but yeah yeah you said there's a way to stop this guy right Patrat are they being wid still maybe working for the admin at all nobody deserves that her whole city gone add it to the list of horrible things the admins gonna pay for yeah let's mess him up oh that's cute weird that the those two haven't been around for the whole season though I'm glad they're back did Jesse tell you about the potato yet oh and the underneath we got our hands on something called a word of passage hashtag potato four five one I forgot about that I know it sounds weird but it's supposed to take away the admins powers for good that'll be payback for what he's done to our poor shop is it even safe to hide out in here used to be the safest place around it's safer than being out in the open sure yeah I guess that's true getting into that Tower won't be easy hopefully there's still something useful in here everyone take a look around shout if you find anything do you guys do that I'm gonna keep watch nice okay here we go so I'm guys as quick note if you're late to the stream if you're watching live you can go backwards to watch from the beginning just a heads up speaking of heads up let's look at the heads here see what I did there surprised nobody wanted to take these too bad they don't help us though I like the ghast one that's very cool very cool indeed radar what's up buddy so we actually left we had the choice to leave radar or to save people last time and we left them there and saved radar which was a big thing I wonder if it helps in the ends or hinders just thinking about the people back in France keep that's to be talking about I'm happy to be here really just let me know if you find anything ok Roger that Roger that ok uh let's go to Jack you okay there jack ah fine I guess just feeling a little violated at someone coming in here robbing the place priceless artifacts and mementos gone everything ransacked I don't know if it was the admin looters what uh I think we've all lost up at this point Jack we're all in this together we're gonna fight back yeah yeah you're totally right in the meantime I'll keep looking around might be something useful in here yet thanks Jesse I appreciate it so are we looking for like an updated map I'm guessing so because this was the shop all the way in like Episode one of series two there's a lever so you pull this let's do it always pull a lever guys always a all Alicia hey Jack by the tides I'd almost forgotten about that stash but the white drawings those are super rare yeah got him one time when I made a trip to the end nothing better for gliding what was that yeah did you hear that sound like a robot I go there you're lighter Alisha whatever you call them as well wings just call them wings why you make me go by myself huh let's go I think it's gonna be one of them iron golems is it beautiful yeah hey you're pretty legendary yourself Jack just play it cool around him cool cool why did that change the story yes I am and you are they call me the stab Walker yes hi hello strange dad person anyway I am happy to report that your plan for the admin worked perfectly he fell for my deception hook line and sinker story about you rotting away in prison forever big success and after the admins appetite for justice destruction was satisfied I returned to the person by cover of night to free your friend from that gerson place not a surprise but this animal is quite Escape Artist I may consider naming her my apprentice I'm so sorry that you had to be left behind must have been terrible now that the team is back together I've warned we need to stop the admin we're supposed to use our word of passage at the primary terminal Jessie thinks it's up in the tower yes I believe that's exactly where it is I've heard him referenced such a thing several times no one thinks to check for eavesdropping ninjas yeah let me guess there's guards right yes yes though I requested a post there the admin appointed special golems to patrol the place okay just you sure we can't like reason with this admin guy you know I'm talking out Bertie you wanting to talk it out Jessie taught me to keep the explosions in boomtown true I'm kidding right after everything I've told you about him you still think we could just talk to him I don't know I just I just you know you cannot me how to talk about things more huh his voice is getting more reasonable than axel I'm pretty sure axel was his voice is completely different a plan you just need a distraction maybe a distraction like Jesse speak speech at the start of Jesse gone Jesse called the light your wings don't exactly go up they do in fireworks what's his neuron think you could get me a map of Beacon town is that of course there it is Wow here's the plan like Jack said we need fireworks perfect never get backstage without fireworks guilty horns so we find Stella wait oh this is actually us Bank gift Sudha this is greater swipes fireworks I thought this was like just a montage of what they could do I didn't realize what actually doing it you're gonna be getting me a bucket of water we'll get to that well we are getting the fireworks Axl and Olivia will distract the admin oh maybe they are then we wait until the big fireworks finale though what it's Romeo I promise you there will be a huge fireworks finale Petra and Jack will wait in the order hall second those fireworks go off hey let's go that's awesome yeah what's that the three of us will head into the tower and use hashtag potato four five one strip the admin of his powers simple right easy might just be the best crazy I've heard in a while Jessie this could work explosions excitement explosions I love it this all starts with getting Stella to help us though yeah yeah she's pretty tight with that admin guy are you sure about that she did see kind of powerful champions city was torn down we all saw it Stella's been hurt by the admin - there has to be a way to get through to her yeah I wouldn't bet on that well Stella does know where the fireworks killed uniforms are I could follow her to them and then we wouldn't have to talk straight can I say how much I don't like this plan you can't because you're staying here only Jessie stands a chance on the streets because Jesse is they aren't men yeah that's right Jesse you're close you got to change okay let's do it boom I know you think still is just another victim of the admin but be careful okay I think Jesse should be more worried about the admin showing up during this plan good luck friend one serving of admin coming up do this thing we've got this so he composes us but we can also pose as him which is quite cool here we go I think we should keep the posters though if we do save the day we should definitely just save them cuz they're called and to find Stella let's go so before we were we were acting out the scenario we still need to do that let's look at the booth I mean why not it's got my face all over it so that sounds pretty cool place just keeps getting weirder and weirder I do like the golems and lots where would Stella because we need these uniforms the uniforms look amazing and oh wait a second here there she is oh and their wait what what why is there two which one should I choose um talk to guards follow Stella but which wait this way I'm gonna go this way that to see what happens cuz I'm the admin I could do what I want boy do whatever I want to you the newest Jesse Kahn volunteers they await your orders not the brightest quartet in the bunch but you know what let them take the day off go slime diving or something yes yes your leader is giving you a request I want to see dives so beautiful the people will weep that's funny so the reason I did that is so that we have less guards to worry about basically now go dive in slime Punk's oh there they go that's not quite what I had in mind but it's fine it's fine Oh forgot that he gets a deport need the different eyes as well that would be handy stop doing that and get back to your posts oh don't look at me like that you know what you did look at the people in the background that's so shook okay so he just pops in whenever he wants to I better find Stella fast before the admin finds me yeah that's gonna be that's gonna make things pretty difficult because we won't be able to see them coming and if there's two admins in the same place there's only one of them that has red eyes so we're gonna be in big big trouble Ocelot poster why would I want to look at that I'm gonna go to look at it anyway I like everyone's scared of me Ocelot what is that for wait it caught me to do like the ocelots from ages ago could it that's like that's like season 1 episode 1 nonsense right there stellar is this you that's not stellar wait no I mean you could totally call me Stella though actually looking for Stella blonde hair looks kind of bow like you but but not have you seen her uh no clue bro maybe try the order hall all the big leaf grows hang they're doing there Babli grow business telling us all what to do okay it's so weird Lawrence and Stella a match made in heaven that might be her she's hanging out near the llamas we stole her llama so she's probably not to look too fond of us go why is she running away come back please come back Stella I don't like you and now you're being even more annoying let's just go Beacon town looks pretty crazy though it hasn't that she changed that much apart from the big statue at the back and it's kind of just a little bit blown up but it's a lot less blown up than champions now Jessie dude just unveiled the new statue you built oh yeah for that mean character I kind of liked the old one but whoa hey I mean you know what this one Oh can I get him to change it back to what I built you know what I changed my mind let's bring the old one back shall we dude can't wait to see it again not that you know this one wasn't like go with your gut dude especially if it wants the old one back yeah let's do it here we go I can't even remember what I built and it said my story is changing is that it is that I built oh that's unfortunate quick cut run run get out of here get out of here quick he's gonna make us change it back though no you didn't see me yeah don't say a word please don't say a thing yes he's so scared he's angry what what are you talking about what is she talking about you want to blame your insolence on me take some deep breaths okay okay we need to be careful guys uh no now whoops if I change too many things he's gonna get even angrier and more suspicious why need to stop changing things that's definitely Stella let's go yeah before I get myself in more trouble and get other people in more trouble accompanied by built that terrible statue though it's awful I'm gonna look at the beacon real quick so it's quite cool I didn't mean to get on Nellie taken away I'm so sorry I feel really bad now she got blamed for everything that I just did I took down the whole statue look at this thing Jessie caught in action I mean Jessie Khan would be pretty cool to be fair and can you stop running away from me please oh no not if we get caught we are so done we need to not get caught force them I don't care needs to be so careful guys no but those I need it I need those Mario outfits take them all take all of them perfect thank you yeah awkward Stella Jessie back so soon this is so awkward you're not the admin are you I don't know doc dot dot you can guess dang she knew your voice down all right that is bold I'll give you that coming back when the admin can just laugh you into oblivion okay give me one reason I shouldn't just hand you over to him right now what don't be like that everything you've done to me you could be a hero for once you heard me you have a chance to do good to fight for a cause you know is right come on oh look who's talking you could have supported me as a friend and instead you rejected me I can't wait until the admin delivers what you deserve she's so weird seeing you too Stella I still don't like stares the punk I'm taking these things thank you why is she so mad all the time he literally blew up her city I just stole a few things and jesse is now flying around his cringing just like I try not to cringe so at least that ain't on it now that's helpful it's weird seeing his um his voice change yeah this is chafing me in all the wrong places remind me to never ask what the right places are hey before we go back there if things get hot I want you to know that I've got your back thanks buddy just like in prison with you oh my goodness taught me in the big house no mercy no prisoners calm down buddy okay well let's not go like looking for fights though okay kind of been freaking me out since we got out of prison sorry sorry I'm trying to tone it down keep the Ocelot in the cage you know just chill keep it cold let's go to work of course we go Thanks thank you now we can get to our jobs that were totally qualified to do I [Music] promise with fireworks people that's what we do [Music] oh we need to NAV as many fireworks as possible please be some in here and then not in here there's no fireworks just stuff you wanted who plans a convention with no fireworks why can't it ever be easy please when is it ever been easy easier I can't help but notice that we still don't have any fireworks sugar cane I guess we'll just need to make some oh no I can't about me guys to grab some paper around here then all we need is gunpowder and a firework star that would really add some flash we'll keep a lookout on the exits in stage without a firework stars I just said literally just now that I don't know how to make fire hugs and they just explained the whole thing way hey at least it looks like the fireworks union guys are did you see Eve or their stars Eve always on the side take all right what color should we go for we've got orange green blue or magenta which is burst star orange ball or green creeper I think green creeper is just gonna be the most interesting so I'm gonna go for green normally I would do blue makes the firework shaped like a green creeper face exactly the blue one's kind of boring selects why is evil here okay buddy what are you doing what why I don't know anymore or what invisibility potions [Music] [Music] that's such a random random part of the story evil turns into a ninja man and he's still not being helpful at all because he has the invisibility potions the whole time and didn't actually tell us phenomenal work we have the stage wall to look at do we want to poke the creeper though I don't think we do we want to punch the sugarcanes definitely because that'll give us paper sugarcane and then we just need then we just need the creeper to die not explode though we don't into explodes let's go this way look at we don't have poked him that much guess that's part of the show admin me has tasted after speech entertainment yeah nor any file I just poked him so happens oh ok stupid that could have been amazing I didn't say poke that sword it just kind of said poke so I was a little bit worried do we want to talk to these guys I don't know hold we just want to carry on one oh they're coming this place is just kind of messy well just be like the noble light of truth and shine through the darkness of the mess only then will you scatter the shadows and reveal your goal deep yeah I'll work on that good dear friend I'll keep on keeping an eye out we're actually pretty done I don't want to waste too much time just in case someone comes I don't think there's gonna be anything in here no guts yes we're good right let's go I don't think me anything else I'm worried that I might miss something that we helpful later on let's just open the chest just in case cuz you never know copy of Lucas's buck our owns this chest must be a fan what oh that's weird so we've seen the ocelots the I saw head and also Lucas's book I wonder if that has anything to do with the story there'd be really really odd and annoying I'd kind of like Lucas and I think he kind of helped us out a little bit so it'd be really annoying if he ended up being an absolute Punk wouldn't it oh it's great paper so we need to do more paper as well three paper I can't even remember how to make a fire work paper sugar fire workers just one paper how many do we need though we've only got one firework star let's just do this see what it does create I think we need to now there's a firework nice that's massive I'm Glenn good job buddy I just wanted you to be safe just maybe try not to hit them so hard next time okay that was brutal that was awesome good job right uh that was actually pretty sweet yes did you get the bucket yeah buddy okay we have a bucket we have this guy yeah good point just really true okay like tuck him away somewhere Roger let me let's have fireworks so we didn't pretty good thanks radar there's fake me a fake Jesse there we go I wonder where the finale is gonna be all strapped in fireworks ready why why do you make it so obvious Jessie we want to talk to you more about how great it is being your friend he's you know something's up we gotta go now just go do it light him light him up q yeah there's the firework the creeper face as well and we're out of here that's pretty cool that's actually a legit minecraft strategy as well you can use the fireworks to make you all a liter a fly faster it's very well what's going on what are you doing oh the buns I just need to know no careful oh don't fall off jeez smacking oh actually hurt him I didn't think I was gonna actually gonna work that was close okay time to get the others ah yes right let's food the that's poo let's put the wards are down that it's not poo that'd be terrible this is gonna be really obvious though and that's a pretty amazing building I wonder what's at the top maybe a theme park that would be good yeah fizz pop miss bunsall rounds 1 2 you Committee was a little strict come on let's get inside alright radars hiding a body not a dead body hopefully just somebody knocked out let's see what's inside this tower I'm actually pretty excited that we can use the hashtag potato for five one I think it is okay but I feel like there's gonna be some baddies in here first this place is dead definitely strange though I imagine you might be relieved to have a little quiet right now don't I was almost expecting I don't know another huge boss battle or something when we got in here same the admin definitely seems to like those but no it's kind of hard to relax when you're in the middle of infiltrating a humongous tower owned by a deadly madman as you try to find his office and take away his powers yeah fair that's true yeah something weirds gonna happen guys I'm calling it now okay what on earth is this boring those cubes nether bricks it's so eerie oh yeah there's definitely people here ninjas oh no we're about to get jumped yeah there they are look wait no hold on that's that's the person from before [Music] what's what's happening hey guys what's going on stand-down ocelots I told you looks like the tables have finally turned on Jessie we can't let you keep doing what you're doing that's enough now sorry I'm so confused I think you're confused me but we're not confused we know exactly who you are now hang on everyone no it's our turn to talk not yours not anymore I reformed the ocelots because I wanted to remind everyone of how things were before and most of all I wanted to remind you know Jessie I know wouldn't be running around on some power trip locking people up Lucas so yeah I set your prisoners free what are you gonna do about it yeah Lucas would you please stop talking for two seconds and just let me explain and there is the new Jessie I've gotten to know lately everything you think I've told you since I came back from the Ice Palace was a lie the admin locked me in a prison underground took my identity came back here and pretended to be me Magnus no how do we know this isn't a trick no trick friend and it's not the first time my friend Voss the admin did the same thing with him yeah we saw the whole thing is this really true all those horrible things you did that let's get real huggy up in here okay yeah it's you I thought you turned evil for a sec that's sorted out what in the world are we gonna do next wait why are you even in here we're trying to get to something called the terminal we have a word of passage potato that we can apparently use take away the admins powers for good yeah a lot of that was way over my head especially the potato but I'm in you just lead the way and the new ocelots will have your back okay those a disaster averted we now have a massive army Romeo's quite the Jesse memorabilia collector I know we don't have much time but it might be smart to suit up properly agreed oh we have to choose again oh my goodness is so many dudes what have we got we got redstone riots golden Goliath and the defender star shield shield of infinity and mantium impervium that's pretty crazy Ella guards armor Timms armor sword breaker or dragon's bane now I think the last time a lot of you guys wanted me to choose dragon's Bane when we got to choose armor so I'm gonna choose it this time I kind of like I really want to use Tim's armor but I know we've used that before there's no pink variety I'm gonna go for Dragons Bane let's go let's do this who's this dragons pain you're copying me buddy it's good that we have an army now though I've show you the good one you look like you're ready for a showdown let's go thanks guys that's the worst like to battle thing ever oh dude beginning quote sortie I don't know if you can see up the achievements or he's saying 5 out of full for our 5 unit why hello there wasn't expecting you showdown it's about to happen what's the move here Jessie maybe you're confused but this is my office hang on let me try and reason with him hello Jessie it's over admin we're here too excuse me excuse me we what are they where'd they go oh I am so upset that you're back that wannabe ninja Ivor told me you were still in the sunshine Institute he did made me feel great you go played this makes me feel the bad it's called a hustle admin and you fell for it hook line and sinker what better way to sneak back into beacon town right under your my nose oh you smug arrogant insignificant what pray tell are you hoping to accomplish by challenging me I don't know if you've noticed but I'm just a touch more powerful than you I know that's why I'm not here to fight you I want to talk this over Jessie Jessie talking it out what's the point in that that's what losers do real people awesome people settle their differences with with no you're not doing any talking right now right now you're just gonna shut up and listen nah you don't tell me what to do that's not how this works bro this is getting intense oh here we go he's back to normal Wow please have to listen to this stupid versus day after day after day just asking for things to do [Music] that's what being a leader is Romeo it's not all fun and bossing people around sometimes it's hard it's what it's terribly disappointing is what it is okay it's just it was fun at first to show them some super amazing display of my awesome powers they laugh I love but soon they were just asking me to do that all the time you know it's funny you made me see something I mean it's starting to feel like maybe I should just leave being Jessie to you why the genuine article what's your angle here this is a trick right nope no tricks now angles no games just good old Romeo telling it like it is what this is all been terribly and mining and I think we've all learned some great lessons push him off that I will totally remember four nights on push the ball next time yours oh I'm gonna get it totally no whole new world oh I'll be a great leader a great friend next time around I should thank you for all these these wonderful little lessons you've helped me to learn there is no way I'm letting you do this oh well you don't really have much of a choice do you sorry but it's time to start fresh make a new world he's gonna bedrock over our town dears that's mad Oh No what is that doesn't seem good oh you guys are okay yeah he just flipped us back to the hallways again they're gonna blip them anywhere such a jerk yep coulda just pushed him up though I mean he can't fly but that's oh I guess that wouldn't work but hey oh dude he's actually burning it already he's just like you know what delete delete the whole thing eternal darkness is happening again we're going to the underground this is no good this is really no good is they how do we get how do we get above bedrock again there's like no way find the terminal space oh yes potato the roof that's where the admin keeps his portal to the terminal thing go come on we need to get to that portal before the bedrock closes up let's do this the epic music is dying guys are you ready for a finale I am let's go quick go go go go go stay safe okay what is Lucas always get left behind always there we go through the portal just run just jump don't even stop just go there we go get in Jessie just please loads erratic pauses please there we go if only I brought another pool to actually look like that would have been pretty sweet and it's already and glad I chose this arm it kind of matches the surroundings made it we're here yeah we don't know where here is is this cool this is the end car looks ND whoa check this out this is cool a pony that will add dimensions like this in Minecraft that'll be so good clock from the admins tower Rises the trip down memory lane is nice and all but how do we find the primary terminal thingy more stuff in here huh well it's the admins place right so what would he do he'd probably know where he was going so it's just more of his stupid recordings oh it's like a automatic assistant or something weird like Siri welcome to terminal space nice that's cool man the admins are Punk'd but that is a cool base it looks like I'm like a testing ground for all his builds because we've got the the clock and we've also got the the big totem golem thingy as well okay first made all this I was still hoping his friends would come here to this is mad makes me feel bad for him actually nobody ever said it was easy to hang on to your friends look this is the thing that they tried to kill they tried to kill what's-his-name in whatever got in his name you know the nerdy guy they tried to kill him with that just making me walk really really slow though radar that's his name it is like a testing grounds cuz that the ghast was there too the black glass with the red eyes and the three heads that was there too so that's where he kind of builds all his ideas just kind of like his own personal world which is pretty awesome like a testing world whoa either code I think I know what's gonna happen I know how to unlock this we got this get ready password that must be the word of passage hashtag potato four five one here we go so we can put the potato in here right guess we need to put something in there to get this thing going potato potato it's empty what I mean it must be talking about the potato right sounds right to me potato please it's like a vending machine you talk to now I'd be amazing in real life like him a vending machine you just be like potatoes give me some sweets and he just dispenses and poison one which one do we use I mean the word of passage didn't say anything about poison but it did have that weird hashtag thingy that might mean something oh I don't think that symbol ever actually means anything yeah and I figure out which one is correct surely it has to be the normal one right surely ah let's place the normal one because I don't think the boys ammeter is gonna be any goods let me place it let me let me place it please why would it there we go yeah this is right potato uh-oh still need to enter the rest of the word of passage so there's four five wall right or not till I do all right here we go use this is so hard to do wait what four five one do we just have to remove all of them like this let's see I don't know how this grid works otherwise hmm don't think that's exactly right oh no place poisoned one let's try this one I still need to enter the rest of the word of passage know if this is right or not till I do Oh No ah grid look at is this thing do I have to make a hashtag what does it have to do with potato four five one we got four five one but I think we let me put this stuff back here we go can you make a hashtag out of this by using one and four I don't know how do I do that make a hashtag what out of all of this though I don't know how to make a hashtag oh all of this that's crazy four five one I'm trying to figure out I have no idea doing the right order four five one tick hmm don't think that's exactly right I'm gonna try to run a hashtag I don't know how you do all of this though this is gonna get me stuck for ages Khepera guys we're in for the long haul but if it's not by doing it with four five one a hashtag is like I didn't know how you make a hashtag out of this you can remove this cuz it's only three whites only right for five one I don't know if you can write that either you have to do it straight that's so weird though like this that's exactly right number of blocks four or five one I have no idea what you guys talking about from left to right what do you mean how do I let me reset it then we reset it real quick so you do left to right four five one maybe do it fourth down fifth down first well there's so many people going through this okay here we go go back I want to go back hmm don't think that's exactly right so random let me change Mateo though I don't think the poison material on me this'll do the trick oh I see what you mean now I still need to enter the rest of the word of passage I think I've got it this is right or not till I do come on so it's the opposite of what I've been doing you don't take away the blocks you leave the blocks oh wait that just that just ticked something didn't hear something green in the middle one is right ah I didn't see that at the top then dude this is so confusing oh wait wait four five one so does that mean that the right-hand column is right oh that says a1 I'm just straight I've guessed it now guys five so if I remove yeah so these ones are right it's just this one that isn't right I'm just gonna have to guess I have no idea I can't even guess what this would be so confused if you got any ideas guys remove it's definitely a pattern oh I see I think I've got it now yeah I was confused by the numbers on the size I was looking at in um rows and not columns that makes so much more sense thanks for you help those I'm guessing that's not quite agreed sorry parrot what we just initiated a parrot party sounds good to me perfect okay so that's right we just need to put the poison potato in there we go there we go good thud or a bad thud it's Fred Fred if you're seeing this recording well I guess the worst has happened and you just put the word of passage into the primary terminal I wish the terminal could just take away Romeo's admin powers it'd be easier that way but making this gauntlet was the best I could do Oh put your hand into the pedestal to receive the copper it's got the power to make Romeo normal again it might take a few hits to remove his powers entirely but it'll get the job done do you understand sure thing good luck sorry you're he's made like a golden gauntlet knows nothing here we go there's me the second oh okay Oh oh good we should stop you Romeo once and for all I don't you you will stand okay they're alive quick get the gonna get the girl quick don't waste the chance to get the golden gauntlet let's go yeah this is the second gauntlet that Jesse's ever touched and had on his hands yes wait oh five out of five I'm gonna punch you in the face do it man she's gonna just bear with me oh no it works we can actually smash him he's clapping again someone's over it in the system what's it just happen a sea temple Callooh Callay remember when we first met he's playing mind games that was back when I thought we could still be friends [Music] this this oh it's going to be where I bury you um rip rip oh my goodness big things happening this is insane can you notice mica with the Borla anyway try it I think it works that's what I would have done it did work it's bullets amazing still use the gauntlet no smacking all that eight Mottola is mad absolutely magical he's like glitching out this is pretty epic like really you know what the snowman is one of my favorite characters actually I liked him a lot we're in a boss fight oh here we go hit the flames back okay let's do this there go slice that was terrible Jesse what are you doing buddy here we go here we go this is fire water why can't I hit them back oh I have to a closer there's so many of them though yeah haha slice and dice buddy see the Snowman four most powerful one you're doing pretty good though I think we have lost too hot that's fine oh oh what are you doing stop that stop that instantly jeez okay when you do this again we need to get close and then hit them as quickly as possible now get to him and slice them please get up like every time how do I get close he's got a nice bowtie as well I like it don't let's do this here we go here we go nice nice nice slice get him come on yeah we don't even need to slice them we just need to smack him in the face with the gauntlet like the glitches snowman in the world Oh [Music] oh it's going back to this thing so let's just let's just chop you real nice it's just like an old-fashioned Minecraft Jules whoa okay can I get him I think I can get him I just need to dodge when he lunges forwards that's got the real Petra those are we good whoa get him yes it doesn't show how much help she has come on come on there we go this isn't so bad this is much easier than the Snowman the Snowman was more powerful than you yeah we go I don't know how many times are gonna have to hear but we're it's he easy I can just slice it she does some good dodges but I've got the Dodgers to punch we just need to keep punching it with the gauntlet though because otherwise it's not gonna go well come on finish it finish it come on come on come on BAM this is the big punch whoa what does happen this is what is going on I can't use your powers Romeo time you paid for everything you've done forgive him no no this guy's tripping badly why he it's a snapping ass all over the place he's looking pretty bad now though it's gonna make us choose to forgive him isn't it we still got some kind of abilities though he's like throwing rocks and stuff what is he doing just throwing rocks okay that's fair enough we're just gonna come up and smack you square in the eyes buddy it's gonna be fine it's over here we go sock it to him buddy we've got this it comes the music are you ready if all you can do is throw rocks no this is blowing my mind guys what is even going on but I've got to impress it I'm pressing it so hard yo the flying diving elbow drop it grab it but pound do does that big is he done he looks like missing no from oh look it's the original guy why do you have to come make everything so difficult everyone likes you and you're nothing hey we're not the ones trying to rule the world what no no I'm not I just wanted people to oh jeez okay I thought that's gonna be the end therefore not it's the place falling down this place is held together by my powers no more powers no more terminal zone they tubed we're gonna if we don't get out of here pronto what about him what about him he's not our problem anymore but look at him he'll never make it out of here on his own oh she's right just just leave me my powers are the cause of all this in the first place don't make us choose please please to make his shoes I can't believe that this is what it took for me to realize oh oh it had that kind of power in the first place look at where it got you yeah yeah and it'll all be over soon oh my goodness don't make me choose just leave him behind please leave me ah stayin apart we can decide what happens to it later oh yeah we can decide later that's true that's true I'm gonna take him with me I'm too nice aw come on story is changing great I hate you when it says that they either means you've made a very good already bad decision awesome let's go come on Jessie come on buddy go underneath good roll you know what I'm glad I saved him just with that roll that was amazing I'm glad everyone said save him because I didn't really want to do that jump jump jump jump jump that's a full block jump buddy you can't do that in Minecraft or maybe five I don't know you definitely got you fired how could is how can he still have powers the doing stop to like these crazy golden as well did you just destroy the portal as well we're dunzo it's over there must be something we can do there must be and we got the gone let's go I don't really know oh yeah I've been saying for you okay he's he sacrificing himself today's guest quiz I think it has got squished hahaha oh man this is intense so intense so the adven is got what the admin has no powers anymore so he's not an admin but he's still someone yeah and not a minute too soon what about the but all the bedrock disappearing I was gonna say how are we gonna get rid of all that come on calm down everyone calm down you got this it's gonna be ok they're freaking out what is he doing y'see the power lord it's all too quiet guys save the world again huh doesn't that ever get old why yes thank you for noticing thought we'd fit in a light bit of world-saving before afternoon pie time happy to see you all in one piece too I could go for buy out the admin did did he not make it crazy as it seems at the end the admin sacrificed himself yeah Romeo ended up saving all of us seriously that doesn't sound like the admin to me it was actually pretty noble I tried to save him bring him with us but he didn't make it out I feel better now you way better a good person for trying Jessie well I'm just glad that all of you are ok and I guess I guess this is all over yeah yeah I guess it is bertie what do you guys say we head home I say way ahead of you friend me too it seems too easy guys it seems too easy I don't know what to feel right now what is happening they're rebuilding which is goods are they actually gonna keep this that would be quite cool they they didn't really need to build it so they might as well I like the cow balloon is still there I saw the whale balloon earlier as well which was awesome looks like they're rebuilding it there's classic Jessie oh we're gonna say from this direction coming to speak with you no ninja trickery hijinks or tomfoolery here yeah I mean I mean you're right there I can see you I know I know but I'm trying not to sneak up on people anymore no more ninja ivor then huh no no I decided it was time to stop running around in my pajamas and start trying to fix a few messes starting with trying to heal the rift between my old friends Oh Magnus is easy we'll just pop by boomtown no man that's awesome they're gonna be so excited you think so that's certainly the way I'm hoping it will happen well I suppose it's time for me to go this has been fun though hasn't it yes hey what's up radar was just saying goodbye to he's gone guess ninja habits die hard I hope you don't mind but I've kind of been taking charge of the beautification project I thought why not at least make it look intentional really stepping it up the leader mode if I do say so myself true it's been stressful but also fun you've definitely been stepping it up really proud of you I just realized they put trees and stuff on it that's cool I like it you know what's good that is the real Jessie we don't like the real Jessie remember really just ignore these losers and be on our way do you understand Stella listen I'm really sorry about what happened to don't even if it wasn't for you and your little gang telling the admin off in the first place I'd still have my home you coming sweetie say no good girl we're going to rebuild champion City together and it's going to be wonderful and Stella is the absolute worst can't believe Luna went with Stella after everything although I guess she did get left behind in the sunshine Institute true yeah now you got everything you need all packed and double-checked yes Jack this is very bittersweet for me goodbyes are no good yeah so I won't say it this time not to people that I will see again you got it come on walk me to the gate oh so she's going off in adventures that's cool so you're leaving apparently for how long honestly probably a while but it's good this time I'm doing it for me I'm trying to like grow or whatever anyway I'm about to say goodbye to everyone and I miss myself I wouldn't cry it'll be okay so Petrus heading off into the great unknown I figured it definitely sounds exciting everyone's got to find their happy place for Patrick's mostly and unexplored forests and caves yeah I think I'm closing that chapter of my life for a while it's time to settle down here hey you guys are missing out on Prime group hug action yeah you don't think this is like the last time we'll all be together do you know well maybe I don't know I mean if Petra's leaving well I mean until the world needs saving again that always seems to act as a nice reunion hopefully hopefully not too soon though okay well I'm gonna get out of here bye guys be safe out there okay the safest and when you finish that book of yours I better have a great part back in the admins cabin I know you promised that we'd always stick together but the invites still open if you want it no pressure what to go with huh wait am i ah I thought it was just gonna be a peaceful end now it's gonna make me choose an ending ah what are the two choices stay in Beacon town or head on adventures you know what I feel like this is setting up for I think this is setting up for I don't know for him to just take over for radar to just be a leader so I I don't know dude I really don't know what to do I'm gonna leave this up to you guys what do you want to do I'm gonna go Jetray is happening that's so funny Jesse and Petra it could you it's up to you do I go or do I stay I leave oh my goodness loads of you are saying leave pick Petra people like Jessie and Petra together oh my gosh I'm gonna leave I'm gonna do it it's up to you guys I'm clicking it I think that's why we're gonna hit the road for a while so pretty awesome right story is changing hold you radar danger could still strike at any time what do you think pal you really yeah I hereby promote you from intern to hero in residence thanks boss this that you have been you are what I'm trying to say is that I promise I'll make you proud you already have Hey so cute I'm gonna miss them too but if anyone ever really needs me I'll be around it's a cool ending I like it [Music] this is it guys this is what you wanted the ship is happening no regrets no regrets see you like you can just come back any time it's not like I'm leaving forever I can come back bye everyone bye bye Jessie hey dummy gonna wait up for one [Music] it's happening it's happening [Music] I was kind of hoping you'd be interested in a race yeah I think we chose that yeah we chose the the good ending guys which what they're both good endings we saved the world but I like the ending a lot I'm glad you got me to chose that because always I was close to stay in really close is that it is that the end I think it's the end it's getting the stats you and 49% decided to be by petrol side no matter what it's literally 50/50 guys we chose the 51% though so uh Wow yeah that was close really close it's like it's such a hard choice it's unreal what other things did we choose you and 50 all these choices are so close you and 50% let him become the man in charge 51% encouraged radar to be his own man and these are gonna be really close so close I guess this is the day before it comes out at you comes out tomorrow so I guess not loads of people have played it but still you and 49% wanted nothing to do with Stella so she embraced her dark side oh I didn't know that happens so she could be really different I didn't know that that's really cool yeah not many people played it so all the choice is really close we showed Zahra that there was hope in the world I think that was the right choice really like a really good choice Oh 50:51 took pity on romeo and pulled him out of the voids I think his um his ending would have been the same no matter what you led with empathy and protected your friends no matter the cost see I'm a nice guy and this game proves it what advice did you give jack play it cool ok let's say that everything's like 5050 so it gets like no one's played this year so you can choose what's that one before did you confront the admin oh yes you could just like attack him instead I wonder what happened different then and then 51% so most people have chosen to leave so far and that's it there was I'm asleep pretty surprised it didn't give you any kind of indication whatsoever whether there would be a season 3 because before there was obviously going to be a season 3 but this time there's no indication whatsoever none at all I buy another season I mean by season 3 I meant another season wow wow wow wow we're done here we're actually done here story mode season 2 almost at season three story mode season 2 is dunzo it was good you know what I'm glad it was like a way more positive ending because the endings of season 1 was really sad like crazy sad we saved the world the bad things happened poor Paulo porkchop Reuben bless his soul he was kind of in like the beginning of this anyway but guys that is going through the end of this stream at this video and this series so far of course if they do release another season I will be at the first person on it as always thanks for sharing and this opportunity with me to play this game with you guys because I'm glad I was allowed I was able to involve you guys and all the choices and stuff like that especially that last one

also I've got myself this mods it was already in the pack I just didn't press the right key so we know all the recipes now but look how many things are in here it's insane you could you can catch a swordfish cold and bread what you can make golden bread that is insane actually insane are they gonna do ah yeah it's gonna sell this bread right let's go to sleep and see how much we get 2,500 to 4,000 six hundreds that's one thousand that's two thousand one hundred for every set of cucumbers that we farm that's phenomenal I wonder if they wait a second you not we need to buy do you know what we need to buy when it gets to the right time we need a magnifying glass that'll be phenomenal I also feel like we need to make another farm I am going to put it um I don't really think this through did I guess we could put it over here and then put another house over there I think I'm gonna do that right it's time for me to buy things from you I think let's see what is here we've got ourselves all kinds of seeds and rice balls that's cool this is what I was gonna buy the crop reader to get info about it is one thousand but I bought it anyway let's see what happens shall we I want it we look at my unicycle I thought you'd run away don't take it I'm the only one with the unicycle please don't take it I want to right-click and it says stage six out of ten that's amazing so you can keep these here and then wait for days and they just keep giving you money I am happy about that that's actually so cool we do need to sort out the bed situation soon as well and all I wanted to talk to you live the potential or unicycles Stealer how's it going buddy I need to you by an animal ranch and a poultry farm now I don't know if when you buy these you get more because I want to get a blacksmith apparently the blacksmith is amazing so you can buy weapons rather than crafting them and you can buy ones that are better and upgrade them it's something I really need to do but I don't see it anywhere here we only need a hundred wood for each one and gold ain't gonna be a problem when we got these suckers over here oh my goodness Candice has a small store with pets you want to buy some sure thing oh dude here we go here we go she sells inventory pets this is amazing oh my goodness 100k that's because you can fly what what is it slow ty no way Wow can you hear that the rain is almost coming through my ceiling the house pet to teleport home that's pretty cool this is amazing 1 million for the Illuminati pet spawns a random item and has a 2 minute cooldown we just got some money don't we this is cool though good to know thanks Candice see you later I need to not do that cuz I almost died every time ha ha seriously guys can you hear that I think my roof is gonna cave in it's raining in the game and it's also raining in my office Oh bloods mad now that's over let's let's spawn the goddess thing and see if she has anything else to say because I want the blacksmith I really think you should be able to farm flowers it's just not fair is that all you say don't forget you're going to want a poultry farm okay so basically I need a poultry farm let's do that in shall we an animal ranch cost six thousand and a hundred words we need ten thousand gold and two hundred words simple easy ah yeah look build the general store build the animal ROM build the poultry farm okay I need to go and do a lot more action don't I come on now this is not the time for messing around tree felling is a dangerous sports okay I'm glad I spawn back here great now I've lost all my stuff you lip don't even laugh for me please don't don't look me in the eyes well that's two deaths ah you again Charles good job you found another rare specimen he's back I can see him a little bit closer now there's the tuxedo rabbit you show me where another piece of wood is that I missed ah bless him see you later tuxedo rabbit I will capture you one day one day you'll be mine 64 + 62 plus 64 plus 18 equals 208 we have enough we have enough wood to be able to buy this thing we just need the gold I'm also very fatigued should probably sleep I will go down here at one point by the way I just need armor and stuff that's why we need a blacksmith so I can go exploring where do you and rocks keep coming from what's going on can I pick them let me see what happens if I pick them what is this it just it just drops rock like what he's placed him down again I mean it's free rock I can't really complain let's sleep to be less fatigued and my cucumbers have got a couple days left what are you doing in my bed that's a little bit weird sure it's not go lie these rocks are getting way bigger that's a medium Boulder the real question is where am I gonna put this ranch when I've when I bought here because at the minute I was gonna put something here but I think the ranch will just be better when it's in a row like making a full town to the side down one lane and around this this would be sweet can I afford it now actually let me have a look I reckon you should get an animal ranch built you can learn about cows and sheep ha ha ha I just need him to wake up he needs 4000 for the poultry farm and 6000 for the animal ranch I'm gonna go big for the six straight away which means I could do with some more seeds how much do the seeds cost me Jenny Jenny where are you she's down here like always how's it going uh uh your stores not open on a Sunday Joe anything I can sell you have sugar and bone mill uh butter can I sell butter I don't think so right let's just sleep twice oh it's too coach and then get our money for our cucumbers then we should be rocking and rolling in money lots of money I don't know why I feel like loads of these have died for some reason I'm not sure what's going on there but let's uh sleep and I think the next day it's crop in time I think that's I think that's what you say with farmers now we need the lingo oh those don't actually look that healthy do they they died what they died how why did they die I'm so confused I'm so confused I think I need a sickle now so I need to build I think I need to craft the hoe I'm so hungry time to farm yeah but real funny real funny yeah I like it okay so where Jade I need to give you this thanks for the hoe oh you just gave me your hope okay I need shears don't I thank you it also just disappeared on me again thanks for that right let's hope this doesn't disappear otherwise I'm gonna have to try to grab it for myself right shiz I think if you give Ali's the shares are great have my spare sickle yeah buddy that's what I'm talking about I don't quite know what it does I think it destroys the dead thing yeah it does okay so we need a sickle to destroy dead things rest in peace money comedy that just happens or so everything needs to be done in like in threes so let's make sure we've got this right shall we see they just change back to shares that's annoying right so before you see all this and freak out basically if something disappears I'm gonna have to just throw these away so these can go to the deepest depths of the ocean didn't need you anyway and I'm just gonna have to creative mode them back in because otherwise I'm not gonna be able to keep the things that she gives me which is really stupid just a little glitch the way you're gonna have to deal with well what is happening what is happening oh it's summer summertime right let's get um let's get crazy I guess excuse me guys I need a little bit more space up in here I need to I need to make some more fences because I need to keep all this safe from everyone I've also gone over my god s pool by accident but that's that's fine there we go right that should be good I'm a little bit worried there was the light level that killed them so I'm just gonna do a few torches like this just to make sure there's enough light level there and let's buy some things it's Tuesday it's time enough to buy Jenny I'm gonna buy something from you welcome how may I help you you can sell me some things so we need to make sure that because we've changed seasons we can actually grow the things that we buy for example the hemp seeds they need to be on a light level of 12 plus and they can't be grown in the winter wheat seeds can grass seeds corn seeds I think grass doesn't need watering for some reason but we know oh she's changed them cucumber ain't a thing no more it's it's onions tomatoes and corn nice I think tomorrow is going to be the best so let's let's buy some too Oh seeds Jenny coming up I need to wow that's that's close I need some tomato seeds I need one two three four five that uses up some of our money but that's the way it's gonna have to be here we go one two three why is it created a dead bush there's a little bit of a glitch going on here isn't there and now just mess that up oh my goodness this isn't going well it's stolen some of my seeds what is going on why is it changing to turn pushes what is happening duh okay I think I fixed it I had to go back in and try and make sure it was okay takes ten days which is fine requires water yes seasons summer yes I just need some good old cash let me get some money hopefully this works Travis is still in my bed and I'll see you when I've got enough why are they dying why are they dying what is going on when it is branch come from I'm so stressed crop is dead thank you through the info Wow I'm not sure why it's dying what am I doing wrong the other ones seemed to be fine maybe it's the light level is the light level different yeah look the light says zero that's not accurate though is it why is the light level zero I don't know but I'm gonna continue trying to nurture these Tomatoes so we can at least get some money out of them huh Wow where did you come from where did you come from no this is not fair this is not fair go away go away this is the worst minecraft day ever you think this is funny buddy you think this is funny there's a there's a there was a spider here you saw it right you saw a spider and you didn't even jump in and save me get away from me you get out of here with Stone soils leveled up that's great it should be the day oh look at these beautiful absolutely beautiful right I deserve some Tom's look at these yes Arthur goodness 10 days worth of grinding just seeing all the dead bushes in that I can't believe so many of them died it's just it's not fair it's just not fair I'm gonna have to see it fix the next time but we got ourselves 41 I feel like that's loads I wonder if these will die even if I water them there's only one way to find out because it would be awesome if they just replenished every three days after that initial time if not there's something wrong with it right let's pop all these in here I think we get 60 for each one so that's like 600 2,400 maybe it's a little bit over let's sleep and see how many crops we've killed how much money we've gained we gained quite a lot around five thousands oh it looks like they may have survived let's do it see what happens when we water them I don't want this to die please don't die I'll whisper to you every day if you just don't die actually I'll sing to you I'll sing sweet nothings into your ears maybe it's because I'm standing on them all the time if any of you guys know why my crops are dying considering that's a real big part of the game you could please let me know cuz I'm struggling it says two more days and these ones come back as well got another tomato for you what is that we can buy from you actually you left you'll if I need to talk to you in two hours yes look we're getting some more Tomatoes tomatoes whatever you call them we get in more of them I like to call them Gold's just straight out gold so if this works then those those other plants are definitely glitched because their light level is saying zero so I guess I just need to put this tomahto away and see if they survive I think we've got one more day and then we can get them roll near the money rolling in the money rolling in the money okay this actually works this actually works this is perfect this is where we get the money from loads of tomatoes with the seeds and oh wait a second I've just realized why all the other ones died because you couldn't use them in summer I am so dumb see I'm a beginner farmer beginners can make mistakes it's just these other ones that randomly died I don't know what's going on with them we've got money for days guys if this happens I've got 40 tomatoes to put away and we should get loads of money I don't know it won't make us go up to 10k though so I might need some more I will one of the plans from you left us we can get on with it but let's see how much money we make huh I'm ready I'm ready shower me in gold five two five seven up to seven six that was 2,400 that's actually amazing why are these things bothering me so much I want to see if you can get a sprinkler or something you actually can how do you get one you can't craft it so there must be a way that you can get one that would be amazing wouldn't it cuz then you don't even need to worry about it'll be like when it's raining every day guys look while I'm waiting for you lips to open you can actually sell berries I don't know how much they can sell for but look you can get berries from them blackberries red berries this is awesome okay so I can put these in mean to look out for those and try not to destroy them then I carve up blackberries in though I'm just gonna nom them just nom them all up the pond can have one as well enjoy you lift my main man I want you to build something for me here we go we're gonna buy we're gonna buy the animal ranch I think it's gonna be massive though I'm worried it's gonna be actually this ain't so big this ain't so big at all how much more area do I need to clear out I can have them touching like that that's fine we need to clear out up to here let's just make a little guides this is actually fine here but it needs to go back to see here right let's clear this out real quick right I think I've done it let's have a look here shall we I need was it there nope it wasn't there it was here right yes yes I could out way more than I needed it's clear of the bees as well which is goods in line with the general store as well and I think we've got ourselves an animal ranch guys let's shift that's right quick and you live spring into action buddy you could do it you can do it there he goes no basement this time this is a straight-up build you live as a champion right I'm gonna sleep real quick just to see how much money those berries got me I did one tomato and a couple of berries like nothing it's ten each actually that's pretty good its money day it is money day at get out the magic stomp is here which means it's time to collect our winnings all the tomatoes in and let's see how you lives getting on with the animal ranch through this is looking cool very cool indeed what are we gonna do about these bees I need to check how many days there are in a season so we're on to 17 so far which is pretty good right - 4,200 I just need you left to finish this than I could build another one things are going well finally I think you Liv's done I think he's done oh I would pat you on the back at GE go Pat's sorry buddy did me tell you who is this animal ranch open Monday to Saturday from 10:00 until 3:00 so we're open a gym you ain't got any animals in here everybody he has got a lead oh I know what I'm gonna do with this which I will replace by the way if I do use it soon right Jim how's it going you don't just sell animals we sell them strong I want to shop please right you sell treats oh my goodness oh my goodness you so cows and carrots and stuff and nametags who sells sheep as well bro we're about to be best friends oh my goodness if I didn't have another building to supply then I would buy things from you I got even speak I see you live he's eyeing up my um my unicycle again let me just talk to this guy I need to buy another building and it's gonna be the poultry farm but uh boom it worked I had enough wood after all perfect so the poultry farm is obviously gonna be full of eggs and stuff where should I put it obviously I found out why the fishing wouldn't work the other day as well because you need a fishing huts basically so I'm gonna put that in the middle over here I need to make an area where this can go I feel like it's gonna fit well kind of like here but obviously in the right place it's actually massive it's really big that's crazy right at least we have it though I feel like we should have our first animal but oh I was like Candice how's it going but I need to make my farms bigger as well it's kind of annoying that I put my farm here cuz I can't extend it that way but I need a bit more farm I need to you know if I can extend it all the way through there that would be amazing I might work on that you know I think I'm gonna do it right let's unicycle on over to the brand new animal ranch to quit this video yeah I need suggestions what I'm gonna call this series if I call it anything I might not even call it anything it'd just be like just be a 2 or 3 day check in there every week to see what I'm doing in Minecraft I guess hey if you enjoyed this video like see some more please make that like that'd be greatly appreciated and exams be the first bit it seemed I mean please do consider subscribing to join team TDM today for daily and videos next time we are going to make the poultry barn buy some animals and capture the tuxedo rabbit that's what I'm gonna do anyway guys thank you so much watching like will be awesome and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] 
but where did you guys come from weird so I feel like we spent a lot of time with our neighbor over the past I don't know like year or so you've got to know his creepy self quite well well today he's invaded my x-box that's right hello neighbor is now out properly like it's fully out the previous versions that we have played have actually been the the beta and alpha versions which means it's before release but now hello neighbor is fully done and hopefully a lot less glitchy than normal but it's here I'm excited and instead of playing on a PC over here I thought we'd go ahead and play it on a brand new console as well because it's never been out on Xbox before so let's hit play and let's see what happens the artwork I like it eyes even go like a title screen and stuff it didn't have any of this stuff before it just kinda went straight into the game looks like his basement door has changed a little bit there's a bird inside which is a little bit odd but let's hit continue and let's see what happens I have no idea what goes on in this game or should I say what's different to the the previous versions at one there's cutscenes - okay let's see what's going down there's never been acts before carry our child is that a child we have someone running to get the ball we've seen the ball before hey that looks like the neighbor oh wait I'm playing oh dude that's me those are my feet so my ball went down here somewhere this is cool I like it what does this say though siming or missing that's that spot wrong isn't it looks like there's two missing children maybe there's posters everywhere this is cool wearing brand new contents straight away we can run jump all that good stuff oh there's the ball it has stopped I recognise that car I also recognize this house actually and that's a pretty oh-oh I'm a little bit ugly aren't I one of those noises oh it's him what are you doing oh he's panicking and there's I guess is that what the player is is this me as a younger version of the player was it gonna be that there's the famous basement oh my goodness someone's screaming and I think they're behind that door you should get out of here oh Jesus jeez I can't even run I can't even run what happens what is he locked his baby behind a door are you insane are you actually insane what did he lock me by in the door oh no it wasn't me this is me right now okay we've seen something pretty weird can we go in here I don't actually know the controls which is a little bit awkward but look at this my new house is looking phenomenal this is crazy the whole fridge going on beautiful I like it I'm very very short though I definitely am a child this is so weird there's not much inside my house I could just quickly look upstairs there's a big bedroom which is nice and a random really badly placed all another bedroom as well so do I live here my parents I'm not quite sure let's see what the neighbors up to here we go this is the car we have seen in previous games and it's been so long but I think this is one of the beta houses I'm pretty sure let's see what we can pick up I want to pick up something to throw out the window can I pick this up I certainly can there we go I am so confused okay he's in his living always found me is family run run he freaks me out so badly I'll destroy you punk with a bin lid I hit him I can't remember how I got in here before it's been so long let's just run and see what happens we've got windows we've got something real crazy-looking here oh geez yep yep he's gonna catch me he's definitely gonna catch me oh oh stay away buster you stay away from me okay can we get onto the roof using that because there's definitely a hole in the roof I literally cannot remember any of these things yeah there's like a platform that you can raise to go up to that window we just need to get inside this place that's run while he's doing that oh ha ha we're inside we are in side there is a a bowling ball I am gonna take this I don't know why there's a padlock there oh geez oh geez I'm gonna throw out I'm gonna throw I'm gonna throw eight bowling ball punk get out get out what is that what was that did he throw it tomorrow at me dudes is that what he just did sorry about your window in advance buddy cap how I'm flying though absolutely flying did you see that oh my goodness he definitely still throws glue though that's that's inconvenient let's see if we can get in this window am I too small no I'm not I launched I launched and I don't know why all I guess I walked in on him taking a poop I'm sorry I'm sorry did you see what ah where am I this is freaky I was just about to say did you see how far I launched but some things something's happening here it sent me into what is going on there's TVs on the ceiling and there's Oh what's this can I jump through he's getting in his car why though and look at this doll this doll is freaky I can't get over here so he's just like he's just sped off in his car this must be like some sparking story did he crash was that that was a wheel wasn't it it was look he crashed into do you crash into the piece of truck Buster you shouldn't do that no one's gonna get their pizza now are they oh my goodness what is he doing no was that please let us say his kids in there something bad has happened guys something really Bad's because serious my thumb is looking so he's crashed his car he hasn't like crashed it terribly I mean one of his tiny wheels came off but something insides the car has happened that's really Bad's yes we should go through here and find out what happens it just sends us back okay that's weird something something Bad's happened to this man I think it might have been all his fault and it involves a car crash which is you know it's actually pretty terrifying okay for this bit I need a wrench I'm pretty sure I need a wrench to get that open there's also something in here Oh guys check it out the wrenches in this room and that room is guarded by a silver key I think how on earth do I get in here there's a lockpick or do I need the magnet I'm not too sure there's a lockpick on the top left definitely a shovel ah man things are weird there's also this thing I don't know if this has anything to do with anything right I'm going up I'm gonna try to at least how could I do this up here yes and what is roof guys oh geez can I jump over this bit I did it okay right I'm gonna throw this right at this window here we go that's through the big mega throw as well when it goes white around the edges Kapow yeah that's what I'm talking about there it goes into that tree our only problem is I don't know whether the neighbor can actually get through those top windows right your buddy Phil I can play em for tonight right now being on the Roos trying to find out where people are let's just go in and see what happens we've got a switch that's good I'm just gonna pluck that right nice perfect I don't know what that does I heard noise though we've got the wire that goes through to this bedroom which is locked okay that's bad anything else we can use in here books portraits big pictures boxes absolutely nothing but there is a fan here which doesn't actually work why would there be a fan that's random wait a second did this open down here what did this open what it what is this I'm so confused oh oh okay that does something as well there's a secret wall bro this guy is freaky really freaky where is he though I don't want to cross his path I think we're good I just need to find something to unpick that lock with right because I need to get in there you got anything in here buddy anything it's all no that's fine right under the bed I'm under the bed you didn't see anything oh geez okay there he is you didn't see nothing buddy get out of here get your sprint early legs out of my eyesight okay he's gone and he's pretty much just taking the gramophone off okay it's playing music I'm not sure that's the best thing no no I found me you punk oh geez look something else is happening so the more you discover or the more time to get caught the more you find out the story oh geez oh I'm small I'm really small what is he doing dude he's rampaging around hello why did you grab me like that huh I'm gonna put this in my house this is mine now bit crackers alright guys we made it we made it we're safe what do we do no no way are you kidding me there was a look there's a fake painting here the whole time yo we need to jump into this right now I didn't know he went upstairs but now we know so yeah we made it with our crore of a hand intact how do I get through here yes I made it okay let's be real quiet whoa Oh a key give me this key what could this key before it's like a red key there's the there's a yellow key as well so I can open this no that's just placing it what now this is open forever right yeah buddy that's what I'm talking about okay what else do we have we have this does that make the fan go it does why would we need the fans ago though that's really odd it's really weird being this smoke so I'm used to it being a taller character but hey that's fine we've done that we open this no we can't but we do have this key now I wonder what this key goes to could this key be the one to the door there's only one way to find out and that's by doing this quickly quick a quick use it use it it's not the key to the door hold on a second is it for the car that's the only thing we haven't tried and the only other thing that we'll need a key can we use it here no what about here that's work yes we got it we've got the magnet thing oh look at him looking you just broke the roof guys mad absolutely mad this is exactly what we need we need the lock pick let's see if this works jump up here crouch give me the lockpick here we go let's see if this works I got a crowbar okay that'll do let's take that can we take anything else yeah we've got the lockpick as well beautiful can we take the wrench we can't take anything else right that's all we need though take this and the crowbar as well we don't need this key anymore so let's swap them out let's drop this and let's grab the crowbar don't know what I need the crowbar for unless it's for this nope not for that um oh jeez what could this be useful I don't know but we need the wrench so we need to use this lockpick right here to grab it let's try it let's try it yes open the door into my face okay open the door please and let's grab this before he comes and finds us there we go do we need anything else there's a shovel as well that kind of freaks me up I don't think I need it just yet guys we're doing this I'm getting out of here there we go right let's go upstairs oh my goodness this is cool it actually works right I'm gonna hold this crowbar just in case he comes a-running and let's see what happens we're on the we're on the full roof and we're gonna go in here oh I see okay so this is this is the room that we couldn't get into before there's a chair in the way so let's get rid of that really quickly pick this up put it down grab the crowbar just in case okay so this is like a child's room I'm guessing we've got a real creepy little doll which is a little bit odd what else are there a key do I need what don't I need anymore I don't need this we can kind of get back here any time anyway I'm gonna grab this the red key actually we don't need the yellow key let's grab this instead I would grab you you're a little bit freaky and I don't really need you red key that's all we need isn't it that's all we need to get downstairs I'm pretty sure I like this drawing a lot we've never been inside this before I like all of these drawings the person the kid that was in this room is very very talented there's that bowling ball again as well more drawings mustache paintings he's proud of his mustache isn't he right let's get downstairs and let's see if we can open this door that's all we need to do where is he where is he let's get in here and listen for our ears we need him to go into his bedroom then we could just rush in and go into the basement then hopefully we get ourselves a little bit more story let's see where is he is he in here he's not let's just do it use open don't throw the key oh my goodness why do you throw the key go we did it we did it Oh what's gonna happen oh I'm excited okay we have entered the basement we have no items I'm pressing the buttons we have no items it's just dark and I'm sure we're gonna hear a little bit more about the story I don't think we've ever seen this before there's a giant boiler washing machine nope that's not a washing machine it's a secret door of course it is what is happening here guys this is so weird someone's camping someone's camping in this room and the outside is fake that's not even real there's a pictures okay uh what can we do here sleep basketball I'll take the basketball I don't know why I'd take the basketball can i oh is this one open let me see if I smashed a window I can okay let's get out of here yeah I don't think I should have done that maybe I should have on the other side it's a fake room it's a full-on fake room oh I don't even know what to think about this guys there's candles there's weird weird stuff going on here what happens if I pull this down why would I pull that down this goes up into the roof ah this is creeping me out it's like a door here but it's so dark I can't really see there's also buttons here as well I think I need the power on for it let's see what happens yes I need the power on so don't turn the power off note to self can't open this door is there anything behind it yeah a big chair and a pipe but let's see what else is here oh my goodness why is this so freaky this is actually amazing though I did not expect the full version of the game to be this crazy I've got a TV remote but I can't use rubbish let's just head this way I mean what else could we do this is also blocked this is all the same room that's blocked in oh my goodness guys this is the door no that's just a standard fridge or is it it's a little bit freaky red light is on that even

shivers guys I'm getting shivers up my spine this is too weird way too weird should I have bought the shovel with me I feel like I need the shovel something happened in a previous in a previous game where we needed the shovel do we turn this on let's see what happens I don't know if I can turn it on I can so we can have a shower that's great let's uh it's fantastic I've been here I haven't been through here hello mister neighbor what are you up to buddy this is just a black room oh my guess there's so many doors this one's blocked and is not even a way to see through the keyhole oh man oh man what are you up to buddy you are freaking me out oh geez is that a torch yes oh good that's a torch flashlight even that's perfect I can see a little bit more now everything's like a fake room it's really odd oh I've been here yet there's something something happening here I don't know what that is it's like part of a pylon maybe things are buried oh my goodness what since when did it get even freakier playing hello neighbor this is making it out to be like a completely fake house like everything about it is completely fake that's slightly worrying there's still so many doors as well oh oh is this like a fake living room it is with the TV remotes drawers I don't think there's gonna be anything in the drawers I'm still opening new doors as well cuz I'm leaving them all open oh I got shivers there's like somewhere we can break through power oh I turn the power off what if I press this what does that do oh my goodness how do we get there there must be a way to get there hold on that's the exit door so we definitely need to go over there there's just oh that's a mannequin that's freaky we need to go over that side somehow I want to see if I can throw something at this yep definitely can do that dude I don't know what to say this is a blocked door though because there's a there's a chair on the other side hold on a second this might be the door I haven't used yet or is it the mannequins here I feel like it's this way yeah we haven't seen these yet are the baseball machines the shelves the fences here we go here we go I've turned the power off of an eye yep I need the power back on why did I turn the power off this is the exit it's right there oh my goodness right power back on that'll be fabulous and then it should be up here and then we're done I don't know what we've done but we've done something how you doing sir you've been lonely in here with all your chairs aren't you right okay we're not done yet Oh are we let's see see what happens yeah guys we're out of here let's see what happens oh I'm not controlling this this is a cutscene oh he found me you found me let's go let's go oh my goodness no I need to run I need to run run run this is freaking me out the chills are real no no I have keys I had to have keys that's not good is it whoops I wonder if this is act 1 done or whether we have to go back find the keys and bring the back so we definitely had a red key we definitely had a yellow key but you can't take items into the basement so maybe not act 2 it was all a draw maybe not look we're inside somewhere we've got the grossest legs ever a big toe and really raggedy clothes welcome guys to the room that we were in before oh man this was the room that we jumped out the window for ax2 insane very insane so guys that is the brand-new hello neighbor game it is super cool even though we played loads of hello neighbor already this is really really good it properly sets the story out properly rather than having to speculate and guess and abuse glitches and stuff this is like a fully fledged game I'm surprised it's out on xbox I'm pretty sure it's out on ps4 it's out on PC as well wow that was really something and if you want to see me a complete to the next act I believe there are three in total I think it's said in the game description then please remake fat like also leave a big fat like if you did enjoy this video

all night this Christmas update is here you can be the traditional rugged looking male you could be one of the brand's new super cool looking Knights but why would you do that when you could be a gingerbread man let's go I'm a gingerbread man and the Christmas of day so battle royale in for tonight is live and I'm super excited literally because I've been playing this all night yesterday and it's a lot of fun like the Halloween update was pretty good but this one is even better there's a Christmas tree ahead of me what more could you want I'm a gingerbread man there's also which is the goal of this video a brand new umbrella you can get also if you win in this battle royale during the Christmas update come on give me the stuff give me the stuff give me the stuff anyone else coming down here huh yep there's someone right there here we go first kill maybe and he's a knight these are Knights let's go before they pick up a gun oh geez that was a that was a sniper get him get him get him I'm a gingerbread man gotcha okay so there's definitely someone with a sniper we've got ourselves a green AR which is good we're in the circle which is also good the only problem is I really wanted to get into that house and I think someone's already there yeah your Christmas trees gingerbread man and a brand new umbrella that I really really want to get only problem is I still haven't won another game okay you know what I love this game but it doesn't love me give me this please yeah I'll say I need some shields I got some shield let's glug this the new sound is amazing there's already only 57 people left and I need a shotgun I definitely need a shotgun and right there can you see them just over there I don't know if I should take shots but I think I'm gonna whoa dude he just took like all my health how did you even do that bro now he's lobbing grenades are you crazy No someone came from behind and killed the gingerbread man and he had to okay he had 200 health we're done gingerbread man does not look happy does not look happy at all you know I haven't actually tried the female version which has a lot happier face so I think we might just be a little bit more friendly there's also the brand new snowball weapon which we should be looking out for - but apart from that Christmas trees Christmas bushes gingerbread men lots of Christmas all inside fortnight let's go back in here's the Christmas bush check it out you can actually when you get the bush item in fortnight you can actually become the Christmas burst which is quite cool and the battle bus the music's changed which is quite calming which is weird for fortnight but look at his face it's absolutely beautiful and so is the rest of the bus that is that's awesome gingerbread woman away oh no oh no I messed this up I went really far away from the battle bus and now I'm flying into a tree Oh No please be something good in here please be something good in here woods fantastic shotgun okay could be worse I'm not hearing shimmerin I'm not hearing any kind of shimmer in no I'm gonna die mind you I don't feel like many people have dropped here I saw someone off in the distance just now I can see a chest right in there so let's just grab some things to go could have been much worse oh yes could have been much worse give me these things shield as well that's what I'm talking about okay things got better and I actually much prefer being in houses than anything else just because you can build into the roof all that kind of thing right let's just drink this and think of an action plan going into the roof that's exactly what I just said I was gonna do and I'm gonna do it there's no chest up here but I like just having like a big open look at everything getcha Barents see if there's anyone sneaky peeking around hey I'm the gingerbread woman I could do what I want okay that's what I like to hear there's definitely a chest in here but it's here it's upstairs there it is come to me a bush perfect I don't know what's use I'm gonna drink this just because I want to and pick up the Bush perfect we're inside the storm as well this could be a much better game we just need to find where that other person is only 34 people are left already how the storms only just started coming in you know what let's just collect some things while we can we need resources something I failed to do almost every time is collect enough resources and let's like kill people I don't actually have enough resources to last the rest of the game so that's something I definitely need to get better at another medkit yes we are stacked guys right another thing I've been doing is resource management so I can get a little bit better at that choose my weapons quicker but it's oddly quiet here like really quiet this is not usually a quiet town but today very very quiet okay we're like centre circle so I don't really know through there's only 23 people left already that's actually quite insane I'm gonna put it out there I think that other guy has stayed here and is going to start sniping people I don't really need those that's terrible terrible chest cured amount to ammo though my goodness right I'm gonna open this up I have like a good AR I don't have a good long-range weapon but this could at least give us some some view points this is actually the craziest game guys I've not felt like I needed to move because we're like prime position for the next circle and we're in the top ten already this is a this is a fast moving game and no one has stayed around here all of this destruction around here was me or me oh the next circle is over there I might actually make a quick step because I want to get the high ground I need to be so careful though why does it have to be dark I hate it when it is dark in for night it's just so much more difficult oh there's snipers going off is that someone there's not someone up there I'm concerned very concerned okay there's definitely someone up there there's someone on that high bit already where do I want to go I could go up there oh no there's someone where are they where are they there they are get them I hit a tree I actually hit the tree oh my goodness that shielded yes Oh water kill what a kill oh my goodness right I'm not using the bush I am going to heal this is dangerous I can't believe I hit the tree that is so dumb okay we're good we've got a cure now I really want to get up on that mountain but I feel like that is gonna be so dangerous I'm gonna have to start moving in in a second though gingerbread woman I have faith in you do I want to get rid of the bush I'm gonna become a bush I'm gonna do it let's quickly become a bush let's not get trapped in the storm and let's go I'm a Christmas bush guys watch out I'm basically Christmas please don't hurt me people have me yeah we're good right oh there's someone right there I don't think they see me boom got him I got him do they see me though I am gonna get caught by the storm let's be super careful guys super duper careful there they are there they are there they are there they are let's go let's go let's go oh no no not not like this not like this not like this they had 15 health I should have just got up I should have just gone up there's also these weird new emotes the dropping into the thick of it guys Pleasant Park on a drop where you drop out as soon as you can this is gonna be it's gonna be mental dare I go for the Christmas tree I think it's gonna be a bad idea because it's like four or five other people here but everyone's gonna go for the Christmas tree I'm not going for the Christmas tree see you later buddy see you later you know what ironically I don't think anyone went for the Christmas tree hello how are you see you later sorry about cutting your game short I know I know it's annoying especially when you get killed by a gingerbread man things are getting busy out here guys there's so many people that landed here because it was the initial drop oh hello I see you down there how are you sixty-two not so bad oh-oh-oh gingerbread lady taking no prisoners Wow this is where I die isn't it this is where I'm gonna die hey there's a bush there's a push right over there can you see it is running it would be amazing if we could kill a Christmas bush where did he go there he is he's right there can you see him I don't think they've seen me yet let's go for it here we go here we go almost almost almost let's build up come on let me build let me build they're running away no I am not letting you kill me bro I am not letting you kill me yet ana he okay I'm in big trouble right now I should not have taken him on like that I should have gone up but hey you know what I made some mistakes and I'm gonna pay for them now I'm gonna use your little box that you made so that I can you know heal a little bit yeah okay I feel good about this one I'm right on the edge of the the circle as well which is perfect but he didn't really have much on him this is a super obvious place to be so I really want to get I want to get up here I think yeah I'm gonna get up there we cured a Christmas bush though I kind of feel bad but I kind of don't okay this wasn't actually where I was planning on going but this is actually much better how could you not see me bro how can you not see me how can you not see me please don't kill me oh my goodness no you're dead you're so dead yeah buddy Wow I think he was aiming at someone so I need to be super careful as well but man that was sweet when I saw that gun on the floor I was like I need to be careful dude and then I thought he was there are you kidding me right let's build this bad boy I think he was peeping someone because he was so like he was so distracted annoyingly no shield no medkits someone's in here I don't know if I can shoot them through that window though what are you doing what are you doing look out for any stragglers there's definitely someone in that building who we can see I think they might have seen me so I need to be even more careful there's someone over there as well shall we get him whoa my sniping abilities aren't great so I'm just gonna have to be confident and just try oh I always over judge the drop okay they're trying to like that are they I see they think I'm still there can you see them okay I might actually get out of here because I don't need to waste my time with that guy I'm just gonna lose I also need to be careful not to get stuck in the storm because that's would be ridiculous is a bush right there can you see them there's a bush right here whoa where did that come from okay we are in a sticky situation guys I'm out of you know everywhere I've got no shields and I know there's a Christmas Bush down here I don't know what to do here we go here we go no Christmas I'm so mad at you so mad I didn't Christmas buzz christmas buzz I am trying I win this game I'm gonna take a different approach I'm gonna go all the way down to fatal fields and just take it from there because I enjoy going in straight away but also it can end very quickly no matter how good you are if you're just gonna get destroyed so yeah let's not do that on McGuinness let's head all the way to fatal fields and see what happens you know I think we're here by ourselves so that's lewd up and I know there's someone there right I'm going for the tree every time I'm going for the tree this is Christmas and there's only there's only one gun here why is that I'm going for blood guys I'm going for Bloods they're definitely in here somewhere there you are how you doing buddy yeah I almost messed that up so badly let's just hide in here drink our potion and I don't know how I messed that up but I hit the roof many times there could be the only other person near us though so we should be fine right I need a med kit please okay you know what not so bad I have three a ours which is insane but you know what we've gone from 9 health to 109 not so bad the real question is is there anyone else up here with us or do we have pretty much free rein on things I really wish there were more chests near the Christmas tree let me down the house looks unlooted let's do this and as that sound we like right let's grab the chest and I think we'd be in for a pretty good game as long as we get some kind of oh yes yes please as long as we get some kind of healing we should be fine nope that is another AR that's great you know what bandages will do though we're inside the circle as well perfect choice now we just need to see who comes here and we to protect our fields I'm renaming them to gingerbread fields that's what's gonna happen here that's what's gonna go down I'm feeling much better thank you Oh another shield is well glorious ah all right another chest oh my goodness this is definitely gingerbread fields if I mess this game up I'm gonna walk out the room the video end and I'm not sure what also happened but I'll be it severely disappointed in myself get out of here oilless epic Oh what happened to this bath it's so yellow that's insane good thing about fatal fields you near the ocean so you can be fairly sure if you cover your back there won't really be anyone there so you can just look forwards where else haven't we been we have been in this big red hot yet so let's make sure that everything is secure cuz I really read I want to mess this one up and let's go Oh fatal fields is in the next ring as well right on the edge that's actually great I'm gonna go up here I'm gonna set up camp inside this house and I've got this the only thing I'm really missing is a sniper but you know what I feel pretty safe here it's one of them awkward situations where I'm already in the circles so I don't really need to move that much I just need to kind of hold fought right need to look out for stragglers guys any stragglers around here or looking to get shelter from the storm huh no good good for you anyway excited asteroid you Punk's all right where we going to the prison ha ha ha someone's building over there I didn't want to go to the prison the prison is such a like a weird place there is some high ground there though so I guess we need to make our way there by the way check this out I love learning this if you play fortnight Wow okay baby dot I was gonna say if you play fortnight learn how to edit your buildings it helps so much and Here I am just failing to show you what you can actually do so you know what I'm just gonna jump out it's fine too risky but someone's got to do it guys we just need to go we're pretty sure this area is clear anyway so it doesn't really matter I'm gonna take a little bit more of this thank you and let's go this is definitely gonna be another top ten yeah that's what I'm talking about we've got a slurpy slurp you know what let me take this drink it just to get the HP back then I'm pretty sure we'll be at 101 hundreds right this is really really open I'm pretty sure everything's goods not much high ground for people to snipe me off oh dude I hate this I hate this so much having to run is the worst stick to the high ground stick to the high ground and we should be fine right there's another chest here as well I dunno one to get caught out I just need the ammo and the bullets that'll be fine take the bandages as well and I'm running the wrong way fantastic twelve people left someone's definitely up there or died over there Archie's lots of actions gone down here guys but the high ground is where I'm going someone's definitely died up there but no one's collected the loots that's so weird no one be up here no one be up here did they get sniped what even happened here I mean I'm not complaining I'm gonna I can't even take it I will take your sniper though there we go semi-auto very nice not really sure where I'm going there's someone right over there I can see them they're right on the edge of the storm just like me there they are there they are there they are no no no don't do this to me don't do this to me oh my god someone right out in the storm and there's also someone behind me dude this is weird this is so weird is someone in there I can't really tell but I also need to get this person who's near me where are they what was that what was that oh my goodness I am terrified dude we're in the top 10 though so we're all goods oh look it's all right here are you kidding me hello see you later buddy yeah oh my goodness I can't believe it I didn't realize that was gonna happen that's fine though absolutely fine two kills nine people left I am a little bit worried because I've got not really that many building materials I'm out by myself and people already have buildings up there there's two supply drops coming in which are Christmas presents by the way I don't think I've ever actually said that I kind of feel like this guy had more stuff did he have more stuff he had a few more building materials but not really anything of notes I don't have any jump pads or anything Eva so I need to be super careful there's something in the middle that I don't really want I think I'm just gonna have to play this super chill what happens happens there's two towers next to each other that people are just rushing in on so it's just be really chill and do this I wish I had a bush right now actually a bush would have been amazing I don't know if anyone's in that tower or not I feel like there maybe not bro there's a jump pad right there right here I'm gonna quickly just build around myself and I have an out there is a jump pads if I play this properly I've got this let's drink our potion oh man this is the best game so far I just need to wait this out builds and then put a door in here perfect right this is gonna work I think this is gonna work when I get to the jump pads right there so I need to do it just before the storm comes in people have shotgunning each other the prison is not a ending at all because it's so concealed oh I've been sniping going on as well we're top five guys top five four let's see how many people can kill each other before we have to use the jump pads there's some crazy explosions going on right let's go we have to use the jump pad now we have to use the jump pad now here we go guys let's do this makes me so careful right let's build something up probably should you use brick for the bottom but you know what it's fine or it's not no it's not let's go let's go oh geez okay I'm in big trouble I need to get inside a building really quickly they're coming in they're coming in come on come on come on come on no I'm gonna get you I'm gonna get you oh jeez this is terrifying actually terrifying he just fell all the way down I am NOT going to fall with him somehow there's still four people left I'm not quite sure how where did he go where did he go I'm in big trouble I could get sniped - any second guys like that exactly like that oh my goodness oh my goodness no it was you it was your log our shelf did you have how much shelf 75 yeah he healed up oh that we came forth that could have been such a good game I just didn't have the resources and yet a rocket launcher there he goes oh my goodness he's gonna oh I thought you had them see why I mean though the prison is nuts even if you have a rocket launcher you have to hit everything multiple times because it's made out of solid brick it's really tricky where are they this is the tiniest circle ever where are they the circles like so small it's getting even smaller where is this other person there's two people in here dude are they they either in the storm or like above and on top of each other oh where are they where are they they're close or they are literally on top of each other I need to stick around to see what happens this is the smallest circle I've ever seen oh my goodness it's so small where are they what what is going on oh my goodness the circle is they must be below they must be you can't even see the circle and the map guys that is insane oh it's covered in it's coming in what you're gonna do please be careful is I built the whole way around the circle I'm losing my mind how there they are there they are you got them you got them go no how is this gonna end I'm so sorry zero this store is zero Lauer's nuts actually nuts they fell out and then go killed by this storm in the for damage like it that was sweet guys unfortunately leave that there for today I know we didn't get with a win but we got like three or four top tens which you know what I am happy with I don't claim to be good at the game I just find it so much fun I hope you did too if you did and would like to see some more fortnight where I try so hard to get that Christmas umbrella and please do make 5 thumbs up that'd be greatly appreciated and if some to be the first video you see why me please do consider subscribing to join team TDM today for daily video as part of that guys thank you so much for watching have an amazing day and good bye 
Hey guys! So last time, we checked in with the neighbor. He was uh...... He was homeless in a subway station. But is okay, because *laugh* because today, the doctor got a brand new job. He is a doctor. He's gone from having a big house which I sold all his things in to homeless to now having a...... doctor's degree which is pretty insane, so Welcome to Doctor Hello Neighbor, which is another mod and is actually the one that won the Mod Competition run by the people who make hello neighbor, so I'm just gonna hit play and the...... Yeah! Things gonna be...... Starting off a little bit freaky. This is not what I was expecting Oh and while you're here, and if you haven't done so yet What are you doing here that subscribe button a for daily videos by me, let's see what the neighbors up to today? I'm scared :( Are these drawings of body parts? What! That's a! That's a stomach or a spleen and that's a human. We have a baseball. I'm gonna grab the baseball, which is fine. We've got pictures. Is that a pencil. Yeah, I'll take the pencil. Everything so dark! Why is there a bed here? Did I just hear something? Is he mad that I stole his pencil? "FIND GENER-ATOR" Okay, let's do that. Ah, that's why it's so dark, there's no power. Wait hold on! This is an IV drip! What was I in this bed? Um...... Okay, not too sure about this already. There's a book and also yeah, I can take the syringe I'm thinking that. This is creeping me out. It's got the winds noises as well. What on earth is going on here?! What is this?  It a...... Oh, is a underground or underwater. "Pulbis in spiritum". I have no idea what that means. Could I just get out of here, please? No, I was not expecting this! This is crazy! We can't go through any of the doors. We can't see through any of the windows. Oh geez, okay. Yeah, I am not. I'm not feeling this...... Hopefully if things get too scary, I can just stab the syringe in my arm and put myself to sleep...... That'll be...... That'll be perfect. Or maybe this whole thing's a dream. Who knows? We can't open any of the the cupboards or anything and oh my goodness! What's?! This is like all warning signs for explosions...... electrocution and fire? Yeah! Things...... Things could get dangerous today. I thought we were just coming to visit the neighbor it is brand-new job it turns out his new job...... It's crazy! We're gonna have to go down here as well. I thought this is a generator is a periodic table It couldn't be more wrong. Down here?! Is this where we go? I literally can't fit down there! What even is this? It's like a door to somewhere with a massive light bulb with an eye, its like the Illuminati! The illuminaty! You get it? Ha, ha! I can't open these doors. I can't read these books...... I can...... Oh, what's that is that? Oh no! No no no no no. it's so dark! I don't even know where to go? Can I break something maybe? Let's throw a pencil with this window? Yeah, I didn't work...... :( The baseball? No? Oh, wait! Look at this. There's a button. I can't actually press it though. I can't put a pencil on it either. Um...... So we can open that but it won't actually let me press the button yet, and now I can't pick up the pencil. That's....... that's a shame. What if I throw this at it? Come on! No, can I just push this out of the way? I can! Why did I think of this before! Let's see we can go down? Yes! We can I really wish I had a flashlight right! Now all I have is a syringe and a baseball. Oh, my goodness. This is terrifying! Where am I supposed to go? Neighbor, are you um? Oh jeez, what's this? There's a flashlight! Can I grab it? I'm gonna grab it. I'm gonna grab it. I'm gonna grab it. Grab this, turn it on. It doesn't even work! Why? Why is this happening? I literally cannot see a thing! It say one. Okay, there has a big lever here. Let's press this. There we go. Okay, no noise. Oh! You released him! What? At  least it's bright now. What does it mean you released him? Find and use four fuses to get out of here. What? But my flashlight doesn't even work! Ok, this is...... this is gonna be more scary isn't it. We've released the neighbor into the wilds! I thought...... I thought I was just gonna join him for a day of work, it turns out he's got...... bigger plans. Wow! Look these stuff. Born...... to kill. Okay, uh? Man, you know what, I'm gonna take, wait. What is that? That's scary! No. No, why is that even there? You know what? At least we have power now, so we can see where we're going. The only problem is I'm a little bit worried...... As to what on earth...... where on earth the neighbor is? Oh! What is this? This is insane! Actually insane! There's fish on the wall, a bug, a stingray  and a frog. And a...... and a bird. Excuse me, sir. Do you know where the 
fuses are? I desperately need one! What's up! What? Where did you come from? Dude! Does it start me again? Is he gonna start me again every single time? Please no. Yeah, it's gonna...... It's gonna make me start again every time. Fantastic! I really wish this worked. Right, so the fuses look like they're kind of...... they're big! They're like big orange and long. Could there be any in here? I literally can't see anything. I can't move these boxes either. Prometheus Opening Switch, that actually did something! Oh! We're here! I see! Okay, that's pretty cool, so we've opened up the....... The floor basically.Oh! Is this unlocked as well? Dude, did this....... did this unlock before? There he is! Oh my goodness! He's actually in there. He's just...... I don't even know what he's doing. He's got blood-stained t-shirt. Ah! No, it wasn't me. It wasn't me. It wasn't me. I don't even know if this is the right way. It is the right way. How do I leave? How do I run away from you? No, I don't want to start again. No no no, I thought you give me chills...... It's giving me chills. It's giving me chills. How do I run away from this dude? I'm going in here! What are you talking about? No no no no no! Ah! This guy's tough, really tough. Okay, so blue doors are ones we can actually go through now. We just need to be super careful that he's not behind them. Wait, can we open this? Yes! :) Okay, so this should allow us to access everything a little bit easier, right? Do I go this way? No. Ah, yes! Yeah, make like a loop. Okay! That's good, because now we should be able to get away from a little bit easier. Ah! Why is he such a pain in the butt? Where do I go? Where do I go? Where do I go? Let's go through here. I don't think he's following us anymore. I don't want to jinx it though. Oh! Okay, what is this? This must be his office. This is creepy. It's got beeping. Medication, a tiny doll called Maria! Okay, her name might not be Maria. Oh, a fuse! Yes! I've got a fuse! Does this flashlight work? Yeah! Did I just kill someone? Someone died? Maria? Are you okay? You doing good? Yeah! We have a single fuse which is good. We also have a flashlight that work! No, no, no, I just walked into another room that...... No! Oh, I escaped! Oh, that was such a close call! I don't even know how I did that! There was another room there though. We need to go down here and there's a Batman symbol on the torch for some reason. I think he's gone. I actually think he's gone. Okay. This is actually...... Terrifying, even more so than the normal game. How do we get to the other room? This is the one we were in before then the other one was opposite. Yeah, look at this! Is there another fuse in here? He draws anime on our way is this where we started off? It is! We just didn't realize so it's a Sun bed and a moon beds. A jar with a body parts in. Gross, there's definitely no fuse here, though and the fuses...... Don't actually show up in your inventory so we need to remember how much we've got. Look at this It's kinda look like Slenderman. Right, let's be super careful and explore every single room. Ah! Go go go go! He's so sneaky. So sneaky. Now, I have to start again. Yeah, definitely doesn't let you keep the fuses. That would be good wouldn't it. We do need to make sure that...... Both of these are open because then that gives us a big loop that we can run away from him. There we go that should be done now, right? Yes! Right neighbor, I'm coming for you, actually no. I not. That was a complete lie. I'm running the opposite way to you. Jesus, he right there. He's right there. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out! I'm going round the other way I really could do with that flashlight right about now. Just because it makes everything so much easier running through the corridor. There he is. I see him. Okay, I don't know where he's gone. Ah! There he is! Why? Leave me alone. No, I walk into the wrong room. Get away from me. He's got me. Look at his beautiful specs. Okay, I think I starting to learn the layout of this. I'm just worried that he's gonna be near me. Oh, I always jinxed it. Right, let's go around this way. Underneath and then he should get lost in the whole labyrinth of the maze, right? I think so. I think he's gone. I'm a little bit worried. He's not though no. He's not he's right there How do I avoid you and what is that noise right? I need to grab this real quick Let's go and put that downstairs, so I think my theory is that the new ones appear When you put them in the in the lab I'm not too sure though. There's only one way to find out let's put one in here yes Haha, shiny brands new only only three to go should have grabbed that flashlight. Though. Shouldn't I okay? I'm pretty sure he's outside that door so I might be a little bit done here Maria. How's it going? I think that's what I called you. I need you as a lucky charm. Is he buying door number one No, I don't know where he's gone right, let's try in here. I have no idea. What's in here. This is the lab, okay? Let's go out of here. What's in this door? That's the fish room fish room This room where on earth is the next one. I swear. I checked all the rooms so far Maybe new ones unlock when you put the fuses in Okay, that would make sense No, no nobody's going this way. It's going this way. No. I've got it to a room why I hate you oh Okay, so I just realized We have switches, but I can't I can't actually activate them you reckon they're activated by yeah They're definitely activated by this aren't they there's cables coming off. Okay. I know what to do now I need to go ahead and open these doors Grab the fuse and the flashlight and then come back and switch a switch on that's what I didn't do last time okay? Neighbor doctor I was happy for you, but now you're just you're just annoying me, and I'm gonna take your things Oh jeez jeez jeez jeez jeez he was right behind the door, haha I think the original room is opposite the Bedroom that you start in I think it's like his room and your room so grab the fuse grab the flashlights Grab it. Oh my goodness. That was stressful, and now we need to go back under so that we can Do nothing absolutely nothing it's gonna be fine right let's go down this way And we should be able to put the fuse in then turn the switch on right Fuse and then switch, yes, okay, right I have no idea what that does But I'm guessing it's gonna open a door somewhere this one was this open before it was Which one wasn't open before they all look exactly the same What are you kidding me he was behind the door That's just unlucky right so the two the two bits near the ends don't do anything These are just the two bedrooms This is the like research fish kind of bit put the fuse in again pull the lever again and I'm guessing it opened the door like what else would happen And where are we underneath? That's weird, okay, so I don't know. I just did differently but a moment ago I unlocked a different door it actually works, but it wasn't in this room It was in the other room, and then I got caught before I could actually record it properly Yeah, look this doors open check it out Okay, I am gonna get caught. I'm definitely gonna get caught ah fuse Perfect I need to lay low and this is extremely, creepy it's like there's IV drips there's just bottles of Reds books medicine What is going on here? This is weird? I'm glad I actually managed to get it working I don't know how but I did alright. Don't catch me now. I swear if you catch me now I will throw this flashlight square in your heads. No. They away from me stay away Let's put this in number two and this should activate a second door Hopefully anyway. I don't know what I did differently, but I've managed to actually open a door So let's see if it's one of the red doors has changed yes this one this one here What what is this? Oh? My goodness got all the pictures and stuff in it as a fuse and some very Very weird noises did the lights just go out they did look That's the guy from like the end of the hello neighbor games originally There's a bear trap as well a shoe which is a little bit strange This is creepy a tire swing I'm out. I'm out of here. I want to leave Oh, my goodness right that was actually pretty easy to find that one. Okay, we need to go to number three there We go and then open this Perfect now we need to find a wait these are opens What's in here? There's a fuse here? Is that a toilet what? Why is this toilet got a webcam on it? I don't really know. Oh, this is weird. There's tarot cards, which are like. Oh Jesus keys as well There's a lot of weird stuff in here so tarot cards might not mind reading future reading cards so kind of predict your future there's that creepy bear that we've seen in the main game before I want to look in the other door before we put the final fusing there's one here - Hello I remember you guys. How's it going? Jumps? There's another hole McGinnis. There's another power slots? Rockets, Oh what are you guys doing playing in here? This is this is where I'm going to turn this off Yeah, I should have done. That should I turn that back on ha ha right let's put the final fuse in and see what happens Run oh yeah, what? How do I get out? How do I leave? How do I leave this place? What is happening? I'm so confused yes. Yes yes yes We did it. Oh that was sweet. That was so cool. It was really cool Oh man, well after that door actually worked We were sorted that was so good like that was I I can see why that one cuz that was a whole new game Whole new neighbor in his brand-new profession You definitely shouldn't give the neighbor a job because he's gonna turn it into some kind of freaky hobby isn't he mannequins?

I'm sorry you had to see this but I have to channel my anger somewhere it physically won't let me and I can't play through all of that again for a video today so I'm sorry but sacrifices have to be made so I've been doing some research to find out what the neighbors real name is because in the previous episode I was talking about how we just call him neighbor we don't actually know his name apparently he doesn't really have a name his real name is so sad which is like Russian for neighbor so I liked it so said mister so see that's his name and it's so says very important day today it's our very important day today because I I'm gonna find out the final secrets about the neighbor about this house about the basement but no I want to do and I mean a lot what happened his chair that's awesome we need to do three minigames we need to find one manikin four pieces of cake and the key card easy right but to be honest the neighbor has been upsetting me greatly so I'm gonna throw this kettle through the window up here so I can collect the manikin that allows me to get the gun so I can just shoot him here we go I think it's this window here I'm pretty sure it's this window here comes out yeah there goes the Kel it's coming down it's coming down and it's in the tree right let's fly through the window and get the mannequin you don't know how much time this saves me having just a ladder to get onto the roof is insane here we go so before this room is a little bit glitched this time hopefully it's a little bit nicer yes haha don't fret anymore little one I got you weird room just boxes and a single TV well you know what I kind of like this TV so you're coming with me as a haha it goes hit my roof fantastic I'll have to charge the neighbor for that also the crowbar was missing when I loaded the game so I had to go back and get that that was not appreciated at all as much as you've just fallen over look how shocked they are four mannequins check now we need to go and get four pieces of cake which is really annoying one of them though is all the way up there so let's see if we can do another MLG throw huh missed I missed there it goes here we go just one little window to get in just glides and there we go there's even the little party hat on the sides that's so cute I want this as well so I'm gonna throw this down to my house see you there I'm just collecting like loads of the neighbors things so that when this is all over no I don't need that so that when this is all over I can just you know just sell all his things on eBay that'll get a lot of money right hmm I feel like I should go in there but all I have to throw is a cake actually should've kept that plate forget it let's go I need another piece of cake which is it's down here there we go cake number two thank you whoa why does why does that garden have a big patch of nothing in there weird Oh actually let's just undo this hey I have no idea why but we did it is this a random toy car which I thought was a piece of cake it's not right birthday room how's it going I need I think this is the best way to get through it yeah it's right here right we to put down one here okay fine I'll put it here instead there we go we need this one as well now we just need one more piece of cake is that the moondoor one oh man you know what I'm gonna get the mannequins first oh yeah nothing to see here buddy nothing to see here ah can I still put the chairs on the thing I can ha ha that blocks myself in so I probably I probably don't want to do that to be honest I'm gonna unlock this one though fine I'll let you in it doesn't really matter I kind of want to know what's through this door here what's this one oh it's here yes he said bear trap and I don't know where he's gone right I need you that's one two three and I can only carry that many actually I can carry more just leave the umbrella here right here we got mannequins you're always in my way but I think we'll make it okay he's chasing me but I have no idea where he is because the mannequin is blocking my face oh he's there oh goodness we need to do the moon door nonsense it's okay you know what this chair is now very very useful to me can I can I have it please thank you I don't have a torch though which is really annoying oh it's so dark so so dark I can't even remember where the Sun door is is it down here Oh moon door I can't even remember which what I'm talking about yes it's here okay perfect right we just need this chair let's go right in the middle yeah there we go perfect and now I just need to wait till morning I guess ok did this work did this work the moon door has worked perfect what about this door yeah birthday cake I got these so much faster than before there's also this door to open as well sometimes we'll plot this down here grab you back and see what earth is through here what if we got old as this the weird Squidward door is here I completely forgot about this it's got the guitar and a bear in okay this is much better okay I just need to oh wait a second this is also a different room that we haven't been in before I don't think there's anything we need here though there's no like no weirdness in here I don't think so anyway right I just need to get in here and then present most of the birthday things birthday room okay right final piece of cake needs to go right here there we go and then we need to line up these mannequins side by side so we got one we got two and we're gonna need to grab the other two then we got ourselves a birthday and the gun oh man I'm so excited here we go we missed this before so hopefully this works please yes Jamie I got the gun I can finally shoot his bunk but in the face look at this oh I'm so happy sorry sorry this is just a bit of target practice hard be number one done I now need to do three minigames which is Mads okay the first minigame is this one so we should be able to throw this which didn't work there we go that's better I was like is the power off I have idea of Jesus right open this and then we can go in here I think this is the shopping minigame I'm not quite sure as certainly as okay right so we need to remember that we need to look inside all of the shopping carts and see what's items we need to grab so give me some seconds and go shopping I think I'm done I think I'm done please mark me five out of five I tried my best buddy come on come on bring me up bring me up bust up yes yes yes yes yes okay I'm out of here I cover member which power this gives you but I'm so happy let's get out of it here we go it's just this door which superpower did I get though I'm not even sure I have no idea which superpower I got but I'm about to find out it was not double jump okay next place of interest is actually up here because I need I think I need keys now here we go let's jump on in let's glide through the door easy peasy green key thank you very much is there anything else in here that I needs I don't think so now I'm pretty sure the green key is I'll jeez can I shoot my way through I really can't wait listen my feet are making a weird noise now that must be the superpower that I got by your hilly car remember a joint it is is it the one where I can just like knock the neighbor over because that's one of my favorite ones ever here we go this this is the green key door perfect right come on get past the boxes open up this door and let's go inside okay there's another door in there but this I think is the sneaking minigame which is a hard one I can't actually remember how to do this one I think it's to do with the lockers but if they catch you then they send you all the way back it doesn't help but I can't really see anything right now do we need to listen for the bells okay I'm going in I'm going in I think I need to wait for the bells as soon as the bell goes they move there we go okay keep going keep going you need to stop moving though there we go let's do it let's do it let's go let's go ah ah no okay give me some time I'll do this I'm here I'm here I've done it yes okay here's the creepy guy girl whatever you want to call it and this is where we get to knock her back I'm pretty sure here we go not come back not come back ah oh my goodness I thought that wasn't gonna happen and then I was gonna fail so this is where we get to knock the neighbor back which is perfect took me a while not gonna lie but we got one more minigame to go and I think we need the red key for it so I need to find that next bit if I remember correctly we need to put to the gun down here now I'm a little bit worried not gonna lie because that's scary but let's see if it's true gun I love you but please do not leave me forever there we go bang bang Alec this is Cera's freak it out

neighbor looks like he's going wait where are you going he's going to the right that's fine we can just sneaky sneak on in there it's gonna be fine that's that's it a really annoying place whoa are

dark this is a staircase where are we going okay there's there's a big leak a big old leak is this a door yeah it's gonna be a door why is this happening though is that gonna burn me what's happening I can can I get through I can I was like what are you doing this looks oddly familiar which is a little bit strange these doors are too too small for me to go through and yeah this is exactly the same it's a fake room we've been here before this is definitely not what's happened before though Oh follow the candle do I need to follow the candle of a little bit scared ah yeah I do there's loads of candles wait we've we've done this before do I need to do it again oh jeez what's that noise oh this got a lot creepier this got way creepier okay so it's similar to what we had before but everything is kind of like broken down a little bit locked and yellow the fridge is even busted open is frayed electronics as well water spilling out everywhere this could be like a sign of just something going bad something going real bad oh who is that what is that what was that it sends me back dude I've got to avoid those things I am confused scared and confused right I'm just gonna run it and see what happens I need to not get spotted by that crazy thing I'm gonna hide here you can get away from me it's got weird shadows it's like got lights as eyes oh I feel like I'm whole geez oh geez it's soap it's loud as well what is it what does it do it's making my vision go funny but I'm not quite sure how to get past it oh it got me Auto eyes Rosen - do I look I can carry the TV with me this is kind of cool it like properly lights everything up as well so I can actually see what on earth I'm doing dudes I wonder if that thing is gonna get me though oh oh no no no it blocks me there's a thing lines me no wonder it blocks me I need the TV I need to run he's speaking a weird language I'm just gonna run I'm just gonna go I don't know what's gonna happen but I'm just gonna run it's brought it's not just blocked quick it's it's locked there's a trampoline where do I go where do I go no this is not fair this is not fair I'm gonna throw the TV at you huh that in a work that didn't not work I think you can hide by sneaking here he comes this is the big test I still got the TV going off well he just ignore me yeah he's definitely gonna ignore me there we go he disappeared sorry for the random language but it just it just works it shows off everything a lot easier shoot you're annoying me now though geez what's this we got past the guy everything's getting a little bit warm up in here kinda wish I had a flashlight because the TV's just annoying this chair is now not blocking this door and the exit is still through there okay this is the same but kind of different it's a big fireplace boxes can I press any of this stuff oh it's the wall do I need to throw something at the wall though I can't pick up the box it says to try and run through it okay okay that works can I just go straight to the exit no it trolled me how do I get to the exit I'm not a fan of this this is creepy that's locked fantastic and I can't see anything else cuz I threw my TV there's like a fence back here as well how on earth do I get there what's this it's bits bricks fantastic I'll throw bricks don't make me but I will my game is frozen it's actually frozen why guys I can't believe this is happening I actually cannot believe this has happened my game crashed I threw the TV at the big light box because I'll seen if I could knock it over to pick it up to put over the fence so I could get to the exit door let me just give you some background over this whole series I have probably spent about 10 hours on the Xbox edition know including all the PC editions just the full game over 10 hours I'm trying to load my game and it's just giving me this it won't load I had to force quit the game after it crashed and now it's just stuck on the loading screen I think I've lost over 10 hours of progress and the worst bit I was on the basement literally just about to find out the secrets of the neighbor and it destroys my save file someone's gonna have to pay and it's gonna have to be one of you give me two seconds I'll be back back I'm so mad for you do you know why because you're holding you holding item that I haven't even seen in the game before and look at his face smug little punk isn't he oh and look my game is still loading still loading I'm sorry you had to see this but I have to channel my anger somewhere otherwise I don't have a good engine to the video this videos ending was supposed to be the secrets that we were working so hard so hard to unlock you have no idea I wanted you guys to experience it but don't let me if physically won't let me and I can't play through all of that again for a video today so I'm sorry but sacrifices have to be made duh-duh-duh oh I'm so mad I'll see you later guys leave a like if you want me to replay ten hours of content and a see you later bye 
So today, I was gonna revisit a game called slither.io Oh, just because I found a new version of it called wormies, and it was pretty cool I just wanted to take a trip down memory lane But afterwards I was gonna read some of your comments because I absolutely loved doing and you guys love  watching it, too And I found this one comment that got me thinking it's from disco lizards of course, and it says this has kept me awake What happens when youtubers get old and that? That got my mind ticking a little bit I mean what am I gonna do when I'm 80 am I still gonna upload gameplay videos. I mean it might be pretty cool actually Then I remember there's actually apps and websites out there that can make you old so I thought we'd start off by Seeing what I would look like old, and then we'd find out what a let's play would be like first up We're gonna see how old Technology thinks I am cuz there's this really cool app that allows you to take a picture and then guess what age you are? That's a terrifying smile with a terrifying haircut. I'm gonna use it and let's see what age it thinks I am 29 29 that's three years older than I actually am it can't be right it can't be right. I'm gonna take it again Oh, no, that's an awful photo. Let's use it. Anyway. Let's see what happens sixteen Oh my goodness I know sometimes I look young but we've had 29 and 16 Those are 13 years apart right let's try one more this average it out This is try normal one use photo and done 28. Okay. It's getting closer It's not spot on, but it's close so either thinks i'm 16 29 or 28 I mean it could be worse at least it's not 80, then I've got an app called make me olds Which is it's gonna. Make me old, so let's just take like a neutral picture there We go and let's use photo I have no idea how this works But is that it it just makes you black and white that's not making me old even this isn't making me old That's just It doesn't even fit how is that supposed to fit a human face my mouth is down here, okay? That's that's what I'm gonna look like when I'm old. I could also get something else up in here I can do this Actually, you know what this is getting better. Is there a bald head some of these are terrifying does that work. I kind of What that's weird, that's so weird oh oh no, that's creepy, that's super creepy What happened to my eyes hey there we go Lady that just doesn't fit does it I need to get a bit older so my head shrinks That's how it works right the hoax fun. Okay, so I've actually bought this one So hopefully this one is better and allows you to go up to 200 years older. Yeah, are you ready 3 2 1 Oh? Oh Guys I'm old that is that you look to you about that's so weird it's like real time So that's 20 years wait hold on that means. I'm let means. I'm only 40 Oh, my god like this when I'm 40 like really okay? 40 years in the future my eyes are looking a little bit Then we can go up to 60 so I've got a little bit more spotted on my face. Which is a little bit It's nice very nice My wrinkles on my forehead as well Wow and yeah you can go to 99 and 200 I think it's gonna make me pay isn't it I'm gonna. Do it what it's 1899. It's gonna Make you pay more for 200, but it's got a gravestone behind it I don't know if I want to do that anyway plus 80 which means there'll be a 106 years old That's not even that bad for 106. I'm looking pretty good. Although. I'm lookin a little bit dirty What's this as well that's interesting? Plus 99 so that'll make me 125 years old. I'm looking good Kinda look at me that looks too realistic. Why how does it do this? that's impressive if I look like this when know if - 125 years old I'm feeling pretty good about myself. Oh my goodness. What is that? Monsterfied oh, I just want to know how old I look I see so 200-plus literally means that you're going to be a Zombie or yeah a vampire that makes sense Oh, no. Oh, no my ninety nine year old mouth has literally fallen off Oh dear Well, it would look like this. Hey guys. How's it going today? We're gonna play a little bit of slither.io wormis whatever I decide to play. This is so weird look at my face So obviously video games in Just let's just say 100 years is easier in about 100 years video games would probably get a little bit crazier We've got virtual reality now. Which is pretty crazy anyway I feel like I need to do a different voice because my voice isn't gonna be the same It's gonna be like hi guys. How are you doing, and I'm not meaning to offend any 125 year-olds out there, I'm pretty sure after doing over 100 years of YouTube my voice is gonna be gone I don't know I kind of gained an accent, then that was that was a little bit weird so yeah You know while we're here doing a let's play as a hundred and twenty five year-olds I'm number 8 on the leaderboard no way in a hundred years. My gaming skills have got way better This is this is perfect. So you didn't know wormis is basically slithery. Oh, but way way better. There's no lag It's got loads of game modes and currently playing the crazy game mode Which I think means you get a mass way quicker, and I can't stop looking at my wrinkles and stuff I probably should be looking at the worm. Just in case oh this guy's like a brain. That's so weird Oh, my goodness look at the size of this guy He's huge. We're trying to find the head somewhere there. It is. Oh no. I'm so dead I'm so dead I can fire things as well, which I didn't know I could do no no, I uh instead I feel slightly tired, but Look at my expressions, so angry This is so is so weird right let's So uh 
 lets read some more of your comments shall we this is on the you wanted me to play this which was the duck season of VR game and No Ducks were harmed in the making of this video Are you sure yeah? No no real life ducks It was funny when he thought the chair was real And you watched it at night. That's brave. I was scared even in the day. What else would we Oh oh? I Laughed so much when I was editing that that fall at the start  should be added in the chair fall montage of dantdm Oh, yes, I completely forgot that we did that do not watch this at night Just a warning because this is scary, but if you do go grab a donut from Dave the donut Dan why'd you fall off your chair 1 million times? I don't know even if the chairs not real. I fall off it and when I'm super old like this I'm probably gonna be falling off chairs way more often and not being able to get up. There is also a scare montage I thought so I saw them in the recommended of the last video. I'll bet you five thousand million dollars I won't be noticed by Dan you owe me five thousand million dollars, buddy And I need it I need to correct this face of mine. Oh yes I didn't need the money.

*sigh* Guys, today's a sad day. Um..I messed up I messed up really bad So look at my face! Oh. Okay I didn't realize the googly eyes were there. But look at my face, the frown! Can you see that? It's so upside-down. It's unreal. I messed up in the last video if you guys haven't seen it yet, I was collecting goldfish And.. Pretty much i would say 99.9% of all the comments of the previous video were.. You sold your goldfish. you're stupid for selling your goldfish. And I know, secretly i needed the money, because we gotta raise another 21,000 gold. But there is a saving grace, do not worry guys. Look! We saved one. *Umm... I think it's dead* I completely forgot that I put this guy here. But when we get ourselves a nametag, I will be naming this guy lucky. Because he avoided the great goldfish purge, of 2018 So umm... Let me get a name tag Which I'm pretty sure we can buy from the animal guy in our village this guy will be
named Lucky and will stay here forever as long as the tree house stays standing
hey guys how's it going welcome back to the unnamed Minecraft series also known
as the greatest Minecraft series you've ever seen of all time something like
that where if you haven't seen it yeah we're just surviving creating a village
and stuff and raising gold right now it's winter so nothing grows usually I
grow things but look they're all dead and last time we also put the heaviest
thing in the world a coke oven in the top of our treehouse it hasn't fallen
down yet but oh it's made it's made another block of cold coke and more
creosote oil we are going up in the world fantastic now the reason we need
that is for some crafting recipes and stuff and the goal of today is to trying
to get myself some steel but steel is incredibly difficult to get because we
need a blast furnace I'm pretty sure which is why I got it searched up
already we can only buy it from the blacksmith and the blacksmith is pure
real nice to us and he's selling it for 1,000 gold per piece the only problem is
we need 27 pieces and nothing's growing so how are we gonna make it you asked ah
fishing that's that's what we're gonna do we're gonna try and get some goldfish
back as well I don't know if we should have a funeral for the fish I'm not too
sure they were placed into this hopper and just disappeared into the box of
nothing where it makes us money so you know what we did get something out of it
we didn't completely just like kill them they did there's somewhere I don't know
if they're actually dead but they're definitely somewhere so it's not all a
lot because we did make some money but we
sold our friends for money so that's bad let's just keep on fishing see if we can
sell things and try and make twenty one thousand boots and not what I need hold
on a second ultra rare ones though I will take those thank you okay we've got
some fishes I think we got a message in a bottle as well which is nice what does
it say admit one to Davy Jones's Locker oh nice we've got a ticket to Davy
Jones's just in case we end up there at some point some algae which we can eat
and there we go full of fish okay let's get you boys sent off I don't know how
much you're gonna make me but I need money and I need money desperately what
I also need is food because I haven't got much snow oh jeez it's so good I
slapped him so good Charles did not warn me about that guy oh my goodness by
having to slap Tim who's been close enough to explode okay I'm out of here
let's go I closed the door let's sleep let's see how much money we get and I
need to get myself some simple last bricks seven thousand three hundred and
it's snowing my favorite time of the day favourite weather whatever you call it I
hate it he's still down here what do you want from me huh what do you want go
away God don't explode don't explode please don't explode it's closed it's
gross yes don't EDM wins again there's two
this one's got googly eyes as well oh my goodness this is not fun this isn't fun
come this way guys come this way you can explode over here I'm sure there's some
of your friends we can explode you with get me yeah come yeah it's okay
go on explode if you have to I'm literally fishing my way through window
we've got a treasure chest we've got three treasure chests three messages in
a bottle let's quickly read these about another ticket to Davy Jones is dear
fans hi and we've had that one before there's not many messages out there is
there right there's ooh treasure chest got ourselves some gold fantastic might
want to switch these around just see what we get oh that's sweet yes that's
so good I don't know one yes this is great
oK we've got two diamonds we can actually make a diamond sword we've also
got two boxes I'm not sure what happens here boots
and string okay we've had so many boots it's unreal look all these fish we've
got as well I can't believe we just got diamonds from that right I'm gonna do
loads more fishing check back in with you when I'm done and hopefully we can
raise this money today because I desperately need some progress all I can
do is fish and look after my cows that's all that can happen
okay next batch done we have some tin cans we have some logs and stuff we also
have a lockbox let's quickly do that now what's inside oh god okay I was like did
I just get ripped off but no is gold let's per the rest of our fishes in here
we actually have turns and we have ourselves another goldfish as well so we
can not sell that today and let's go ahead and sleep let's see how much money
we get that's a whole day's worth of fishing and whatever I get from my
animals I don't know how much it's gonna be probably like 2,000 which is terrible
I needed to just not be winter winter just sucks so badly and actually we can
take this block of cold conch and start doing that is that gonna work or is that
wasted it I have no idea but let's go to sleep it goes from 7 1 to 11 that was
3,000 that was 3,000 in one day okay Archie that was four thousand seven one
that was 4,000 yes for eight twelve it's still gonna take me ages to fish all
that up but you know what that's way better than we were doing before and I
miss one all right next haul is done I have a treasure chest three boxes and
four loot boxes let's go box first a slime ball
that's such amazing shoes and rotten flesh on flesh is not great boots
depends what they are ultra rare still I mean no slime ball is insane right and
lockboxes next redstone glowstone lapis and more glowstone that's actually
pretty sweet I like that can't carry all this stuff right we've also got an iron
ingot okay that's not so impressive oh geez
let's go ahead and sell these things and I'll come back for those that's cool we
can get some decent things for those we are approaching a problem though and the
problem is to do of this fishing rod it's only got 27 uses left and I have no
idea if you can repair it which is a problem because if you can't repair it
we're going to five thousand pounds on another one
which we don't want to do because that doesn't negate everything we've done so
far wait a second can we main man repair
this if this dude over here can repair this that'll be even better where are
you at where are you at please be open Friday 10:00 till 40 just closed no it
doesn't open until Wednesday again are you hungry time to hibernate soon guys
I'm running out of anything that I can do I can't fish anymore cuz my fishing
rods running out I think it's time it's time to hibernate that's it that's it I
can't do any more otherwise this thing will break or on one more durability and
we're done that's actually the perfect amount it just fills up my imagery right
let's do these boxes real quick we have that piece of wood piece of jungle wood
and a piece of stone that's not so bad we also have a golden apple nether
quartz and iron dude this is cool I'm gonna have to come
back and get those what can I trade out for the iron just for now rotten flesh
as well the bottle oh jeez please don't die here please don't die here there we
go she trapped in a message factory get
begun there we go we got a Golden Apple there's a cheese sweet these treasure
boxes are good right it's time I can't do it anymore
I just can't zombie get out of here no one wants to talk to you please just
leave thank you ahh Enderman I'm out I'm out there's another zombie as well I'm
just gonna go I'm just gonna go it's getting a little bit apocalyptic over
here this is part of the reason why I just need to you know sleep and forget
winter ever happened I'm out I forgot to sell my things are you kidding me quick
quick quick quick quick quick quick so all the things I don't know if I can
sell Algy I don't think I can I think that's everything I now need to get
water because otherwise I'm gonna die of thirst as well
okay let's sleep see how much money we've made and pop all of this stuff
away including our brands new Golden Apple look beautiful it's gonna give us
up to 15,000 that's actually not so bad whatsoever or on day 22 of winter and
now we to prepare for some hibernation let's make another chest real quick just
because we need one pop random stuff in here actually I might have
for that here yes I do that's getting another tin can going as well and I did
actually just completely waste whatever that was Wow good job right so the way
this needs to work is I need to go down tend to my animals and then just sleep
do that like seven times maybe more and hopefully that will give us first of the
opening time for the blacksmith so we can actually repair my my tool and then
we'll give us winter being over I cannot wait hey dudes how's it going I didn't
forget about you I promise I just came to pick you up pick up any eggs you have
as well you have chicken feed you're all good see you later buddy
I'm gonna get you some friends soon don't worry here we go day one darn it
let's go hibernate I'm pretty sure we could just sleep at any time so this
should be able to work nothing apart from our our animals will decay you're
gonna decay because you're dying on you and on fire but I'm yeah that's all I
need to do and then winter will hopefully be over I don't know how many
days winter has but it's a terrible terrible season I hate it and sleep make
money and win - please be over really this is what's gonna happen here huh
what what what this is so weird so very very wait he keeps getting
frozen which is goods but when he unfreeze just comes to me be gone be
gone this is the stupidest thing ever I hate these people so much just go die
die just die no one likes you be gone there we go finally sorry about that
sorry no my brush just broke I'm gonna have to get a new one of those as well
and I'm pretty sure I get the animal brush from this guy the blacksmith and
it's not open for another like Wednesday Thursday yeah it's not open Saturday

the villager I just killed that's insane wait what you open every day of the week

way around I wasn't it Wednesday to Friday see the colds get into my brain
this is not healthy not healthy danira I'm Wayne till 10:00 okay geez wait
there's an anvil right there can I can I repair this I don't think I can my only
hope is that denier who can actually repair it man I hope he can cuz
otherwise that's five K down the drain by the time you fish up enough stuff
you've only earned the money to buy back your fishing rod that sucks
first off I need to buy a animal brush from you thank you I am NOT gonna buy
shares cuz that's ridiculous I do need them though can you repair this always
happy to sell some fine tools no no no no buddy no I need I need you to repair

I hate you looks like I'm just gonna buy this I'm just gonna do it another
diamond fishing rod I need to get some monies together honey or four days of
winter left I'm so excited wait I just realized was it Christmas
because it was the 25th of winter is that what happened here I think it was
I'm pretty sure that was it right let's see what we get from my boxes okay I got
some leather that's the first time of a quiet leather normally I think that's
why it's doing that Lockbox we got a lapis we also got an old I think that's
pretty cool okay let's put everything we have in so far we did get another
goldfish which is awesome I'm gonna keep that bad boy normal fish as well and we
have all that stuff that we had earlier and let's see how much money we get from
that and then we've got three more days I cannot wait I'm gonna brush my cows
just so they don't get unhealthy and your boys going home here we go we got
ourselves up to 10,000 again okay not so bad three days ago let's smash
this I'm done with winter and on the last day of winter it snowed Lots what I
want to do now actually just what I'm thinking about it I might use the anvil
real quick and see if I can repair this Sony got eight swings left so I would
rather keep it if I can let's do that it's the last day of winter we need to
get this garden back in action because I need some money and I can't I just can't
fish anymore I can't I will do fishing at the same time but doing the fishing
at the moment is just insane by itself and isn't very good for you guys to
watch right let's see if we can go ahead and repair this just it's got a few we
could make a diamond one actually but it's just got a few enchantments on it
and stuff I can't even remember how to repair there we go look at that smashed
it it's level five it's a basic but it doesn't matter it's got heart it's got
soul and I can't remember we've got ability tokens that's pretty
cool what have we got so far frost and etheral oh my goodness there's so many
cool things that we could get it's almost it's halfway to the next level so
he could save for one of these and it means within a certain radius to set on
fire a hundred percent I'm saving it I'm saving it alright so any news of these
guys I guess they're all still giving me the same size things that they did
before but the chickens died pooping out big eggs that's what I'm talking about
big eggs there it is look a massive egg whites a medium egg but still good job
buddy I appreciate you thanks for the extra money see if you treat them nice
they'll produce big things I guess that's the saying right there's put that
in there and it's time Travis it is time and to get out of the cold your head
isn't gonna frost over any more it's time for winter to be over I've got
money ready to buy so many seeds is unreal guys are you ready cuz I
certainly am hibernating happens and we go in we're out of here
goodbye winter hello to the next season which I can't remember what it is but
yeah it's my birthday we did it Christmas and a birthday in one single
episode I'm so happy that I'm gonna push the secret button there we go happy
birthday wait what I need to get out more thank
you that means we've done a year so we started this series on spring first ah
it's beautiful I can turn my frown upside down very very soon but for now
it's gonna stay pretty sad just because it's been quite actually because it's
snowing still why is it still snowing what is happening this is unacceptable
what day is it it's Monday so Jennie should be open ready to give us our
brand new seeds ah this is the best day the best day no more darkness in the
mornings hopefully no more snow after today
charis I am so ready for this however our farm is definitely not it's looking
a little bit worse for wear isn't it I got blown up and then we just didn't fix
it because we didn't need it anymore it's bad bad times right what do we need
we need a hole we need I think that's it hold a watering can and then we can
start on this yes Jenny's open at 9:00 as well good times come back to me
sickle hoe and I think that's actually all I need there we go copper watering
can as well oh man this is great now we've also learned how to do fishing
we can also learn how to do beekeeping as well which is pretty crazy which i
think means you can get even more you can get even more money so we could do
beekeeping we can also do the fishing and the farming at the same time we are
going to be rolling in money which is exactly what we need for the next video
oh goodness I'm excited okay I think we're ready to go let's see what we can
buy guys let's just buy everything and I mean everything and the ones that we
need to look out for the ones that regrow what we grew in spring Jennie
how's it going I'm so happy that you're selling seeds again actually are you
selling anything different I kind of need those snippers from you a packing
tape scoop see that she said oh the bee hiving stuff the bee house screwdrivers
who still doesn't sell it know what I'm gonna do about that at all
but I'm gonna find out in the end right we have something that's okay industrial
hemp I guess I think we need that from I'm pretty sure we need that for the
engineering modeler we're using I'm not sure
turnips potatoes cucumbers strawberries grass and wheat which were the ones that
just kept on growing I think it's all about strawberries and cucumbers both of
them regrow cucumbers growing ten days then go back to five strawberries go
back to seven I think so maybe strawberries would be the best
let's buy am I gonna support 11 did I mean to buy 11 I don't think so but I'm
growing strawberries guys we're doing it I didn't mean to buy that many but we
need to we need to just make as much as we can one two three oh did I do that
wrong I did always doing things wrong good job I bought extra huh need to make
it so they're three apart every time there we go right well one bag left
let's just do that I know it's a bit wasteful blitz fine got our updated
watering can as well which does three at a time which is absolutely magnificent
wanna make it so this is upgraded at some point as well just that we've got a
three by three grid would be even better well well what's happened what's
happened as you could tell avoids event what has happened no it's so weird it's
L avoid beets Abed stop don't do that that watering definitely takes a lot out
of me I thought it was gonna change day as well but turns out it didn't that's
good and voila we have ourselves back a farm oh I'm so excited look at this it's
beautiful absolutely beautiful to grow strawberries for days the next thing we
should probably do is I don't have a bow to take this guy out he's coming for me
anyway no don't even don't even how does that still get me if I'm shielded at all
my dog tonight I don't my dog tonight no no no
Nord I do not die have a Barry he can't even eat berries I know it's not the
best but flesh eat flesh just do it there we go back up to 100 oh my
goodness my dad almost died in 4a my very eyes right I think even though it's
been a weird one this is a good place to end we finally hibernated out of winter
I can turn this frown upside down we celebrate it kind of a birthday and also
Christmas at the same time fantastic this pack takes it out of me but mainly
that was because of winter so now the winters over we can get to making 10 no
we need 16,000 more so that we can make our coke oven to get that big old
waterwheel happening so we've got all of our electricity going and stuff and then
we're gonna build some more buildings it's gonna be awesome guys I'm sorry
this is a little less I don't know involved than normal we just have to do
a lot of chores and stuff and hibernate which is you know boring but I hope you
enjoyed it anyway if you did please leave a thumbs up that'd be greatly

said the relics will make us rich I wonder why there's bird eggs what can I do with these I was going to try and hit them off they're probably not the best idea there's no story to this one maybe we have to discover the story when we explore this this is just a straight-up free roam never had this happen before but we're really far away from these artifacts we get in yeah oh that's cool are you ringing the bell anyone end oh you know any yeah they let me in so that's a good sign so they didn't let me in then this level would be pretty boring you know ha ha I guess that scared me get out of

let's do this look at this how crazy is that we're going to are we go to heaven where I deserve to be to be fair this is crazy I don't even know where we're heading we're traveling through like space and I'm the hookshot unlocked that we unlocked the last time has just made everything so much more epic we would have been out to do this before oh is the timepiece up there there's something shiny it's like they'd caught a shooting star go and keep on going need to make it to the top please I like the golden bells this reminds me of something whose elder as well so magical there's loads of giant sparkles there's a yarn up ahead of us as well which would be handy for creating a new hats and we have arrived in some crazy location in a different location because the map is now saying something lately different I'm gonna quickly change out one of my pins to the magnet one so I think I want to do that for now just cuz I need to grab stuff and let's talk to this little robot and see what's going down okay yeah stay away from the goats okay that's well noted this is like a sky farm it's really cool okay I was thinking normal goats this is like look how big that goat is it's actually massive sweet so this is another there's a big like shine of Lights there we should probably check out that's pretty much it though this is a mysterious world and I definitely do not want to get hit by this guy hello oh geez no I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry about I'm out I didn't mean to bother you but I'm very scared of this guy oh geez I just died I thought that was that perspective looks so weird I thought I was actually there but I wasn't it's fine we just respawn I can double-check there was some bit I couldn't double jump earlier right these bells no I don't want yet I wasn't so I could ring this bell before I don't think I can now so I'm going to jump this way instead I've seen our patch cellar how's it going widely please make a purchase at my humble store Jennifer YouTube double axe I am NOT gonna be an insomnia I'm fortunately have a good time if you do go though Audrey Charlene and Jace what can i buy another pin badge I am going to apply this yeah definitely

a cool system and this one and this one perfect everything I'm a badged master you can't see that by just got an achievement for being a bad master alright let's go we go in this house wanna see one go in no I can't okay I'm just gonna jump on top of it then I love the look at these houses the Twilight Belle is this way so are they need to do with the big shines as well I need to figure out what these frosty bits are as well I haven't actually figured that out yet I think this is a platform I cut up earlier so let's go this way okay so those birds of the bird house is still shiny things which means all so now I need to I know I can do these I blow them up there we go gives me special things I didn't know that before so I need to get to the bird house somehow but I don't know how to get along there that's crazy oh jeez always fell off it's down here actually okay that's helpful thank you lets us blow these up just to give us some more items I'm gonna need to save up again some more money because I need to buy badges and things and these give us loss actually what does this hat tell us we need to go to we need to go up there okay challenge accepted there's a giant goat in our way though let's go this way what there we go sweet right there's another yarn over there I grabbed it I can grab it actually so if I bounce some of this and there's like there's a hook-shot thing above it so I should be able to do it whoa okay I'm now on a random brunch oh I remember now so this is what happened last time so I can double jump as long as I don't do the spring otherwise you can jump really really far so I guess that's why they we need to stop that we just want to grab there we go yeah and that's why I was trying to get Jace don't worry if you're late you can actually scroll back through the video while it's live if you want to go and check it out and watch from the beginning and plays your back how's it going nice to see you Alex vlogs Sofia hakuna thank you that's really

you have to grab that right if I jump this there we go yeah this hookshot is amazing where to next I'm kind of getting near I'm not oh I was gonna say I'm getting near to some of those the artifacts by really not let's try it this way I don't think I've been up there yet it's like a big volcano with a cosmic star thing on top of it which is good is that a door it looks like a door there's something on fire whether it's a door or not I should probably go and check it out got my health back as well which is great right let me see where this star thing is this way really oh can I go in here no one wants to open their house to me what's this light as well I've already been here why is this light thing it's like some crazy beam of light looks really cool if I'm not quite sure what it's for it's this way you're not being like I am I don't know how to go across that do you need to bring that I need the ice how I think which is oh I got I got it yes that's exactly what I needed I was like I'm pretty sure there's a nice hat around and we do have it it's so cold use left trigger to do a ground pound sweet look at our new hat we're looking awesome right so we can hold the left trigger cool ground pounds before I wha that was insane I was actually insane that was cool that was very very cool literally but we've already been to this bit so we can ground pound with ice what just happened I don't think that was supposed to happen right that was a little bit weird all right I need to find some more of those ice platforms definitely what's that one that Archie I think there was one around here wasn't there pretty sure even if there isn't I don't I don't know if you've been up there okay the old windmills this way make sure you swing - as a party punch how the ouch what was that what is hitting me is that that o is the purple flower so the windmills over there but how on earth do you get over there I'm a little bit confused there's another guy over here is going to destroy my life if I go near him okay let's do that right now let's get all the way this guy is going to destroy us here we go this is what we're supposed to do nice man the UM the creativity in this

can do it then this is what we're gonna do cool so we need to go to each one and then blow the horn at the top to unlock the new levels that's that makes a lot of sense I'm struggling with a staircase the cameras not being nice to me anything good at this popular stuff testing my parkour skills this whole game is to be honest we got here for a reason it on that no get up there I need some more life actually there we go that's how you do it got any hearts up here anyone what is that thing flowing above me it's a raccoon oh it's that raccoon thing that falls on you no get out of here Oh trust you I was like I always said it was cute but um you know what it was trying to kill me again no one wants to open their house to me understandably so I am climbing all over your stuff let's go down this way let's go let's go let's go though they actually pull down faster than the speed of you runs you have to be super careful I feel I was this I don't know if I've seen those before I think I have the cool thing is about this game there's not that many enemies but the boss fights and stuff a very very cool right we need to do another balancing act across here if we fall we are so dead so dead I'm sure we'll be fine [Music] only to wall rides we'll jump up here look at that amazing get out of here it looks like a an evil Torchic it's very strange there's another one good it's the only has got me them and also like all of the terrain is is Park horrible as well which is very very nice there we go so many tight ropes I would not like to be this person right now it's making me go make me go funny we're almost there we're at the horn and there's an ice thing as well so we can take a massive jump off the top of this cliff what is it gonna unlock I'm just gonna keep an eye on it [Music]

there wasn't it okay we must go back over here yeah we need to go this way and then we need to change direction the other way can we alter it when we go this way I think we have to go backwards and then choose the left-hand side I'm pretty sure that's what we need to do there we go old windmill this way let's go back and then hover left yeah there we go and this should unlock a new location perfect not sure where we're going but I'm sure it's gonna be cool but like weird thorny vines coming out of it this is cool level design guys this is very very cool windy passage oh geez look all these oh my goodness I'm on a windmill I could say look all the purple flowers that you are told to avoid they kind of scare me a little bit they scare me more than this guy don't happy I come in peace definitely oh geez I messed that up no I thought there was solid platforms ok I'm back here I thought I was going to start will the way the beginning so I don't want to touch those flowers but how do I get those platforms to be active guess any one way to find out you have to press a certain switch don't here I'm pretty sure he's up here you might be okay there's a there's an ice platform there's also binoculars so we can unlock something else there's another horn over there how do I get to that bit oh it's right there yes okay we can do that right now it's exactly what we need I love

at down TDM I'd love to see it [Music] all right let's make our way all the way back this is gonna take some time but I want to go into a new land you should probably make the way to the bird cage

thank you there we go right we've done this horn I need to get around somewhere this way I'm pretty sure there we go I can break this as well though we know I don't know why this one Wow the Sprinter hat is easy my favorite what's your favorite hat so far guys oh we can use this as well we can also go back to other levels and do this as well which I haven't done before I'm pretty sure we haven't gone this way yet so let's do it lost gamer thank you and epic super vlogger one two three right where a bird passed it's exactly what we needed [Music] I'm gonna growl I don't know if I need the hearts right now but let's listen to this guy great that's uh that's really helpful actually it's not helpful at all I'm sorry let's go down here right now I need to get to that bird house stat oh my goodness is that actually gonna make me do parkour on these strings that's so mean and I've just fallen off what what just happened there I was trying to be so accurate as well oh man this is tricky got up and a yarn Bartman what game is this frog I just missed it in the chat but it is a hat in time it's a very very cool game been playing it for a bit now I feel like we might be getting towards the like that I think we're over halfway I'm pretty sure okay I will do that don't you worry where do I want to go I guess I'm just gonna go this way no this is insane it's not the beginning is it it's definitely not the birdcage though Michael millets how's it going crystal burn thank you demo life can I do reaction to Instagram Alex again maybe I will definitely do that epic football I might do crystal burn I've already answered your question and TNT James thank you I'm glad I inspired you there's a horn at the top okay there isn't one at the top of this one I see we make this jump what what yes absolutely destroyed you yes so you can kind of parkour up these guys too and the eggs getting bigger they definitely weren't that big before I worried that a giant bird is gonna come down and think that I've been snooping around can I do this yes I can that's what I was just talking about to make like some complex movements if you can combine them all together yes I got a checkpoint as well I haven't seen many of those in this game must mean a really difficult bits coming up maybe there we go right let's keep on making our way up and across oh jesus what about the bridge I think we're doing okay there we go double them up as well I didn't know you could do that right I'm gonna pay attention to this horn this time otherwise I'm gonna miss out on ready to go these horns unlock new passageways ah it makes another that's where we came from so we just need to go back and do that again perfect serpentine bird horn I did it I've done it Devin Tyson Ethan and money dude thank you so much glad you guys are enjoying the stream let's head over this way should not have done that there we go she asked to use my parkour skills to get back that's where I was and not fall and die I think this well though if you double jump close to the bottom you won't die just like that way they said back along this and then we're gonna have to come back again so gonna have to rewind and now I think that takes us to oh my tickets to the bird house actually that'd be good this is our long act considering there's plenty of acting actually this is free roll I completely forgot right now we

challenging mind you some of the bosses we've done have been a little bit challenging but just rewards your creativity from your movements and also make sure that you're just exploring as much as possible the more you explore the more you get out of the game but what is this guy saying you ninny the birdhouse oh sweet we're almost there I wonder if I have to do a boss fight for this next bit

right way though let's head down here and see what happens oh my gosh I knew that's gonna be one of these eggs jeez they properly explode don't they okay we can't get anywhere from here we're gonna have to go round we're gonna have to do it take the long roads there we go I knew that was this way for a reason oh jeez every time every time I get exploded at least there's plenty of hearts around

failed that that was such an epic fail let's go through here again hopefully no more eggs cuz if I if I have to deal with any more eggs I might actually die and concentrating epic concentration yeah I need to go through here up the ladder okay perfect cool sludge the weirdo - Colorado how's it going crazy cats Sean the human monster is one of your favorite games it's one of mine - it's very very fun Charlie gaming even watching for three years that's crazy and cheesy test subjects how's it going right that's not I almost did that jump wrong again where do I need to go I think there's a hook

oh I had that happen where's that going wit that was really weird why is that a thing he sniffed the UM he sniffed the pup when then got a bit crazy that is really odd I think I just messed it up yep good bye see you later right I think I'm actually going to leave this world back to hub I just want to see what we've got for our next next like unlock goal see what there is it's telling us to go back in there but we've already had free roam so far I'm so confused oh but how it's done so we still need to work towards a finale but you have to you have to work towards each act but you don't know what the act is called that's so weird that's really really weird right let me quickly go back to my main house wanna see what it looks like I want to see if we've got a goal for our next place this seems like it would be pretty cool to go into but it doesn't have any kind of timepiece allowance to go in what other doors have we got area unlocked area unlocked area unlocked is that one up here that one's unlocked 225 is our next one which takes us up to the top okay we need to work towards that we need we've got 17 so we need eight more that's actually quite a lot isn't it and how many more have we got here I think we can go to the once it goes on the golden vote that's what it was talking about wasn't it so we can go back through these time rifts and collect extra while they called climbers there's two more but this is what we were talking about earlier so this is what we were talking about with the Mafia that's in the jar yeah I think that's that the golden vault I think that's there then the next mission pretty sure go back to chapter 2 this is chapter one let me see what chapter two is this is chapter two right I'm pretty sure this is chapter two let me have a look yeah chapter two so you can go back and get the to try it this three time rifts here oh I can go back to this you're right this is the thing he was talking about it wasn't the other thing at all this was when he was doing the secret underground studio I'm gonna have to go back to that at some point but unfortunately guys today I'm gonna have to pull this face to you yeah because I'm going to have to end the stream I'm so sorry I'm so sorry to do this to you but I have to end the stream so far I didn't start as early as I wanted to but hey at least we've got a lot done today visited a new world

you soon bye 
It's been a long week a real long week Yeah, you read the title correctly for the past week or so I have been banned from fortnites grandma Well a banned from grannyfortnight anyway But let me just give some backstory first basically you guys know that I absolutely love the game fortnight I was uploading videos all the time streaming all the time playing all the time tweeting all the time Literally living and breathing this game. I don't know what happened to me. I'm obsessed I can't remember how I came about but me and Jem challenged each other to do something and my Challenge was to get up before 8:00 a.m. Every single day so I could work on YouTube videos and have enough time to do everything I wanted to do in the day because I would get up any later Then I just make videos make dinner and go to sleep Which isn't healthy, so I needed some kind of punishment if I didn't get up before 8 a.m. And that was I wasn't allowed to play fortnight or consume any kind of fortnight content Whatsoever no videos no streamers Nothing so for two weeks absolutely no audio. I was up before 8 a.m.. Every day. It was fantastic. I was making videos I was making videos for 3 days in advance. It was great then the fateful day came I woke up I checked my phone and then um I Got distracted before I knew it I checked the top little bit on my phone Just up here where the time isn't it says 803 so I was like ok This is bad because the deal was I had to be up and out of bed not just awake so I tried to get up and before I know it I saw this from the other side of the beds, it's Unfortunately, I didn't get away with it I tried to explain that I was awake But not up BER rightfully so I was banned for an entire week So bad they kept bringing stuff out They literally just pull out the Valentine stuff, so I'd only played like two games with the crossbow now the grenade is out They've got crazy. Cool. Skins as well, and if you don't get them in time they never got back Rightfully, so she banned me and the week is up the week finished yesterday. I loaded up the game I thought I was gonna be absolute trash so bad, but I won my first game. That's right I came back, and I won so that was my little story for today what I've been doing the past week and I'm gonna buy explains the full night Let's do this so Carla stay in the game Twelve wins abouts you pretty proud of that don't look at the time played a matches played it doesn't matter On another note look at this ridiculous glider and by the way, it's absolutely massive It's it's a crazy one you also have these all these skins I actually really like this guy, but I'm not sure whether I'm gonna buy him Yep about ten hours to decide and some cool other stuff as well On another note the battle pass ends in like five days. I think so I need to grow ten levels That's all I need and I kind of won the potato aim emoji as well, but the ultimate prize is this Black Knight So let's jump into a game and see what we can do I completely forgot. I have the the shark pickaxe That's like my favorite item in fortnight at the moment next time buddy next time so Before We jump other updates that they've made. They added other items. They've rotated out one of the SMGs which is fine No one liked it anyway They've also added new sounds and changed the way sound works, which when I was playing a really great changes Oh, I suppose dumped out ages ago. Let's go. I kind of wish they'd do more of the umbrellas cuz I swear you used to be able to get some of the glider skins as Umbrellas like if you purchase the glider or not the glider you could have it as your umbrella skin as well if you had one They should bring that back that was definitely really cool Maybe they already do it, and I don't know what we got what we got what we got we got a grenade launcher Interesting not exactly what I wanted right now. There's nothing in here either. We're gonna have to try and destroy this guy It helps if I don't fall off. We've got so many grenades. It's crazy try to put traps down as well I Don't think so buddy. It's coming in Actually worked oh jeez Probably should have checked for traps shouldn't I where are they I hope I blew it up I think I did that was amazing so looks like we now have this place to ourself. I'm pretty sure anyway Okay, something's going down over here Where is it? It's over there? Okay? I can see them Jack and I could get them from here They're running across, but I'm not sure where they're going I guess to the ring. Maybe here we go I'm gonna get them from here. This is gonna be fine absolutely fine I promise you they've gone like awkwardly underneath the hill So I'm not really gonna be able to see them, and they're firing grenades at me as well nice try buddy nice try Whoa, okay, okay stop that stop that right now someone's coming up someone's coming up. I've messed this up and missed this up massively And I'm dead I messed that up so bad. I'm keeping that one in just because they got their grenade kill Guys I just found the legendary scar in a treasure chest so now I'm gonna try and use it To kill someone and here they are This legendary scar is scary like actually really scary. There's nothing in here. Oh, you know what that's actually pretty good I've got a shotgun yet I think they would have looted most places and then just wrapped back around cuz I can't hear nothing yep I think that's what's happened here. I need me some shields like desperately shields no they work Yeah, that's more like it. Those are the shoes I was after thank you even better double shields Yes Hello fellow bear. How are you doing? I need to grab this and go like quickly I know I left a shield behind, but I need to get out of here. This is bad. This is so bad Whoa chug chug chug chug chug Okay, that makes me feel better problem is I dropped some good stuff While I was there, so I'm not quite sure what to do now guess I should just make a move and see what happens are there's someone right down here. I could probably get them They're just behind the tree How did that take so long hello I Mean, I'll take it. I love I don't mind problem. Is there's probably gonna be someone literally watching over me right here I need something long-range this will do kinda. Yeah, what is happening up there? someone's breaking something ah No no no no How did that just happen How did that just happen oh my goodness, okay? Okay? I have no idea how I just won that fight and literally took me by surprise. I thought it was someone up top Somebody's gonna be so mad. They just lost that oh my goodness. I had a shotgun and everything I have no idea what just happened dudes come on the storms coming in come on come on all right. Let's go I think someone's gonna be following me to be honest, so I'm probably not gonna do very well here Huh I just need to heal up to full. I just need one more bandage There's only five people left, and there's no buildings where we're heading to next there's someone with a massive base over there, though So I'm a little bit worried Everything should be fine look at that look at that thing okay There's another massive base up there as well, and I think people are firing at each other So we just need to be super careful, and hopefully we can get out of this alive I don't think we're going to but it's worth a shot Yeah, they're trying to get me yeah They're definitely try to get me the thing is they're gonna have to move because they're not gonna be in the next ring What just happened what just happens I had a wall behind me, and it was just gone what how did that happen? I could have had them easy and this guy he launchpad it in so I would have been out to see him But how did that happen there was no gunshots at all until I was got shot in the back And there's no way I can do anything about it, then that's so weird wait a second Wait a second new day new skin. Let's go this goes perfectly with chomp jr. Ours is magical match made in heaven This is perfect and a little bit less crazy and standout ish than the teddy bear. I got to admit I'll take that thanks for taking the wall down buddy much appreciated those a bit mean wasn't it Oh Yes To Great Kills, that's insane so someone just left a launchpad just chillin so don't mind if I do. Thank you Yeah another victim down why are you building up? There? Is that in the ring? Are you kidding me Another kill like that that is insane at a legendary scar as well That's ridiculous, okay, Weddington x-ring. I didn't know I expect to get this many kills with a grenade launcher. It's insane What just happened there, I can't quite I can't I can't quite work that out. I'm not sure what happened there I was incredibly inaccurate So I am lucky my goodness right time to set up camp that crazy base is still over there. I wish we had more grenades Man the next ring is across the river That is gonna be killer to get to people are making their way across already though. I'm gonna have to go. I think because otherwise We're not gonna make this this is super risky I don't know what to top this mountain, but I guess we're about to find out right okay? There's definitely people up there. This is gonna get a little bit crazy guys. I'm not quite sure what to do here There's a base right there. I reckon they're gonna be able to see me so I am gonna build it up a little bit I'm a way more than enough materials. I just need to be super careful I've got nothing to one-shot them, so I need to be careful. I don't think they know I'm here yet Okay, yeah, they know I'm here. They definitely know I'm here though Ended with an explosion it was such a cool game. I should have just rushed him know What That look like he came through the wall how did that even happen? Pump shotgun to the face buddy, not a nice look that was super weird though. He just traveled through the door, okay? What is happening here? This is super weird? Honestly I have no idea what just happens. There's someone in here as well, so let's try this shall we Oh Big shots big shots Yeah, buddy, oh the blue bust I love the blue burst oh My goodness someone's got the heavy machinery out someone just died in there Did that bounce off I Think I just got myself killed Just die already geez I see you I see you. I am gonna get you, bro Come on come on. No. He launched padded out of here Really, I'm following you What do you want from me, buddy? Huh? What do you want from me? You want me to kill you like this is that what you want? Finally Geez okay, that's a cup way too much of my time I'm leaving I'm going back to where I came from just because I'm still inside the circle that was intensely right Geez and I have no wood left Fantastic the only thing is I didn't get to loot the other guy because I ran after thee I ran after him five people left I feel like we can do this. We just need to be super careful Probably worth noting. There is a jump out over there It's annoying that he used it otherwise we could've that is an annoying structure over there Wow I don't think there's anyone up there It's like a slanted piece. There's someone over there though definitely Just chilling in the middle okay worth noting. Okay. This is it We're gonna have to follow the storm in which is a little bit worrying? But it should be okay because I know there's people over here So this could get a little bit sketchy and by a little bit. I mean massively so oh Geez okay, this is getting sketch. Just get it real sketchy. Oh geez oh geez No not like this not like this Jeez come on come on not like this not like this. Where did they go? Where did they go? They didn't kill themselves Where did they go I have a campfire and I need to use it pretty desperately this should work this should work definitely No He was there the whole time the other guy. I'm so angry oh What a shot that was incredible good job, buddy Well done. That was a tricky spot. I didn't pick up a med kit before I probably should have changed it for the sniper Because I already used snipers that much to be honest. I prefer a long range of salt rifle shots instead well You know what we're only Six away from completing our battle pass, maybe I'll unlock that in the next three days I think I should be able to you know what unfortunate couldn't get the win today But we were so close a couple of times.

Wait. Wait, you hear that? (I think it's thanks to us people who did the subtitles!) (Pink Thing Meme Noises) (Noises get faster) No...not that (Why not?) (Siren sounds) That. That's right, we're going back to prison! (What'd ya do this time?) Again. (For REAL??? It's like the 20th time!) (Reading on-screen text) Roll up, roll up! this traveling circus is like no other, as prison inmates perform for your entertainment! Come and be entertained by exotic animals, magic tricks, and spectacular convicts attempting to ride unicycles.  Don't worry folks, security is top priority. There's no way these clowns can escape. We'll see about that... (Yea we will won't we...) Oh my goodness! All of the prisoners are scary clowns! Look at this guy! What happened to you? They all look really terrifying... (I think they're ugly) But does that mean that we got our very own clown outfit? I hope so. (Hope it's not ugly) Yes, we do look at our face! (Ahhhh! it's...) We look... old, actually (Yeah...) But welcome back guys, to The Escapists 2 - Hey, how's it going? (good.) What is he doing to me? (Thats not nice!) What? That's abuse! (You should pull a Pryor and use a flamethrower on him) (Reading on-screen text) We have been able to acquire you from your previous prison... But I escaped all those! (it took a few days but, sure...you really did. :|) (Reading on-screen text) We get a performer, the prison system frees up a cell... Everyone's a winner! (No, not the prisoners.) I'm not sure about that... I'm not sure I am. (I'll shush now...) (Reading on-screen text) I've spent years growing Cirque Du Catastrophe... Into the finest traveling circus! Using the overspill from the prison system... To keep the crowds entertained! I see this guy has a blue mustache. That's pretty amazing. Look at him, beautiful. Oh my goodness. He's a magician What? That was amazing! He turned a plant into a human. Well done buddy, well done. You look at this guy too! Oh my goodness. This is like the happiest prison on earth. Wait is that a lion? There's a lion! (Because logic of prison games) Do you want to see an elephant? (What is this, a zoo?) Yeah sure, I would love to see one. There he is! There's camels, Zebras, what is happening here? This is the weirdest, but possibly the best prison I've ever experienced. (Reading on-screen text) Before you ask, No. It's broken... (Evil laugh) Oh yeah. This is, this is gonna be the way we get out a hundred percent (insert John Dena voice) [Are you sure about that?]) Yeah, welcome back guys to The Escapists 2. They just brought out a brand new DLC And they were nice enough to give it to me so that I can record it for you guys I am excited because you guys love this game, I love this game, and we're in a circus prison (Thanks!)     We've lent our services to the to the circus industry. I guess... And, let's see what this prison's about. You know me, I like to escape prisons in one episode, so let's see what we could do here. Everyone has clown names! Jojo, Hiccup, Gabbo, Huggle Binky, Sneezy, amazing! What's mine, just uh, just Dan I guess. Okay, I've literally done three or four jobs already. I have a hundred money. To the payphones, let's go! Where would the payphones be in such a circus do they even have payphones of the circus who knows ah? Why would they be here right here? Okay? I know where that is if I don't escape this prison through that cannon I'm gonna be severely severely upset and this guy's caught them the flying Giuseppe use epi Whatever your name is I think that guy used to fly out the cannon is job time okay? What kind of jobs can we get here everything's in like tents? It's kind of cool So we get face painting balloon Artist hanging posters or lion feeding just like a house cat except much larger and much pointy er and definitely more Dangerous so hiccup has that job where I need a job. We just do loads of errands right let's ring someone We've got it's a longshots wind-up merchant, or super rubber chicken actually this one's already unlocked I didn't even need to buy it the flag giuseppe has been grounded ever since his cannons been out of action I told you went too hard on his last flight and completely burst the firing mechanism now that cannon is just sitting there You know the flying Giuseppe is actually let's slip how that thing works despite the fancy pyrotechnics It just springs in fact anyone willing to put in the effort to replace that ruined launcher I'm sure you remember seeing how far that thing is sent flying Giuseppe in the past So we just need Springs is that it? Where are the Springs? Actually if we just go and locate the cannon we should just be able to be told what it needs I think where's this can look at this. Where do you think you're going nope nothing? Let's not do that but only in trouble yet geez I love this the music school as well. Can I play this? No, that'd be amazing oh What's that? Oh? It was the balloon job. That's cool. So you make the balloons and give them to people This is a working circuit That's very cool right where's this cannon there? It is how you doing, right? I need a crowbar to fix this thing okay first thing. We need is a crowbar escape tip Wait a second hello all just to remind for cleanliness while we're here It doesn't take much to attract vermin I shouldn't have to remind you what happened last year when rats got in with the elephant's scared the life out of it and sends it bursting out of fear on a rampage for the Local town that's actually interesting so we could give cuz there's fake rats isn't there are dead rats in some of the cells So maybe we could do that with the elephant that'll be pretty at no why you trying to fight me out What did I do are you crazy man sir madam the amazing lock caught this guy is trying to help me look look watch this There we go see you're at me oh You got stairs as well. This is cool. So there's an extra chest desk. That's what I meant. What do you have inside? you have a Battery I will take it you think you're gonna punch me huh I'm gonna take all of your belongings And you had to duct tapes amazing okay, free time is now which means I can start snooping Let's see what these clowns have got especially Jojo.

I should prepare the launch mechanism in this okay I need to craft a makeshift launcher What could that needs? Makeshift launch what does that even look like Oh two springs and a piece of wood? I saw a piece of wood earlier. Where do I get the springs from I don't think I can craft them Can I I can make a helmet that's pretty cool, but that needs a coconuts? What kind of place is this right? I need Springs woods and a coconut This person has so many delivery missions. It's crazy, so I can just keep on redoing them. They keep on bringing them back I'm not complaining though because that gives me loads of money or any of you guys selling a Coconuts or a spring no one is selling them ok. I'm gonna guess That they're hidden in places like this. Let's see shall we what's inside desk number one Oh a horn and a coconut and a crowbar. I'm gonna take the horn. I don't know what this does It's a weapon apparently that looks insane look at this thing I'm a proper clown now right it's gonna find all the secret chests. Okay. There's one down here Let's see if there's anything in here. I don't know what this is Visitation I have no idea. I don't really care. I'm gonna take something from here though. Please have what I need another Horn a file that's nothing that I need there is a desk here, but that's behind all Kinds of nonsense right it's exercise time at the end of the day Which means I think we all need to perform right now actually does it it's sending me somewhere else Maybe it doesn't it doesn't look. There's a new place Okay, oh wait. I'm in a God's quarters. This is a guards desk uh okay, let's not get caught in here I Can also go upstairs as well. I didn't realize that was a guard desk until I started looting it I was like these beds look a little bit more comfy than ours, and they are oh, I'm shot. I'm gonna get shot I'm gonna get shot. I need to go into my oh I think I've lost the horn. Oh, no the horn is a green weapon and it's show time Come on. It's my big moment pick me up quick look. There's actually people there come on. I need to do this Where are you taking me put me down put me down. I'm going I'm going I'm going. This is this is my moment Come on come on I can't be late for the first show okay, I made it I made it I made it What should I do I'm gonna? I'm gonna juggle. Let's do this look at everyone, haha This is amazing people are fighting in the middle and everything what a terrible idea for a circus But hey look look how amazing we look right now I'm gonna do the unicycle next if we haven't escaped by then actually let's do it now Let's see what the unicycle does here. We go. Are we gonna write it yes We are look at those moves red one show's over get out of here. I got some free time now I'm gonna plan my escape first things first. Let's go back to those guard desks I don't think I should be in here, but it doesn't like him getting in trouble We have a can of custard a lighter and some other things. We don't need crowbar No, don't any of those either. Is there another floor as well. Oh no. I'm on the train Maybe I can get into a secret compartment. Let's see where this leads to it might get me a big trouble Oh Oh, I'm inside the red Okay, there's a train at the back. So that's how we get around that makes sense we got a spring That's what I'm talking about. I'm taking the timber as well right I need to be careful. I need to not get cool here Okay, what have we got so far? We've got the timber We got the spring the coconut as well and a bar of chocolate just in case we need to knock someone else We only need one more spring and we can fire ourselves out of here the custard fires a weapon as well, okay Tell you what in the circus over? We've made some incredible progress Let's hope that the makeup Stays on our face for as long as we work here there must be another chest around here that I can find a spring in And I feel like it might be one of these forbidden train carts let's see if there's any on the other side cuz that required to read keys to get into and it turns out I Didn't need that. I just go through the roof. Okay. There's no more secret train. That's Maybe somewhere in here. There's another escape tip here as well. Why won't you open the door for me? I know you're in there stop ignoring me. I see you fixing things all the time that you keep avoiding me Just please fix my cannon. Oh, it's too flying Giuseppe He's left a note to try and fix it does that mean the maintenance desk has What we need that might be a really really good clue. This is solitaire I don't need to be here, but what is the best way to get into here? We need a We need a Sian key, or we can look in here. What's inside rubber chicken squirty flour and a can of custard the typical circus ingredients No, I need more intellects. There's books around here somewhere You know I need 60 to make the helmet anyway, which I'm guessing is gonna be what we need. Oh look wind-up. Mouse as well That could be the elephant escape okay. This is interesting okay appears that we have just been all beaten up just before showtime Amazing guys. I'm gonna be late for Showtime. I've got like eight seconds come on don't be late Don't be late doesn't matter if you don't perform. I'm gonna Hulu just for you guys There we go Made it whoa that could have been that could have been dodgy. I just need a spring That's all I need just a single spring. I'm gonna see if it regenerates back into this desk I'm gonna guess no because I'll be way too easy and No chocolate though. I will take definitely okay. I do actually have enough to make water putty and molten plastic So I can get a key if I need to I also have enough to make a single Cup of chocolate, but who do I knock out? I actually have no idea hmm Paper clip and battery. I think I can work of this if I do need this iron key I think I've got this what do I need to craft myself a little Taser a wire? That's all I need I need a wire, and then I've got the duct tape I need to make it okay Let's see if I can find a wire out here. Oh Why have I not been up here yet What is this it's a multiplayer escape? Well, I didn't know you could go across all of these There's a generator over there, and what is directly below us Just another cell okay. That's not helpful interesting though. I just needs again here. What's the best way to get in there? oh, there's a vent above it and I have myself a screwdriver, but Where is the vent it's it's between these two isn't it? Ah? There it is okay, I can actually do this But what if I get caught I think I I stole a screwdriver didn't I let's do it I'm gonna risk it the springs aren't contraband either so if even if I get caught it really doesn't matter. Let's go I haven't seen any guards up here yet either. I just want to check that this is actually the place Yeah, it is right. Let's do this. How long this is gonna take okay? Not so long only takes it takes 25% each time and then 5% of my stamina I should be able to do this. Let's go don't mind me lads I'm just coming in to grab a spring to fire myself out of prison. This is going to work. I promise you Oh jeez there's a guard coming in there's a guard coming in I used to grab this quickly quick Quick quick get down and search a desk quick quick quick quick quick. Oh my goodness. Let's grab Wait what there's no spring in here? There's there's no spring in here. Hello. Is there a no spring Are you kidding me? No spring. It's aw Man, this is annoying. This is really annoying I thought there'd be a spring well at least I have a hammer so I can make the I can make the coconut hats ah How can there be no spring I have no idea where the spring is I was convinced good job I didn't go and grab all the keys and stuff because that would have been a massive waste of time Also, the security's gone up, and that was my fault. I'm not even I'm not even upset I'm not even sorry either right this this and a hammer Makes the the helmets and I can't make it because I need more intellect. fantastic. Come buddy. Study your butt off. You can do this. I need 60 I think I've only got 50 at the moment 40?! Oh man. It's gonna be a long time. See you in a bit guys. I've got a lot of reading to do 60. perfect. Now I can craft this. Now the only reason I am guessing that I need this is because The other guy I caught member is named, but the other guy is wearing it. I think his name is Giuseppe So that is why I'm crafting one of those I don't know if I need it But I'm just guessing now where on earth is this spring gonna be I actually have no idea Oh, wait a second we can vent under here. I need another screwdriver desperately oh Okay, maybe not it's just chillin here. Thank you. That is a giant spring I did not think I'd be able to get that so easy. Yes. I was planning to go in the vents and everything but no RNG is on my side. Quick speedy dinner, which shot. You know. I never eat in these prisons It's like a hunger strike, but it's fine. I'm getting out of here. I don't need that. And hopefully We've got the other piece that we already need... So let's get this and let's get this I think that's all I need hopefully have enough intellect now as well I do and let's take the Helmet with us. Just in case we need that I mean this is gonna be amazing just close your eyes guys Nothing is happening here. We go fix cannon almost ready. I just need some protection I told you I am firing my way out of this prison. Yes! Here we go, get in there buddy. Just need to put my coconut helmet on. Safety first!

I can't remember what it's called, It's called like the cat launching game? Oh. Oh! oh... Oh Dear, at least I'm out of prison I might have a broken neck though good job's ours for wearing my coconut helmet. Safe glad, wait what? *laughing* You can't even speak properly It doesn't matter. I'm out of prison. I'm free. What grade did we get cuz' I feel like that was pretty quick. we got ourselves a BIG, FAT BIG, FAT A! Yeah!

okay let's just do this this is keep on going as a bench we can just sit on if we like I mean it's a pretty cool background right it's really cool it's one of my favorite levels so far I like it a lot not sure I like the gravestones and stuff that's a little bit creepy and who are these guys I think we're like these Pokemon creatures what happens if I hit them like worms like haunted worms oh is this how do I not even see this what is going on here I can move them but where would I put these I'm so confused where can I put these you know the stock part of fruit is sometimes called the flesh I certainly do guys I'm just a little bit worried about what would your plan is here and this woman looks very upset very very upset like need to put this I don't think I need to put it up there that was the wrong place wasn't it so do you want to know where to put these maybe I could feed them to someone burn them I can cook it just like this no way do these go pick it up can I just take them wherever I want let's see what happens where I take over here I'm so confused by these apples this says all the gravestones are glistening why this says something about two tree monsters maybe three tree monsters oh no that's that's disgusting it's so disgusting I can't even run while I've got this either I can take these though this is freaking me out this is really freaky oh look is that it is that where I need to put it I don't think so there's lots of glowing things lots of spirit like things lots of apples and some weird glowing foxes okay I did the first bear the contract it wants me to kill the spirits though I'm not sure if I want to do that I've only got a Big Apple to defer them I really don't know what to do with this I'm gonna take it with me anyway because it shows me the way back there we go Scrabble these oh wait do we need like more of them y'all this is weird so weird can I put these back start attacking it what on an X put it on an X I don't see any X's Oh what just happened warts who does up the Apple who's up the Apple that was freaky there's like warning signs here but I'm not sure what to be behind the tree let me see if I find it I can't go past any of the flames by the way there's these but I don't know if those are the things I need to put them on I don't even know if I'm supposed to be focusing my attention on these right now oh I see we need to block the signal okay it's gonna blow up I get it now guys how did we not have that happen the whole time we brought it over here that's insane we just need to block this signal that's cool thanks for the thanks for the tips guys is that only that stump that we can put it behind I don't know what happens if we blow up both these apples blam there we go I think I failed no I did it yes Oh guys you know exactly what to do got some yarn so this yarn we got dweller mask yarn this is spooky on requires 12 so what happens is you get 12 of those and you can craft your own hats which is very cool but we need to grab way more of those right let's get back to the contracts otherwise I'm gonna lose my soul I don't particularly feel like doing that right now and it looks like it's actually a lot of these around this is cool you've blown up though keeps blowing up I think we just exploded this diddly what's here I've got a picture dude this is so weird I'm gonna have to figure out how this all works this is like haunted it's creepy it's confusing me it's gonna drop the painting for now cuz I've spotted this oh wait I can't even get it it's frozen can I do this alright what you can get hints as well okay you can't blow it up with that so you can get hints if you use the normal hat too which is quite nice I need to infect this there we go no come on come on I do work I just got it that was so good perfect ice yarn oh that was a different one how many of those my god I've got it doesn't even tell me oh I've got four yarn so you just have normal yarn can you mix the three I'm are you sure you can't go inside these they kind of got freaky people in anyway oh oh hey sir of course not you freaked me out yes I remember don't you worry buddy okay look at this guy on the right can you see him he's like he's stuck okay okay so they're doing something that could have end him he's so creepy but I kind of like him a lot okay I do like that guy he's very cool so I'm guessing we need to put those paintings in the holes right the paintings are the paintings are linked to the purple but I don't know how I can get them to die I can't bring those okay put them in the fire maybe let's have a look cuz now there's no purple see let's see what happens yep I just set myself on fire though which was bad so let's not do that again let's do it again but properly okay I forgot I can also wall jump as well I forgot how like magically talented this girl is you need to grab that painting so I need the four paintings and that's the second thing on our soul contracts there we go right this grab

diamonds now which is good as well or what these mean can we push the houses do you think I wonder let's just focus on this for now got these floating worms as well this is such a cool level it's so cool I'm gonna parkour up here there we go proper parkour master this little lady got some yarn as well nice I don't know where the menu is where it shows you how much of each yarn you've got and as well it's so easy to get distracted in this game like I'm already distracted I'm not supposed to be coming this way oh I feel like I want to I thought it is a floating Lantern that I really want to just grab is that it how do I grab that though I'm not sure I can do this and there's a big spider over there yeah I'm backing out and I'm definitely backing out I need to get the paintings and then worry about this afterwards I'm not getting destroyed by a spider today alright the last ones up here then that's the second thing on our soul contract done so wasn't too bad of a thing to sign it was

delivery one let's sign it here we go during the delivery one let's go I can do double I don't need my soul for now oh nice [Music] you know what this guy is a little bit of a punk I do like him but

mail delivery is act 5 and will you act 2 first oh it looks like I get a new a new item that's gonna be sweet he's illegal yeah I guess he's forcing someone underage to sign a contract which isn't great isn't a great star but I saw my soul away already so I don't have a choice to be honest all right let's do this I think we got a new weapon here which would be amazing is he gonna interrupt no

right here we go what what a jump you know I need the painting with me to kind of get there and it seems to be that even if you jump on the lily pads these guys are gonna get you anyway yeah I'm Dead's so dead let me try again I mean does it matter if we die I feel like it does I need to find another heart otherwise I am gonna die yeah this is a really cool game it's it's called a hat in time if you guys haven't seen it yet I'm sure most of you or a lot of you have I'm just trying to find our heart to try and do this where we are after timepieces to save our spaceship it's a pretty crazy story but it's a good one hot beautiful bright let's start this again so you guys are saying I can use the painting to get across but I'm not 100% sure if that's true let's see we're on an job because if I throw it it doesn't oh it does okay but I need I need the painting what has happens oh okay this is bad yeah I'm stuck inside the painting now I'm stuck I'm legit stop buying this painting that was so random oh my goodness how can I do that I literally I'm stuck I don't feel like I can do it let me see what contracts we got it's definitely clean and silk with the subcon well and I can't go around the edge without the fire can i I mean I could go this way I don't think that's gonna work I have got magic actually that's a good point right can I blow this up now I tried that before haven't I oh the lily pads do work kind of no okay okay okay okay and stop stop leave me alone leave me alone thank you I'm trying to test if the lily pads work if you only stay on them for a second I think I'm staying on them for too long no they don't work all right let's get back to where we were you keep saying that but I'm not I'm not feeling it there must be a way to get across and I can't go through there without breaking the chain I know little one let's see we can do anything around this so I haven't even got to where the foxes are yeah because the the hands keep destroying me look there we go oh Jesus on it on that should not have done that she'd not done that she's not done that okay that's fine my ring certain bells what are you talking about sir I did not just need to fall in talking about her so how well can I get across there I guess I could do Park all right the well is through there look at it though look at that the background that's cool then they're talking about bells I don't know wait they still consume me every time so even if I run on the trees it consumes me that's so weird so I need to go up there okay I can see that let's see if this works there's no work I need to get over to those bits there I'm not quite sure how I can't go on those twigs I need to though let's try it no that wasn't meant to happen yes no you can't even jump on those keep going keep going keep going don't get consumed no so close I was so close okay it can be done it must be able to be done I'm gonna die though alright here we go let's keep going just keep going let's keep going let's keep going let's keep going there we go yes I got it oh my goodness so if you ring the bell the trees come to life okay that's what they were talking about okay this is cool and the well is up here we did it finally my goodness I'm a banana such a banana Marty made it so well I didn't realize you could jump over the whole time I didn't think that's the way to do it but hey we did it anyway so what is our mission here clean it okay I'm not quite sure it means by clean but we're gonna find out I'm sure big ice walls this is cool Cantwell is this this is mad oh great that's fantastic right so we know how these working out which is goods or do I I don't know where they're I need some of those pokemon things there they are come here I need your help geez exploded straight in my face I did not expect that haha what's in the chest this is exactly what I needed I need the multiple pin badge now a hundred percent because then I can do the magnet as well right we can hook shot this oh look at this that's so cool yes it's amazing guys you don't you don't even know how cool this is okay I failed that but that's fine why do I need to get to there's a lot of hook shots around here I can bounce up here and get one maybe yeah I think I can there we go did it and huh yes not quite sure where I'm heading I think I need to go this way this is cool though this is like it's like Zelda but not yes there we go made it push the button and see what happens just unlocks the door fantastic that was worth it wasn't it alright I just want to grab this quick I want to try and grab the yarn yeah so do you know I did that that was awesome that doesn't dwell a mask yawn I need loads for that I want to try and find where those creepy people as well they're like the I comment what he's called but I need to buy a pin off of him I think I've got enough money to do so so I probably need to do that now I've got my hook shot I'm feeling pretty amazing myself and I can unplug this which is apparently believable water now so he could be in trouble nice that was cool this is such a cute game oh hello I would press the button destroyed him okay this is making all of the levels way more explorable guys because now we can like hook shot everything collect even more diamonds we got 300 already pressed loads of switches find loads of hidden things it's gonna be great so great and apparently we need to I don't know why we had to buy those other levels I guess we had to sign a soul contract to get these levels but earlier we had to buy the levels from the movie star get out of here but hopefully oh no no no no I didn't mean to do that swim swim swim though drown please I died enough so far I don't think I died completely I've only lost some of my lives I haven't got game over yet and we are scaling this professionally no ended I didn't realize I did that but this does have really cool Zelda vibes like all the good things of Wind Waker if you guys have played that before that's what I was supposed to do she does those spiders keep coming out of nowhere I want to get this yarn uh was the best way to do it there we go it's not even yarn it's a rift token you don't know spaceship orb machine getting cute rewards who wouldn't want cute rewards hopefully new hats and stuff would be great okay I'm a professional at this now guys professional hook shot user link eat your hearts out all right more apples great and always use more apples an apple a day keeps the doctor away no enemy do that what's up Oh chop chop what have I done oh geez ha ha ha no oyster eh probably blasted if that is that what we needed to do to clear actually yes look yeah there we go we've made the river work contract complete we got my soul back I'm so happy and I get one of the time pieces as well so you finger these timepieces like the things in Super Mario Galaxy and Odyssey of course they're very very similar to those beautiful almost in double digits for these bad boys did you caught the notification at church that's hilarious thanks for joining even though you're a church have a good day new hat designs yeah I want your hat designs 100% so we should be able to go and buy those now right let's go and trade these rift tokens in where can I treat them in though not there up here now we've got those need 25 to unlock this sorry didn't mean to run into you buddy where do I spend these guys remember is up here no it's definitely not here we got the cat in here rift tokens use it on your spaceships orb machine we've gone of these as well but you need to collect all of them to make it happen oh I was just about to say is there any of those um is there that weird guy here but I don't think there is three gifts why can't I remember where I spend this I can't go in there but know where the old machine is that looks like an old machine but I can't break it right now can I though have I been thinking I can't break these the whole time I have dudes I can't believe it it's a small machine that takes tokens and gives a gift in return spend three tokens for a gift of course let's see what happens all dude is like a proper arcade machine hat flare new color oh I just realized I needed to claim it or reroll I'm gonna claim it I want a new color dye the color of your clothes okay let's do that ah mate that looks cool that looks really cool so you use this I don't have enough token so it's three tokens a time that's cool I like a proper mage now I'm like all in black clothing that's sweet I love that right I'm going back to the Haunted Mansion so I love it so much I need to find one of the creepy mask dudes to get another thing toilet of doom time rip detectives a cover what this means is it just where you can buy another level I think it is yes it's another time piece right I want to do this cuz it's a boss so let's go the toilet of doom are you kidding me that's hilarious are you ready for the toilet too I don't think you're ready I'm ready there it is oh it is oh I actually properly matched this world now I it's cool right let's see if we can find that I keep going to say the devil guy but it's not the devil guy at all the guy with the creepy the creepy mask I can't believe I haven't realized that I could just do this and look at the hats that's awesome so awesome want to blow these up I think oh I just got loads of diamonds this is perfect I don't like blowing up graves though it's a little bit weird thank a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do blow them all up well you can if you block anything it doesn't have to be the ones that are gold nice just got like a hundreds this is insane I didn't realize this I knew we used it before but I didn't realize we used it for this right let's go I need to find this guy just so I can do it for the boss fight just in case I need to grab anything desperately it's good for grabbing hearts and I'm pretty sure there's one right at the beginning whereas the creepy dudes is you all the way up here I'm pretty sure he is but one of my soul contracts is finished I need to cash that in so I can get my soul back I guess and I think he's up here there he is see my memory serves me well right I need this take it we gained more than 50 just by blowing up those graves thanks buddy so now I can do more than one at the same time significantly reduce the cooldown when using hats oh that's cool that's a new one I don't really need to do that though right let's equip another one let's go for the magnet badge nice so can we buy another one of those so we can use three at the same time I guess we could but not with him alright let's see if this guy will give us our soul back what why guys a pug Absolutepunk why do I trust him in the first place I have no idea look what you can grab these nooses that's crazy so this takes you to new places but why would I want to be up here and do this but I don't even know where this will go that's cool though new places to explore just because we've got this hook shot yeah I should have done that known and I should not have done that quick get out get out get out get out get out why do I keep doing this to myself did it whoa that was close I need to get out of here this place scares me for tonight is down man that's annoying oh good oh I've already made a video over today and it's a good one but less for tonight more hats what is going on here I would love to know I don't know why I jumped into it that's probably a terrible idea what is happening with these things oh it's all exploding is the toilet just got out of control I think it has let's go and sort this toilet out I forgot we had a toilet waiting for us don't think I've ever said that before it's a little bit weird right then sir I would like to talk to you I think how's it going geez this guy's a madman already I can tell I'm gonna go to my this see what I can do not quite sure I can do can I blow him up I think I can I think I just did it oh geez oh geez oh geez okay stop that what is happening I always swing into him okay I'm definitely going to use my my proper hat oh he's dropping flowers not flowers apples as well he is dropping flowers look there's roses and stuff this guy is crazy absolutely crazy get him I don't think his boss fights too bad you just need to avoid those red things like mad and you got it I don't wanna go near that it's an apple okay well it's got a timer on it Oh okay those hurt that hurts as well great this is so intense so intense gotcha see time that perfectly you just need to swing across and kick it in the face and avoid the apples as well how cool is this game guys honestly it's so nice so nice to look at it's got amazing amazing graphics such cool style great characters let's kill this guy before that train destroys us I think it's a train a haunted ghost train what is people throwing so many flowers at me I'm a bit worried that I need to use the apples know what I mean they feel like I'm not really doing that much damage to him just by kicking him hey I don't know oh maybe yeah maybe I can go into these good bubbles let's see what we can do no one hits a good bubble it didn't work oh geez oh geez there we go yeah should be able to do this now yeah there we go so we can throw the apples at him but we just need to swing into the right ones like that and we also need to jump over this No all right boom get out the way oh my goodness this is actually hard losing my mind a bit don't give us what are these Oh giant Apple what what is happening what is going on why is this so crazy what do I need to do I'm not quite sure I'm doing it anyway can you see my mind it's melting absolutely melting this toilet is like unreal I'm definitely losing my mind guys oh geez oh they're not even trains there I thought they were trains cuz they made the honking sound but they're definitely not so he powers up this giant Apple bomb and then we have to just smack him in the face this Gary's crazy this is a toilet boss fight guys I don't think I've ever done a toilet I played some weird stuff or I think I've ever done a toilet boss fight before I think I'm doing it right I'm pretty sure I'm doing it right missing all the red witches kids expose your belly flops all over the place and I get him when he's blue maybe that's it yes okay perfect [Music] No leave me alone leave me alone yeah I didn't get some money's blue okay that makes sense you got like bursts out into orgies oh geez oh geez no no no no no no no do not smack me do not smack me why can I do my double jump that well everybody got one life left I need the gift of life please I think I'm gonna die in the die here oh my goodness are we gonna squid get him no this guy's properly frustrating guys I will destroy this toilet though [Music] there we go I did it I did it smack yeah at the end please dude have you ever seen a toilet explode like that before I didn't think so I didn't think so that is crazy and we did the contract I completely forgot that was our contract I would like this please I'm about to die thank you thanks for the flowers as well nice it right nice to meet you toilet nice to meet you that was mad absolutely mad it was cool though best stream you've ever seen I know not many other streams have toilets are you fight right what do we unlock we must have unlocked something I really like the black clothes that we're rocking right now yeah it's more of an outhouse isn't it destroy them so we have actually completed up for gnarly yet so we're gonna have to do the mail delivery service I'm excited to do this one and I chose this one because it looks like we get to drive a pretty haunted scooter and I like it I think that'd be cool look at this guy's little hat he's so cute I mean he's meant to be evil and we got our hearts back I think we do how's it going dude I need to speak to you certainly that is so random where'd he go did he not complete the contract maybe Oh might be all quids it's a little bit let's see what's inside mail delivery batch upgrades all upgrades here a great you're flying had to a mail delivery scooter that is insane okay okay I told you so earlier we were talking about that looking like a cock out thing right so now we need to put the badge on which you've already got I don't know if I need the hookshot oh my goodness look this is cool like a fire male I need to aim at him yes this is perfect right let's go let's deliver mail to these pugs shall we how cool we can jump as well this is awesome right you need mail you mean mail come here buddy package to the face enjoy it was a bone we got some guy over here as well what did you get a bone as well not so bad maybe don't ask for bones next time do you need mail sir do you want some anyway enjoy this is so weird but so funny at the same time how many more have we got one two three four five six seven toes ten in total need to keep my peepers out to see anybody wants mailed your mail know anything so I'm not going back to see the toilet again that was scarring we have to go in throughout the trees there's gonna be spiders trying to attack me as well can i fire at the spiders and kill them let's see hey buddy how's it going want some mail to the face no it doesn't work there's a guy you've got mail that's a big package jeez you're on somebody's special list today right you don't want me or anyone else this is such a weird contract there you go you're gonna get in the back watch out but how many more five more can we go this way I don't think we can we haven't been this way yet the bridge is like out low oh geez I missed there we go alright ok if I quit it doesn't actually quit which is good um will I need to go across there do you reckon I don't think I can get there yes there we go combine the two and then he's gonna trap me in here oh I'm so confused I'm just seeing if there's any little minions around here if they need their mail because if you wouldn't like a new ps4 or something and you don't get it on time because you got a new delivery man and he sucks that would be completely my fault and I don't want that to happen it doesn't look like there's people around here I'm quite impressed with the way I got over here though yeah I don't need to be here that's another one of his traps so we definitely want to do that there we go so all of them are gonna be this sides I can't go through all I haven't checked backwards let's go this way I'm doing it buddy don't worry I'm doing evany or 4 left I can't do that anyone else want mail do you want some I'll give you some anyways I like you I know I know ah yeah through this way anyone through this way need some mail I need to remember where I met all these like little minion things jeez that did not that was not supposed to happen there was one there but doesn't like you there anymore which is fine I don't think they need mail over there no let's go oh it automatically told me to not drive there no driving allowed maybe they're not back here maybe I'm just thinking way too much into it I'm gonna go this way I'm going back look I'm trying to find them okay don't judge me with your big green and yellow smile if you let mean if you see any then let me know guys in the chat where on earth they are I mean they could be up here actually I keep exploding my bike by accident anyone email anyone oh geez I am in a trap again whoops what do you want you can even have a contract on you okay this is exactly the same thing it's gonna make me do another contract okay I have to do this one which is the manor let's go fine I'll do it sign that up I skipped all that because we've already seen it don't worry but I need to deliver mail let's not get distracted here we do one thing at a time can I Drive this in water I guess not nope you don't need mail [Music] why is this so difficult where are you all surely you can't be over here it's not let me use my actually is it let me my hook shot I can't even get over there it's dead it's just destroyed them I love how all those signs were abs 2.0 the toilet of doom I didn't even realize it's not anyone up there is there that wouldn't need it let me switch yeah there is okay we can find them right this fire at this guy ah yes right so we can find use the other had to find it that's quite cool there's one through here there he is Kapow one more right little hat you're gonna have to help me out here some I'm worried worried I'm not gonna RTC him oh is it one after the other through there wasn't just one around I see a little scoot over here and this is the last one and then I can cock out the pal and I take your mail sir there we go we do it now we can get our timepiece from this guy and another contract done that's two new contracts done now we just got the the manor one to do whoa what is happening do you see that that was insane alright we're not able to use this any longer so we're just gonna you know drive it all the way back up I left one I know I found it though it's kind of weird cuz the chat is delayed so if you say behind you I probably left but there we go there's another trap that we can do as well we have to figure that one out I can just walk into that trap at any time it was across the water across the bridge sorry we've done a lot today a lot already oh wait that's not like something they're weird so we didn't need to buy that at all that's gonna have a look I will come back to the Haunted one though because I like that so much I just want to see what is over here just looking a little bit you know smoking and stuff what do we got what do we got what are we unlocked maybe a time rift nope oh maybe because we got the hook shot now we can do the train rush okay that makes sense I'm not gonna do that today though guys I'll go back to that one those ones took a long time last time I feel like we've been making lots of progress today progress progress today alright let's go here I want to see if I can get to the finale I don't feel like I'm that far away would it fill up now oh I thought I was full then we got one more to do Queen Vanessa's Manor we've done the boss fight I'm guessing the finales gonna be the boss fight too we have done a finale that was when who was the girl the bearded mustache girl knows her and this is the next one let's go let's do this it's a pin this again how do I make him marry I'll jeez really you grabbed on to the edge and you jumped off that wasn't nice was there want to do the double jump right so wait it's doing the double Jeff you is doing the double jump like twice always running run isn't it okay that makes sense there was a trap here but I'm guessing there's no more contracts left so I'm gonna ring this bell and see what happens says keep out but not no I will not keep out we just walk through we can't eyes weird little Bearpaw voice is like this is like Odyssey wake I'm not even oh it's made smaller need to be so much quicker quicker quicker ice set oh jeez the camera is not being kind to me okay this is not working what happened there we need to do both at the same time but how can I get back through there now or I've messed this up I've messed up I respawn let me see if I can yeah I know I need to do this I need to get back through here though so I need to make I need to do both at the same time right yeah I can't get over otherwise it's the floor this is a major floor I might be able to get up there actually let's see if we do it a sneaky wall jump if not it's gonna be fine oh oh this is not the wrong bit I think we can do this actually is this easier if you have the other one done no how can I not get out this simple jump I'm like a parkour master no it's not working how am I supposed to get back here cuz the purple one that you need to smack then you smack this one and then I can't get out weird so weird I definitely can't get out this way I'm gonna go back to the hub and try again yes it activates if the time runs out does it let me try again anyway keeps telling me to go back there I don't wanna I want to go back to this one this one's the coolest I just love the styler it's so much I want to try and complete this one today cuz we didn't get to like halfway wait for the blue block to form okay I'm gonna do this again don't worry let's go hat girl I don't think she has a name which is a little bit upsetting maybe she does maybe I missed it alright let's try it again shall we I know my parkour steals just like absolutely rip so that one's done now you see it you see what happens yeah it does end you guys alright so I need to jump just as this one ends there we go thanks guys this is insane though look at this I think I'm gonna have to jump all the way along here it's hard doing parkour with an apple because you can't run you want the power cord to be made harder do it with an apple there we go oh my goodness I did not mean to do that I'm so sorry oh I'd say I'm sorry she can't hear me I guess I am her so I am sorry let's go let's go let's go oh my goodness I'm making up for it now aren't I my parkour skills have been well I was gonna say redeemed but I kind of ruined it let's try again there we go now run out really quickly no just run onto this one yeah there we go that's how you do it boom let's grab this let's throw this kaboom ice destroyed hello sir how are you I like those little things they look like worms but they're kind of cool let's go to the mansion look at this place this looks mad I've got like the proper black outfit to do it as well

piano it looks like we need to uh I'm guessing we're gonna see what's in here what is in here my big prize a timepiece okay was that it is that all we needed to do yeah another contract complete oh that's awesome I forgot we just need to find out what's in the Attic that stressed me out as a gift up there no it's gonna send me back oh man that was a little bit terrifying right we did it though is it the neighbor's wife I'll dude it could be actually could be intruder alert as well fantastic who's who's intruding it's a jar of ice okay right I've got two options now and one of them is the finale I think time rift detected as well yeah that's not what I'm here for I think it's done the finale is here let's just do it let's go for the finale your contract has expired obligation get what you deserve let's go is this good is this gonna be the boss fight with him this is gonna be nuts oh my goodness I think my my face kinda like like crazy then I'm sorry if I did why did I sign it I had to I had to right there's our timepiece obviously this isn't gonna go as well as we think it's gonna go we can change our color here nice the widow dye the color of your clothes so I'm guessing the three stars means that it was rare at least a little bit rare so we can grab this one so I'm gonna be like this so is it nope oh I remember [Music] you go with the soy is infected toilet and now he's throwing me to the ground what they do not give me my timepieces vacuum Punk East Omaha as well what is happening what is happening why did he steal my hand you have got to be joking oh man he's gonna decapitate me I've got no powers how am i sup this guy is insane what all I have is my double job that's it I can't even oh my word Wow okay okay he's got potions I hit the potions back maybe nope definitely can't do that Oh what my goodness this is insane guys this guy's a nutcase just try just one it's going to be something to do these potions right yes yes yes get it and wouldn't do it I was trying to throw it I'm gonna die I'm actually gonna die oh my goodness this is insane no okay let's do that again and call me an idiot it's not very nice is it all right status again oh my word at least I know what he's gonna do now I was like what are you even doing with his minions and stuff it's such a cool boss but difficult I wouldn't I couldn't figure out what we do with the potion because we can't use our umbrella either but we can use our umbrella but it wouldn't let me there we go let's go for a thousand yeah it's like an evil Willy Wonka you're right find it no chocolate though right here's the one going here just grab it was this opposed to stick to my heads I don't know what to do with that I literally have no idea and he's exploded me at the same time he's like some crazed Pokemon doing hyper beans all over the place yo look at these they're kind of cool I like those duplicates of me my gun was a thousand we can dodge these but when it gets to the old wait a second yeah okay we wait for that one now he's blue yep oh it can this is intense guys oh my word he's so angry he's at at what what even was that it's played all these minigames on me as well I don't think so buster I'll let you use blue now yes okay so this is how we do it we potion dim blue we just need to avoid wall is rampant attacks what what is happening what is that why is this guy so back we'd like some crazed like under-over Lord of the underworld that's what I was going for it likes paint as well it is nice it's avoid that cheese so we have to choose the happy one okay that makes sense now I feel like see that faces pretty quickly I don't like you you're absolutely insane this whole thing is insane I think I'm doing it though no don't get hit like that that's so noob such a noob move smack him he's not gonna give me any hearts he doesn't think he's enlike me one bit so he's definitely all gonna give any hearts I'm dead man this is so hard I'm gonna do it again don't you worry I've got it this time let me concentrate I have to defeat this guy I wonder how much health he has it's like you have to learn his attacks and stuff it's so difficult okay this is me okay get out of here get outta here you're punks I don't even like you I don't look like that's all here comes the big thousands and after this you should be able to use yeah here we go perfect so now he's blue and we're gonna son losing so much I've only lost one okay I thought that damaged me then oh that almost got me this is a terrifying attack oh my what what am I supposed to do there I don't understand that at all I just got another life gone this is a hard one I just got a heart from somewhere give me a pity heart boy this and it's a big red one there we go to avoid that touching really annoying there we go twice oh I got another ha how do I get the heart I don't even know what to do there guys anyone let me know what to do on that bit I'm so confused I don't know I think I can hit him but I don't know no that's so annoying why car I just need to figure out what to do on the dark part and then I can and then I can get it back you have to hit one of them yeah but I tried they wouldn't let me right there try not losing a heart on this bit again I will get this guys don't you worry I'm just learning boss why it's all about learning and running apparently goodness so reminds me of like one of those bosses on a crash bandicoot if any of you guys have played that cortex used a lot get outta a pond I'm going into mega concentration motor this guy is annoying me what is the scariest no still haven't got it still haven't got it choose the left face listen let me choose though smack him I got me a heart okay that's perfect okay here we go always hit the left one okay I'm gonna get ago I wasn't paying attention in whoops [Music] avoided all right left oh so we have to hit the unhappy one okay perfect thanks guys that's really helpful I need a car back from there Steph oh yes back up to four okay we got this guy's this puppy's going down downtown you look better in blue anyway blue is the best color this is a sweet boss fight oh my goodness that caught me [Music] No stop him común ha yes where's the unhappy one why can't I get them straight away I did it once but I can't do it again that's unfortunate [Music] no why did that just happen solo that was close as well he changed right at the ends this is a hard fight it's just that stupid dark beard I'm sure you just have to hit the unhappy one but it wouldn't let me unless you have to do it like straightaway and you might do yeah this is a hat in time guys such a cool game there we go didn't lose a life that time you have to do it so quickly okay that's how I'm I did it no I keep using a stupid heart I think you get a heart every time you hit him which is quite nice yeah I definitely got me I messed that up this is taking like all my concentration I just want him to turn blue so I can hit him it's all I want so if I don't do it straightaway it just kills me that's ridiculous [Music] gimme ha thanks buddy [Music] No oh I jumped into it so hard to George so hard to dodge oh my goodness [Music] did I do it no I have no idea what just happens it kind of looks cool that I'm in dark right okay this is reminding me of like undertale well there is no I kind of like him though what oh my goodness okay wait a sec sounds pretty fair to me buddy look at this contract okay let's do a zoom in showy so the tasks are get out and just get outs and the following parts will be available none of it get outs let's sign I'm out of here take all your junk so I get to keep some things we what I'm editing it yo ho stay and have fun and be nice I get all of it and I defaced him I'm gonna stay Oh cause he's already signed it and you get to be my BFF oh what an idiot it does if you've signed already I forgot about that thanks buddy I got my soul back you feel relieved energizing just the usual amount of empty now what yeah yeah okay they're gonna give the time pieces back we probably should have added that in ourselves you know what bad deal thanks buddy let's grab it that's fair thanks buddy thank you so much look how cool that is what a cool ending to that part that was awesome I loved that it was easily my favorite part of this game so far it was so much fun it just a little bit more challenging than normal it keeps zooming in on this telescope here so I guessing we need to go back to that in the future do we have enough rift tokens no we have one fantastic okay let's not do that then I was gonna say let's have one more spin but we can we've got a nice black outfit though did we we didn't get enough of this did we oh I did just press it there we go we did get the rest of it it's some match you've identified a relic from the strange planet what's it called oh I don't even know what that is a tiny train and birds basically yeah right let's go and see what the other mission will be when we continue but we did it guys I'm so happy let's see what's in this telescope now a time rift is that the same as what we had before there's a time rift and old timer flew and time left purple time piece fell and hit someone okay so we should be able to do train rush now I think I'm pretty sure because we've got the we've got the hook shot now so guys you know what we did amazing
