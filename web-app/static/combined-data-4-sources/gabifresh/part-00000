Honored to share this story as part of my collaboration with Merck on the Her Life. Her Adventures. campaign: I took this photo when I was celebrating a huge moment in my career! I literally had to pinch myself when it was happening. So many decisions in my life led to that moment  big and small. I believe that it's possible for women to have it all  and I made a conscious decision to focus my energy on my career and planning for goals.

hi this is Nick Mason Nicolette means ENCOM we're here right apartment in Williamsburg Brooklyn and I'm in my closet kind of a mix of cher Horowitz um Wednesday Addams it's definitely feminine but I also can go from like really whimsical and bright and colorful to really dark and kind of gothic that time so it just depends on my mood but I think I'm a good mix of the two architects some of my favorites I have a Provencal school or sequin top that is definitely one of my favorite pieces in my entire wardrobe I got it on sale from Karen does effect and it's a little oversized but it just has really beautiful detail but obviously the sequins or something I'm a huge sucker for and there's an exposed fur in the back and also just the tool on the edges of the sleeves and the bottom hem it just it's really special this is what I'm wearing today the dress is from ASOS I got really recently and the shoes are from Urban Outfitters they were another recent buy they were on sale for $20 my necklace the long pendant is Chris Ivana for Urban Outfitters and this one is from eat well and I mean this bracelet was a birthday present from some of my best friends a few years ago it's from me meal I think Travel inspires me a lot I've been really lucky to travel throughout the world I'm really influenced by different cultures and also having to cultural background I think has really inspired my personal style and influenced my aesthetic in a lot of ways and living in New York but you're never short of inspiration in New York City this is another one of my favorite pieces ever of all time I've had it for three years now and it's another piece that it's super beautiful it still gets printed and I just worn this over and over because it's really special and gorgeous and I think the colors are incredible it's from C by Chloe um I think I first started gravitating towards fashion when just growing up in Los Angeles I was about like 11 12 years old and all my friends started gravitating towards like teeny bopper magazines and reading like Tiger Beat and you know whatever had like the big 3-foot long pull out with the Backstreet Boys or deffence all that had no appeal to me at all and you know while they were picking up those magazines I started pulling up fashion magazines and I started reading Vogue and Elle and so it was kind of early on and I think in my adolescence that I started getting really obsessive with fashion and then I when I was 17 I came to New York and did a program at Parsons and decided like this was going to be my career I don't really like dress casually often I don't dress down a lot I tend to be like dressed up or not dressed at all but when I do have like casual days something that I I started doing to like kind of be casual that still feel like dressed up was kind of like fancy or t-shirts like this one is one of my favorites I got this year it's Christopher cane and it's just a really amazing material it's a modal Jersey so it's super fine super thin really easy to wear uncomfortable if this is a Alexander McQueen top this was one of the long bond hmm pieces this one's from you I think I got this in 2008 another McQueen top these are just another long bond hmm like they're just pieces that are really easy really versatile and it kind of takes the casual out of casual dressing you know I think it's really important to try things on and not limit yourself to just what you know is available in your size because you're really not taking advantage of everything that's out there this is another one of my favorite pieces it's kind of a soft like sweater material blazer it's from Topshop this is another one of my favorite pieces from there it's a super sheer top with little sequins and rhinestones all over it Marc by Marc Jacobs and it's a piece dress with wool at the green part is wool and the block is Jersey and again it has an explosive for little details like that or like the sweetheart bustline but I'm really drawn to I think that a sweetheart but it's just really great things for contouring the body um I bought this on gilt and I loved it so much that a little while later this color came out I don't guilt to so I end up buying both here's another look I'd probably wear this out during the day like I don't really have a filter in terms of like daytime look for the evening looks I'll start from the bottom of the boots are seat by Chloe from Mehta portait I really love that I'm three inches for fall to start so I can actually wear them more often of the Bay to skirt is from Topshop and this top left hurts your top is from all things college I just don't have enough space for all the shoes that I have but some of my absolute favorite shoes are up here in their boxes and these are definitely my fancy order shoes that don't get worn every day and the same with my bags I keep a lot of my bags here and then was that I'm using they drained the week I rotate out and put that out here are a couple of my favorite pairs of shoes with Chanel pair they were runway and I got them on sale but these are incredible there's pearls in heel and in the platform and these are definitely her favorite she was mine and they're a little bit ridiculous and quirky um and there were cats all over new meal and I love these they make me really happy I bought them for myself for my birthday I love handbags obviously you saw the ones in my closet and these are some of my other favorites this one's from you it's navy blue with gold hardware and it's huge and this is something like I use a lot on a weekly basis my husband my other favorites here at night classic Chanel that I seek when you new bag um and this means that I got for my birthday this year this is one of my best ditto for Evans dresses I actually went to London for the launch of the line it was fabulous second collection with Evans and I interviewed best ago during the launch for Vogue Italia curvy which is really exciting so if this just definitely has a lot of remembering attached to it in sentiment it does a really big point in my life making like a turning point for my career the leather jacket is from Topshop I love it the little buckles everything it's very at nineteen seventies in New York to me from necklace it's costume but it's functional so I like like hard edgy pieces with like super feminine kind of classic pieces and having that juxtaposition of the different styles that's why I really love these ruched pockets they actually are like real functional pockets and the dress and even though I'm not usually concerned with having flattering pieces I think the ruching here the way that it's straight on the hips is definitely really flattering and also like with the long expose it bird comes back of the dress I think the biggest thing to remember regardless of your size is to know that everyone has something about themselves that they're insecure about or maybe they wish they could change but when it comes to fashion I think you just have to wear what makes you happy period 
hey guys this is my video about how to make things work when you're a plus-size girl and you guys will hear me say that a lot make it work well now I'm going to explain what I mean by that I get asked a lot how I shop at straight-sided stores like forever 21 and H&amp;M and yeah I'm just going to talk about some tricks of the trade and things I learned along the way and I know I've said some of this before in my blog posts but I just want to have one video with everything so that I can send people here to watch this if they ask again in the future because I get new readers every so often so first of all and like I've explained before you should always look for specific types of materials and cuts obviously anything that stretches it's always a good thing uh-huh jersey knit is my favorite but lots of different materials stretch obviously when you're in store in the store you can go and actually feel things stretch them out buy them in that way eventually you'll be able to just tell by looking at something whether or not it will fit you and then you can move to online shopping and just by looking at the pictures online you can pretty much have a good guess about whether it will stretch to fit you and that way you can shop at Topshop and forever21 calm or wherever I know a lot of people think that I can just magically where straight sizes because I'm on a smaller end of fat but that's not true it doesn't really matter what size you are I really want to get that across whether you're a size 16 or 26 or 32 or 36 you should always try things that are not marked your size and the reason I say that for instance is because I don't just fit into size 14 so it's not like I'm a size 18 squeezing into something that's smaller than what I would normally wear I pick up everything everything obviously if they have a 14 or 16 I'm going to pull that one but if they don't have a 14 or 16 I'm gonna go to the biggest size they have whether it's a 6 or 10 or an 8 I'm gonna pick it up and as an example I'm wearing the most fabulous dress right now I have yet to actually wear it out in public but it's a mint dress with zipper details down here amazing pockets I got it at a thrift store last week and I want you guys to guess what size it is so just in your head get someone in the number that you think I would pull probably wrong because this dress is a size and I saw the dress first I loved it I saw the shoulder pads and the zippers and I was like I need that I looked at the tag I saw four I stretched it to see like what type of material it was and I put it in my shopping cart and here we are so my point is that if I is a size 20 can get a size 4 dress than you and as a size 30 can get a size 16 dress you just never know how things are gonna work out so just please don't be intimidated by what number you see and try things on make things work for you a lot of times when I shop at hmm or wherever else I may fit something and it's probably not fitting me the way the designer intended it but that's okay if it fits in a way that I like it then I will buy it a lot of times they have slouchy shirts or oversized things that are in fashion right now which means even though it's Martha size 12 it can fit up to a size 24 and again it might not be slouching on you but it might fit you perfectly in a different way and please know that I am NOT saying that you should wear anything that's not flattering and I hate that word I really do but I hope you know what I mean my point is I'm not condoning to wear things that look too small I'm condoning wearing things that may not be your size technically but that looked like they fit you by so there's a difference what else I think there's a lot more I wanted to say about this and if so I will just write it in the post and hopefully this helps some of you guys but again look for Jersey fabrics feel how things stretch look at the cut on things you can often wear dresses as tops yeah so if you have any questions I'm happy to answer them and I think that is love you guys

hey guys it's Gabi I decided to make a video post because I've gotten a lot of requests lately to do a tutorial on how i style my hair so I'm happy to do that one thing I will say is that this is the natural texture of my hair so I can't really tell you guys how to replicate that part but I can show you how i style it and what products I use and hopefully that will be helpful to some of you again my dog sorry ok so I don't wash my hair every day when I do watch it i usually use herbal essences color me happy and that's the same conditioner i use it comes in the pink bottle it smells really really good and i've been using it for years and i always get a ton of compliments on how great I smell I think a lot of people like have stopped me and asked me what perfume I'm wearing and things like that but I actually don't wear perfume so they're just smelling this so that's what I use its really good for detangling and it conditions really well and after i get out of the shower i use a flat brush like this a hard brush and I brush my wet hair forward and I then while it's still soaking wet use a beta elements defining wit on it I use about like a nickel sized amount and I just obviously work it through my hands and then work it through the top of my hair and then I use the rest whatever's left on my hands I'm the rest of my hair and at that point I just let it dry because my hair is very interesting like you can't touch it while it dries and you also it just looks really really bad if it's soaking wet or it looks bad all the way up until it's completely dry like I cannot leave the house with my hair half way it just looks terrible no matter how long it is it just looks really bad unless it's one hundred percent dry and that takes a good hour and a half no matter what and I can't use obviously a blow dryer because that will completely make it frizzy so it's just a waiting game at point and then it comes out looking something like this but I did sleep on this hair I just woke up from a nap actually and I slept in my work clothes as you can see and these earrings actually which is not good but anyway I was going to do a full tutorial like getting out of the shower and everything but because it really is very simple and I'm lazy I just decided to talk you guys through it and I hope this is enough if not and you still have questions just leave them in the comments and I will try to do my best to answer anything I haven't gone over the video so once it's dry it comes out something like this except not as crazy and then I just obviously use regular bobby pins it's almost in like a faux hawk right now but it's not quite even so I just use bobby pins and kind of grab pieces and pin it to go more towards the center I've never done this in a video so kind of backwards apart yep and then I do the same thing to the other side and like I said because I took a nap my bangs are all crooked but um anyway hopefully this looks okay until I can get to a mirror oh this is so confusing and so that's just how I do my hair it's really really not hard I use a couple of products and my hair just naturally kind of dries like this because of the way it's cut so hopefully this helps some people I don't know if you want to get your hair cut like this and you need pictures then let me know otherwise that's pretty much all i do in terms of makeup I've already done a post on my makeup routine it's very simple i do the same thing every single day boring my experiments sometimes but i'm not a really big beauty person so I'm more into clothes i'm getting 12 beauty recently but i'm still a newbie so um right now i used to use prescriptives foundation but i got poor so now i use just l'oreal true match really cheap you got a drugstore I find that it works very well but it's kind of broken me out sometimes on my face I get more pimples I notice if I started using it so just have to be very careful about making sure you remove all of your makeup obviously at night I still use a prescriptives powder I don't know what this is I think it's level 4 it's their minimal mineral powder they only have one and that foundation is actually like a shade too light for me and this powder is like a shade too dark so it ends up evening out and I use prescriptives powder mineral cheek color it's pretty pink I don't have much makeup on now again nap but hopefully from my last two posts you can see what my normal makeup would look like and in terms of lip gloss or lipstick i just use whatever I have I'm and right now I have a good peachy color on it's literally called golden pearl but I haven't I don't even know it's Elizabeth Arden it's my mom's I steal her stuff and like I said I'm not big into beauty so I don't tend to want to spend a lot of money on it so I just use what I can whenever I have some extra cash and the last thing I wanted to say is I know green nails were like the big thing in 2009 and I was obsessed like whenever I saw them but I could never find the actual nail polish whenever I went into places I can never find mint green so I asked my sister for green nail polish for Christmas and luckily she got me this se color it's called mint candy apple and it is gorgeous I'm not wearing it right now but I've literally worn it for the past I don't know how long and it's amazing I asked her to buy me two different bottles because I know this is going to be gone really fast so if you want matt green polish that's one of the colors you can use hopefully you can find it and I think that's all I wanted to say I hope this was helpful and if again you have any more questions let's just let me know in the comment and I will do my best to answer them ok bye 
hey guys I know it's been a while since I uploaded a video I mean I did have the simply be headquarters tour which I hope you guys saw i uploaded that a week or two ago but it's been such a long time since i just kind of sat down and talked to a webcam so I thought this would be a good time to share my current beauty favorites so first of all what I'm using in terms of skin care I have really bad adult acne I've talked about it sometimes on here and on Twitter and stuff and so I'm constantly searching for a skincare regimen that works for me i was using mario badescu for a while which i actually really really liked and for the price point i think it's great but since it wasn't on hundred percent clearing up my skin i thought it would be a great time to try the oil cleansing method which I read about for so long but I was too nervous to try and for those of you who don't know what it is it's like you're literally using oil and putting it on your face every night as its as a cleanser you don't use a toner a moisturizer you just need the oil and it's a really all-natural wonderful way to cleanse your skin and I know it seems counterintuitive but for it works for so many people so I decided to try it and i'm liking the results so far I mean I'm still undecided I've only been doing it for about two weeks now and I cleared up my skin immediately but then I have had if you break out since then including right now so I'm undecided we'll see what happens I'm gonna give it another month to see if my skin calm down I probably don't want to bore you with all the details about how the oil cleansing method works or what exactly to do but I find it's very easy and because it's not three steps it's just one it kind of keeps me on track in terms of actually getting up to do it every night just Google oil cleansing method and I swear there are so many resources out there that can tell you how to do it better than I can I think I used the blog crunchy Betty as kind of my guide to how to do it so there you go I'll link it below secondly I'm just finding the most amazing products at drugstores I've been reading about lengthening mascaras that have the new fibers in them and it was sounded perfect for me because I hate eyelash extensions and I just feel like it can plot your eyelashes it's a hassle and it's really expensive I'm really bad at putting on the fake ones they only last a day it just they look really fake sometimes unless you get the expensive kind I don't know I mean I know you can get nice ones at drugstores but when I found about out about these mascaras that had fibers in them so lengthen your eyelashes I was really excited because it sounded like exactly what I was looking for I was worried to use let√≠s even though I know it has had like really great recommendations and my friends who use it it just seemed expensive and you know I don't know the long-term effects so the mascara I bought is Maybelline illegal length with fiber extensions um and I'm just really impressed it doesn't make my eyelashes that much thicker i will say but the length is definitely noticeable I mean I guess what it does is it kind of has fiber in it that literally are deposited onto your eyelashes and the more coats you use the more you can tell the difference in terms of length so yeah I definitely recommend it if you're like me with naturally short eyelashes I also ran into a Walgreens or duane reade the other day well a few weeks ago actually and grabbed some mail or some lipstick colors I used to using makeup forever or NARS or mac lipsticks but I was really really impressed with these colors the one I'm wearing right now on my lips is called fuchsia fusion by Revlon and it's I mean I love highly pigmented bright pink fuchsias and I mean it's perfect I mean I can't I can't say it's any better than I mean any worse than any of the other lipsticks I've gone from name brand and the other color i got from revlon was called really red and i love that when i've gotten tons of compliments on that as well it's somewhere in this messy apartment but i can't find it so moving up as you may or may not be able to tell him this lighting i dyed the tips of my hair blonde um I dyed my hair light a while back about a year to I don't even know anymore a year and a half ago it grew out and so I had these dark roots a lot of people thought it was purposeful some people were like that girl needs a touch-up you know what i mean so i decided to just go all out and make it look fully ombre so since it was dark here and lighter down here i wanted to dye the tips even lighter to make it look you know all like it was on purpose hit which it wasn't originally but i really liked how it turned out I used feria can't remember the name of it but it was like feria bleach for light brown hair basically and yeah so I might actually do it one more time to make the ends even lighter I think you'll be able to see the radiation a little bit better when my hair straight but I didn't have time to do that today so this is it i'm really loving my curls right now I think I still do need a cut but as many of you know who read my blog I have teamed up with paul mitchell i'm one of the bloggers of one of the many bloggers in their curly hair campaign and they can't recently came out with these new hair products just for curly hair and I'm telling you they are amazing I'm fully a convert like I just loved them like I said drugstore brands are great sometimes but sometimes you do want to splurge and I really think these are worth it worth every penny the two products that i use on my hair texture are there spring-loaded detangling shampoo which is great because it doesn't have any sulfates which means like the frizz factor is amazing my hair is not as frizzy as it used to be and then what i use after i get out of the shower is the full circle leave in treatment and that's all I mean I used to have to use moves and mousses and gels paul mitchell does have a gel as well on this line but i find that these two products are all i need you know i don't know it's just I love them and the faculty have tapped into so many different bloggers different endless views different hair types it seems to really work on tons of different hair which i think is really important so if you've tried those let me know how they work for you but I've her glowing reviews from every blogger that has tried it out I think that's it this is getting a little bit long you've probably been able to tell that I'm talking really fast to try to get it all out but I will back I promise not long from now I'm actually in the middle of moving into a new apartment I finally got a lease to a new apartment don't even ask it took so long but I've been traveling so much i'm actually going to New York in a few days and then crossing my fingers I should be in Brazil after that if everything goes smoothly which it may not I don't know visas and all that stuff so yeah things are kind of crazy over here but once I get settled into my new apartment I hope to do a lot more videos I just hired an intern and she is amazing so hopefully with her help things will be more consistent and yeah I hope you guys have a wonderful day and everyone on the East Coast I've sent all my prayers and thoughts out to you guys I hope that you're doing well and I will see you guys soon alright bye and if you're watching this on youtube and not on my blog go to my blog because you guys need to see all the pictures from my halloween costume because it was awesome 
hi I'm Erin Terry and i'm yun fat and fabulous i'm 19 years old i go to school at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign and welcome to my closet I think that I'm a little bit of everything um

forever 21 not only the Fate 21 department but right the regular store I know that 12 x 12 i would say i would recommend to a lot of plus-size girls because they they stretched material stretches um I also shop the target a lot on my shop at alloy um and Delia's more hour than delius um but I shop there also because I'm very tall I'm 510 so I get a 35 inch inseam i also like shopping at torrid they're a little expensive but like for jeans since I'm very tall I just have to I have to pay for it cuz i can't find tall jeans anywhere else um these jeans i have one actually from torrid oh i don't know but i really like them they like my favorite jeans now so i have a few favorite things in my closet um one of them is really simple I wear this a lot like cuz I feel like I've been dressing it up and dressing dressing it down it's um a shirt from forever 21 I think I wear it a lot just because it's very loose and I'm I'm into a lot of loose clothing nowadays and it feels it's very comfortable especially for the summer um actually I probably wear it so much i had this on it and to make it match with like everything i just took it off and put a safety pin on the bags i can put it on when I want or not something else I like is this shirt I got from New York &amp; Company um I got it may be the last week of school and champagne they had this sixty percent off sale and I have something to do writing a lot of business casual clothes so I got this and I really really liked it I'll say it I like well i watch reality TV a lot so I like the city in the Hills city more fashion
