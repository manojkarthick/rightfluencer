In the YouTube world you could do whatever you want I remember the good old times when it was gone wrong gone sexual except with pranks some people took it too far. Or did they Today we're gonna be checking out YouTube pranks gone wrong god sakes We've gone too far first one this guy Duct-taped his friends entire room with duct tape when I say entire room I mean the whole damn room this pillows his bed That's too much work for a prank he's not kidding when he said Everything I can imagine this would really Really mess up the paint I did a video or I made like a little duct tape bridge over my pool that took me like over an hour like back And forth 15 pieces of duct tape it ain't fun It's hard and it's sticky and it sticks when you try to like take it off and then put it awesome No, no no, no. I don't fucks with duct tape or I do but not like this oh My god, I would just leave it I'd just be like okay. I'm gonna live with this because It's just too much trouble oh I like this. I like this man looks good There's a lot of work for a prank I mean at least you're gonna like draw whatever you want on and then you could like rip it off I'm hand if somebody duct tape my whole room. I'll just be like okay. This is my room now I'm gonna live with it this dude put snakes on his girlfriend who hates snakes I mean I like snakes if someone did this to me I wouldn't be mad about it, but I know a lot of people don't like snakes don't move to ginormous. Thanks What a great way to wake up I Don't know where it came from oh? There's two giant snakes on you. They just chill they're not doing anything. They just want the booty like everyone else I mean if it was something like mice or like Cockroaches or scorpions. That'd be no no no no no no no that's gone too far. I mean snakes they just chilling They're just trying to have a good time. They just want to be thick on some thick Like everybody is laughing and recording you and you are just sitting here dying I'm sorry I Don't even see tears what's with you tubers crying, and there's never tears coming out. It's all just Never tears On the bright side It's not good enough that they're not on me anymore. I don't want him in the same vicinity as me get rid of oh no No way This is just straight-up. You can't do this here What a god damn chili pepper on her tampon you cannot do this you Absolutely cannot do this Now I'm thinking about it right now you cannot do this okay? This is definitely gone way too far He put it back in the applicator and waited for her to use it This is straight-up cruel. How are you gonna? Do this year girlfriend? Like I could imagine somebody you fucking hates. Maybe as revenge for cheating That's mean But if it was like an actually really spicy pepper you probably die your baby makers gone, so this dude right here Just likes to put hot sauce on his girlfriend's burger not just any hot sauce he put this hot sauce that's supposed to be 650 times hotter than a jalapeno so like one of the hottest hot sauces there is you didn't put a couple drops He put a good chunk on that burger and gave it to his girlfriend. Oh No, she's like why are you recording me? Oh no? The sauce was supposed to burn your insides just in case she wants to take a drink Really there's chili all throughout this straw. Let's just say Kate goes to You get much, you're a dick man, no wait Maybe drinks. I'm sorry you regret it so much Yeah, I regret it so much. Just kidding I'm sorry Yeah Katie Katie Katie, here's a empty glass get some from the fridge oh Come on man yours empty glass oh wait. I don't have water show your tap water bitch Sorry I put duct tape on the tap It's a really spicy game. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. Holy shit. I'm sorry Hey I'm so sorry, Katie. I'm sorry Are you okay, I love you Duct tape On the tack so she can't get water. I love you. I love you. I love you Thank you for getting me footage from my video I couldn't understand doing this to somebody that she did on you or that you really find hey, but this The water doesn't help That's a myth. It makes. It worse this next guy is doing a little prank where he leaves a baby stroller with a fake Baby doll in it on the edge of the pier and ask somebody to take a picture of him and while somebody takes a pick The stroller slowly rolls off into the water. I mean I think this is funny thought of the stroller I Got my baby Oh my god. Oh my gosh shot of my baby Sister What are you doing? I want to know how it just moves by itself House like it on a roll itself off it when dad doesn't buy you Gerber baby food i'ma roll off this Dampier touched To roof, and it's just a baby a lot of the people don't even see You want to divorce The ocean it's so funny, how people don't even seem fazed by it like Wait what just happened did your baby? Just like fall in the water? what so there's this guy that thinks it's funny to like go up to guys and their girlfriends and Antagonize them and make fun of them, but he messed with the wrong guy and the guy ended up shooting him three times They went to the hospital. He survived over a prey No this guy thought it was funny to duct-tape His friends car the whole thing y'all better use that YouTube money to buy me a new car cuz again That's gonna screw up the paint my car's gonna be sticky if you do that Arizona or anywhere hot duct tape will stick it will not come off you can either Take me to the dealer buy me a new car you go you could give me that big fat check this video made these dudes They don't mess around when it comes to duct taping like me. I mean I half-assed my bridge but these Leave no spot uncovered the whole damn thing duct tape like man I gotta go to work guys just a prank bro, but but no really I've gotta go to work What do I just don't worry about is just the prank? I'm gonna make money you gonna take this off or not just a prank anyways. That's all for today Hope you guys enjoyed this video if you want a pipe to make sure you leave a like and comment below Which one you think went too far and subscribe Jon the wolf pack Well, I love you guys so much. Thanks for watching bye guys 
genius people who beat the system me and ding Matt Smith made a video on this and now I want to do a part two by myself no bicycle riding no rollerblading no roller skating no skateboarding and absolutely no scooter writing we got my mails right here on a unicycle it doesn't say anything about a unicycle I mean they made that sign like ain't nobody gonna use anything with wheels on this sidewalk and this dude over here well y'all can't do nothing about me and like do a circle food isn't allowed in the living room his tablet isn't allowed in the kitchen he beat the system I quit it's over so tablet is not allowed in the kitchen and food is not allowed in the living room but there was a line literally a line and he is not about to cross it he's gonna have his food and he's gonna have his iPad you better let this kid do whatever he wants cuz he's gonna grow up to be Elon Musk too so if you go that way you're paying for parking at pay box if you go that way it's at ozone so there's like this really small area right between both of them where you can perfectly park a motorcycle for free without getting towed this person knows what's up I mean that's one way to get free parking if you thought that wasn't good enough another hack you can do whenever I park illegally I just give myself a fake ticket before somebody else does it for me this is like the smartest thing I've ever seen anybody that goes to downtown LA you get a ticket everywhere they're always watching put a nice little slip in the windshield and it's like oh no I can't do anything at this car they already got a ticket little do they know it's a fake ticket this is way too good I love this I'm gonna try it out with my luck I would get double ticket are you eating healthy today I made aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato puree spread on baked whole-wheat Wow let me see what dude is just a pizza it's a pizza I mean if you think about a piece is pretty healthy you got the cheese group you got the grains you got the vegetables hell yeah eat pizza every day part of a well-balanced diet food we are required to offer by law chips and salsa yes we are under actual legal obligation to offer something and food from proper burger code doesn't count so here we are technically doing the thing $200 for nachos so I don't know in what universe they have to offer chips and salsa at this restaurant seems like a bar like who holding a gun up to your head like you better put chips and salsa on this menu you have to or we will sue you okay $200 that'll really stop people from ordering it and if they do order I'm getting $200 for some chips and salsa all you got to do is bust open some tortillas get the salsa out of the fridge pour BAM there you go $200 somebody's gonna buy it sooner or later you know like BuzzFeed that does the most expensive nachos and then when they order they're gonna get some regular ass nachos no gold flakes no nothing just chips and salsa notice due to festival rules we are not allowed to sell drinks including bottled water therefore August peanuts sale one pinna for one dollar peanut shell included one free bottle of water comes with a purchase of a peanut I mean that's one way to sell water when you're not allowed to sell water sell peanuts think of the free water it's like I'm not even selling them it's free y'all can't do anything cats who can't touch me my dad went to Vegas for five days and put a camera in the house but that ain't stopping me no you did it no and this kid did not that he didn't he did not he took a black-and-white picture of the room taped it to the wall he actually unscrewed the camera from the ceiling put it on the ground so it is looking at the living room lifehacks right here now you could throw a party do whatever you want and all dad is gonna see his living room I mean you should probably change it do like a daytime and then a nighttime you know actually make it legit but this is good we faked a proposal just to get free dessert Ashley will you marry me oh my god yes I will make sure to do it like really loud so let the whole restaurant hears and starts like recording and taking pictures the waiter comes up to you and they're like oh my god that is so sweet let me get you a free dessert what would you like they even put congratulations on it ha joke's on you we already married I mean is it worth it though for like all the attention like people like staring at you when taking pictures and stuff I mean I like the idea it just ain't me though I don't I don't like having all that attention in real life if I ever got proposed to I wouldn't want it like in public you know I wonder if they did this that like another restaurant and then somebody was at this restaurant and saw them propose and then they saw them propose at another restaurant exposed or you know what another hack for free dessert any restaurant if you say it's your birthday they will give you free dessert it's funny because when I actually went to a restaurant on my birthday I didn't say it was my birthday and it didn't get dessert well I mean that makes sense they told me to change the sign so I did I wonder what it said before by means they told him to change it he didn't know what to change it to so I'm gonna be honest with you I'm gonna put it bluntly they told me to change the sign so I did yeah so like what's the problem y'all should have been more specific about what you wanted this dude he having a boys night out he went out with the boys trying to prove to a girl that he's in bed so he's like all right guys we got you just put this behind let me put my jacket on like a blanket and look at the picture it actually looks like he's in bed but I know girls are like hold on you have a black hole too comforter you doll Oh better un when she goes to your house and sees your bed she'll remember this pic and she'll be like whose bed were you sleeping in well not work on the crazies so I didn't come home last night and this is what happened how's grandma asked where I'm at no I made a fake Becky okay what hold on I'm sending a pay her back man get you a sister like this she made a fake sister she took a doll head wrapped it up put it in bed that looks legit where she learned these skills from kids are getting way too smart they gotta be stopped at least grandma's didn't find out I mean usually your little sis is gonna be the first to rat you out like grandma I wonder why Becky's not home yet at 8:01 p.m. good guy did not what cost more buying a new tire or paying the fine to get the boot removed and got a boot put on his tire and he was like nah nah I ain't got time with this I ain't got money to deal with cops or fines or anything I cannot he took off the whole tire and put on his spare I'm gonna put the other tire back in my trunk I'll find a way to take that boot off I guess it's cheaper to do this he ain't got time for this this dude got into an exclusive party by wearing a wrapped-up receipt on his hand yes yes sir that that is a receipt he's gonna go in take pics like this is what happens when you act like you belong somewhere like they'll just let you in like they don't care or their security really sucks can you hang this out please mom he took the post-it note and hung it up like there you go mom I did exactly what you wanted are you think I meant to hang the shirt out GIMP boy unbelievable GIMP boy customer requests front door please put under doormat so they asked to put the packages under the doormat okay first of all that's already a stupid request and second of all you got exactly what you asked for this big-ass package they're gonna put it under the mat like this dude knew he was gonna get a huge package so like what do you want the UPS guy to do hmm he asked me to put it under the doormat okay I will put it under the doormat he did exactly what you wanted but like are you dumb are you sick GIMP boy it's a no dogs allowed oh no problem I just put my dog Cooper sit right there hell yeah dogs allowed everywhere take that unreasonable laws he's like so happy he's like oh I'm allowed now this is such a good day and I'm a good boy for your safety no fishing wait do birds have to follow laws because this bird is clearly fishing or is it eating comment below breaking this seal constitutes acceptance of the end-user license agreement okay I'll just open it another way to rip the other part of the seal is still intact it's not broken I didn't uh uh I didn't open it so I can return this at any time I'm not accepting no and user License Agreement nah I know I asked for my sour cream on the side but I want to see the bitch who threw this ignorant shit the little cups that we could just squeeze sour cream into hell now you want it on the side you get it on the side this person really got out onto the drive-through like this is the type of do to check their food right after they get it in the drive-through like who did this you did not just put it on the side of the taco shell this guy who came to autozone today said he wrecked his two Priuses so he welded the non wrecked parts together and made a six door car what the hell he wrecked not one to Priuses and so the parts that weren't wrecked he put on together made this monster Prius that's twice the environmental friendliness twice the amount of vegans you can

guru now this is all I need for a setup oh wait gone blood blood blood okay I want to tell you about my day while doing my makeup I had the worst well not the worst day but it was pretty bad and I'm just gonna tell you about it and I know I know there's bigger problems in this world than my little insignificant tiny problems what is my video and I'm gonna complain anytime I talk about any problems in a video no matter how big or how small people always seem to compare them the other problems like ah there's worse shit going on in the world shout-out to the asshole who use my makeup look at crusty like your face I mean if your friend or your family come up to you like hey I had a bad day and then they're like oh somebody cut me off I got the wrong McDonald's order they give me a hamburger instead of a cheeseburger oh my day is ruined I mean you got this like that you're not just gonna be like wow there's bigger problems going on in the world who gives a shit about your problems and if you do take a second and reflect on why you have no friend I don't have funds either by choice we can't trust nobody speaking of friends I'm gonna meet up with one of my youtuber friends today and I'm actually waiting for her right now I'm just gonna get ready so she's been watching my videos really cool longest time and then they started commenting on my stuff and then I started commenting on her stuff like that she's pretty and electorate is too even thought counter said most of the Venezuelan youtuber and all our videos are like in Spanish so I could not understand her but yeah I'm gonna be here today we've been like talking and we both have like bad experiences meeting up with youtubers so I feel like she knows me so she'll be like yeah I like her so my face has been breaking out so much guy like you have no idea and I feel like I talk too much in this video I'm gonna finish the rest of my makeup and also my day my hair is fading back to brown my life is just a huge mess right now okay so what I wanted to talk about today this is the first time I've ever travelled by myself I have never gotten on a plane by myself I have a really bad separation anxiety where it's like I hate being alone I don't like going anywhere without sausage or my mom or somebody I know I have to be with one of them preferably sausage I mean I did this thing a couple of months ago I could talk about it soon you know the secret project thing I've been working on I had to go a night without sausage and like sleep with other people look that's what she said I slept with two girls like actually sleep you know oh now you guys are really excited for huh and that whole night is just so embarrassing I was just crying the whole time like I couldn't help it so I was in a sleeping bag I like zipped it all the way up and I just cried myself to sleep and I brought like tissues and put it in my sleeping bag so I could've loved my nose but it was just really bad like I could not stop crying I couldn't eat I couldn't do anything it's just it gets really bad it's kind of like how my dog is like every time before we're about to leave for a trip he starts going crazy starts crying barking going apeshit and even when he sees the bags packed if he sees the bags packed or he sees luggage he knows we're leaving then he just starts going crazy so just doing this on my own for the first time I don't know I've been like super nervous the past few days like how am I gonna do this how am I gonna like go by myself I know I can I know it's physically possible for me to do things by myself but it's just likely I've been getting really bad anxiety attacks just like panic attacks and like I can't breathe like doing the simplest things like oh my god I have to walk to my gate in the airport like hyperventilating and like I was so sweaty oh my god that's a baby Shiba Inu what how do i zoom in okay but her dog is hella cute and like getting in my Oprah this morning and usually my mom takes me to the airport this is the first time I took it over to the airport instead of having my mom take me and that I was super nervous about luckily it was like a girl it wasn't like a creepy guy but it's just being in the ober knowing that I was gonna get on the plane by myself I was just getting so sweaty and so hot and like so like nervous and like jittery I don't know so happens to me when I have like a panic attack I get like really sweaty I start shaking like my hand just like tremble and my heart starts beating really fast and it's just very very unpleasant I've just had like so many panic attacks during the day just like when the plane lifted off and I didn't have anybody sitting next to me I mean that's a good thing cuz the plane was like full I was sitting in the very back the last spot and I got to like lay down during the flight and I tried to watch a show which was the first time I did that because usually I'm on a flight with sausage and we just talked her like it snuggle with him the whole time but this time I just watched American Horror Story there's that new season I came out but yeah so at the airport I got Starbucks and there was a damn hair in it a damn hair in my Starbucks drink you know what I did my flight was bored excited to get the hair and I drink the drink when I got the post mates for that lovely show I'm a plate you saw there was a hair in it too coincidence I think not like why do I keep getting hair my food and it's not mine I've always gotten here my food and I just eat it like I never complain about it because once I did complain about it and then they were like are you sure that's not your hair but now that I realize that asshole thing to say you can't say that shit to a customer really you sure that's not your hair and it wasn't like on top it was snug inside the food the one that I just had today between the cucumbers and the tomatoes Oh so the worst part about today so I came checked into my hotel they're like your reservation was cancelled so I'm like I know it's not because I made two reservations I cancelled one of them and then booked this one and they're telling me nope it's cancelled and we can't find the other one so the hotel gave me the confirmation of the one I cancelled a couple days ago I booked the hotel and a flight together it didn't give me a confirmation or anything so I thought it didn't go through so I cancelled it like it wouldn't show up anyway and my bookings in my email nothing and then I called hotels calm I was like can you cancel this one it was a different Hotel on everything look I was very specific I gave him the confirmation number I gave him everything and guess which one they canceled they canceled the one I told him not to cancel and they left me the one guy cancelled so I've been sitting here in my hotel lobby for the past hour on the phone with these stupid motherfucker she's like no man you cancelled this one and there's nothing we can do about it like I was on the phone for an hour 95% of that I was on hold waiting to be in my damn hotel room I mean I don't usually get annoyed with customer service people then she kept arguing mute like back and forth like no you're wrong you cancelled this one and then I had to buy this hotel again and the prices of course it went up so I'm paying almost double for this garbage yeah I'm paying I'm paying double literally double for this trash room and I don't me to sound like an asshole but this is a really ugly room for what I'm paying for okay so look the hotel room tour it's a big room I think that's what the money is where the money is I don't know I just hate how there's no natural lighting maybe that's why I'm biased here's the bed Oh mine unless you want to come over only if your name is Rupert okay I guess this makes it worth it I got this little sitting area for my makeup doing and I got this in my robe right here and here's the bathroom and a toilet and a shower and a bathtub and a toilet and a Sniper Wolf hello I wanna change my clothes wasn't it funny how this thing this strand of hair is like bright blue in the mirror right now it's dead-ass bright blue and it's brown in the mirror this is the lighting I think it's the lighting oh I can move light here is the finished look I forgot to bring other shoes but I like these pants is the fishnet and I got this big comfy sweater boy so badly I'm supposed to be cold so I mean la is always cold but I'm always cold too so those lighting is killing me a shirt its boobies mom's shoving me around anybody that does

close anybody there nobody's they don't like it yeah it sounds like somebody here yes during the day yeah this is during the day for me not so much at night but during the day I just feel like someone's trying to open my tent I always hear somebody opening my tent but so I heard a couple of people died a few weeks ago in the mountains yeah do the bodies just stay up there or do you bring them back to like five years ago there was a rescue team they went to what's current the highest peak then they one of the guide he found dead body in the edge of the glacier in the glacier the glacier the beginning of the glacier they found a body from I think this this guy he died and like 30 years ago what's his body like preserved yeah I think some of them is preserved but let's see some of them is exposed to the play to the Sun and cold becoming all the skins in the bone all together and seems like yes bones and skin so what do you think about spirits are there any spirits or ghosts around base camp I probably I believe that there is some energy could be the spirits of somebody they already died and probably in base camps why because there are a lot of people with the same feeling we are going up sometime probably they're coming yes tell us something or to have some I don't know something like a connection with them because we have the same feelings work so if I want to find a ghost myself what would you suggest what I look around base camp where is there anywhere I can go at night or if you go probably by yourself without light or I don't know giving some sign that you are over there for all you can you can find some signs from experience and if you are working you you you hear a lot of sounds in the sides one of them could really be spirit go up tonight see what we can find you guys can't really see much so you can't really see much of me but I'm here with Brandon and we're gonna we left the camp the camp is like way back there and we're just walking towards the mountain right now okay here we go you can't really see much I don't know if the cameras just are is your light onto we need like the boys or just walking around to see if we can find anything enough spirits or something we're headed towards the mountain it's pitch-black here at night so I can't really see much which has a night vision on or something it's like really hard to breathe here I look just in poop yeah it's like I can't even see your light I can't even see much going on need brighter lights it's like it's literally pitch black here at night so you can't see much do you see anything I think I see something over there wait maybe what it yeah wait really wait is in the river I think it's like that looks like something yeah like it like it and I look like an animals there something there's a lot of coucher during the day [Laughter] no it's usually what's over that I do see something over there yeah I keep having to like put my light up and down I don't want to walk on this ground it's like you're gonna see it's moss so it's like you sink into it so because you can't really see during the night there's not a rock or anything dude my light won't stay oh this is like really hard to like it almost looks like blood oh my god what what the water yeah what the fuck whoa you know what they were saying they were saying in the mountains that smelled like blood and that people people died and then I don't know if it goes like through that's really fucking creepy cuz I didn't see this during the day it wasn't read that's really creepy it's like oh like that so I don't know there's like no moon or anything I'm looking up at the sky right now it's pitch there's literally no moon bitch get lost yeah like if anything it would be like reflecting off of the moon if it was red but no like the water is literally red over here and then we have like the rivers here if you guys saw in the other videos the rivers during the day they're literally clear they're like blue-green clear and it's just so weird I don't know I don't know what to tell you guys but it's been another episode of exploring Peru I've been uploading a ton of these videos I mean the blood thing doesn't really like creep me out much as other stuff I still haven't found any actual ghosts yeah so I can't really talk can't really say anything but I mean we're still gonna look but anyways make sure you check out Altima expedition on YouTube red it's the whole reason I'm in Peru and all the stuff I'm doing here I got a washroom going so I love you guys thank you so much for watching we should leave a like if you want more of these videos and yeah thanks for watching bye guys [Music] 
last time on cheapest woman in the world we had angel Durr oh I'm sorry the biggest cheapskate in Texas today I've got some more cheap escapes for you so you can learn ways to save money are ways to like not feel bad about being cheap because these people take it to a new level but cheap sand this hour is probably located how can you be cheap since you are a little kid like you in the lunch line at school like damn this mule cost one dollar hell no I rather starve and then they're gonna give you the meal for free not some more like it but I had a small business and he had to find ways to get through a lot of hard times and he showed me how to think outside the box but there were some hard times and it influenced me as a child grow it up to deal with how to be a problem salt hold on over here in order to save some money she washes her family's laundry in a pool and I saw the pool I'm like damn she's got a pool in a nice backyard it looks like you have money no they are doing it and that community pool you know if you live in an apartment complex you have a pool that everybody uses she brings all our kids are to the pool like all right kids laundry day let's wash your laundry in here well there's people in the pool trying to enjoy their day off the demo laundry in the pool because the chemicals that are in the poll are saying what are the ones that are found and what it's hard running the washing machine cost money I'm not expert or anything but doesn't chlorine damage clothes I've jumped in my pool with some clothes and it's like completely screwed them up so first of all your logic is a little flawed why washing clothes at the pool is weird it makes you shock them in 1912 it feels like oh my gosh you think that's gonna stop her once Benjamin Franklin's gonna come along and get electricity in here in 1812 at Foley somebody would have bet electricity and a washing machine so we would have have to do this very expensive to maintain this pull the average pool owner spends about $3,200 a year to maintain their pool what the hell is in the pool so does it look like laundry though looks like bottles and they clean it out bottles what are you up to the pool skimmer broke so I just took a pair of pantyhose stretched it over the top and there you go pool skimmer ain't bonhomie when she put her pantyhose as a net okay I mean that's a good idea because pool supplies they are pretty expensive I'm not gonna lie a pool cover can range from several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars bubble wrap is extremely affordable covers the pool up in on at 9:00 why do I feel like this is their daily routine like they do this every damn day like hey we got all these kids wake up bright and early do our laundry in the pool cover the pool with a bubble wrap cover I don't know if it's a Arizona thing but I have never covered my pool and I've never had a problem with it so I don't know do you even need to have bubble wrap what if the birds in her neighborhood have like anxiety and they gotta like pop that like pick it all over your bubble wrap pool cover what now bubble wrap pool cover reduces the rate of evaporation and saves for approximately $100 a year on her water all right I guess they answered my question it seems they're almost $100 a year because of the water from the pool evaporates and she doesn't have to refill it seriously though I mean how much did all that bolo wrap cost that bubble wrap was at least $100 congratulations you just played yourself could've got yourself a proper pool cover off eBay I mean damn she actually has a nice house that's what being cheap gets you huh okay we have another one of these except she's gonna do it at her shower that's what she said you say I'm using a free sample of detergent I got to my clothes before I put them in the shower to soak so she's gonna wash herself while she's washing her clothes I don't know about you guys that bath water looks hella gross you're washing your clothes dirty bathwater they just soak it in there it looks like she covered the drain so the dirty water off her body is it going in the drain it's gonna like sit there and she's gonna sew Kreuk clothes in it you know what I'd rather just not wash my clothes at all I'll wash it in the sink you know no no no no I'm gonna shower my clothes are gonna shower with me or at least shower with your clothes on I don't know I feel like there's better ways to do this I almost never do laundry I think the last time I did the laundry was maybe three years ago I start wringing out these clothes I don't know about you guys but this frustrates me I am frustrated watching this I'm not trying to with my youtube money like I got money for laundry but really though a laundromat cause a couple quarters to do your laundry and a nice safe normal clean-ish setting you don't even have to pay for the water I know that's what I like all these cheap escapes are concerned about paying for water and um use a dryer father doesn't write around waste money but it's the trench coat and then wears clothes out faster of course of washing your clothes in the shower and then use a dryer what a joke wait an 18-12 over here it's cost like three dollars to wash and dry clothes okay sorry not a couple quarters it costs three dollars three dollars to do laundry and dry it I don't use toilet paper I just use water and soap to clean myself off after going to the bathroom you're telling me she does not use toilet paper don't tell me she uses her hand please I don't want to hear it I don't want to see it there's a water bottle that I have and I prints myself off if I just urinate as I am done with that and then I dry myself off with the paper towels I have if I took a dump if I took a dump I like how she's so open about it like no shame at all like if I just took a dump this is what I do but she said she's using a paper towel to dry this she reads the paper towel what is that you have been exposed you're a liar I mean maybe it's just for emergencies wipe myself down with soap and then I take the water and rinse off the soap very very annoying like imagine washing every single time you go to the bathroom and then you have to wash your hands like really good because you just watched the dumb I would not want to shake her hand so yeah technically she does wipe with her head if she goes number two girl if you meet this woman whatever you do do not shake her hand I don't believe in spending money on something that you're just gonna throw away such as toilet paper or a paper towel I stop that toilet all right there I mean I know it's just for like emergencies or you know what what if somebody comes over and they're like I'm gonna go to the bathroom she's like okay they're like all right don't turn the paper in here she's like it's okay there's a bottle wash yourself off I have a little piece of soap it's not even a full piece of soap it's like this big a little ass piece of soap I do not like your lifestyle you do you I'm not judging or anything but this is just not practical you know you can live like a normal human being for the low price of $10 a month I feel like that's all it takes just give this woman at extra $10 a bud and she could live like a normal human being thank you what the hell she looks all dirty for I'd be like the other girl she looked clean but this girl I'm afraid it's the coldest house in Wales this is their Great Hall it's our smell maybe the Polish I polished all the floors and what polish ma'am nothing here has been polished since 1812 what she polished them with special polish that you hope you can't buy in the shop oh I know what it's called I want things done how they were done in another age 1812 you know I don't like the modern smells and I hate things that make room smell nice I hate things that big room smell nice what kind of smells you like then what about products that like I don't like products use you know a bit I like a bit of dust anyway this woman hired these people to clean her house her house has not been cleaned in 29 years she's like I like a little bit of dust just cuz it's like you know gives the house some character like somebody's lived in it what the hell is your room Cornelia when was the bed in last wash yeah it's never been washed my guests hello yes here's your guest bedroom the bedding has never been washed what about the mattress you clean the matter oh please enjoy your stay like this place is haunted dusty crusty musty and the beds have never been washed okay yeah yeah I'm done maybe Hoonah umm I'm not expert or anything but it's like one old lady she obviously can't take care of the whole house why not sell the huge 20 room mansion and move it to a nice apartment I don't know just an idea but anyway that's all for today I hope you guys enjoyed this video comment below which one blew your mind the most which one do you think was the worst in this video I'd make

this video will make you very very very uncomfortable your discussion advice but it's a family-friendly video though everybody knows that one kid you know that can do all this weird their fingers okay this might not be so bad I always wish I can do this wait I always try to do that and then people make fun of me because I couldn't do wait look almost I almost did it let me do it on my other hand I'm not flexing my ring I swear okay I can't do with this hand oh wait wait wait all right I might break something but it's gonna be a try oh I try not to cringe double-jointed NIST's this one's not so bad I mean I came close to doing it now we got this person over here doing this weird freaky shit with their fingers like I always wanted to do this it's weird I could do it with my foot I don't think I'm double-jointed I can do this weird thing with my toe where it's like no I'm saying I know I know this one is still not that bad I can't do ah I almost pulled something I can't do this with my fingers oh are you uncomfortable yet wait I can do this I could do this no problem it's this double-jointed because I could do it does that mean I'm double-jointed Wow see that doesn't look so bad it looks like I'm just going like this except they take your way overboard and it goes oh it goes like this fascinating this is a hyper extendable hand trick you learn something new every day okay it gets worse it gets worse okay I don't know the double jointed knees double double knee double knee joints but this dude kid twists his whole damn you Oh God I can only twist it this much that's more than 90 degrees that does 180 degrees he twisted his damn leg 180 degrees ah I can't don't mind me here just hold in my fingers oh wait is that there a trick to doing this where you could just okay I should probably use my left hand in case I break any fingers but I swear there is a trick to doing this I knew somebody in school who used to do this or at least like fold their fingers like okay what I do it all I get is this okay see it doesn't work oh no no man this really does it for me this really does it for me I can't this dude really is holding his bottle like he has his all hand like his fingers they turned all the way around so what I knew that was going to happen and now I'm all wet okay I think we're gonna stop trying to do these because it's obviously not going to happen I wasn't blessed with double joints I think this is more than double jointed this is like your whole damn hand is like one of those sticky hands you're just like twist it any way you want I don't like this picture it makes me uncomfortable and I want to see this in action like I want to see them grab it and action like bend their fingers all the way back like completely backwards like imagine bending your fingers completely backwards it's not I can watch this thing all damn day this is so weird I'm tripping right now like this it just freaks me out it's like the knuckles go back to when you posit it's like a normal hand it doesn't look like there's anything wrong with ever oh I think I found the glitch in this game this it's not supposed to do that how hands work okay okay you think you're special in everything is there anything wrong with this ankle that's not normal I mean can i oh I can't I can't do that oh they can bend back farward the ankle they could protrude it forward that's what's wrong with it see a normal ankle it goes in this one it goes out I don't like it I don't like your foot get it away from me it's ugly gives me the heebie-jeebies [Music] so regular people when they do this their leg is broken it's bro they need to go to the hospital this dude casually stretches and legs and then just casually stretching nothing to see here my legs can bend forwards and backwards knees whoo so he just got some fancy-schmancy knees oh I don't like this he made like a turtle and someone with a stick like battling the turtle oh my god I just realized this damn knuckles go in imagine that imagine being able to bend this in normal people they break that what if I wonder if one of these people are in this situation and they get into like a really crazy fight and then somebody gets their hands are their fingers and they're trying to break them and they just go like surprise bet I would just be like hella creeped out run away like what kind of monster are you you're your fingers go backwards I'm not messing with him oh no here they are in action the nightmare in real life whoa what's he attacking that little dog before huh this is animal abuse at this point I'm very uncomfortable oh we got another one of these another one now I want to try it am I kind of doing I'm kind of doing it except just the other way he did it the other way but I'm kind of doing it

okay I just finished this and let me tell you this is the creepiest shit you will ever read in your life I thought this was boy first I can't believe what I saw this will give you nightmares and the worst part is it's real hey guys I know it's December but I wanted to do a spooky video today because so many of you guys recommended this I got so much comments asking me to read dear David from what I can see so far it's a series of tweets videos pics documenting your ghost I haven't went through these or read anything so we're gonna go through them together and everybody said it's really scary so it starts Monday August 7th so my apartment is currently being haunted by the ghost of a dead child and he's trying to kill me he started appearing in dreams but I think he's crossed over into the real world now the first time I saw him I was experiencing sleep paralysis and I saw a child sitting in the green rocking chair at the foot of my bed he had a huge misshapen head that was dented on one side I did my best to draw it you wake up in the middle of the night and you see this sitting in your rocking chair what you do I'll go pack my get out you and your big-ass head can have this house for a while he just stared at me but then he got out of the chair and started shambling towards the bed I couldn't move because I was paralyzed I have sleep paralysis fairly often it sucks right before he reached my bed I woke up screaming I had another dream a few nights later where I was in a library and a girl came up to me and said you've seen dear David haven't you I was like who and she said dear David you saw him she continued he's dead he only appears at midnight and you can ask him two questions if you say dear David first then she added but never tried to ask him a third question or he'll kill you so this is all going on in his dreams this is crazy I would be terrified to go back to sleep I was very shaking having two dreams about the same thing is pretty weird anyways a couple weeks passed without incident then David came back in another dream same situation I was in bed and he was sitting in the rocking chair near the window stare at me in the dream I say dear David how did you die he mumbles an accident in a store I say dear David what happened in the store he groans a shelf was pushed on my head that's where the big old dank came from pretty sure doesn't work that way you must be hella squishy a bookshelf falls I knew you're gonna have the dent on your head I'm frozen with fear I asked who pushed the Shelf David doesn't answer I realized that I asked the third question which I'm not supposed to do at this point I wake up absolutely terrified why are you gonna die you're gonna die you're gonna die the next couple days I Google deaths in the city but I can't find anything about a kid named David dying in a store I even tried different names like Daniel Dylan Devon nothing a few weeks go by without incident sort of randomly the apartment above mine is vacated and I have the opportunity to move into it it's a larger apartment so I'm thrilled another month or two goes by and I sort of forget about dear David I think you lost track of me because I moved upstairs yeah that apartment was haunted but lately something strange is happening for the past four nights my cats gather at the front door at exactly midnight and just stare at it almost like there's something on the other side there's got to be catnip on that other side no bells here last night I got a weird feeling and I looked out the peephole and I'm dead sir and I saw movement on the other side chill us ups okay when I opened the door and turned on the hall light nothing was there but my cat seemed unnerved bushy tails etc and that's where I am right now dear David found me I think I don't know what to do I'll keep you updated for the sixth night in a row my cat has walked over to my door promptly at midnight and stared at it okay that's a little creepy I mean up into this point although this could be bullshit I'm like why doesn't he just show his phone but he's taking a pic with it so and people don't really have flocks these days oh here's a video I can smell him this will put a normal kidney behavior if you ask me I mean if this is happening everyday at midnight it's a little weird so I took a photo through the peephole cuz I'm too scared to open the door I feel like I saw something I couldn't tell so I mustered the courage to open the door nothing was out there but I took another photo look at this Oh looks like there's something there I don't really see anything in this pic maybe a face right here maybe I'm kind of making out something over here but I mean that could be anything that could be the wall could be like your eyes playing tricks on you is it just mirrors there's something in the first photo right where the banister meets the shelves hiding in the stairs it looks like something I wasn't sure if it was a smudge or something so I took a second photo from the inside there was something out there here are the second photos I don't know about you guys but this looks like a head to me right here these are the eyes these are probably hands I can't really make out something here it just looks like duster I mean DeVries on the people again the heebie-jeebies now I dead-bolted the lock and I got in bed because I don't know what else to do I can hear I can still hear my cat meowing at the door the poor cat so happens we take a pic with Slash it's been pretty quiet tonight I'm gonna try to keep a sleep talk app to see if anything happens during the night I'm heading to bed but the cats are back at the door they only do this in the middle of the night it's routine now and here we go just minutes before midnight mio mio mio mio mio mio mio mio mio mio mio mio mio is midnight midnight now mio midnight yo yo I want some midnight now mix some snacks oh they're both there now I don't even know if this is the right kind of salt Maxwell is extra talkative tonight he's obviously trying to tell me something I used the sound app to record my apartment last night it makes individual recordings each time I hear something there was 33 recordings most of them are pretty vague a couple of them are passing cars and the like and the like but there are three that I'm interested in the first is a snapping sound of what seems like a single step it's odd because I didn't get out of bed all night I don't know to me it sounds like the cat like you jumped off the bed or something that was an explanation for everything this one is weird because out of 33 recordings it is the only one that has a strange electric sound throughout somebody said it's a poltergeist oh my god that scared the shit out of me stop the scariest thing this whole time was another song plane after that channel he lives in our part man you can hear the cars outside in the cat video so that makes more sense then there's another snap ring groan that was him nothing out of the ordinary these happen between 2:00 3:00 a.m. I have no explanation for them I'll keep recording and share if I find anything curious getting the F out of my haunted apartment for the weekend eyes nose and mouth misshapen head small stature please tell me it's just the painting I see two eyes mouths a weird head son the selfie he took it's in the selfie he took whoa I see it now wait these are the eyes this is the nose this is the mouth or it could be these are the eyes either way it does kind of look like a face still not convinced so a weird thing just happened take it with a grain of salt I bought a Polaroid camera this weekend because they're fun and dorky I decided to take a few photos around my apartment Polaroids are stupid and fun and inherently sort of creepy I didn't expect to find anything and for the most part I didn't I took a couple of my living room and bedroom that's the rocking chair I first saw David in there pretty unremarkable so he actually has the green rocking chair bro if I saw a ghost in my dream and he kept haunting me I would get rid of that shake don't don't give him anywhere to sit if you're gonna come in my apartment you gonna have to stand I know it's a little rude but here ghosts and he's not supposed to be there in the first place so you don't have to take that away from him then I went into the hallway and I snapped a photo the polaroid developed completely black I even ripped open and destroyed a fresh pack to see if it was just an undeveloped Polaroid but they start out white I also thought maybe I accidentally covered my lens with my so I took a photo while intentionally covering it the photo on the left is me covering the lens with my finger and the one on the right is a fully lit hallway taking just after midnight so this could be nothing I'm not sure what to make of it one last thing I wanted to double check there's a couple videos of me taking photos good give me the receipts because I'm not buying it okay here's my living room I'll leave that there okay now I'm gonna take a photo of the hallway just to show you let's see what this one does come on if it doesn't develop that is actually very creepy take a minute I knew know there was a damn poltergeist in there but I mean all of this until now I feel it could be faked I might need some real proof it came out totally black again for a second time honestly I don't know why I'm still fucking around with this camera there might be a logical explanation someone told me to take photos from farther away and I tried that once with my iPhone and once with a Polaroid huh I don't like this okay this I don't like you took a picture of the hallway with his iPhone and it came out fine left as with my iPhone right is with my Polaroid the hall light was on both times why is it pitch-black each time with a Polaroid okay okay somebody call an exorcist okay first of all you need to get you some holy water second of all you need to get out of there is the hallway keep your door closed folks have been arguing with me to get some sage so I did so he burned in some sage sage in the hall and definitely sage in the hell out of this rocking chair cuz I like it I don't throw it out a key over here selling cursed furniture honestly sage doesn't seem like it'll help much but I'm open to anything I barely slept last night I kept waking up feeling like something was wrong but who knows maybe this will do something sage did not work I haven't dreamed about David in a few months but he appeared last night in the dream my bedroom was filled with a hazy smoke but I could see David sitting in the chair across the room boy you say she didn't do anything but make a smell would you want the rocking chair I'm gonna put it in the hallway okay if you like to chill there's so much just my apartment he was smaller this time almost shrunken he didn't do or say anything except look at me anyways it feels like a bad omen it's been two weeks and he still does this every night at midnight other weird stuff has been happening to I've been recording myself sleeping and it picks up this weird static electricity sound every night it lasts about five minutes this morning I woke up to the whole house shaking it felt like a small earthquake I debated even mentioning that on Twitter because it sounds made-up but I distinctly felt the house swaying it's just a whole bunch of small things that happened at once I feel so uneasy like right before a thunderstorm comes everybody is telling me to move but I don't have any guarantee that this won't follow me they issued a thunderstorm warning for tonight everyone in the city is talking about how weird the sky looks I can hear Rolling Thunder in the distance it doesn't look weird it looks like a damn thunderstorm all this ghost stuff has been spooky but the past weekend the first time I actually felt unsafe in my home on Friday night there was supposed to be a huge storm in the end it passed but the night was just bizarre anyway I fell asleep pretty early I was incredibly tired for some reason I had a dream that night where David was dragging me by the arm through an old abandoned warehouse I'm not sure why I didn't fight back in the dream or javi was strong enough to pull me but that's the dream logic for you it was a creepy dream but I didn't think much of it when I woke up I took a shower and then notice something I'd waken up with a huge bruise on my arm oh no I've seen this so many times ghosts leaving bruises on people now look maybe I injured myself the day before my arm was hurting during the night which manifested as a dream there could be a totally logical explanation for this so I brushed it off went to get a coffee which I do every weekend when I walk to the coffee place I always pass a food cart repair depot it was incredibly busy especially on weekends I've lived in the neighborhood for over four years and the place has always been jam-packed with carts getting serviced but today was completely abandoned the whole warehouse was totally gutted and empty well almost empty I went inside to look around because I was astonished this place was suddenly empty after all these years basically the only thing in the entire warehouse was a single green Cher bra if you recall David first appeared in my green rocking chair it could be nothing but it's weird that is the only thing left behind on my way back from coffee the warehouse had been shuttered it's remained shuttered since the chair my bruised dreaming about an empty warehouse and then passing by one it gave me the creeps needless to say I gonna dream much that night too many strange things are happening and more frequently so I don't know anyways it was a strange weekend there had been a few small developments in my apartment but not really sure what to make of them I just know I'm scared if you recall my cats usually gather at the door at midnight but lately it's been getting earlier and earlier every night I was almost used to routines so when they started to cry at the door closer to 10:00 p.m. I was confused they began a new routine hover around the door at 10 p.m. cry for about 15 minutes then wander off nothing's wrong but this week something else has been happening shortly after the usual cat stuff around 10:30 or so I start getting phone calls from an unmarked number no caller ID my entire call history for the past week looks like this you'll notice that I answered once yesterday since this has been happening for days on end I thought it might be an automated telemarketer or something usually if it's an automated thing if you answer one say quit calling so I picked up instead what I heard on the other end was a peculiar electrical static sound very similar to the static in my sleep a picks up at night I didn't say anything I just listened waiting for some automated message to chime in after about a minute the static stopped and there was silence I kept listening I heard what I thought was breathing but it was so faint I can't be sure my heart was racing so it was hard to hear then just as I was about to hang up I heard a very small voice whisper something about the way they said hello freaked me out it wasn't a question or greeting just hello a flat statement so quiet I could barely hear it I panicked and hung up I didn't know what else to do I closed all my curtains in my apartment and turned on every single light I watched TV until dawn because I was too scared to go to sleep I sort of feel like I'm losing my mind I look at each individual incident on its own there are perfectly logical explanations for everything but after three weeks of weird shit happening I don't know how to make sense of it all the only thing I feel like I can do right now is write everything down so that's what I'm doing and that's what I'll keep doing so I move the green chair out of the bedroom weeks ago it's been various parts of the living room ever since I should probably get rid of it but I'm not sure that would have any effect also I'm going on vacation to Japan in three weeks and I keep thinking if I can make it to my trip also I'm going on vacation to Japan in three weeks and I keep thinking if I can make it to my trip this will all end as dumb as that sounds David lost track of me once I moved so maybe if he believes I've left the apartment again he'll leave me alone anyways last week I bought a pet monitoring camera so I can keep an eye on the cats while I'm overseas it's basically a nanny cam that connects to Wi-Fi so you can check in whenever you want it runs 24/7 it also alerts you to sound and movement via an app I blocked out the company since I doubt they want to be associated with ghosts in any event I decided to test it out this weekend I was away from home one night so I set up the camera before I left my phone pinged periodically through the evening alerting me that the cats running around and playing normal stuff then around 11:00 it alerted me again that it detected motion but when I check the feed of my apartment I didn't see anything so I watched the feet again still nothing I watched it a third time and finally noticed something watch the chair I'm not sure I want to that damn chair is gonna start rocking oh my lord oh my lord oh my lord throw away the damn chair this is not OK this is not chair this dude with the big-ass dented head I'm gonna just chill in your apartment when you're gone that's not okay man that's not okay I'm gonna take that chair I'm gonna put it in the hallway you can rock out there as much as you'd like but this is not okay I knew it couldn't be the wind because I haven't had the windows open all this summer I have a/c and like to keep it chilly it was it was unnerving but there wasn't anything I could do about it right then so I flipped my phone off and tried not to panic about half an hour later I got another motion alert oh do I want to watch this here's the feet of that alert I do not want oh god oh god oh my god oh my god this guy is not lying this guy is not lying this guy is not lying holy shit let's watch this fullscreen oh my lord what the fuck is that look at the chair something it's straight up moving in that damn chair and you see that thing at the top it just Falls it just Falls he rocked that shit so hard it fell I don't like this I don't like this anymore I don't like this anymore I want this to stop please I should give me one of those motion can't see if anything creepy like that happens in my house if you missed it the first time look above the shelf it's a little turtle shell that I hung up on the wall yes I know it's weird to own a turtle shell but my family lives in Montana and I picked it up last year at a native trading post since I've been back home I've been too nervous to turn the camera back on and today has been pretty quiet that said I feel really uneasy I put the chair back in the hall I hope nothing else happens tonight it's happening again thread I've been leaving the nanny-cam on 24/7 air of course every time there's movement or sound as you know I was going over stuff from the feed this weekend and noticed some weird stuff during the night on Saturday while I slept I recorded the cat's in the living room it seemed pretty unremarkable at first but then after a few moments Maxwell freaks out and jumps over something invisible that's weird that oh I thought I saw something I thought and it looks like the cat saw something - oh that's the other cat I don't think it was a bug or anything Maxwell doesn't react like that with bugs he just eats them something spooked him well smart I never get bugs so maybe like three and all the years I've lived there anyways the next night the camera recorded a couple more strange videos oh my god let's see this here video specifically it recorded Maxwell doing this on and off for hours was standing on the couch real weird oh maybe likes to chill up there doesn't nothing he'd sit up on his hind legs and peer around the room as if looking for something or looking at something this is odd behavior for him and I can't come up with an explanation for it especially because in the next video okay that was something there whoa whoa what is this he's possessing your damn cat what is this the cat sees the ghost cat sees the freaking ghost how can this be I do not get it that's some fishy business going on here and I don't like it I suppose there's a chance it was a fly but I honestly never get flies so that seems unlikely I just can't shake the feeling that something is made its way into the apartment it's odd behavior from Max well in any event things feel off this week I can't explain it I've been having so much nightmares lately they're way more intense than my usual dreams - I don't know if it's because I'm stressed or if it's something else this afternoon I took a nap and I had a dream I haven't been able to shake in the dream I was laying in my bed and rolled over to face the other direction on the pillow next to me was a severed head with a bloody spine attached snaking down the bed the head was staring right at me somehow still alive it had this huge smile plastered on its face horrified I screamed what happened to you the head smiled even bigger it feels great the groans after that I woke up it was dark outside by then everything was quiet other dreams have been just as strange things like dark figures staring in my window even though I live on the second floor stuff that makes no sense in relation to what I have been experiencing in real life after that dream about the head I've been feeling uneasy all night I couldn't stop thinking about it I decided to go for a walk if for no other reason than to get out of my apartment I went to bodega a few blocks away to get a snack on the way I had to pass the warehouse that was boarded up a few weeks ago it's actually on the way to everything I passed it twice a day just to get to the subway I hurried past it since it freaks me out at the bodega I got Doritos and a seltzer then made my way back home make him away back home walk and fast trot fuck up these ghosts when I passed the warehouse a second time I heard a dull funk from the other side of the shutters i frozen place but there was no other sound after that I probably should just continued on but my curiosity got the better of me there was a granted there was a graded window next to the doors about a foot above my head too high to see into so I thought to myself okay I'm gonna hold my phone up to the window take one photo and then run for my life I mean sure my flash was on position my camera lens through one of the grates and snapped a photo I almost thought I saw movement when the flash went off but I couldn't be certain the light bounced off the grates and was pretty blinding I couldn't even look at the photo I just ran all the way home to jumpy to look at it for a while and just ate my Doritos nervously when I finally did look at the photo here's what I saw it seemed to be a different part of the warehouse maybe like an office what is that what is this I don't know what this is there was a bunch of old insulation I won't look like a filing cabinet and a ripped up leather desk chair then I noticed something else in the upper right corner something that seemed like a face oh no oh oh the more I stared at it the more it started to look like a nondescript blur now I can't even be sure what I'm seeing maybe I'm too deep into this and my brain wants to see David when he's not there that definitely a damn face it's something is something there's something there there's something there I see ID Leslie knows I see like a skylight I don't like this I don't like this at all but here I messed up with the filters on my phone a bit tell me this doesn't look like him this doesn't look like him I don't know you can't be sure I bought a votive tablet the shrine I'm at in Japan please protect my castle I'm away from home oh so in Japan he saw a statue and one of the kids on the statue had a dented head I don't know if I'm overreacting maybe it's nothing it doesn't feel like nothing anyways I have to pack for my flight home in the morning it'll be good to see the cats again at least okay now it's just she overreacting I made it home safely the cats are fine if a little more talkative than usual oh this cat is adorable where things have been happening with the electricity in my apartment this week first two bulbs have burned out in the hallway in less than a week at this point I've just left it alone rather than get a ladder again but the strangest thing has to do with the blacklight on my TV it's an LED strip that plugs into the TV itself via USB the TV has to be on in order for the backlight to be on but last night the backlight was flickering on and off by itself I noticed it sometime before dawn when I woke up and went into the kitchen to get some water I'd barely got back into the bed again when I saw a faint light come on in the living room after a few seconds it went dark again I went back to the living room and I stood there watching the backlight go on and off on and off for at least a few minutes it was bizarre eventually it stopped and now the backlight doesn't work at all it's only a couple months old so it shouldn't be dead already anyways I couldn't go back to sleep so I went to dinner near my apartment it was the only thing open at 4:00 a.m. when I got back home the Sun was starting to come up so I figured I might as well shower and going to work early I showered then brushed my teeth and then headed to the bedroom to get dressed as I passed my front door I thought I heard a faint scratching sound from the other it was so soft I wasn't sure it had really happened I went to the door but I was too scared to look through the people since there's a skylight just outside my daughter the hall was a wash and a faint yellow green light I snapped a couple photos at first the photos didn't seem like anything just blurry nothingness but as I analyzed it and started noticing things part of a face an ear and eye staring right back at me this is an ear I'm taking it oh god oh god I see a freaking eye here and an ear here and this the bald ass head I see it now I think maybe it's time to get someone else involved this obviously this isn't gonna stop until I do something I'm just not sure what that is yet I'll let you know when I figure something out first I had a friend come over to do some cleansing stuff she did the whole apartment in the hallway a lot of self-proclaimed professional mediums have reached out plus a dozen ghost hunter TV shows I've declined them all because I don't really want strangers in my house sensationalizing what's going on so instead I had a friend come over and cleanse the place for about a week or so it seemed like it worked things appeared to go back to normal the cats weren't gathering at the door anymore I stopped having dreams it was like starting to seem like it was over then when warning last week I was walking to work and past the shuttered warehouse as usual this time all the metal doors are wide open sunlight pouring in the warehouse was still mostly empty except for one thing there was a hearse park near the back wall all right the warehouse had been closed for over two months I have no idea why it was open that day no one was around it was weird but I tried not to think about it it's not all that strange to see a hearse I guess like they have to park somewhere I tried to put it out of my mind the next several days were uneventful but something else happened last night it was around 11:00 or so and I was watching TV on the couch I went into the dining room to get a drink from the fridge and notice both cats sitting by the far window staring up at it the window looks out onto the roof of the businesses next door the window looks out onto the roof of the business next door I glanced out the window but didn't see anything I figured that maybe there was a mouse in the wall or something I shrugged and grabbed a beer from the fridge as I went to the kitchen to get a bottle opener I noticed something there's a window in the kitchen which looks out onto the same roof and some with standing on the roof staring at me I immediately ducked down and reached up and flicked the light switch and peered the windowsill but I couldn't see much my phone was in my pocket so I grabbed it and took a photo it was blurry and dark but I swear someone was out there where I don't see somebody maybe they like just chill on the roof I tried to take a better photo but the figure had disappeared I closed all the blinds and made sure the door was locked and drank five more beers until I was too drunk to be scared but now I feel like I'm back at square one I'm sure it was him and he's not going away I don't know what to do it's been about four months since I first dreamed of David this might be long but stick with me last night I dreamed about it last night I dreamed about him again it was almost exactly the same as the first time I saw him in the dream I saw him in a chair again I don't have the green chair in my room anymore this time it was a recliner I've had for years he was staring right at me just like the first time again I felt paralyzed I could barely move but this time something was different I still felt mostly immobile but I could squirm just a little bit I felt more alert I could move my hands somewhat David glared at me and I dreaded what I knew was coming he was going to get out of the chair and come towards me like before I had to do something I had to do something I kept my phone next to me on the bed and I somehow managed to get a hold of it I thought if David is going to kill me maybe I can at least get evidence on my phone I started snapping pictures in the dark sure enough he crawled down off the chair and began shuffling towards me he moved slowly like it was a struggle for him I felt terrified but I kept taking photos David limped closer towards me never taking his eyes off me soon I was face to face with him he started muttering something too quiet for me to understand I watched as his eyes rolled back in his head until they were all white I tried to ride away from him but I could barely move I stared in horror as he began crawling up into my bed still murmuring something and that's when I woke up same as before broad daylight no trace of David anywhere it's almost routine now but it was a dream after all so I got up and went to work after a while the stress of the dream melted away I wasn't even gonna write about this since it wasn't new information but tonight I noticed something that petrified me I went into my to find a picture from a couple days ago and I saw dozens of pitch-black photos on my camera roll all from last night oh no no it's better to just show you turn up your brightness because they're pretty dark oh my god I don't want to oh my fucking god oh my no no way no way this is real no way this is real I oh my god no no uh-uh I'm gonna turn my brightness back down thank you that's I can't believe it I can't believe it I literally cannot believe this this is this this this is not real this is not real it can't be real there's no way this is real oh no no no no no no no this is not real this is not real this is not real this is not real ahh this is the one that made my heart drop usually I can come up with some sort of excuse for what's happening but I have no logical explanation for this so I'm sitting here on my couch freaking out I certainly won't be able to sleep I just felt like I needed to get this out for anyone asking yes I am Alive I've been on the quiet side because there's something I'm trying to investigate and I'm not sure how to yet I rather not tweet unless I have something substantial to share it's also sort of hard to explain the logistics of what I'm trying to find out what I'll do my best basically there's a part of my apartment I'm just learning about at least that's what I think to refresh your memory I live in a duplex I used to live on the first floor now I live on the second floor it's a long boxy building that looks like this the other week I was tweeting the most recent update from the living room couch about 30 seconds after I sent the last tweet I heard a thump directly above my head as if something above me had dropped something on the floor which is impossible since I'm at the top apartment also there's no way to access the roof there aren't any ladders on the outside of the building the only way you'd get on the roof is through a skylight in the hallway and there are no trees in the immediate vicinity either it's definitely wasn't pipes either it was distinctly the sound of something falling to the floor my building is old and makes lots of noises but this is a new sound and it startled me so I'm thinking is there some secret crawlspace in my home I look all over my apartment but I can't figure it out so I go into the hallway and that's when something dawns on me there's no real way to ease into this I'll just say it there's a mysterious hatch in my hallway I've always known about it but I just assumed it opened directly and to the roof it's really high above the stairs so I always figured it was impossible to access this without some sort of fancy professional ladder I took the video so you can see how high it is oh damn that's pretty damn high I see that hatch every morning when I leave for work and think nothing of it but this time something dawned on me it can't lead to the roof because it's actually below the roof I'm about to spring some simple Matthew so I apologize in advance I checked Google Earth to make sure the hatch is about three feet below the skylight meaning there's about three feet of empty space between the two openings I think maybe the hatch leads to a short ladder going through the roof but even if that's the case the hatch is level with all the ceilings in my apartment that means there's three feet of empty space all over my apartment I was ready to explain this for a few reasons one it might just be some sort of insulated space that all residential buildings have I'm not an architect so what do I know it doesn't seem relevant enough at the time so I decided I wasn't gonna mention it here but over the past week and a half I've been hearing more things above me a few days after the first sound I heard a similar thump while I was in the kitchen then last night I heard something small clink to the floor and roll about 6 feet before stopping something is going up there maybe it's hour a coon maybe it's not I also can't get over the fact that the hatch is in such a weird inaccessible place over the stairs I need to investigate I'm just not sure how right now this video is getting really really long so basically he just bought a pole off Amazon and there's no tweets after that I will keep you updated leave a like if you want a part too when we get more information about this but oh my god this actually blows my mind like it's not bullsh it's actually real I'm scared but anyways that's all for today you're the real MVP for sticking this whole time if you watch the whole thing you're amazing I love you I hope you enjoyed this video Oh make sure you subscribe John the Wolfpack I love you guys so much thanks for watching bye guys 
hey guys today we're going to be reading notes from teachers I'm thinking about it now I don't ever think I got a note ran home and if I did I just didn't show my parents you know when teachers asked you to give a paper to your parents and have them sign it and give them back half your parents signatures are just squiggles you could literally just squiggle something on everything and forge a signature I think I do that like once in high school I was just so terrified that she'd look at it and be like hmm that's not Lea's mom's signature and then she'll get the actual signature and then she'll compare them like this is obviously a fake you did this no I mean I'm an adult now and whenever somebody asked me to sign something is literally just a scribble it's like kind of my name it's kind of not is just a scribble so but anyways I have like almost the thing you do this video so this little girl cut her own hair in class and then the teachers there what do I do let me just take whatever hairs I can find put him in a plastic baggy and send it to her parents let me cut her hair today I'm so sorry well you can't really do anything about it like you give a kid scissors today we're gonna be cutting out triangles and then they'd be like oh scissor there's literally nothing you could do about it so here dummies parents sorry sorry she cut her hair wasn't that much anyway I mean in preschool I cut my brother's ear I didn't cut it off what I like sliced that's why you should never play with scissors or give kids scissors without washing them like there's a joke and I ended up cutting his ear and it's scarred like I don't remember why I even did it I was like four or five years old during math Aidan told another student he drew a boy with a penis pooping she then scratch out the picture Aidan spent some time with me at recess he said he tried to draw a Green Lantern but it didn't work out I explained that we don't need to talk about penises and pooping during math thanks Sarah this must be so awkward to send home to the parent so he was tried to drug Green Lantern but she saw it as drying a boy with a penis pooping but is this still Green Lantern pooping you know what I could draw something and it looks like something else like something dirty no he said he was dry Green Lantern he was obviously dry and Green Lantern you're just making this awkward but embarrassing him like what if his parents would back the belt and beat him you penis is like pooping during math no but my smiles just try to jog lead lantern let's teach her the real MVP for sending this warning Omar has a worm in her pocket she did not want to throw it away I just wanted to give you a heads up look oh you got a worm in your pocket that's okay I'm just gonna like give this to your mom okay like damn kid can't read I don't want her to know about my worm I don't know why kids are so fascinated by worms so this is like a behavioral report cards that a teacher sent home with a kid and she circled the triggered face trying to kiss a girl in class slash cafeteria class and cafeteria boy if she don't want it in the classroom what makes you think she's gonna want it in the cafeteria I like how she put tried not successfully kissed the girl he tried but he didn't teacher attached a note to this girl's chapstick Danika let her friend smell her chapstick and the friend accidentally took a bite sorry what kids these are monsters hey do you wanna smell my chapstick kid it smells good therefore I must eat it during math today max was having a hard time following along when I asked him why he wasn't doing his math max responded well I'm just too good-looking we talked it over and he has now agreed even good-looking people need to know math he is such a hoot I hope his self-confidence stays with him always I don't have to do math because I'm gonna be an Instagram model the only math I need to learn is how much followers I have also how much my fifty sponsorship is there's anyone that doesn't need to learn math it's influencers hi Sandra Kimmy was very proud of her poem she even tried to rind the lines but we're going to have to try another one next week without the potty language I heard the music mom listens to they rhyme all the lines I just wanted to do the same bitch runs with bitch okay break it up back it up like China rhymes with China took the rate to China just the race in China oh is too good man while I was reading to the class Hena removed his shoes and socks and began playing with something it was a dead lizard I removed the sock it smelt of dead things according to Tanner the lizard went up in the air and was alive when he was in the sandbox and he kept it there and stepped on it by accident Oh No so we found the lizard in the sandbox he's like oh where should I hide this I don't have any pockets let me put it in my shoe and that poor lizard stayed there until he stepped on it and squished it and that was dead I removed the sock it smelled of dead things that's all gross this girl did not like her lunch and then the teacher had to write this home Gabi did not like the brie cheese as soon as she opened it she started crying saying it smelled she did eat the rest of her lunch though way to snitch on her Stephanie that's funny I didn't I didn't know teachers like report things like this to parents like I don't think my teachers ever contacted my parents someone I got in trouble with that's another story although this is not a behavioral letter as such I am writing to inform you of something that has come to our attention something has been brought to my attention that's when you know you in trouble Johnny and a few of his friends often make up characters give them amusing names and then they have play times however it is come to our attention that one of the characters has a name willed oh the dildo and this has I am sure you can understand raised some concerns with us on further discussion none of the children said they knew what it meant but they are aware that is an inappropriate word to be using one of the children said they picked up the word on the playground so we're following this up further and dealing with it accordingly I hope you can appreciate the reason I am informing you of this matter what it's um finish your vegetables and then I'll tell you the damn kid will never finish his veggies it's a bad word okay don't ever say it again I don't know I think that's what I would tell my kids I wouldn't explain it to them this is the best one yet so those drill got in trouble for calling somebody a Hanzo main another student took her pencil and she referred to him as a Hanzo main I have no idea what this means however it was clearly meant as an insult I feel this

today we're gonna be doing some exposing it's been a while since I've done one of these exposing homeless videos but we are back at it again ever since I started doing these videos that's made me like more cautious cuz I would always give money to homeless people and then I started paying attention like okay this person has been working this corner for several months now and when you go up for them a job they're like no I'm good I'm not expert or anything but I'm pretty sure that make it a little more than minimum wage that's why they keep doing it that's why they keep working that corner so this youtuber ran into a homeless guy in 2013 this was in Vegas and in 2014 he ran into the same guy and he was still homeless you know what let me help you out with some money man you know what I don't have any money but I could do a better one man how about I take you to a hotel room and get you to shave take a shower for a few nights I'll pay for you man cool my idea of Vegas this is fun to me because I'm making so much money doing this this is how you know they ain't legit they don't want anything but money you offer them a hotel room if he was really homeless it'd be like Christmas for him right now but also I mean it's kind of creepy when the dude is getting this close to you and it's like hey I got a hotel room for you that's the only other reason I could think of like not man I'm not like that but he's saying it's like Vegas to him like he's making hella money off this doing nothing but sitting some people like that hey what do you mean you mean you're faking it so he's like I'm cool man I don't need a hotel room if you got cash that'd be great though like they only want cash they don't want any other kind of help that means they're not really homeless this next clip is when he met him in 2013 so a year before what you just saw he ran into the same guy he's gonna rob a bank with me it's a recession out here admit I have a house I'm not really homeless I just do this for fun yeah I do this for fun cuz everybody's giving me free money all I have to do is stand around look pathetic it's working or no homeless I mean at least dishonest to this guy what I wanted to say is if you want to help somebody homeless offer them food offer them water you can donate to a shelter and that way you know the money is being used for food the point of these videos is to help you differentiate between fake homeless and real homeless I'm not saying all homeless are fake homeless but a good chunk of them are I've seen the same people in the same spot working that corner for months you would have thought by now oh they have enough money this should be good they should be able to get back on their feet in a few months but nope they find it more profitable than having an actual job and that's why they keep doing it next up we have a homeless woman so here's the lady that everybody keeps giving their money to it you see her and here she comes [Laughter] whoa I didn't know you could use that as a defense mechanism I am Spanish and Hungarian don't fuck with me what is she so mad about she looks hella cozy and bundled up my nice brand-new North Face jacket she's just way too nicely to be homeless well you didn't you just shake your envelope at me they have plenty of money well lady you better get away from me you're a crazy white bitch is what you want really yeah really [Applause] [Music] damn the little chihuahua got a lot of bark I've never seen a homeless person so aggressive you know you're making it so much worse for yourself like you know she's recording a video and you're gonna give her that footage she wants and here she comes you don't have your picture on my phone just shake your envelope at me your money I don't know about you guys but that envelope looks things and by thick I mean like hella cash in there she doesn't even look homeless to me you see this person walking down the street they got a brand new down jacket gloves a scarf glasses what you looking like you better go to Target not ask for money I mean you see a person like this asking for money don't you look and be like damn they got a nicer jacket than me why would I give her money but she's just Halle rude to this woman actually went to jail for throwing bottles at a car this one is a story from the news in fact usually what's on the sign is a far cry from the truth just to get money to support either their style of living or their drug or alcohol habit so they've been following these two girls for a few months now they know all about their lives they're gonna go pretend to be homeless and then they're gonna go back home to their nice house from a distance her friend looks on as Megan whips out the cardboard it's hard that's what people don't understand is it's hard to eat it's hard to have a place to stay and it's hard to you know keep shit this girl still lives with her parents too lazy to get a real job so she does this instead because everybody is gonna feel hella bad for a little girl and she's gonna make a lot more money doing this than working at McDonald's clothes and without uttering a word convinces people to give her money and if you watch closely enough you will see her routine is a very convincing one like clockwork every 30 to 60 seconds Megan's hand goes up she rubs her head then her eyes she tops things off by revealing a look of near breakdown to move that consistently paid off time after time after time again watching her they've been recording her from a distance this whole time they know all their tricks people pull over I don't say anything to anybody I hold this sign I don't make anybody give me more that's a good answer that's how you don't get in trouble she's done her research because in some states you can't ask for money her sign says stranded and then people would be like oh poor girl she's stranded let me whip out some cash her day is far from over once that ramp is tapped out Megan gives a high sign to her friend they walk to the bus hop a ride to tracks and then take the train more than 50 blocks south her friend again will sit and walk once Megan flies her sign how much you make in a day average and picks up exactly where she left off well lately out here like accordion Arnim well according to our numbers that's a pretty low estimate one point above three bucks in just 30 minutes five dollars we watched eleven different cars hand her money the average donation I gave her a couple dollars two and a half bucks a car do the math that's more than 50 bucks an hour two hours a day could get her $500 a week which means realistically in a year I just felt sorry for a girl out there like that Megan could be pulling in more than $26,000 tax-free we've been that's more than my brother makes and he works his ass off she's done her research like she doesn't stay in the same spot like she takes a train goes to another city and does it again only her she to the house what do you think about that that is crazy I live in a trailer you see this woman she gave her a few bucks she doesn't even have a house herself she lives in a trailer and she's giving her money like I don't understand most of the people that give them money don't have much themselves it just blows my mind how you can accept money from people who don't have money themselves she should get a real job everybody else has a real job if I can have a job I'd have a job so someone gave you a hundred thirty bucks right now you would get on a bus and go to Seattle for the past six months you just haven't been able to make it's hard it's hard I mean I don't I'm not gonna say there anything and the truth is she doesn't have to all it takes is knocking on Megan's front door I'm Mike Hedrick with channel 2 are you Megan's mother I am and her family will tell you all you need to know parents are parents you're gonna snitch I don't even think her parents know about it she panhandles for money you know I thought she was but I don't know I don't know how to get her out of it she's basically lying everyone I guess by anyways that's all for today I hope you guys enjoyed this video leave a like

for watching bye guys 
hey guys what's up so my hey I don't know what's going on with my hair I haven't washed in a week I haven't brushed it in a week I haven't done anything because I keep it in a beanie for a week so it's kind of just like all over the place it looks shorter now just because it's all tangles and stuff I don't know I've been really letting myself go out here so if you guys don't know already I am in Peru first we went to Juarez which is like eight hour bus ride from Lima it was a one-hour drive that a ten-mile hike to base camp with which where we are right now I'm making a lot of videos on this because I'm on the show called ultimate edition it's on YouTube red it's available now and today I'm explaining why I'm going home I'm actually leaving base camp today I'm going back to far as it's gonna take like three day process to get back home just because it's like so far out in the middle of nowhere so basically it started I want to say a week ago Juarez is 10,000 feet above sea level and once you get to higher elevation it's kind of rough on you a lot of things happen you can get like headaches nausea there's half the amount of oxygen up here so it's really hard to breathe I know it's like weird thinking about it what there's places on earth that's like happy about of the oxygen like you can't breathe like before this trip they told us that I was like that seems really weird but this is like hit me hard it's hit me really bad there is a chance that I might die from this just because of what's going on and I'll explain all that in a second that's why I have to be like rushed out today Juarez is 10,000 feet above sea level that took me a while to get used to and I went from sea level to 10,000 feet above sea level and one day so you could imagine like my body was it was shook the other day we hiked up to 15,000 500 feet above sea level so I mean we're at 14,000 right now but ever since I caved out from that hike I couldn't do it like that's how I got eliminated on the show I just I couldn't do it anymore that was just my limit first of all I was carrying a really heavy backpack which was half my weight and if you guys don't know already like I have a really bad back ever since high school like a high school I couldn't carry a backpack like I would always have to carry something good by hand just because my back was always really weak I've always started hiking up to the mouth the other day when I got over 50,000 feet I started getting headaches again I started being nauseous I was dizzy it was really weird like the dizziness would you're like walking through the mouth and you're like about to trip because you're seeing like double-triple of things and so it's so hard to explain I've never had anything like that before anytime you go up in high elevation or climbing mountains or anything you're gonna get mountain sickness most people get that wood sickness and that's just some of the symptoms to it like you're gonna have diarrhea you're gonna vomit you're gonna have nausea you're gonna have really really really bad headaches it's harder to breathe you get out of breath easily like if I go walk here like 10 feet I'll feel like I'm gonna pass out like that's how it's been almost the whole time I've been here and obviously your body can adjust it's harder for some people to adjust it's been hard for me to adjust just when I was climbing that valid the other day I just I couldn't take it anymore like I felt like I was gonna pass out like I had to take a break every like two minutes and when I came down that's what it started getting so much worse I don't know why because when you get to high elevation then you come down lower you're supposed to feel better and when I came down that's when it got really bad Oh poop out everything I ate I threw up a couple of times and I was just really nauseous dizzy and just very lightheaded like every time I go walk somewhere I was lightheaded and that night I started coughing really bad and apparently I was coughing like all night the other night and when I woke up and went to breakfast every was like was that you coughing all day I was like no I don't know I thought the next night a half's just like I was coughing in my sleep and I remember waking up a few times and I couldn't breathe like they told us about that that would happen a few times where you just wake up in the middle of the night like gasping for air like you can't breathe that's happened to me so many times since I was here and I've had like what I coughed like I've had the worst coughs most of it happens at night like what I'm sleeping or laid out it is just like I'll cough so much like uncontrollably and like sometimes I'll feel like like a gargling like uh like it's kind of like a wet cough but it's like it's so weird it's like your coffee good gargling water at the same time I talked to the doctor about it and he said that's pulmonary edema and that's like when water basically gets in your lungs and if you don't go down to lower altitude then it'll kill you so they think I have that right now I mean he checked my like heart rate and oxygenation levels so he basically put your finger inside this machine thing and said my oxygenation was really low like 70 something but that means it's like really hard for you to breathe here by heart rate by the drastic heart rate has been over like 130 140 this whole time so it's like really bad I mean I'm kind of bummed that I have to leave today I mean I don't want to die because the little under why do you think serious to happen and that's why I kinda had to come down from the mountains the other day I didn't want any permanent damage happen to my back or anything I couldn't take any more and so basically as you go down about it if you go lower elevation the fluid from your lungs like it goes away that's why they decided to take me down I mean I guess that's it this is like it's funny like the one time I go outside so what time I go camping it's like I'm gonna die I'm not even kidding it's like it's really a fatal thing oh my nose is so stuffy so I don't know it's our cuz we right now maybe I'll have to go to a doctor when I go home and see or maybe I'm not going to the doctor I hate doctors I'm so terrified of doctors so hopefully when I just get to a lower elevation I'll be fine but yeah I hope you

hi sup guys its update today so that means another so Tabasco for you guys asked me questions that I used to them in this video every single Sunday every single Sunday every single Sunday every single every single every single Sunday with me we haven't done one of these in a while huh she may not look it but she's very excited to be here if I sound weird I have a really bad cold I'm tried so hard to do this video I'm gonna stay on my lap look she's just so like a human okay let's get started hey Lia what are your thoughts on the boxing trend with youtubers this year growing up I've been in my fair share of fights I haven't been in a fight in a while would you fight mommy some people knock a bitch out me too if I have to so I actually didn't watch the chaos I fight but if there are other youtuber fights I've probably watched them is there anybody that I would fight I don't know probably are you going to play some games with sausage you are the best I love you I love you too a student gathered a playing overwatch with sausage men streaming a lot of overwatch lately I've been streaming on live Mia come hang out I stream a couple of times a week so click the link in the description below follow me on live me and turn on notifications so you catch my streams what is you and sausages favorite pastime or thing to do besides gaming I mean besides gaming we like doing lots of finding new places to eat yeah yeah for real though we really really really enjoy eating will you ever do a twin video with some other youtuber I think that'd be so cool to have a twin one of my friends that lives in LA we get comments all the time asking you for twins or sisters or whatever and we want to do a twin video I don't know what we should do so comment below let me know if I had a twin what would we do keep it family-friendly please will you ever have kids kids as in like actual babies I don't know probably not but you know when you get older you start to like want kids like you crave it like you crave pizza and I don't know that hasn't happened to me yet because I definitely don't want kids and ever since I saw a lumpy have a kid has just made me never forever want to have a kid let me tell you a little bit about what happened with lumpy so she was pregnant and she was having a puppy she only had one puppy we took her to the vet the baby was kind of stuck in her and by the time they pulled it out the baby didn't make it but I'm sorry lumpy but there's no puppy so that was really sad but I'm glad Lumpy's okay don't I mean that's why I just want a lumpy to be okay she's fine now she's great actually are you accident she's excellent but yeah that whole experience of seeing something being born it's just not something I want to do but puppies on the other hand I do have that puppy fever I don't want to get another one would you like that I got another doggy or no I think she would be very upset because she does not like other doggies caz would love it you know it's really weird about calves he loves humping puppies cuz they got that soft puppy coat like they're extra soft when they're puppy and he loves humping soft things no shame but is your opinion on okay let's talk about this person since a lot of people ask me about her does she copy me and a lot of people think she is me fYI this girl came up to me at an event and told me that I was her biggest inspiration and that's really cool and I could totally see it like she would do omegle videos gaming videos vlogs just like me and then I start uploading reacting videos and then a few months later she starts doing the same every reaction channel ends up doing similar content thumbnails we all have our original unique style that makes us all different she tried calling me out on Twitter saying I copied her thumbnail I didn't I made my own the same way I've been making them long before her if you go to my videos and scroll all the way down ten months ago I started doing like funny text videos and I started doing this style of thumbnail ten months ago too and I made up this type of thumbnail here's one from nine months ago this type of thumbnail just became my thing my style like my subscribers would know that they're my videos because of my style if you go to her Channel and scroll you'll see that her first texting video was eight months ago and then seven months ago she started using the same kind of thumbnail that I was making the same thumbnail style that she's copied for me I mean you don't see me starting drama with people who copied my thumbnail or even took original pictures that I made myself and using them as their thumbnail I mean everybody ends up doing the same content in the reacting community she of all people should not be complaining about copying about how much money do you have by the way you're an amazing youtuber thank you so much and let's see I have one two three four five six seven eight eight dollars right here that's all my adsense money this month time to go buy a Lambo Nick asked if you had a ten minutes to live how would you spend them Oh God ten minutes to live I have no idea I'll probably go to the nearest Krispy Kreme and have Krispy Kremes you don't have to a blast time cuz I absolutely act so I can't eat gluten I would just eat all the gluten food that I can before I die one last time so I'm already dying I might as well like Krispy Kreme is my favorite before I found out I have sylia so then I couldn't eat them anymore and that's why I grew up to be such an angry person Michelle asked how supportive are you with sausages weight-loss journey I don't know let's ask him maybe how it's supportive am I of your weight loss journey very I'm a very supportive very healthy food but sometimes you you attempt me with the bad baby we catch again rice every day but you've been very helpful thank you you always wants to go get pizza popcorns that's bad you can't do that baby yeah so I've been cooking like almost every single day and he has been losing weight it's just what we go out to eat is a problem because we eat a lot but yeah we've been doing good with staying home eating at home and cooking and yeah his weight-loss journey is doing good my weight-loss journey though more like a weight gain journey see that's the problem I'm always trying to gain weight and eat more and he's trying to lose weight so it's like hard Misha how's your breathing gotten better since your trip to Peru okay hold up hold up hold up hold up a lot of people somehow think I am still in Peru the whole show Ultima exposition all those vlogs were recorded in August like months ago I am home now I've been home for months but now I think I'm pretty good I mean besides this cold I don't know I never get sick I'm now I am sick and it just sucks have you ever suffered through depression for the past two years I have suffered I don't want to say suffered suffered through depression but that's exactly what it is I don't know what other way to put it but I know a lot of you guys can relate all I can say is it does get better it's not like miserable your whole damn life oh my god well how could I say this without sounding like hella cliche but like that is a light at the end of the tunnel you will be super happy one day so just push through it keep going you got this believe in me who believes in you but there's no other way to say I know it sounded so like cringe but that's it's true there's no other way to say it Caffrey asked do you eat gutters individually or all at once when they're stuck together okay who leaves them all at once what kind of monster just takes that whole ball of gushers and just puts it in their mouth are you kidding me right now I'm gonna bite off one by one and this makes it easier cuz I could just take them out of the pack like that and just they're like grapes that's the weirdest inappropriate thing you've been caught doing maybe like pulling out a wedgie but like sometimes the wedgie is so damn bad I cannot handle it anymore and I will just like stick my finger up there and then just well through my pants obviously but is like I will pull out my wedgie in public it was bothering me that bad like even when I'm walking I'll just hope nobody saw it but even if they did see it it's like so what I'm just pulling out a wedgie what would you say to someone who wants to be a youtuber definitely don't become a youtuber for the money I know everybody says that but it's so true and I've seen so many people start doing YouTube just because they want to make money you really fast and it doesn't work like that it could take months even years like like make money that you can live on you know don't do it for the wrong reasons do it because you actually enjoy making videos and want people to enjoy those videos does it ever bother you when people ask why you're dating sausage I always see comments under videos by the way I love you so much I love you too the comments that bother me are wow she's dating exhausted she's so ugly that means she would date me no okay first of all I like how sausage looks no I would not date somebody because they think they're better looking than sausage like those are the comments that annoy me because obviously everybody likes something different I like how sausage look I know this is like super specific I've only like like anime and video game guys and there was a correlation within like every single guy I like this is me being really shallow for a second I like guys with big shoulders big legs they have to be long dark hair is a must big everything okay I like big they've gotta be a pinch of evil really just a pinch oh and a beard I don't even like sausage no he doesn't have a beard Claire asked what does your saved on and still look like Oh No hell no I'm not showing you what my save looks like actually since sausage has logged into my Instagram he saw my save the other day I had to like unsaved everything which is really embarrassing it's kind of like your history except you saved pics that you really like and it's just like yeah I have a dog pic saved it looks like lumpy I really like looking at dogs that look like my dogs why do you drink a lot of tea it's not good for your body what the hell tea is really good for you if you guys follow me on instagram push by the way if you don't follow me you better follow me right now I drink a lot of teas and I get boba a lot almost every single day but the difference is I get all of my drinks unsweetened or 10% sweet but usually these drinks are super super sugary and will give you diabetes which by the way runs in my family so I need a chill with the sugar but like I don't drink sugary drinks I drink them unsweetened or just with a little bit of sweetener so they are not bad for you at all are you a morning person or a night person I absolutely hate mornings I am the most miserable grumpiest person in the morning I'm definitely a night person I can't get anything done until it turns dark why don't you upload gaming anymore correction I just don't upload gaming as much anymore that's because I've been streaming all my gaming now I really want to see you playing racing games my whole life I've been awful at racing games I've just never been good at them do you like to play for tonight or not and yes I happens to

this is hopefully it's not what I think it is it looks like Pope from Dell and Ray to Crystal I'm breaking up with you PS happy anniversary though one month it's really hard to do this you told me these little kids one-month anniversary I'm surprised they even made it to the one-month mark and it's like happy anniversary but I'm breaking up with you this is why you should not date people in third grade from wishing you a happy Valentine's Day PS I hate you and get out of my life so if you find these Valentine's cards that you give to everybody in your and Jonah's over here he even put a mad face on his name you see the end in Jonas he's as a damn frowny face if that doesn't say I hate you then I don't know what does when I was a kid and we handed out Valentine's cards in class I always got the cards that you could put a lollipop or a piece of candy on I took my Valentine's Day very seriously and the people I didn't like I didn't give them a lollipop in theirs we got a badass over here Oh mommy I love you sometimes sometimes you you want mommy to love you sometimes I love you with all my but I would say my heart but my butt is bigger oh my god she don't think I just start saying that I love you with all my but it's my bus bigger than my heart is it everybody's butt bigger than their heart we should start saying that dear soldier my name is Donovan I wanted to give you a happy Valentine's card because you'll probably never get to see your family again so I want to let you know that I care sincerely Donovan what the Donovan I got your card I'm good you care but you have no helping me happy Valentine's Day sweaty I see this all over social media when people try to say sweetie and then they end up saying sweaty girls are white and vampires are dead Valentine's would be better if it was Halloween instead these kids with these damn rhymes I can't I like Halloween better - math dear Mom and Dad I love you so much I loved the dinner you made in January 28th 2004 love Jackson yeah what year is it now it's like I remember that dinner you made it 2004 like the same day probably I wrote it in his damn diary mom's meat bomb casserole is the best damn thing I've ever had in my life I'm a document this moment that every single Valentine's Day I'm gonna remind her of the one time she made me dinner that was really good I want you to know that you have a fat heart and then the heart is like it's love and then the other heart is like you eat too much junk food this kid gave this card to his mom ma did you eat too much junk food your heart is like really fat I know you love me but it's like fat and you're getting fat and just a subtle way of me telling you that you're getting fat oh the six-year-old girl gave her dad a card that said i'm sorry i'm so rubbish oh this seems like the most half-assed card i mean it doesn't have any color or anything how are you gonna be a six year old girl and give somebody a card where are the hot pink Crayola I want to see red and pink what is this black and white not gray and white I'm sorry but you're rubbish for not using any colour in your dad's Valentine's card Cody's teacher has relationship problems and complains about it to our class and then Cody is like this is a love potion share it with your husband Cody is so sweet oh my god like like this kid is gonna make like this really cute baggie of like all of these all these hearts sprinkles and marshmallows it's like all the things that love is made of man sugar who knew love was made of the same stuff with diabetes happy Valentine's Day mr.

"Do hippos eat people?" "Do hippos bite humans?" No they're vegetarians But they will crush you between the giant jaws??? *Gasp* They could cut crocodile in half and a single bite. It's very aggressive. Maybe it's because it's vegan it's like hey Stupid human. Well. Why don't you go vegan? Be like me! They aggressively forced their vegan lifestyle. Eat grass, or I eat you! Stupid human. They're so ugly. They look like ugly dogs. Everyone told Steve selling this car for a bike was a bad idea He's probably laughing at them in the summer, but who's laughing now?

Oh... wait no They're not washing their hands, no If this was a girls bathroom It would be washing their hands But it's a boys bathroom and boys do something else. That dude in that stall Grasping that toilet paper for dear life like come back here. I'm not done with you yet.. Toilet paper is like no! I just wanted to blow noses. The life of a toilet paper is kind of shitty. *She chuckles at her on joke* They should make a movie like the emoji movie, but with toilet paper and the toilet paper is like No, I was meant for something else I was meant for something greater than this. I shouldn't be wiping human sh*t And then the toilet paper rolls out of the bathroom goes on an adventure And then at the end of the movie it realizes. "Wait. I was the happiest... In the bathroom stall wiping people's sh*t. Oh, oh. No, no no no no no no! I can actually see it coming down onto her face What did this poor woman do to deserve this? Wait! It's the middle of June? Why is it raining? Are there dogs that actually do this? He ain't got no respect for humans! He's like nah you m*ther f*ckers took my puppies away from me. You sold them!

this looks like you I was sick of the purple what do you think about my new hair coming below since the black hair is a throwback we're gonna do a throwback video today basically stuff that was cool in middle school that isn't cool now my middle school I know a lot of you guys are much younger than me maybe some of you guys are in middle school now I want you to know what it was like when I was in middle school like over ten years ago bro it's been over ten years there's a long time but today is gonna be a blast from the past let me know if you remember any of these this is not a shower in a camp or is it cuz I'm not gonna lie it smells pretty good like sometimes I can't even tell the difference between acts I'm like a good smelling cologne however I do prefer Old Spice this is what a man should smell like sometimes when I'm lonely I'll take Old Spice spray and spray my pillow and sleep with it I just told you but yeah there was a lot of guys that did this honestly that would not shower but instead spray themselves with Axe ray or some cheap body spray I mean when they walk past you you feel like you're suffocated like I can't breathe and not the good kind whoa now but if you don't shower and you spray it to cover up when someone gets close dude they're gonna smell all the nasty smells mixed in with those smells and let me tell you that does not smell good bad smells plus good smells does not smell good okay Loki I associated all of her Facebook and I thought they were so stupid but Loki I just wish I had enough friends to do them with the foot one I've actually done that before it wasn't a group of my close friends but we kind of all just needed friends to do it so we kind of just pretended to be really good friends and took a pic like that was finally part of something in my life I always wanted to do the star what can I do it by myself [Music] okay it doesn't work I made my own spend in 25 minutes finding the perfect CD CDs were my life I used to make so many CDs of all the anime and game songs I liked I really liked all the Inuyasha songs Gundam had some good songs too this is what we did before Spotify you guys have is so easy now all you gotta do hook up your phone get Spotify this is not a paid advertisement so I'm gonna stop it right there and tell you that Spotify doesn't have everything especially anime and game music guys so very much like I like listening to boss battle themes in my car okay sometimes when I go through the Starbucks drive-thru I gotta turn down the destiny axis theme but yeah this much CDs and I didn't haven't been a find your like that but I had him just like all stacked up and there's like a little compartment that I would put them all in but a lot of them got damaged and they don't work anymore so actually looking for the CDs yesterday because my car right now has a CD changer where you could put like eight CDs in it and I want to put CDs in it it's like fill me up that's what she said having a wardrobe full of these brands so I used to think Hollister and Abercrombie were preppy and I didn't like them I was like no I would rather slit my wrists then wear Hollister Abercrombie and then in the end of high school I went to the store and I really really liked it and then all of my clothes look like that I actually worked there I was like a first job I got was working at Hollister I was a model before Instagram I had this one Hollister shirt that said yes the twins are a handful do you get it but before I bought the shirt I was like yes they are quite a headful I didn't want to like buy and be like well they're not really a whole handful so like have to check before I bought it I didn't want to clickbait anybody with my shirt literally just drawing all over yourself and your friends okay I did this I don't know why kids do this like me I want a tattoo so bad once I turn 18 I'm gonna get a tattoo of this it has a meaning Green Day I remember liking Green Day and dry it all over your shoes I didn't have chucks or shoes you could draw on so I drew on other people's shoes I'm sure you could all guess what I Juran everything I told you had a meaning it's my answer to all questions adding as many X's as you possibly could to a screen name or email this is me and everybody I knew not even kidding I had a xxxx Dark Angel 69 this is so weird no no no wasn't angel it was goddess like yeah me goddess like lowercase X X yeah me goddess 69 xx and before people start googling hey let me google it ah nothing that's because it was my email is your email still the pimp is re at the pimp mail.com i remember when i first learned the word pimp when I used to watch Flavor Flav and it's like everybody at school wanted to be a pimp and call people pimps and it was what you wanted to be okay my dad hates sausage because he thinks he's a pimp and he pimps me out on the Internet be quiet my son turns it up recording Santa's retard I did this I can only imagine how loud her xuxa's are think you got those big ol lips when she said shush it's like when she says shush other people tell her to shush there's definitely some spit coming out when she shushes you when I was in middle school I used to shoot up hair led like a mechanical pencil he's just this this gif is so it's so satisfying making the lead long and I love how that feels remember how badly you wanted one of these I can't tell you a truer story because when the razor came out it was revolutionary it's like when the iPhone came out or when a new iPhone comes out every year like I didn't have a phone and the razor came out and a bunch of people in my class had it I don't like oh my bears they get me one and they got me a prepaid virgin mobile phone oh they got me this thing this thing right here this is exactly what I had this is my first phone and I got it in middle school but it was also around the time that the razor came out but they got me that instead and I couldn't do anything but call them like on emergencies and you know damn well they ain't gonna be no emergency so like I mean you're not texting on it you had to pay for text back then yeah iMessage now but before you had to pay for each text or you have like a texting but my parents didn't want to pay for that we got 10 year olds with iPhone X's now oh oh texting was an easier name hi today I'm going to come to you no sorry I was like the first conversation at lick came up to mind yeah you need to s you better click that seven four times see this is how it worked you see the letters by the number you had to click the seven four times to get an S and then that's not it if you want to be like send nudes you have to work for it you know I'm not even kidding sausage had one of these phones when we first started dating overdramatic PDA displays okay I might have done this but not to like I'm my boyfriend or anything cuz none of the boys liked me but like to stare at a guy that I thought was cute I can't wait to my classes over second stare at him from a distance this is what I did I would just stare stare at all the boys that never liked me back till after high school then all of them try to hit me up and send me nudes and stuff boy was in high school I wanted a boyfriend so bad fill in your iPod Nano with perfect songs oh come clean the Hilary Duff I like this song though low-key though low-key I would never tell anybody because I was all about that metal life believe it or not I never had an iPod nano I had an off-brand one that I got from eBay for like $30 I mean it's basically the same thing but it's like hella cheap and then in high school I finally got an actual iPod and somebody stole it from me after like a week of having it I was so sad I cried so much it was like $150 and they just stole it from me wearing these bracelets okay we used to call these candy and all like the raver kids or like wannabe raver kids would wear these and they were like a ton of them and they're like oh how about that poor lifestyle I was never into this I don't know I just never liked bracelets calculator insults Hey look this is you I didn't say the calculator has spoken your mom's pretty pretty loose show me show me or eight zero zero eight five this was fun this is why I couldn't pay attention in math some girl brought her boyfriend a nope when we get married I'll wear a black dress and MC I will play at my wedding and we'll mosh and then I judge my boobs okay then would you like it face down then good luck getting MC are your wedding I'm just waiting for them to go on tour quoting Napoleon Dynamite and every conversation whenever I feel like I wanna do gosh oh so mm we I did this something really nasty I did in high school was they gave us tater tots and I put them in my friends pocket and then I kicked her during class I was like give me some tots and then she actually gave me a talk and I was like I don't want this been in your pocket who knows what else has been in there having your entire sexual life consists of this yeah but imagine it but way hairier oh that's pretty gross I've never done this I've done that and a lot of boys have done that this dude asked me to go like this and then I went like this and there's a cosplay is not consent drawing this everywhere yeah pretty much it was just so satisfying to connect all of it and just make a perfect s oh so good spending hours customizing your myspace even though no one gave a shit excuse me I care for all you youngsters out there before Facebook there was myspace it's kind of like Facebook except you had your top friends on your page and this caused a lot of problems like I had nobody that was my top friend like everybody else had somebody else as their top friend so I couldn't put anybody as my top friend so I literally had my favorite band as my top friend if somebody has you as their second top best friend then you put them as your second top best friend like if you're my top friend and I'm not your top friend it just looks bad ah not having Internet everywhere you went that's right there was no Wi-Fi remember in 2006 when you accidentally hit the internet button on your flip phone and you had to press end 40 times to keep your parents from paying for such a luxury oh yes yes yes yes yes there was an Internet button on your phone but it was like super slow and like prehistoric like there was LTE but it was super expensive and nobody used it and it was really slow and I said a couple of times by anyway that's all for today I hope you guys enjoyed this video come up below let

outside and just a tank top and a diaper and make her run around the neighborhood and like thirty to fifty neighbors holy shit that's a lot of neighbors who got thirty to fifty neighbors and so they all came outside started watching a run back and forth in a diaper crying hysterically and then eventually the cops are called and guess what her parents were arrested and as they were getting arrested they started laughing like why are you arresting me it's my daughter she she has a pee-pee problem and she tried to run away so they ended up going to jail for a year I mean where's the poor

that's a little too rude you really think your parents aren't gonna see that you pull anything on Facebook your family will see it that's why we have Twitter and snapchat now the parents are too old to use that shit one two three four five six oh yeah you made about your mom yeah I mean like one bullet is enough you don't have to like DoubleTap like is the damn zombie isn't gonna come back up and start talking shit about you next up we got a mama that shaved her kid's head for making fun of somebody with cancer and her mom took her damn head okay I mean that's kind of good cuz bullying is wrong [Applause] [Music] [Music] Wow I don't I don't know what to say I honestly don't know what to say about this like I feel like she went a little too far I know bullying is bad and making fun to somebody with cancer is even more fucked up like you just don't do that but it's like you could have just like took the razor cut a little bit from the back of her head like I'll show you what it feels like that kind of old - she looks like 1415 although there is an earlier version of this video from more than a year ago and it said that this young woman was being punished for uploading nude photos online so who knows regardless of the wreaths in so it's not bullying cuz I feel like a parent would not do that for bullying but for uploading nude pics online oh let me shave that hair off you want to be a huh you could do it fall just like ever oh this is by far the absolute worst thing ever these parents paid forty thousand dollars to get their daughter kidnapped so she will smoke away too much weed she was sleeping with lots of guys she was disrespectful so they decided hey let me put some respect on that and they sent her to a behavior modification camp in Jamaica where she spent a year away from them the camp was surrounded by barbed wire security cameras and inmates had to wear flip-flops which made it hard for them to escape so she got taught a lesson she did I would two of me I hope you a brand new change purse of them that that was scar you for life for a year like a whole year oh yeah don't worry it's just a prank bro you won't be disrespectful to me to me this is what I'm gonna do to you this is like the ultimate trol this is a life-changing I a troll that lasted a whole damn year this blows my mind man it just blows my mind like so this mom found out that her young daughter was going to older guys houses oh so she sold her One Direction tickets first of all I feel like one direction yeah I'm sure like 10 would be 12 years old what are you doing older guys houses and still going to One Direction concerts something doesn't make sense here so she took all the One Direction tickets she bought for her and her friends and she sold them to put them on eBay and here it says people bid twenty four thousand mama made a nice profit - Oh that'll teach you to stop pulling around I feel like most of these punishments or to teach their kids to stop pulling around so apparently this is the thing you have a little kid that starts acting up put them in the damn cage they can't do anything look at all of this that's like a concentration camp in the comfort of your home like like seriously you want to have the extra good time put in the dog damn so this is this is a thing look at all these poor kids they probably think it's cool for like the first few minutes like yeah yeah good to be like Cooper over here another like with mom mom mom dad please I put put in my diaper by anyways that's all for today I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did

Brown i really need help on the homework tonight. What  teacher thinks i mean Mr. Brown, Can you help, me with, my homework tonight and by homework i mean~ I just want to pass my class okay, do you know Your biology grade yet, no but i nailed the teacher it better be an a or i'll be pissed OMG are you sleeping with him for a grade, oh, my, god that is nasty!

Take, miss harris, you're the reason, you're the reason for this you brought this upon yourself, miss harris now help Me with this damn homework Oh, that sounds interesting i taught them about wind and solar and natural gas and geothermal and what i do to convert dirty girls into clean ones. I wish you came, by my, 8th grade class OMG autocorrect! Fuels not girls Convert dirty fuels into clean ones. I never learned that in biology. Biology was on my favorite classes We had a really, awkward, young teacher and we were learning about sex ed and she asked, do you guys have Any, questions for the class nobody Had any questions except one guy, he raised his hand and she was like yes what's the ph of a Vagina. [laughing] i Hate my teacher. school just started how Could you possibly hate a teacher already. he said, he would never give us a test, when he walked Through, the, door, so that's awesome you, don't have to take, any tests that's What i thought but the next thing i know the smartass is coming into the classroom through the window Waving the test in our faces. OH I see what you did there you got owned by an old man that sucks bro XD. The smart that's real smart No, test today! hold up let me hop, through this window Real quick, hey i need, your help, which one is the answer of the 5.2. On the biology quiz? Valerie, this is mrs. Ussher.. your biology teacher..? This is not how it looks like, no problem the answer is c Thanks? you're, welcome now you owe me 10 bucks What this is robbery that's one answer on a quiz it ain't even a test? You know, man i'm a Teacher, we don't get paid much i get it actually this is a really good way to make a money [laughing] Really, good way to get fired real quick to like, imagine all the money you can Make, imagine if you could buy yourself a good grade, oh? Hell, yeah, well the rich kids, would just have perfect Days i always thought that was how it worked because this one rich kid in my elementary school her mom was always Donating money to the school and always volunteering and of course she had like straight a's for being such a moron i didn't like her i didn't know What the, makeup brand maybelline was and she gave me so much shit like, [gasp] are you stupid You, don't know, what maybelline, is i'm like, bitch i never wore makeup in my, life, how am i supposed to know This, was like in sixth grade what kind of sixth grader wears makeup, okay, everybody now Hey, what was the homework for tonight? Oh hi Jess it's peach 13 in the workbook. Oh My, god Jason, that hot student of mine, jess just texted me [groan] i wanna Kiss her so badly [spooky music] Um.. This is still Jess.. Three hundred dollars if you won't tell. 400 and you can, kiss me [cha-ching noise] No, [laughing] This is so awkward. I mean let's be real here if you're texting the teacher "what Was the homework tonight" instead of your friend you got a thing for the teacher i'm sorry but if you're Gonna text him you got a thing and you should just wanna start up a conversation. Hey Mr. R, i already read Huck Fin over the summer do i have to read it again? Any book, worth reading once is worth reading again. Even twilight? I said it had to be worth reading once Hey, why is everybody, gonna come at twilight like it's a bad book I've been i've been possessed, by stephenie meyer stephenie meyer please please please stop it stop it please don't ever say Twilight is a good book Because she will take the contact out of your eye, and twist, it i'm probably gonna go blind tomorrow, so the teachers took Hannah's phone and then her friend texted her phone. Hannah the teacher has your phone! emily i want your phone as Well bring it to the front of the class. Honestly how Stupid Don't text in class, okay? Especially not a phone that the teacher already has. I think Hannah knows her phone is missing if the teacher took it yeah honestly How stupid. Hey, dad come pick, me up i'm suspended. What did you do this time? -.- Nothing, my teacher, asked, me a simple question and i gave a. Simple answer What did she, ask, and what you say and you're grounded.. She said i had five bottles in one hand and six bottles in the other What do i have i said a drinking problem. Your ungrounded for learning my smartass talent Why, would you get suspended from that it's true. Did you just assume i have a drinking problem? 2017 you're the sensitive people hey school was awesome today a lot of laughs! =) Hey, what happened? Well my mate was hitting her calculator on the edge of the desk because it wasn't working. Soo Then the teacher shouted at her, "holly how would you like it if i banged you on the table?!" Yes mr. Brown i would like that Hey, that's pretty good that would be awesome wouldn't need to be like put on a disk or usb or could it just be emailed Through, can't email that format, way too big. Oh Good shall i send you a dick or a, usb to put it on. send me a what? How, about how, about you don't send me anything at all because i.. [inhale] No, this is illegal this is very frowned upon i meant disc your teacher called, me what have you done? There's this test today and i wanted to sit in the back of the room but the teacher, wouldn't let Me she said not in the back. So? I said "that's what she said" and she'll yelled, "get out" and i said that's what, "she said too!" (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) You're, grounded for life, but that was good how. You gonna be grounded for life, what kind of punishment For you you didn't even do anything do people really get in trouble for this? Hey mr. Harris i just wanted to let You know that i am upset with, my last test grade can i sex it up with you
after school on monday? -Anna Anna.. This stays between you and me come later so no teacher sees us and is a B+ alright? i'm getting horny just thinking about you (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ...[Silence] Um.. Mr. Harris i meant say "make it up with you" This is really Uncomfortable, well then i'll give you an A+ if you never repeat this to anyone. Okay! Thanks mr. Harris. after she gets her a+ she posted it all over the internet wow, okay i mean that's a better deal got you A+ instead of a B+. it sounds like he's haggling a craigslist deal is A B+ all right, i'll give you a B+ for it. Hey, mom i'm in detention. What Why? in class my teacher pointed a ruler at said "at the other end of the ruler is an idiot" And? I asked him which end he was referring to. That's my girl! That's too good it's too good you shouldn't get detention for outsmarting a teacher they? People too they're, not some supreme being to just regular people to just like you and me but they Don't get paid enough to deal with your shi- sir i really need to pass tomorrow's exam or, my, parents will kill me. Oh hello Cindy :) Sir i will do anything to pass and i mean anything (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I've got a naughty idea. okay sexy what should i do for you tomorrow? (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Would you.. study.

I've been sitting here the past two hours now procrastinating on doing this video like should I do it should I not do it it's 1:00 in the morning okay so here we are dear David part two this was highly requested every single day I get a bunch of comments asking me to do a part two on this it's not gonna be a huge update but it is an update and somebody tweeted me a pic and it gave me the heebie-jeebies like this one we're not fucking around anymore dear David is a ghost and he's real there is photo and video evidence you guys don't believe me I'll leave a link to part one definitely watch that before watching this one alright so where we left off last time there's a little thing a ceiling oh that is that's pretty high he never noticed that little attic thing so it's really high above the stairs so I always figured it would be impossible to access it without some sort of fancy professional ladder I see the hatch every morning when I leave for work and think nothing of it but this time something dawned on me it can't lead to the roof because it's actually below the roof and he's trying to get in here here's the old apartment here's a new apartment which is above it there's the empty space the roof access the roof where he thought he saw David so he can't really go up there nobody can go up there but he's thought David there but David is a ghost I'm buying ghosts logic they could do whatever the fuck they want mm-hmm I think maybe the hatch leads to a short ladder going through the roof but even if that's the case the hatch is level with all the ceilings in my apartment that means there's three feet of empty space all over my apartment oh damn that's a lot so he's got three feet of attic above his apartment who knows was living in that three feet of Attic so that's a lot of attic over the past week and a half I've been hearing more things above me a few a few days after the first sound I heard a similar thump I was in the kitchen then last night I heard something small cling to the floor and roll about six feet before stopping so we left off here he bought a pole off Amazon so he can investigate and see what's up there a lot has happened in the last week but I was away for Thanksgiving so I'm just now able to write it down the noises from the ceiling haven't let up but the pole I ordered didn't arrive before I had to leave for the holidays so I didn't get it until late Friday night I plan to investigate the next morning and went to bed I'd barely fallen asleep when I woke up to an incredibly loud crash above me it sounded like someone had dropped a bowling ball sounds like dear David jumping some bombs drop the deuces stir about a minute I heard another crash I briefly thought about grabbing my shoes and booking it but that would mean passing under the hatch and that seemed like a bad idea so instead I just listened and waited though I'm not sure for what yeah why didn't you record this why aren't you documenting everything here like all these random loud sounds I mean you live in an apartment there's always random loud sounds could be anything the crash happened again and then again probably 15 times in a row followed by a long silence then I heard a smaller creaky sound from the hallway in my mind I registered as a footstep but it really could have been anything so you're just hearing 15 times we need to doing just like wait where is all this coming from above you like maybe they're doing construction or something I stayed still but there were no more sounds after that I lay back down still tense and nervous but I must have fallen asleep at some point because I woke up the next morning and everything seemed normal again I got dressed and left to go get a bagel same as every Saturday so was it like a dream I'm confused as I made my way down the stairs something crunched under my feet I looked down and noticed the pile of debris and the stairs directly under the house uh you know what this means your David knocking on that attic door like bitch I live here now okay you trying to get a pole in like put my ass through my hole no no no no I'm not having that he is not having that something is going on up there it looked like dirt but I couldn't tell for certain it could have been an old plaster or something I glanced up at the hash and noticed something else peculiar the edge of something was caught in it barely poking out it's hard to see because it's so far up but I took a photo oh no something just magically is sticking out of the hatch oh okay okay okay just when you start to investigate the hatch Clues are left lying around for you okay all right let's see what this is at that point bagels were the last thing on my mind I went back upstairs and grab the pole I set my camera on the coat wardrobe at the top of the stairs and hit record just to make sure it would be caught on video so demon burst out of the hatch oh now here's the video Dan was a long pole that's what she said come on hit him harder harder you got a rule was that a damn shoe who put the easy is up here I jumped out of the way and practically fell down the stairs trying to dodge whatever it was that fell at first I thought it was a dead squirrel which would honestly explain a lot hit the steps and then bounce down to the first floor I went upstairs to get my phone and collapse the pole since it's so long and unwieldly then went back downstairs to investigate the object that fell at first I wasn't sure what it was it was dingy faded black I picked it up and realized it was a small leather shoe David why are you leaving your little shoes around still got some small ass feet I mean I know he's a kid and everything bit me if the head is big does I mean the feet are big as a shoe from the 19th century my dudes I hustled back upstairs and texted my landlord I told him I thought there was something in the crawl space and asked if he could investigate he said he'd come by later with a ladder and check it out a few hours later and my landlord was on a ladder shining a flashlight through the crawl space I stared up at him half expecting something to grab him and yank him into the darkness he angled his flashlight all around finally saying there's nothing up here but then he was like oh wait I watched as he reached up into the emptiness with his free arm and what he pulled back he had something small and round in his hand he climbed down the ladder and handed it to me calm down calm down everybody again I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at it was smooth and shiny and at first I thought it was an old piece of candy but it was cold and too heavy to be candy after a second I realized it was a marble those are some old-ass marbles like before my time it was so worn that hadn't registered as a marble at first the shape was also sort of weird with a little bump on one end oh no no come on stop with this everything got to be deformed on one end right just like David why are you coming at David like that that's why he's hiding you because everything you see you're comparing it to him like oh this little marble right here has got a dent in his head like somebody I know my landlord seemed unbothered for the most part okay dude and he told me to call him if I heard anything else I went inside and headed to my office to see if I could figure anything about this marble that somehow made its way into my ceiling I had nothing to go on and in sure I didn't really learn much but I did figure out the bump on the marble I think apparently in the early 1900's they made marbles by hand and cut them with big metal scissors which would mean the marble is probably really old yeah well that kind of marble is really old I mean during my time when we had marbles they used to be like this whenever they make these actually 1900s see I'm sure they had like these kind of marbles so they look much older than these modern marbles I used to have this exact set vintage marbles y'all make me feel old okay everything I grew up playing with is now vintage anyway now I have a decrepit old shoe and a marble sitting on my dresser I guess this is the new normal I mean you could have threw them out but you're gonna keep them there you're gonna keep David's belongings in your house of course she's gonna think it's okay to come back and forth between his sealing house and outside of your window and into that chair so this is a newer update sorry for the long break I haven't been feeling great the past few couple weeks and I haven't had time enough there also wasn't much to say for the most part I wasn't sleeping well I was having weird dreams but they were vague and hard to describe I'm sleepy all day long and I've been getting sudden bouts of dizziness I chalked it up to always having earbuds Crandon and made a mental note to get my ears checked other than that things were pretty quiet I sort of fooled myself into thinking that finding those items in the attic somehow ended all of this not that that wouldn't make much sense but the last week something started to have late on Wednesday I woke up with a start and felt something strange like something had been watching me I turned on the light but I was alone still there was this tangible feeling of badassness everything felt wrong sort of like when you have the flu and you wake up at night and you can't really tell where you are for a minute oh I hate that that's so scary it's like you wake up and you're like wait am I still in a dream is this real life Brian I it was a feeling I'm used to it always accompanies David people tweet me a lot saying he just might need help but I'm certain that's not the case every time he shows up I feel a palpable sense of malice there's what I felt that night malice dread but still I was alone and I was so tired I wound up just going back to sleep I've been so exhausted recently I can barely function the next night the same thing happened I woke up suddenly feeling like I had missed seeing something like a candle had just gone out and I could still smell it that's the best I love that smell when you blow out a candle and you could still smell it so good I thought about using the pet camp from my living room to monitor my bedroom while I slept but the cord was too short to get the camera high enough to see the entire room so I improvised I downloaded an app that takes a photo every 60 seconds and set my phone on top of a bookcase it's almost seven feet tall so I had a pretty good view of my bed in the surrounding room then I went to sleep do I want to know happens next there's a picture down there just like before I jolted awake hours later feeling the same unease I turned on the light and hurried out of my bed to get my phone from the bookcase there were probably 350 photos to scroll through bro no way there's nothing there there's nothing there right the vast majority of them were me sleeping in an empty room it's sort of dark but you could see me sleeping I left a couple night lights on in case anything showed up but for the first hundred or so photos is just me in an empty room I should probably get this out I wonder what goes on in my room when I'm asleep oh no I don't know no I'm done I'm done this is not real this then suddenly he was there standing on the chair at the foot of the bed staring at me no no heck way this gives me the heebie my GB fuck you no man hell no I'm not having this I'm not having this like imagine going to sleep and having this next to you the next photo from a minute later he seems to be staring straight up at the ceiling just staring it's just gonna go in your room make himself comfortable on your couch huh what a little piece of man he's like you see that up there that's where I live you don't like it I don't know I moved to another damn building I'm pretty sure he's not gonna follow you if you move to another building I'm he's got his chute there he's got his marbles there it seems like he lives there then he appears to collapse on the chair the next dozen photos are all the same he's completely lifeless at first I thought he was dead which obviously doesn't make any sense I looked over at the chair half expecting him to still be there but it was empty okay good riddens I hope he's done maybe just passed out he's like tired or something no no uh-uh ugly little dent head over here she's gonna collapse I'm gonna crash on my couch no you can't I never said you could stay here I never say you could crash here but then in the next photo he's gone the room is totally empty again he's gone in the next several photos too I figured maybe that was it but I kept swiping through the photos about 15 photos later he was back standing next to the bed it was just like the last time I saw him where is he in this he was right here he's right here that does not look real to me it does not look real to me it looks like he's like blended in with other stuff he's right here that's so creepy he's just sitting there staring at you that's not okay well like it's not I'm not your friend man that's what my heart started to race I didn't want to look at the rest of the photos but I knew I had to I swiped to the next photo on my heart sank to my stomach he was on the bed inches from me staring down at me sleeping I can't with this anymore like imagine being in this situation you take pictures of yourself while you're asleep and you get this bullshit uh-uh he is on the damn bed looking at him don't know if you did anything else the next one was worse we can't get worse in the next photo he's staying right at the camera he knows what you're doing to him you're exploiting him on Twitter and he's aware he's become aware after that there's seemingly nothing he disappears again and the rest of the scroll is just me alone in my room again that is until this last photo here is the final photo on the scroll I can't I can't do this anymore I can't do this anymore Oh bro really I'm at a loss for words that malformed ear the stringy hair I didn't even know what to think I looked all over my room but I couldn't find anything and honestly I've just been so exhausted I didn't know how to process it even now all I want to do is just go to sleep yeah same if I saw this bullshit I'd just be like yeah okay I can't do this anymore David just get out of my room man people commented it's official dear David is fake as someone who has been ghost hunting for several years I can tell you ghosts do not photograph like this nice try buddy you almost had me as Lee posted these photos it's a doll yeah well I'm here for the ride it's a good ride scariest creepy and you never really know if it's real or not but also I'm a very reasonable and

It's you.  okay future reference don't say texting the love of my life If it's not the person you're texting or do or do do it see if they like you back I mean, that's honestly a great way to find out if somebody actually likes you they're like. Hey, what you doing? I'm you're like texting my crush Take the damn hint it's me. I love you. I've been loving you this whole time I can only imagine how awkward it would be you text that to somebody and they're just enough straight-up reject you and be like I Ain't even talking about you.

Error  34256: the person doesn't want to go out with you try someone else That's one way to reject somebody poor guy, and he just fell for the error messages like oh 3 2 3 3 2 must be a legit error message. Let me just try it again Maybe she'll say yes, this time. How do I tell Chris? I like him though these things are hard. You just did Ellie oh My gosh. I am so sorry. That was to  Jenna Her name isn't even close to mine though. Did you send this to me on purpose? Don't worry if you did winky face Maybe does that mean you like you back - no? oh No, he knows all the tricks all the tricks the girls use I'm gonna Accidentally text Chris that I like him I pretend I'm talking to Jenna, but I'm actually talking to Chris he ain't gonna fall for it her name Isn't even close to mine he's gonna call you out, and then he's gonna be like no. I don't like you Oh, did I sound like you I met autocorrect. I don't like you or Chris oh whoops I texted the wrong Chris.

Li a D that was that so hard now. Tell him I just well I feel the same I Mean that's like best-case scenario, just like I mean just taking a chance going for it like that You're gonna get a boyfriend out of it wish that work for me in school while I didn't do this when I liked a boy I would just be really really really creepy around him and just like go up to him and ask him for hugs Which which by the way? That's that's why I didn't have a boyfriend. No guys like me cuz every time I would see them in the hall I'd be like Can I have a hug - (minus) the boobs? Cuz then they probably would have liked me When I was a little girl I used to watch yugi- oh and I love May Valentine's so much like I loved her outfit, and I told my mom like when I grow up I want to just like her my mom was like no you can't just like her. That's not allowed. That's not okay. I'm like You just ruined my whole life like Do is just like a cute But not it kind of do so work out yay, 11:11 make a wish Okay What'd you wish for? For you to say yes when I asked you out Really, I wish for a baby duck Slanted discontented faces, baby Duck is not a chick a chick is a baby duck right he could have just said a chick And I'm a chick so like I could be a baby duck if you want I can even dress up like one could wear super furry soft jacket and You can like hug me and be just like having a baby duck I don't know to you you want this baby duck or not hey Sharon I like Cory, but we good friends, and I don't want to ruin anything, but he's super cute Go for it trust me. I'm a doctor not really though. Why he doesn't like me. I know it. I'm not stupid He doesn't like you he Loves you he also thinks you're super beautiful. How do you know? Check who you're texting want to go out So adorable good for you Shannon. I swear girls do this a hundred percent on purpose I can't see them doing it on accident. Just like hey let me text my friend instead of my best friend I Feel like would you type out something like this you're gonna look at it? Do you wanna check the text you know look at who you sent it to you're gonna check the text again you gonna Talk it over to your friends sure I send this and make it look like I'm sending it to you But I'm actually something to get to him, and then they're gonna send it They know exactly what they're doing they're doing it on purpose Just like the other guy that called her out our names really nowhere near each other There's no way you got us confused and by the way. I don't like you, but feel like that. What happened to me That's like worst case scenario. That's like completely embarrassment I mean there's a excuse for everything we could have been like no sorry. I texted the wrong Chris Get rejected sucks, man. Yeah. I have to go hey Me too fine. Fuck you. Will you go out with me finally? I Mean that's one way to do it I mean if you're like completely sure that they like you back but most of the time it doesn't happen they don't like you back or Maybe they do you don't know you don't know until you ask and I feel like if they say no you could have just been Like wrong person so if you have a crush Ask him out do it over text you have nothing to lose I feel like the best way to ask somebody out is like I'm talking to my crush right now And then they'll be like who or they'll be like oh, I liked you too, but if they say who you'll be like hmm. I Should I don't know I like you. I want you to prove it now. Do you believe me?

But your performance in the class so no I can't Damm about glad to be done with this I'm not even gonna say hi if I see you in the halls you see not playing any games here but I mean you got your B, so I guess it's okay, so I was wondering what my teachers water-bottle said and He took a water bottle put student tears on it you see that smug bastard he's just drinking him He just teaching and drinking. I'm at the same time. Oh you think you fancy You think you fancy me to my students. You could be anything you want a doctor and engineer even president What famous person do you aspire to be like?

She was like today We're gonna be learning about orgasm the organism. We caught that Thanks to you. We know what that means now when you're in school There are rules this teachers rules are when is it okay to? Interrupt my teaching when aliens are invading if there's a tornado if the classroom is flooding you are on fire Ryan Gosling enters the classroom What about if you're thirsty this teacher has banned words? troll burn roasts finesse Boiled smoked or any deviations you think these words will earn you a one-way ticket to this iss Is Isis don't touch me finesse like damn miss B. You got the finessed I Know what kind of hope passes this to go to the bathroom? You gotta take a damn globe in case you get lost in another Country my teacher left the room during a test, so we all started sharing answers, then I looked up But she's staring right at me there. She is ended am feeling. What's up? Who goes this far? How does she get up there? They're like a secret ladder from the teachers lounge there goes like up there And then you could like spy on the students. I saw metal gear shit. You ain't snake look at her She's so smug like I thought I could trust them but no you cannot trust these kids You could not trust anybody in your life. She really went up there like girl. You sneaky as hell He does this every test so we don't she he's gonna climb the highest mountain in his room Which is like a locker something that does not look comfortable? He a dude. He's sitting on a corner No, that's not comfortable for guys Why is this girl so close to the board though doesn't the board have answers kids? She technically cheat? I think she got the best seat in the house because she could actually be on her phone or anything You just put it in your lap That's honestly the worst when a teacher is like staring at you or at the class when you're taking a test or walking around It's the worst it makes you just so nervous, and it makes you feel like you're doing something wrong Even if you aren't it's like hey, I'm just sitting here doing Biotest, but I know they're staring at me So I can't look up. I can't look around he's gonna. Call me out If I even like look at the clock like this just gave me such bad anxiety whatever the teacher did this I'm gonna take my test like this so my brother lost his recorder and the teacher still made him perform What the hell she really made him stead there I don't care if you don't have a recorder you have hands and it's like the same thing you're gonna go on that stage You gonna pretend? Like you're the best damn recorder player in this world and that's exactly what he did One time my teacher gave me an F on a paper and wrote see me after school on and I was stressing all day about It but when I went later to ask her. What was wrong with it She changed the F to an A and said you're pissing me off all this week And I wanted you to suffer for a few hours, and I did it trust her the rest of the year Teachers they have the power I don't have enough money for a lawyer to beat your ass So I'm gonna give you a s, but I'll change it back I'm good now, so like you can have your a seriously though if you're a t-shirt. Why wouldn't you troll your kids? isn't that what they do to you they do that to you so do a back my professor really bought a Motherfucking coffee in a class to say y'all test scores had me dead Wow He did not I mean he's like hella old did he like by his coffin in advanced Just so like he could pick it out do people actually do that he actually brought it to class Imagine walking into class y'all just guys had me dead Why cuz it was so good. Oh, they were so bad Did you skip class to stream and somebody told the teacher so they started watching him just? Get stitches this would be my worst nightmare, but like if I didn't show up to school. They played my YouTube videos I am dropping the class so this girl gave attitude to my teacher today girl Rolls eyes yeah keep rolling your eyes you might find a brain back there damm I'm not seeing anything But the dance ceiling do I have a brain or not? Hottest challenge of 2018 the roll your eyes challenge see if you can see your brain if you could see your brain You win if you can't then do you even have one my professor got jokes? final exam Answers did he really just send the final exam answers to everybody is this a joke Never go give you what is this a joke?

No. How are you gonna? Do everybody like that I feel like if I took a quiz like that and every answer was C come on? some of them gotta be B Can't be a cuz never a and it's never D is B or C on that anxiety kicks in like This teacher made sure that everybody brought their own pen and if they did it he gonna give you this long ass feather looking pen it writes doesn't it we know is that a feather and ink he's holding the Damn ink. I like it It's like Thomas Jefferson vibes right here high school college is no joke your instructors are very serious And you have to be professional and respectful College dr.

You're not sparkly Just flat color is that for the lipstick? How is something light bright that like contradicts itself.

just remaking my selfies all day long yeah so I don't I don't know what's the deal here I wouldn't just shut up make my account private that would make a fake Instagram page of someone in your school

Oh a surprise upside grew up and today we just arrived at where as Peru I'm gonna be teaming up with some Mountaineers to summit top Laura whoo which is one of the highest mountains in South America so make sure you join me on this amazing adventure and be sure to check out automatic edition on YouTube bread I've been preparing for this moment I've done a couple tests I failed the easiest test 92% fail this test I failed the easiest tests two years ago I did the idiot test now we're gonna put my brain to the test one last time cuz I don't go to school so I don't really use it I'm not really doing tests but you need your brain to grow and to work so you got to keep up with these tests whether you're in school or not let's get started if a peanut falls from a tree when the wind is blowing north where will it land with my experience doing these tests a lot of them try to make you look stupid oh no no not today not today if the wind is blowing north my calculations say that the peanut will end on the ground because sooner or later it will land on the ground do they have a fourth of July in England well the whole reason that there's a fourth of July is independence it's when America gains independence from Great Britain and Great Britain is now England and England is my city don't let that distract you by the fact that there is a fourth of July in England I mean there's a fifth of July there's the 6th of July there's a 7th of July so there's definitely a 4th of July in England it's just not Independence Day how many birthdays does the average man have I know I've been asked something similar to this but I did not know it was a trick question I mean do they mean birthdays like a day of birth they only have one day of birth or they could have none they could just not celebrate their birthday i'ma go in 1 some months have 31 days some have 30 how many have 28 February occasionally has 28 days but if a month has 28 days what did that mean it also has 27 days and 26 days every month that's 26 days 27 days 28 days 29 days every month except February sometimes it only has 28 but that's the lowest it goes I'm go 12c I'm learning I'm digesting this information from all the tests I've gotten wrong from all the test answers I've gotten wrong in the past I've learned cook before I would just do like this I'm gonna write toast to be safe just because this is a common-sense test I'm gonna kill myself what do you mean you don't what toast in a toaster you do put toast in a toaster you can put anything you want in a toaster what was the president's name in 1973 okay this is more of like I wasn't around in that era and I never really paid that good of attention in history class so it's gotta be one of these cuz it wasn't Obama or maybe it's a trick question what was the president's name in 1793 it's gotta be ringing do I dare pull up a little Google search no no no no I would not do I would not do that to you guys I would not do that i'ma go with Reagan and I might sound stupid but I honestly don't know like who was the president in 1935 heck if I know can a man living in the u.s. be buried in Canada okay so he's living in the US and he wants to be buried in Canada yeah like I don't see why not if you want to be buried in Canada just leave a note on your will I want to be married and kit and I want to be married I want to be buried in Canada I don't see why not sure if a red house is made of red bricks a blue house is made of blue bricks and a yellow house is made of yellow bricks what does a green house made of green brick no uh-uh there's not enough information to answer this it could be made of glass it could be made of green bricks it could be made of poop it could be made of pubic hair you don't know see I know these questions are pretty familiar I've answered similar things in the past but the whole point of this is to make sure I don't make the same stupid mistakes because it's been a while I got to keep my mind running fresh it's like exercise but for your brain silver bill has a red house blue house purple house and a green house but where is the White House the White House is in DC but also there is not enough information because there could be a White House anywhere so I'm gonna say there's not enough information oh I've got this question before is it legal for a man in California to marry his widows sister a widow is a woman whose man's died this'll hurting my brain I don't know I'm just gonna be like no no it's not okay because she's dead her sister and it's just like not okay okay it's girl code okay how many animals of each sex did Moses take on the ark one one because he took a boy and a girl oh did you just assume those animals genders you could have asked them what they choose to identify as before taking them on the ark ah so one that's a lot of sex that's a whole lot of sex there was once a lady who really liked pink and her cozy little one-story house everything was pink even her dog was pink her hair her carpet everything what color are her stairs hold up this is a real person I'm not even kidding see what'd I tell you this is the real thing this woman is obsessed with pink her whole house is pink oh my god we got a couple of these ladies got a couple of them oh yeah you ain't that special ma'am and she lives little one-story house she doesn't have stairs there was an evergreen tree in the dark ugly forest where ghosts witches and even Frankenstein's live all of a sudden a great gust of wind flew through the forest which way did the leaves on the tree fall evergreen tree hmm advert green tree I believe that evergreen trees have pines is that pine hold on hold on hold on let me let me let me yeah see they do not have leaves it's an evergreen tree like a Christmas tree I see you doesn't there's no there's no leave sir the tree doesn't have the ah it's is this my answer oh you're really gonna make me watch an ad to see my result you know what I'm gonna censor this yeah yeah take that ad nobody's gonna see it now not even me I'm not looking I'm not looking at your ad no I want my result can I please have my result oh you are so smart perfect common sense you have an abundant amount of common sense you ranked in the 90th percentile which means you are able to answer difficult questions correctly the average person would not be able to you analyze problems literally and are able to see past trickery or distractions come to solutions more easily than normal people you have a mind for science and math and intricate problem-solving well done science and math were literally the worst subjects for me in school I have grown no no no ascended as a human being anyway that's all for today I hope you guys enjoyed this video comment below did I

can get worse than this my family this that my cheapskate ways are out there but I don't really care this is my reusable boiling water yes I know it may be a little chunky but it saves me from spending more money on my water bill by cutting on the water and putting more water in the pipe dumping in and doing it all over again come on whatever change my water I'll change it don't rush me but the more you ask me that the longer I have to keep it yes telling me this nasty bitch reuses her boiling water girl let's be real how much money does a pot of boiling water costs it's gonna cost you a few cents okay and what did you say yes I know it may be a little chunky but it saves me from spending more money on my water bill maybe because you should change it or gives in that dirty due to water it is oh yeah of course it's gonna be good when you drench the pasta in ketchup prego oh no no no no no we use ketchup here high-fructose non-organic can we talk about how much I hate when people pull that the more you ask me the longer is gonna take just don't rush me because the more you ask me that the longer I have to keep it her man is more like a child a big child that she adopted that she's caring for he has no say in anything I am able to make the most of every food and drink that we have in this house by reusing this you just put the sauce from the plate back into the cap oh my lord I don't even think homeless people live like this if it doesn't get all drunk up I'll pour it back if it doesn't get all slumped up I put it back in its container save this pasta sauce for the next spaghetti dinner we do not have to be cheap we really know she has money I'm money like what's the point being so cheap boy I understand that it's aids but she's being too cheap they have money this dude works and he is forcing himself to live like this you honestly deserve it if you're just gonna take it this is the definition of yeah I love her I would do anything for her anything huh I mean you couldn't put that food as leftovers but no you won't be extra and slide the sauce right back in I hate you with a strict monthly food budget of $400 there's no room in Stephanie's world for extra expenses including entertaining guests really just wipe the plastic forks clean Patrick really wants to have a football party I am very unhappy about people coming over to our house really beggar people are really having people over to the house means Stephanie's pockets are getting dug into girl trust me nobody digging into your pockets nobody this poor do can't even have friends over because she has to entertain them or you're just ashamed when they asked wait why is the bathroom dark oh wait we have to take the light bulb from the living room here bring it to the bathroom while you go to the bathroom or you can pee in the dark you know it's embarrassing you don't want to tell anybody about your mental disease when I buy fruits and vegetables I want to pay for what I eat that's what I don't eat there's no need to pay for the vine and while I'm eating is the grapes oh there's no need to pay for the vine and while I'm eating is the grapes this is called griping she is literally picking off the grapes and leaving the vine so she doesn't have to pay that extra 20 cents in weight that'll do me justice [Music] I'm surprised you don't just pick them up put them on the scale that plastic bag gonna cost me one cent probably only need about three of these my bananas I'm not gonna eat the whole of the banana I eat the bananas so by removing the peels pits and stems from fruits and vegetables before their way to the register Stephanie saves up to $3 per shopping trip really just peel the damn banana in the store so she doesn't have to pay for the peel just gonna be brown by the time you're in the car it's okay I like them like that I have never seen anyone peel bananas and put them in a basket that is weird I'm excited I want to be embarrassed sorry I have to you have to turn it off when it's a commercial they have this I'm sorry Stephanie very cheap cheese person I've seen in a long time I'll tell you that much [Laughter] the castles that go to the bathroom I thought the walking around with the candle is really insane think we can use the light we have the Dark Ages now bitch they weren't lying they weren't lying this is not a joke it just keeps getting worse and worse let me unplug the TV while it's a commercial I have to a commercial you know what they taught me in school it costs more money to turn something off and turn it back on then to just leave it on not only is she cheap was she stupid too should have done your own research before taking on this ridiculous lifestyle things like water nasty I don't know if I could keep their this video this is the stupidest I can't I cannot I cannot with her anymore she cook the damn food in the dishwasher like it takes more energy she cook the damn food in the dishwasher sounds very embarrassing very I didn't like what the heck you could get out of their actions being the cheapskate that I am it's for me and my family anybody else I don't know what nobody says it was the Stephanie way and the Stephanie ways the better way the Stephanie way is the dumbass way okay okay I'm actually so relieved that this is over because I I didn't know how much more I could take it

Hey guys, today we are doing a different kind of video. Were gonna be recreating Kylie Jenner's selfies. I got this idea from my friend Mar She like recreated Kylie's selfies, and she was like yeah, you should do it too, and I'm like okay And I've been wanting you to do it for a while just because I feel like I'm bad at taking pictures I am bad at selfies. Okay. I'm not bad, but I'm not the best. I'm not out here taking professional ass pics It's literally just phone, mirror, BAM. That's all I do. There's no setting up. There's no oh I gotta make sure everything's perfect I got to make sure my bed's made, you see that pizza box from last night's dinner, I gotta make sure that's in the trash No, no, I don't care So I've  saved a couple of Kylie Jenner's pics and me and my boyfriend Who might I mention is also very bad at taking pics are gonna try to do this. If you guys enjoyed this video and want a part 2 Make sure you leave a like and comment below whose selfies I should recreate next. This is the first selfie we're gonna try to recreate. See we got the beautiful sunlight there. We got that perfect makeup. We got that, that flawless weave, okay I ain't got a weave. I don't have a white dress like that, but I do have like this tennis dress type thing that I can use and by the way all of these are just stuff I have in my house in my closet. I didn't buy anything for this video I probably should have but this is just everything I could find out of my closet So it's gonna be close enough. See first of all I don't have this gorgeous natural lighting in my house I don't have like any light in my house. I don't know what it is like There's other houses in my neighborhood that like block the Sun, and there's just no sunlight in my house during the winter But we're gonna try I'm gonna put on glasses, so you can tell the difference between us and these pics I'm just kidding. I just want mine to be a little Different okay, this is the only room in my house that has natural sunlight, and it's Sausage's room That's why it is always so cold on the second floor, and then his room is burning hot. I don't - I don't understand That's like the a/c does not work in this room. Okay, so here's my outfit for the first picture that we are Recreating I wore a white tennis dress because this is the closest thing I had to a white dress I mean, I don't even play tennis I just got it cuz goes on sale and almost like oh, this is cute for if I ever play tennis I will have something cute to plan but babe. You cannot play in this dress huh? Oh that's pretty sure I should I was like look at the tennis dress But it doesn't even like cover my butt so I put up my hands to swing I'm just like a full-on butt shot, so I just realized she's sitting and sitting Automatically makes you look thicker. 
[Sausage] Christian and family-friendly video.                Oh, yeah, it's my back. Okay. Okay, so what is she doing in the pic? she's like She like a lean in ansan. I ain't even got anything to lean on okay, I got This okay, this is not working We need it close enough you see the pic here You got a look at it already nice the same the same lighting at all I know she's looking at me so seductively with a big nipple mmm Let's see how these pics come out She don't got a broken Astro headset in the background, baby till chair more like this my hair Hair has to be off right here before yeah, man, you ain't no Kylie Jenner can you get back into position Is the position no no wait wait I don't know what to do with my elbow. Elbow down like that. Yes. Can you position me. And now boobies need to be more fix that way. This is so hard, I don't like taking pics. Look. Its so hot and my makeup is melting off. Okay like boobies need to be tilted up that way, wrong way, opposite way. Oh my god no, its this way. No there like downwards okay, okay? Okay? This would be so much easier on an actual couch you're gonna hate the lighting on you thing I'm trying so hard No, babe. You have to look at me with your head. Babe elbow down. Yes Retargeting they shouldn't even be in the pit. They should be it's in the pit for not my knees They're not tilt you out this way fully-auto. Sample. Let me see some of these damn garbage. Yeah I'm not a photographer. Baby, these are so awful. You know what camera's gonna focus on me. It's okay. We're gonna, try it again because there's gotta be one pic That we do good. We're gonna try again. Cuz this obviously didn't work. Sorry. I don't have that L.A. lighting. This boy Really carried the couch. No. Welcome to Sausage's new Channel Brazzerr.com. See, the lighting we need is the lighting, Up there up there the lighting we need, but there is no light in my backyard. We doing this rather shoe or no Okay, this is good. This is better than the ones in my room. So you guys I put effort into this stuff? I? I deserve seven million, okay guys now. Tell me who does it better? Maybe these suck. I hate this lighting I'm not even kidding. I hate you Take pictures of me. Wait wait wait wait wait. Take picture of me. Okay, okay. You want to do it. You're actually getting, no legs together. You don't grab it you put it seductively No, this is not okay? Stop it so here is the first pic. I think it came out. Well. I mean, it's White dress on point. That's the only part. I did okay. I got the whole pose wrong I know I wasn't looking at the pic when I was posing but Jeez like highly looked so natural and I look so uncomfortable like what am I doing here? I left my pizza in the oven I should probably go take it out instead of doing this stupid photo shoot. I don't want to be here anymore. Hopefully, the next one comes out a little better. Next one is this pic on the couch I wanted to do this pic just because I bought those same exact pants from my boyfriend And I just found them so I'm gonna wear his pants for these I'm pretty sure I have a shirt similar to that. Those shoes though. What are these shoes? I don't have any plastic wrap shoes, so we're gonna have to figure something out. What is this outfit? Yeah, those are mine? I? Got them $20 from Ross and with heels with sweatpants Okay Kylie, okay, so we're gonna sit on the couch right here. It's like it's like I'm twerking on the couch I like this this actually works out really good. I'm feeling money My knee feel soft. Like satin, I'm lounging about in my Kardashian home Where's her other hand, is it like. They're both on her legs, okay, so like on this like I'm gonna bust it open No, don't do that. What are you doing to me? I look like i'm like, what am I doing here? Why am I being forced to pose like this? This does not look natural for me at all. It's like I'll sit like this. I'll sit like I'm about a Papa baby. Oh, I think we're getting a little better at this. This one came out Slightly better. There's always room for improvement. I have the light pose all wrong could have been taken at a better angle And I was trying to like get sausage to get in there and take it at a better angle way see My man's he doesn't know angles, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out I actually don't look as constipated as she does so that's always a plus you don't want to look constipated Comment below tell me what you think of this one. Did I do it good stop? We're gonna Do this cute little car pick. The other day, I was gonna buy pants exactly like this. I showed them to sausage He was like you already have something like that I'm like yeah, probably and then I remembered I saw them in this pink so what should have got him But I didn't I don't have a black Ferrari. I don't have a black car My garage is not as clean as this there kids playing outside So I'm not trying to do a mini photo shoot in front of my house because all my neighbors are already like snooping like What do for a living I feel like they know and then they just tell everybody else in the neighborhood. Everything just looks so Flawless like she just got up on that car snapped one pic It was perfect after checking her Insta, she doesn't have that many pics like actual like selfies of that It's like more, more quality over quantity well my Instagram is quantity over quality I got lots of pics, but there they're just like Mirror selfies. I ain't got somebody following me around 24/7 taking pro pics of me. All right guys, I don't have a black Ferrari. But I think this work look down at my bag Like its my baby Fondlel it. We Gucci. Okay, so after I took this one I put the camera back into my car it fell off the tripod I broke my mic, and I broke parts of my camera so was it worth it to get this pic No, because that Michaels like 250 bucks. I think we did this one pretty okay - I like it I like the hair. I like the bag. I like the pose now. This is something I could do This is more doable. This is my style. This is good I can do this and I could probably do it good. Don't really use flash I'm not a fan of the flash and a mirror pic, but he's trying to hide your face up it works Okay, all right next one. I'm doing and I kind of wish I didn't eat a five-course meal before doing this cuz We a little we a little thick in all the wrong places had two things ice cream I had a five course meal, huh? Let me let me look exactly how it is her arm is out hair back there this looks uncomfortable Her like is in a very uncomfortable position No, I just got a turn on flash suck it in I Don't know how to put my leg or my knee Like is this supposed to be like this Like this out more. Oh, that's how she does it okay? I'm getting better at taking pics You know this whole thing is just helped me get better and taking the Instagram pics I'm not good with posing and everything, but this is a really cute outfit. My legs are not there, okay Oh, I've you just stretched up. This is like very uncomfortable this one came out the best so far I really like how this came out. It's almost exactly. I mean, I got the pants. I got the white shirt I got that flash. I even got that highlight. Just Kylie even have a highlight. No Kylie doesn't even have that highlight I like it. I'm very proud of myself. I patted myself on the back for this next up We got the gray on the gray. I got a couple years ago It's like this local clothes store cuz I made all these brands They get the same exact stuff like forever 21 fashion Novick you all those like closed doors just with a different label They get them from like this wholesalers or whatever I found in my storage room like a week ago, and now I'm like oh now I could do this video so again more my kind of selfies Hello welcome to my bathroom, so I got this outfit like four years ago This was before Kylie had this outfit, but I just so very much happen to have the same one, but it's perfect cuz So let's do this one good, okay, this one is easy straightforward Stuck getting curving mmm again Not something you should do after you eat and look a little constipated or no no no like I gotta pee We are finally making some progress See see how my pictures go from the first and the second to the third and the fourth I mean there's definitely an improvement Maybe it's because I'm taking the pictures and not sausage Yeah, that's definitely it okay, so I think I'm pretty Decent at taking mirror selfies, but everything else like I know I don't know how to pose them There's no mirror in front of me. It's like what am I do? we be creating these pics is so much harder than it looks like it's not she just I'm just gonna snap a pic in the mirror real quick and it's gonna be perfect nah First of all I think all celebrities and almost everybody on instagram with like a lot of followers like photo shops Out of their pics like just to make them perfect. I feel like nobody just snaps a pic and that's it It's perfect let's you're hella lucky. It doesn't happen and this one more of my style more doable for me I can do this - I don't have them Balenciaga, but I got some Nikes. I'm not a sneaker person I've never really worn sneakers I've never really cared for sneakers, but I do have a black sports bra and black yoga pants and black hair, okay This is a much comfier position than the other one the other one is like I Felt like I was going like this like a laying down at the side like legs sticking up trying to stick out my butt at The same time and just it didn't work out this woman seems so much easier so much more simple Video hello everybody I think I'm doing this one good this all looks like it's gonna still a little uncomfortable So I had two pics that I really liked for this one this pic and this pic that I took in my room While I was waiting for sausage to record the behind-the-scenes But I think this one came out good too again mirror selfies, it's much easier I think it's just posing in front of somebody taking pictures of you It's just really hard and it's like you don't know what they're doing You don't know what that camera screen looks like you don't know what they see so it's hard If they're like not directing you at least for me. I don't know how to do that stuff. I think I'm done with this video.

kids who got detention I don't know about you guys but I was a good kid sometimes sometimes I was a bad kid I've only gotten detention twice once was really being stupid we went on a field trip to an amusement park and we were getting ready to leave I was by myself I got hella lost I had no idea where the buses were I had no idea what anything was I was just lost okay and because I got lost when I went back to the buses everybody was ready to go and since I was like I got the tension maybe y'all should have came to find me my chorus teacher gave me the detentions whoa what was she gonna do nothin so this kid got detention because he volunteered to be a target for a paper spear was hit in the face with it so did he get the attention because he's not allowed to be the target or because he absolutely failed and got hit in the face with it all right Billy you have detention maybe you should sit and think about not getting hit in the face next time that'll teach him Billy brought a lunchable for another student and was sneaky when telling him he told me he knew he wasn't supposed to give food to another student and his mom is like I refused to sign that is pretty messed up like kid was probably like hey I don't have money for lunch and then Billy over here was like hey I got you I'm gonna get you a lunchable from home and he's gonna get detention for it you're not allowed to give food to other kids since when is this a thing in 2017 you're not allowed to give somebody food I would refuse to sign too I mean technically this is a good idea if you are a kid and you got a detention slip that you're supposed to give to your parents to sign and then you could just write I refuse to sign be like yeah my mom doesn't want to sign she doesn't agree with you she doesn't think I deserve detention but it's really you sign-in I refuse to sign does girl got detention for saying I'm gonna twerk on you at homecoming you better tip me what do you mean tip you want him to have a fat stack of one and make it rain on you at homecoming are you even allowed to do that I hate shaking this booty for free we all know where this girl is gonna end up high school girls gone wild lots of future career choices for you that's honestly so embarrassing she said this at lunch to somebody but a teacher overheard her the tension for disrespect oh yeah who am i disrespecting by saying I'm gonna twerk on you I would not give this to my parents I'm a fake a second shirt show up at detention do my time I then go to work at homecoming so Nick Garcia got a dress code violation this violation tuxedo this is the first time I've ever seen a guy get dress coded for having a tuxedo you're not a lot of wear a tux you know it's cool what the hell it's too distracting it was trying to be fancy maybe it's his birthday how y'all gonna do him like that Marissa disrupted the class claiming to be the reborn Jesus and hitting another student with a Bible it's me Jesus I like how it's detention because she disrupted the class I had to stop teaching for our hot sex tell you to sit them down if Marissa is Jesus I'm Britney Spears and I can't even sing late arrival reason was scared to go outside fog reminded me of Silent Hill this kid open the doors like you know it's foggy outside I can't I can't do this I can't go to school who knows what's in the fog okay you know what legitimate reason a lot of bad shit happened in Silent Hill you do best to stay nearby I'll be back with help as quick as I can I'm in detention because I threw a very impressive majestic paper airplane into the recycling bin this is not how one is supposed to act because it could have been paled someone impaled someone a paper no at most you get in a nasty paper cut but impale might go through somebody's dam hands yeah no I think nots we're gonna learn sine and cosine but not learn that paper cannot impale someone listen up school learn your priorities my behavior makes others the teacher classmates etc feel unsafe because they could have been killed by a paper airplane okay now you're me I will make the following adjustments so this does not happen again not making massive majestic airplanes so that I do not get the urge to throw them I'm just gonna stop myself from hurting anybody in the school by not making paper airplanes they're just so much worse that you could do and yeah we've got Billy over here going to detention for making a paper airplane and after he had his fun with it he threw it in the recycling so I see nothing wrong with this but it's 2018 everybody's scared of everything including being impaled by a paper airplane y'all crazy today in guitar class you call Justin Bieber a fag this word is an offensive derogatory term that is used to negatively refer to LGBT persons I understand that you did not mean to hurt anyone by using this word but please find it some new ways to describe your feelings towards Justin Bieber complete the following sentences Justin Bieber is a bad person because he does drugs I don't like Justin Bieber because he is a bad singer and should go to jail Justin Bieber's music sounds like really bad but if I were Justin Bieber this is what I would do differently be a better person and then who he is now when I call Justin Bieber a fag what I really meant was he is a bad person and should go back to Canada Canada's like nah nah y'all can have him I can't believe this teacher wrote up this whole thing it's like a specific assignment just for this student who insulted Justin Bieber I mean to me it sounds like he likes Justin Bieber a little too much like dare you insult my favorite singer of all time but here is a very passive-aggressive assignment to take out your frustrations I made it just for you Billy Ryan had some toenail clippers that he said he would use to cut somebody's body with that when he may have swallowed a rock Ryan what the hell you're gonna cut somebody's body with toenail clippers oh you know what had actually be awful imagine getting a toenail clipper and then putting it on some skin and they're like kind of it oh man you swallowed a rock let me get my toenail clippers I'm cut stop rock out of you know the people that grow up to be like serial killers and stuff and I'm not talking about the ones that poured the milk first so this girl on her homework she decides to take a big fat sharpie and write I'd rather see Harry Styles naked oh my god this is not something that you tell your teacher or anybody is something you should keep locked up inside what the teacher was like me too Oh until then detention for 30 was it worth that Ashley zero out of 17 and detention for wanting to see Harry Styles naked if Harry Styles wanted you to see him naked you would see him naked but he obviously doesn't I mean what is there to see not much Nick was in class when another student mentioned an odor Nick told the girl to close her legs okay that was at school guys let's say this all the time like any time they smell fish I like Ashley close your damn legs but nobody got in trouble for it maybe because I didn't get caught but Nick that's just straight up rude girls any time y'all smelling cheese be like Billy close your damn wine watch your balls smell them from here gross you know what everybody should just shower Elijah over here got a lunch detention for stapling students close together don't give these kids staplers that's why they keep it on the teacher's desk because if you give a kid a stapler they got stable everything together they stapling a lot more than their assignments lies you're running around like stapling their shirt and their pants together like you'll never take it off you'll never be able to go to the bathroom again and I'll be forced to wet yourself I mean that's one way getting revenge on the world after being spoken to today about this respect she continues to call another teacher a Furby a Furby is these two little things [Music] all right they're kind of creepy why would you give detention for that it's disrespectful this student was sent home why for a nacho in his eye how does that even happen oh I'm meeting the nacho I really know your mouth is over here your eye is over here how do you accidentally see a nacho to your eye come about you guys by being a lot of food and not once has this ever happened to me Collin bullshit Bob Raymond threw a lamp at another student and told him to light in the 11th grade he's like 16 years old I'll give this one to him he's pretty punny like in the I hope he did after that Wyatt got in trouble for inappropriate language you have to be give me in the ass said loudly to friends that's so embarrassing he's in ninth grade his parents see it be like why Wyatt do you want them to you in the ass I mean it's one thing getting in trouble for cursing but when it gets really specific that's like so embarrassing like imagine giving your parents this telling your friends you have to be ass I don't know about you guys my parents do not tolerate cursing I've had my mouth washed out with soap and pepper if you thought I couldn't get anywhere somebody got detention for drinking paint I'm not sure which is worse drinking it paints are getting the detention or maybe you deserve it for being an idiot it doesn't even smell good why would you drink it I wanted to know what happens it looks like a milkshake Jacob got detention for taking off his shirt in the middle of class and yelling come at me bro to another student but did he get his ass beat I need to know was it Jacob Sartorius Brianna got a lunch detention for reading a book how dare you try to learn on your own reading a book in school disgusting you make me sick I'm the teacher I do the

Some people want to save money, but some people take it way too far You guys probably get mad with your mom tries to save money check this out My mother is a cheapskate and her mother were a cheapskate So I'm three generations of cheapskate Wow impressive like the final boss of cheapskate we got frugal We got cheap we got this woman right here the biggest cheapskate in Texas my family's been dumpster diving for generations It's basically in my DNA at this point My name is Angel Durr and I am literally the biggest cheapskate in Texas Excuse my curiosity, I don't know if she dumpster diver for food or she's pregnant Some people See dumpster diving as like a sport. I don't see it that way. I just see it as something I have to do in order to get what I want for the price that I'm willing to pay which is nothing Okay so I need groceries I need a new dining table, and I need a new sofa But I don't want to pay anything for them You know what I don't want to pay anything for anything because I can find in a dumpster. Okay Miss Durr I found that if you come late in the evening That's when cops tend to want to come around so I try to do it in the middle of the day when people are working and stuff like that. Err, there's a pregnant lady Diving in my dumpster with a stick. One of the main things that I look for when I go dumpster diving now are medications especially Prenatal vitamins, I researched all medications before I take them and I've been doing this a very long time Hold on so she's pregnant She's dumpster diving for medication... I'm not a I'm not a doctor or a professional or anything, but this probably biohazardous material in there Mixed in with your medication that you're finding. She's like I research all the vitamins. It's okay I research all medications before I take them and I've been doing this a very long time Maybe because the research doesn't tell her hmm you shouldn't get your vitamins from dumpsters Maybe she thinks it's okay because those sites don't have a specific warning. That says do not get medication out of the dumpster Thank you. I mean the freakin medication says do not take if seal is broken She's taking this to a whole nother level by foraging  through dumpsters behind pharmacies and hospitals Twenty-five-year-old angel Durr has managed to save more than 350 dollars on vitamins and medications Over the course of her eight month pregnancy. Hold up Just like I said if you're getting Medication from a dumpster that belongs to a hospital. It's gonna be biohazardous shit in there Like needles aids every single disease that you could possibly think of is in that dumpster And you are putting it in your body, and there's a baby in there like I said, I'm no expert But I'm pretty sure that's bad Bad but poor kid when it comes out like mommy what's wrong with me, mm most probably that medication I took out of the dumpster when I was pregnant You done messed up I'm kind of just poking around to see if I can hear anything rattling Cause generally thats a dead give away of pills I think expiration dates in general are kind of mm Lot of times they put expiration dates on things way earlier than they need to just just sell more product I know lush does that like I'll buy a facemask and it'll expire in like two weeks No, no no no. No, that's bullshit, but with pills girl. If it was just you and you weren't pregnant go for it Kill yourself slowly. It's okay. Do-do you okay, but when you're pregnant and doing this the baby's gonna suffer, too Bingo! Bingo! Like medicine and a dumpster they're so hard to find in there. They're so expensive my husband agrees with her life Not we should go to Walmart and get some vitamins for 9.99$ a rather go to the dumpster and get the good shit like expired but free I cannot believe that angel dumpster dives for meds No, that's not even safe. I wouldn't wait too extreme for me We recently bought a house Primarily because of the fact that we were about to have a child Wow They bought a house. I'm surprised You didn't just find somewhere abandoned just decide to live there You know chop down some trees and make your own house, or you don't if you get really lucky Maybe you'll find one in a dumpster because it was a ex frat house. It was in a horrible condition And it had a funky odour to say the least I mean it was a party house angel and Orlando had both renovated and furnished the 3,400 square foot home without spending a single penny. Hold up! They renovated an entire house not spending a single penny. You know what challenge accepted I can actually do that like when I go for a walk in my neighborhood people have like nice ass couches dining sets Mattresses out on the street that they're throwing away And you know anybody can just take those pick them up free to our house We make a point to say hey that came out of a dumpster, and then usually people are kind of taken aback But at the same time they're kind of like oh wow We've been doing this in my family for 60 plus years, so we know what we're doing. We've been passing it down from generations 60 years of dumpster diving we know how to do this we go to the free section on Craigslist And we drive around the expensive neighborhoods and pick up their trash You know see that's where you get the good stuff from she was a child of the depression Everything has a purpose the angel seems to love it. She enjoys it. It's like a rush for her She told me when I find stuff in the dumpster like Christmas Man it is kind of like Christmas You get all this free stuff. I mean at least you like hell is supportive of her like yeah, man It is like Christmas a house free most expectant parents can spend around five thousand dollars furnishing a new nursery Angel in Orlando have collected the same pieces for free We found a lot of different furniture that we're gonna be using in the nursery And it's actually a complete set that we've managed to get out of dumpsters Getting a crib from the dumpster is just like anything else I get from the dumpster. I'm gonna clean it I'm gonna sanitize it I'm gonna make sure it's safe before I let my baby even set foot in it Oh the jackpot a whole baby room in a dumpster like that girl from Orange is the new black Rich ladies that are about a doctor kid and then the adoption doesn't go through and then I got all that baby stuff Brand-new from a Pottery Barn it's not going in the dumpster, but I mean okay I know this is super EXTREME for the medication, but for everything else. It's like it works. It's pretty good Especially for furniture because people throw away that shit all the time you and I are going to the paint store to try to get as many free samples as we can in order to finish the nursery Me and Orlando Have been doing this a long time, so we've already hit up a lot of places Being pregnant kind of gives me a one-up on Orlando. What size nursery are you painting um? I'd say it's a pretty standard sized room so all that paint to paint her room she gets for free in Samples girl how much are your samples? We have samples for $2.99? $2.99 I'd like to work with you on that How about free...99 3.99? How do you feel about that free? Him: If you're gonna buy a couple gallons of paint maybe we can work out something. Her: okay? Her: But, I wouldn't I wouldn't be buying any today. Him: today. maybe tomorrow? Her: maybe tomorrow or the next day. Him: okay? Well, I guess she's straight bamboozled him. Yeah, let me get a couple free samples how about Free.. 99 3.99 yeah, I'll definitely come back and buy a couple gallons So, like what's a few samples maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow or the next day, okay? How you gonna bamboozle small business owners like this my dude go to Lowe's go to Home Depot? Oh you got to pay? There's no negotiate in there. You got a scam the good hard-working people of America. She was very nice lady She was decorating a nursery so thought I would help her out I Approached it like I approached every situation I just you know was nice and sweet And I always think that you get more flies with sugar than you do with vinegar so yeah being sweet more like bamboozled in the poor dude So she's chosen dumpster diving as a way of getting the thing she needs for free Damn they hit the jackpot. Oh we got a baby stroller in here we got a we've got a car seat Oh those dumb moms they spent $12,000 on their first year of having a baby watch me do it for $12 But anyways what's offered today I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did what should hit that like Brennan the hey and subscribe join the Wolfpack *Howls* Love you guys so much.

Oh Vegas see that's a good place to look for change. Also. Do these people have jobs Maybe getting a job like like any job would make you more money than this little hobby. these shoes and all my dress shoes I get from the shoe repair store people drop off the shoes they forget about them Or don't have the money to pick them up oh You know what that's actually good   That's actually good because I've been to a shoe repair store before and it's like the whole Store was covered in shoes and bags and stuff that I've been there for months Like people just forget about it This is grocery budget under $60 a month by disregarding expiration dates and spending no more than a dollar on any single item tortillas 50 Cents Powerbars 50 Cents, cupcakes 50 Cents peanut butter and jelly one dollar. hold up He won't pay more than a dollar on anything Next to nothing for water each month by refusing to use it in his own apartment Hey, would you mind if I throw in some laundry with you just a few things not a lot maybe a few things no eeww no I would rather pay for your whole laundry, then you put it in with mine Oh first of all you a dude and dude's socks The underwear, no Thanks mark you're gonna have to fuck off I could see you have asking them for a cigarette but no He looked like a dirty dude. My name is Marco wondering if you mind if I tossed in a few articles with your laundry No haha Why don't you use all that change you found in the toilet? Huh a lot of people say that I'm crazy Do you mind if I throw in some laundry with you? No that's fine. Thank you, but a couple things here a couple things there And then you find someone to share a dryer with Do you mind if I throw some laundry  with you just a few items? See, a dryer is fine cause the clothes are already clean But washing it and your socks and stuff you let me throw my socks and stuff and then when it comes out You gotta go through everything like wait wait wait these boxers look familiar. That's my skidmark from 2015 Bruh, while he won't spend a single cent on laundry mark does like to gamble he's found a way to make sure he's never parting with his own money I don't spend more than five dollars, and I only play the penny slots because you could win up to $10,000 Okay, okay, maybe I underestimated this guy here, so he's got a gambling problem, but before he hits the slots He just gets all the change he can find. He's like, I refuse to gamble any of my hard-earned cash I will only gamble other people's money that I find on the floor so on his way to the casino He'll pick up all the change he could find one day this dude mark he will get lucky and he'll win If for some unfortunate reason I should lose. I'd only lose a maximum of five dollars, not a whole paycheck Ooh free drinks too! If I were at a bar  the drinks would cost me twelve to fifteen dollars, but by coming to a casino I played the penny slots win money and drink for free Doing pretty good for himself. I'm gonna Have a good ass night tonight for free dress up in my best suit pick a ball of change I could find Drinks on the house. I win I win. I lose I lose. I only spent five dollars max only five dollars I know when to stop most people think oh yeah, I'm gonna keep going they double and double and triple I'm like, no. You got to know when to walk away That's some willpower. Well wait it gets better. This guy wants to sell his testicles for $35,000 I mean I feel like that's kind of low cause they're all old and used up As true do your research I'm not coming at the dude It's true do your research. I'm really anxious and really excited and waiting to do is this testicular study What you do is you go, and you donate one of your testicles. They replace it with an artificial one and when you check out after 14 days you get a check for $35,000 You can buy yourself a brand new BMW Okay, maybe not brand new, but like almost new or like a Honda Civic and go on like a nice vacation It's just one though I mean, I don't think this guy cares about ever getting laid again, and as long as you have one you still a man But that's not all, apparently this dude has done several medical studies for money, and medical trials in order to get free checkups Saving himself seven hundred and fifty dollars or more in the process So to save yourself money like to not go to the doctor and pay for checkups He would be a guinea pig for medical studies. I mean okay. It saves some money. Okay well I would take up there at home. I would use them for daily, work, exercise, and for doing other clinical trials. saved on laundry, Cheap to clean, he saves all the pants from the medical studies and just wears them every day like Oh my workout clothes Yeah, I got free pair pants out of my ebola studies. These are the Ebola. Why study this is my favorite Everyone panicked when my friend and I did this study. It was never tested on humans or animals before, and we were the first two in the country to have it done to us What? They're gonna inject me with Ebola to do a damn study I made some money out of it got a free check oh and the best part. I've got some free pants It's $5,000 for a week, so why would I not do it? $5,000 a week that sounds like some influencer money. He doing pretty good. I mean He's still got all his hair. This is a really good one What they do is they stop your heart for one minute, but you still breathe stay there 14 days pays $25,000. Whoa, whoa! Yeah, you can just like make my heart stop $25,000, ooh yes! I will risk death for that. What good is all this damn money. If there's a chance you will die I mean, he's good, skin glowing. He's still here living his cheapskate ways I mean, maybe it was meant to be, there is only so much cheap I can afford Like they don't get it he's by himself. He has a job He's making all this money, but it's like Why would you force yourself to live like this? When you have money, it's a mental illness I feel like I used to have something like that a long time ago where I was really cheap and what me and sausage first Started dating like he hated it He was like why you got to go to like a used clothes store and get used clothes I'm like it's cheaper, and he just he was just the type of person that bought everything like brand-new I used to do a lot of things to save money.

you didn't see that's really the only explanation apparent to me I know my car looks skinny I know my car is cute I just lost five pounds but that point is simply mu you've double parked your car and completely blocked my way next time you won't get a note is the least I have to say the more that you read the more things that you will know the more that you leave the more places you will go and

passive-aggressive that's more like straight-up aggressive to the individual obsessed with drawing penises rest assured that you're the only person who finds humor in this while I am glad you are so open and expressing yourself it is rather distasteful to be depicting your desires in such great detail on everybody's doors if you care to enjoy your phallic artwork alone in your own place of residence that is perfectly fine by me however there are a number of students who fail to appreciate your unique style of expression on their property the next time you feel the urge to create penises do it on canvas and take it to an art show maybe you'll make some money out of the deal letme job beat that penis on this you're basically asking for it this is so properly worded this dude taped his green teas is your name Dave and then there's another Dave in the office yes my name is Dave thanks for the free drink Dave for life but is it really Dave or did he say his name was Dave bye damn

My hat's got ears Have you ever got a bad present something you really didn't like but you gotta play it off like Thank you it's the nicest water bottle I've ever seen Go on, drink it! Today were gonna be watching kids opening bad presents. I mean as an adult you can contain yourself You're not gonna be like crying over it, but when you're a kid You just can't help it. Oh Big box a rice cake Why is it a joke there's your gifts Show me anything isn't that what you asked for do you like it? No you look dim at least try the rice cake some of them are really good, okay? And that's a lot of soap you can like fill up all the soap dispensers in your house and just like Wash your hands the rest of the year and smelling really good I bet that's vanilla scented which is the best scent you'll have the best smelling hands in the house How's it taste? Have you gonna be really clean this year for Christmas aren't you? what's the matter hun? Feel bad because I hate it. It's matter huh oh My god good poor kids hey guys It's Kyle. Max is raging right now because I got a ps4 for Christmas plus a bunch of games and all Max got was $50 I'd be grateful, but he is just a... selfish dude. Hold up, so he got $50 - Max got was $50 and his brother got a Playstation a buncha games well first of all the PlayStation and all the games are gonna be for them to share like they could share It if I had two kids They're gonna share all that it's not just his. ''oh no, max the PlayStation is for just your brother you you you cannot play it'' and he's gonna throw a Fit forgetting 50 dollars that you can buy whatever you want with Usually kids love money  Give me a card with $20. I would have been the happiest kid in the world That's more than you would make from a lemonade stand if you were selling organic non-gmo grass-fed lemonade you still wouldn't have made $50 so I Think that's a pretty good deal for being a kid with no Responsibilities no job like $50. What do you want a car? I think $50 is good for a kid? If a PS4 is $7,000 then I think $50 It's good for you it's good for you okay max whatever you say Where are those kids parents? I want to smack my kids so hard for being so ungrateful I bet you don't want the $50 I will gladly take it back You want to have no Christmas present you have no Christmas present or maybe this is just a bad kid and they give him less isn't that how it's Supposed to work max. Max, This is how it works in the real world you're gonna be bad You're gonna get cold or nothing you were lucky your parents decided to bless you with $50 he already has a ps4 Tell me why they look like Freddy from icarly That's it. I'm not doing it. I'm not helping. This is freddy before iCarly He wants an Xbox one and the black ops edition a Playstation when he already has a Playstation I would not give this kid anything I Wouldn't even give him 50 bucks I would've gave him a damn water bottle not even not even Kirkland not even that good ass Costco water I'm gonna give him Nestle Pure Life water Doesn't need money he needs discipline Oh my god he's so upset over this like what did you want? you already have a ps4 and he's crying about not getting another ps4 and an Xbox Spoiled a** kid. next up we got a spoiled little girl. Who's crying over an iPhone kids crying over iPhones That's the worst in my opinion because the iPhone it's a big thing IPhone cost a lot of money and your parents got to pay for each month I wish my parents would have got me a nice phone when I was a kid But I accepted it I understand it cost a lot of money. They couldn't afford it So this was when the iPhone 4 came out so her mom got her the three instead Her mom waited an hour in line and got her a phone, and she's gonna complain about it That's how you know you don't raise your kids good. raise them too spoiled I see that Lululemon bag in the corner my friend's sister her mom spoils her with Lululemon And she cried when she got an iPhone, so so don't get these girls Lululemon. That's how it starts Wait how old is this you realize you're crying over a phone ''this is a dinosaur '' yeah, man, this is a dinosaur. You don't know what a real dinosaur looks like it looks like this get your shit Right, this is the dinosaur just kiddin you learn the animals before you start buying them phones A sandwich damn! you see that disrespect?? A sandwich I hate it I just wanted the iPhone X is that too much to ask for? I swear these Millennials and their standards his parents trolled him.  ''you gonna be bad, you're gonna get bad presents'' I feel like that would change kids like they would want to be good just so they get good presents I feel like it will work ''Santa's not gonna get you anything good'' you know I always thought about like what if somebody spoils it for a kid like what if somebody's just Straight-up goes up to them and it's like the Tooth Fairy isn't real Santa Claus Isn't real would you like not have a childhood? Would that completely ruined your childhood? I Wonder. I feel like I knew Santa wasn't real when I was a kid, but it's like look how I turned no I mean, I'm not pretty decent okay.

the normal day here feet playing with other feet when your man says he's going out to have a boys night out y'all think he's cheated this is what he's probably doing I don't know which is worse that wasn't so bad you're telling me this Apple has to bow stems Stefano has one stem has two buttholes what do you call that part how does it look like on the inside would you eat this Apple comment below I wouldn't wine is cinnamon but look like et no I would not eat it as hella crusty oh no how does this shenanigan happen so after the boys night out you come home you try to unlock your door and then realize hey that circle could go inside this circle so this dude actually attached them one wrong move it's gonna pull that shit out you're done Oh imagine if somebody opened the door and opened right oh noes my nose yeah let's just hope nobody opens the door you're probably gonna need some help getting that out wow this girl I don't know if she taped her extensions to her eyelids or if her eyelashes grew that long and she like curled them no no no that cannot be it why would you do this longest eyelashes in the world is it her or is it her those are a little too thick oh look damn grandpa got some nice lashes man ah this is disgusting disgusting this is not real this is not legit no way these are legit she just taped extensions to her hair I really don't like these I would just like them up above we put them with the rest of my hair it gets worse what is this mess here somebody tried to do a makeup tutorial on the YouTube and just gave up and hung their own eyelashes how did they tie string that small around their damn eyelashes the gulp pull them up like ah okay okay I've been cringing this whole time so I already failed leave a like if I know you're still with me you didn't give up we're not giving up yet let's let's keep going here's was poison ivy at least I got like a really cool pic for tumblr it is not a pretty little aesthetic planet it's poison ivy you see that all the rash I don't like the little dots all over the skin that little rationale gives me the heebie-jeebies I don't like it I've never touched poison ivy before and I've never like got a rash from it so I don't know what this is like is it like itchy butt hurt are those macaroons you like these please it is these flesh colored with baby faces molded in I don't know if somebody thought this was a cute idea to have for like a baby shower let's put a baby face on a macaroon to make them skin colored and then it turned into a cannibal party real quick no uh-uh I'm not having this these are just these are very very disturbing looks like when you about iguanas just opens its eyes it's like no please and then when you take the first bite they start screaming no thank you I think I'll pass on the baby macaroons what is it and eyelashes okay this is clearly a photoshopped image but Oh imagine if this was a real animal like just a set of teeth and the eyelid and some eyelashes and that animal was as big as your dog okay see that would be hella creepy I don't like how they put a mascara on it like trying to make it pretty or something because that's not gonna work all the mascara and the world is not gonna work how about you take those damn teeth out go to a dentist or something maybe brush up oh that's what they do they brush today so at one point was this all hole candle and this person is sleeping like the dead or maybe maybe they're even dead and they decided oh as a memorial let's put a candle in the Arab melter is that this a way to get all the wax up but I'm pretty sure they did it wrong that's not how you do it cuz that candle look like the whole dad thing melted inside the ear what happens will you pull it out can you even pull it out is it too late the wax is already went to your brain and started pouring out of your nose and you're already dead like this bugs me so much how long was it before they inserted it into the ear and it melted and I don't like

fake toenails and now we got a foot with no toenails how did this happen were you just like born with no toenails is it edited it out does somebody like rip them off one by one you should have paid your dealer the money you owe him cuz I heard this is what they do you want somebody money every time you're late on that money and you don't pay up they go rip a toenail off you come home after a hard day at work looking at all this shit and you see a dog looking like a snack but not a good kind of snack like a Rover what the hell are you doing we're over looking dumb thick [Music] the worst

stick-on ones or anything nah he went to a damn salon like give me the longest you got and they gave him the longest they got be like my feet don't fit but I can slip my hand through this shoe I pretend like I'm a pretty girl with hairy legs and pretty nails how does this happen how does a hair go inside your nail look look if you tried to do this there is skin and then nail and a dis tightly attack there's no way anything could go inside if I tried to stick like a needle or something really skinny and sharp inside there that shit will bleed like a mother how did this guy get a hair in there this one just baffles me look I'm sitting here thinking about it like maybe maybe he like lifted it off and it's like broke it off and then he put it back on after the hair was it and then decided to take a picture of it I don't know man but this just like freaks me out then he could actually slide something in there but you can't slide anything in there this is the final boss now that I've looked at it enough feel like I'm ready for anything now I feel like I'm I'm good man somebody thought it was a good idea to take their foot callus cut it into nice little designs and then spread it open I want this person to know you are a monster why would you do this did somebody kidnap him and decide to do this to him you peel open a banana you get this what is this you got a double banana

Camaro seems legit only under dreams literally in your dreams on your computer I was the birthday girl and then she's actually gonna say I didn't edit this WTF is that I don't edit my pics page you

fired you because you were late again you cried we're all tired of your shit man you never check the bathroom because you never clean your workstation and always blame it on others you knew there was

What's up guys, today I'm doing my intro right outside my room, because during the day the lighting is very bad in my room so I don't record during the day so I basically procrastinate and do adult things the whole day And then at night I do the YouTube things, that YouTube things as in record a video I can only record videos at night, but I was editing today's video, and then I realized wait, where's the intro? I never did an intro because when I was reporting the video. I was like okay I don't know what to say for an intro So I'm gonna do the intro after after the video and then after the video I didn't do an intro so I'm doing one now I ment intro dang it, Oh my hair Yes in this video my hair is purple But the intro my hair is black because I dyed it back, a video could just can not have an intro and I can't do that I can't just have a video and have no intro It's like going to your grandma's house for Thanksgiving and just like going through the door Sit down, eat the food, get up, and leave, that's rude, so I'm not trying to be rude to you guys I'm trying to have an intro so like hello. How are you? How was your Thanksgiving? I hope you had a good Thanksgiving weekend. Did you eat lots of food because I did Today we are doing twins. Two people that came out of the same, but technically what twins are they don't always look alike, but yeah Let's get started. Don't you see these lovely ladies? They're twins, right? Yeah, they're twins But they spent a $130,000 dollars to look more like each other so they have the title of the world's most Identical twins okay like it's a competition these two girls. They're inseparable. They share a job a car a Facebook account What their boyfriend too - they've got the same damn boyfriend. Damn They're actually gonna marry him. I gotta look this guy up oh My god, this is too good. Oh y'all went a little too crazy with the surgery I'm sure they looked way better before that upper lip looking like a butthole, and it's that's not okay Look at this dude, you sure this is the boyfriend or the pimp. I mean he's probably living his dreams This just blows my mind So their job is working with the elderly at like an old folks home the poor old people They would come up to them and be like wait didn't you just give me my meds I wonder if they like play it off like oh Yeah Was me it would be so let having a twin anything you do you could just like blame it on your twin, be like She did it I didn't do it. Not me. The heaviest twins in the world Over 723 pounds! dang How do you get this big, I feel like it was on purpose. They were just going out McDonald's every single day breakfast lunch and dinner Special sauce nah. Let me get some boneless extra thick extra lard on my burger. Thank you They were normal size until the age of six So you see there's little mini bikes there on Honda's sponsored them to ride mini bikes from New York to LA to show the durability of their bikes That Honda Honda has no chill But did they make it though I know it might be a dick thing to say, but I don't understand how people get this big It's like me when I start getting weight. I'm like okay. I need a chill I need to stop eating so much cookies and brownies. I'm not gonna make some cookies and brownies today Well, I gained 20 pounds in the past few years, so It's not the worst, but I do most of that is on purpose because I want to gain weight I wanted to be thick okay Don't judge me next we got the tallest twins in the world seven feet six inches Holy Moly Obviously they played basketball, but damn these two got some Hella top Aaron and his mom looks like she's 6-foot something. I mean you Put two really tall parents together you're gonna. Get some really tall kids the more you know Oh, that's not all we got the tallest girl twins ever cuz I wait These don't look like twins y'all look like sisters and the tallest female twins are six seven is that an octopus or or a Twin is that what what but but? Calamari was born on this. I'm just kidding her name is Lakshmi Lakshmi I can't say your name, so i'ma call you calamari Junior. She was born with four arms and four legs She was named after the hindo goddess of wealth since Goddness is always depicted as four armed. Yo that's so perfact This is a miracle child She became an object of worship as an incarnation of the goddess, and then they found out she wasn't incarnation of the goddess But instead she's an... (Trying to say Ischiopagus) conjoined twin that means she swallowed the other twin And all that's left is its arms and legs I'm kidding so the other twin was headless, and then the rest of it didn't develop And she kind of just turned into like one being oh, this is this is her x-ray, so see she got a pelvis How does she go to the bathroom? I want to know because it's like conjoined and Then she's got four sets of legs won't she let go Rissa in real life I don't know what you guys was like hella cool. It's like I want to see how it works They conducted surgery for 27 hours to remove the parasite twin, so she hadn't infected ulcer and they had to remove the parasite twin and 27 hours of surgery That's a long time. That's over a day, and then they removed the parasite twin and then that poor kid grew up wanting to be an octopus and couldn't be an octopus I hate you mom and now we got conjoined twins, I feel like this is the most boring cuz everybody's probably seen this, but I mean How would you carry these babies You'd have to like Daddy carries one and then mommy carries the other one you got to hold them so it's like I don't know. How would you like pick them up and take them somewhere do something, good thing babies Don't know how to walk They could just light your bed all day But if one baby wants to sleep on the side and the other baby wants to sleep on the other side and then like, like You can't move your head. I wonder if they know if the other one exists like oh my god There's a baby like right behind me, but I can't see the baby cuz looked ahead so like face the other way They don't know about each other They don't know they have conjoined heads Are you know when babies like drink a bottle and then they're like? Like rubbing their head or something and then it like stabs the other one in the eye Think of all the possibilities just so it blows my mind But they did have surgery the doctors gave him a 1 in 10 million chance that they would survive the surgery And both of them survived. Let's see where they are now Oh my god they are two separate people now I'm so happy Longest oldest living conjoined twins I mean these babies got separated when they were still babies, but these dudes they actually just dealt with it they What they have four arms four legs? Separate heads, it's like Zak and wheezie They have one private area where only one of them can control They're over 63 years old. I mean it's like having four hands You could do like different things at once I always wanted four hands I get like a lot of things done, but I want them like out of my back. It would be more convenient that way I wonder if he ever gives him kisses if he's having a bad day like I love you brother And then just like leans over and just, kisses I don't know it's just so cute I had no idea. This is possible, but these two girls are actually twins How does that happen when the mom messing around with two dudes? I did some research and apparently that's a thing it's like a very small chance, but if you do it with two dudes There's a chance that both of them can get you pregnant like If that's the case I don't think either the daddies want to stay, but that just blows my mind that that's possible like that some Fanfic shit right there, but that's not how this happened so their mom carry genes for both black and white skin So she passed them down to her twins so twins being born with different skin colors is like a 1 in 500 chance I'm sure at school Everybody asked these girls, which one was adopted and then they would explain what we're twins, then I feel like people wouldn't believe them like You are not twins. She looks like she's ben getting that her whole life You the adopted one. She has red hair like naturally red hair, and she has black curly hair like That would be so crazy to have kids like that though. There's another set of conjoined twins except This one is most likely Photoshop, because I don't know what's going on here What kind of underwear is this? I mean, it's kind of like the two dudes, so these girls are using it to their advantage Probably selling pics on patreon everyone commenting on their pic do what twerking video? The world's oldest twins are a hundred years old their names are Ken and Jin they're identical twin sisters born in 1892 So after there were a hundred years old they came up with a rap album Wait, I gotta see this. They are the oldest twins Oh my lord this this poor old ladies came out with a rap album Okay, so this is really weird, but I can't find anything about a rap But they're in a game or a show or something, but they're super evil in it I don't know if this comes from Japanese folklore, but apparently they're two evil twins I don't know if their parents named them that as a joke Like kin and jin this is what they're depicted as and it wasn't even based on the old ladies, so this is the thing Kin means gold and jin means silver in Japanese. But anyways that's all for today I hope you guys enjoyed this video comment below Let me know which one of these like absolutely blows your mind and make sure you leave a like and subscribe join the Wolfpack I love you guys so much. Thanks for watching. Bye guys! (outro music) 
whoever it was like dated somebody doesn't realize they're an idiot he was getting his license renewed and they asked him if he wanted to be an organ donor he said no when I asked him why he told me it was because he didn't want the government to come knocking for any of his organs when he still needed them he really thought that becoming an organ donor meant that at any time his organs could be taken yeah that'd be creepy hello FBI they require a spleen please hand over your spleen Oh we'll be forced to arrest you no I still need my spleen hey girlfriend just ask me with the no on the switch

lock driving down the road and the moon is visible during the day her the moon out at the same time as the Sun sometimes that happens it's not that uncommon no they're like the same thing so how can we see Bulls at the same time the Sun in the moon are two different things are you serious yeah I know everybody wants a college like you schoolboy you learned this in second grade she's in her early thirties oh I know this kind of person the kind of person that thinks the earth is flat they also think the Sun and the moon are the same thing like the Sun sets the moon comes up no it's the same thing okay this is when you guys break up I will tell you now being in a relationship with somebody stupid it's not gonna work out unless you're both a little dumb I told my boyfriend I wasn't feeling

speedo backwards looks like Oh pads yeah this is stupid but it's like so funny the real question here bill why are you wearing swim shoes in your basement this is how my wife decided to unpack her new cable she caught it but she cut the wire with it like you could have cut any other direction you could have cut the top off snipped it off I mean I know this packaging is very frustrating this is the packaging of the devil the devil runs a manufacturing company and he puts things in this packaging now you can't get it open and even if you did what's the point you cut the wire I mean this just frustrates me because she could have clearly snipped the top but she didn't we were driving around this weird part of Las Vegas and I said this is surreal he said I know it's so real I repeated surreal and he repeated so real he just keeping it real surreal I mean it works I mean it is so real I was on a hike and I was following a trail I had read up online we get to a fork and I say okay now we need to go north she says haven't we been this whole time confused I looked at her and I asked why she says that she replies North is the direction in front of you right it's still not entirely sure of the origin I feel like some people they were just absent on that day at school where they learned the most basic things you know my husband asked my gynecologist if he was a Texas Longhorn I I'm not gonna lie they look very very similar you're at a gynecologist do you know what a gynecologist does I would be so embarrassed what's the dumbest thing your girlfriend has ever done when she pointed up with that bluish start and sincerely asked is that earth where are you where do you live Earth then that cannot possibly be Earth like what what goes on in your head I am 5-1 I asked my 6-2 husband to hang a mirror for me so he hung it up where he could see it but she cannot see it I only date guys that are over six feet that's what you get maybe he doesn't care about you maybe he hung up the mirror for himself like I want to see how beautiful I look like don't you just need to see your hair I'm my girlfriend eating these Christmas cookies you could have fooled me those look like cookies I mean after taking the first bite you would think these don't taste very good maybe they're not actually cookies you know if a cookie is shaped in a bone is not for humans it is for doggies y'all got gingerbread men and those around cookies with a good-ass frosting not not bones pop are they good though some dude said that woman could not be doctors only nurses he said that the two are the exact same thing except one is male one is female he was in his early 20s so like if a girl is a nurse she's like a doctor but it's like a nurse because the nurse is like a girl version of a doctor right yeah buddy this dude's girlfriend thought the past was black and white like people didn't see colors they only see black and white in the past because we didn't develop like colors yet some dudes wife cut the avocado like this but how do you eat it then who cuts a damn avocado like this you don't kind of like a damn cucumber my friend's husband thought he could microwave his shirt to dry it faster lifehacks yeah when you think you smart but you're really kind of stupid a dryer is for clothes you don't put food in a dryer to heat up do you so you do not put a shirt hit a
