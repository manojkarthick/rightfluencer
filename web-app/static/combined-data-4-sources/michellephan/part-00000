" When are you having kids? " My usual response is  " I don't know. " Truth is  having kids terrifies me. It's not the birthing pain or lack of freedom that frightens me  but raising them in a world full of monsters. I was once naive  thinking that everyone is good at heart  but when you learn about the stories of children who survived the horrors of sex trafficking  you can't even begin to comprehend how someone can harm a child so violently and sexually  but it happens  everyday. 

When you hear stories of children as young as three  raped  you just can't believe it  but it happens. Not only overseas  but it happens in the very backyard of our cities. Besides sex trafficking  which is one of the world's largest industry that no one talks about  sexual abuse happens everywhere. Not only in Hollywood  but at work  school  even in the comforts of home. From my own personal experience  it happens more than you think :/  

I know this sounds pessimistic  but truth be told  now that I'm older and wiser  I'd rather be paranoid and aware than naive and foolish. In my eyes  children are the closest representation of truth in human form. If we live in a world where children are not safe  what does that make of our society? I ask myself  what can I do? How can I contribute to making the world better for children? 

We all have a part in making a difference. I'm using my platform to raise awareness  and donating 100% of EM Cosmetics purchases during Black Friday week to Love146   an international human rights organization that fights child trafficking and exploitation. I know it's not a big deal  but it's a start. In the end  I don't know when I'll have kids  but as idealistic as this may sound  I hope by then  the world is a safer  and better place for children.

[ The children in this video are real survivors of sex trafficking. It's incredible and moving how they are able to dance and find joy after enduring so much pain. They are my inspiration to find strength whenever I'm feeling down. ]

💄 https://www.emcosmetics.com/. Slavery isn't something that happened in the past. Today  it exists under a newer name. Human trafficking. The illegal practice of transporting or trading people for the purpose of prostitution  forced labor  or other forms of exploitation. It is estimated that 27 million people are trafficked  and many are children. It doesn't only happen overseas. Child trafficking and exploitation are reported on a regular basis from law enforcement and social services throughout the country. Sadly  this is the disturbing truth  and the truth is not always pretty. You're probably wondering  how can I help? Well  the first step to ending human trafficking  is to be informed. Be aware that traffickers often recruit and sell online  so please be safe when you're online. Predators are lurking at every corner and children are at risk the most. When I hear stories about children as young as 10 getting raped 15 times a night  I can't help but feel infuriated and helpless. I was empowered after meeting Rob Morris  the founder of Love146   an international human rights organization working to end child trafficking and exploitation through survivor care and prevention. Love146 provides effective solutions and care for survivors  empowering a growing movement. I've been supporting Love146 for years  and starting today till 11/27  100% of profits from purchases made on EM Cosmetics will be donated to Love146. I will also personally match the profits up to $100 000. Products are cruelty free  vegan with free shipping included. Help me end human trafficking. 🙏 Thank you for all your support and much love. ❤️

💄 https://www.emcosmetics.com/. When I open my phone  an overwhelming sense of anxiety hits me.

Do people like me? Am I cool enough? Funny enough? Successful enough? Likable enough? Beautiful enough?

Where does this pressure come from?

Who are we trying to prove?

Others? Or ourselves?

I'd contemplate on this thought  along with a long queue of other unanswered questions.

Why?

Why do I feel this pressure to constantly project an ideal image of a life that I want to portray online?

I ask myself  do I share because I want to connect  or do I share because I want people to see how much better my life is. 

I began to realize  how my excessive need for admiration  came from deep rooted insecurities of wanting to belong  to be accepted  to be loved. 

Was I not loved enough as a child? 

Do our flaws really stem from childhood trauma? 

Or do we choose a lifestyle that drives us towards our impending demise?

Is it a conscious effort  or a subconscious choice?

Are we really in control  or are we controlled by something beyond our comprehension?

I want to believe that we have the ability to change and transform ourselves for the better  but how can we do that when we're constantly bombarded with distractions and excuses  social media being one of them.

This is why I took my break. 

I needed to answer that pending list of unanswered questions for my own sanity.

I needed time to put real work  effort and commitment into healing  re-centering  and loving myself again  because in the end  all roads lead to love.. "NaN". faded clementine.

hi everyone so the holidays here and I know everyone is shopping there trying to find the perfect gift for the perfect person so I decided to make your job a little easier by compiling a list of what I think were the best products 2015 I was not paid or sponsored to recommend anything at all there's going to be a list of all of the topics and genres that we have right here and you can click on each one it'll take you straight to that spot where you can learn about each product recommendation in that category okay let's get started you're at a drugstore budget but you're looking for quality lipsticks have you guys checked out wet and wild they're lipstick range is pretty impressive the color payoff is beautiful it's two dollars I mean come on that's super affordable that's cheaper than a Starbucks coffee you can get a pretty decent lipstick for two dollars they're pretty timeless a lot of great nudes and dark colors and rich Reds so if you're looking for a really great lipstick line that you can experiment with wet and wild is definitely on the recommended list just because you're on a drugstore budget does not mean you can't find a really good concealer so la girl they make probably one of the best Pro concealers on the market in drugstores and they come in a wide variety of different colors from different flesh tone colors to even more Pro colors like purple green different color bases that can help enhance the undertone but you can also get a little creative and make it a little more multifunctional by using it as contour I think this is like three bucks each three four dollars taxes I don't know roughly like five good concealer at a great price point la girl color pop is winning with their super shock shadow it's not like your traditional eyeshadow where it's powder based this is a different type of formulation so if you do have a color pop product just a super shock shadow you have to make sure to really close it in tight seal it in because if you leave it open it's going to dry out really fast and the matte coolness is going to disappear you apply it with your fingers instead you load it up with your fingers and you Pat it on and it just it's a great way to build your eye shadow without dealing with fall outs without dealing with like over blending so if you're trying to find a really great eyeshadow palette or product for your loved one or maybe you're looking for some yourself don't pass up on color pop check out their site and see if there's any sales that are happening because they do they are very generous with their sales so if you're looking for Mac quality Mac / makeup for ever quality but at a lower price point you should definitely check out makeup geek it's very very affordable it's beautiful colors blend ability is just incredible very rich and creamy and when you swatch everything you can just see the quality of the swatches it's really great and then she sells them individually so you get them like this but you can also get a Z palette throw it up on here and build your own kit she also has these beautiful duochrome pigments that are a little more expensive they're roughly six dollars each but wow they're really intense it's beautiful her duochrome is just exceptional great pigments at an amazing price makeup geek NYX whipped wet day hope I said that right wait a they make this great product that is a multi-purpose pigment / stain that you can add on your lips on your cheeks and it has great blend ability it's pretty intense at first when you lay it down but as you blend it finishes off with this very diffused soft second skin look this is just a great product to just toss into your bag and no fuss no muss really easy and also really inexpensive to use - sorry I tried juggling but it's kind of hard to do it while you're trying to pay attention to the camera so my holy grail blender is obviously the Beautyblender I love it I use it for everything I use the menu on the big one but I know that it can be a little pricey this is $20 so real techniques they launched their own version of a sponge this one is a teardrop shape on one side but if you flip it it's a flat end so it's great for like under-eye or if you want to get like around your neck area or in the crevices but then you can flip it on the teardrop side to get into all the nooks and crannies this however is $6 this is $20 I think Milani is Italian it sounds Italian I knew it see Italians are known for making some of the most refined most beautiful color pigments don't judge by this because this has been dropped a few times so obviously it broke just a bit but I wanted to show you how it looks so it's a big dome shaped blush you just need a little little goes a long way tap it with your brush tap off the excess and just dust it over your cheeks and you have a nice glow Oh Holy Grail for a few bucks when it comes to foundation I know most people prefer a true matte foundation finish because it just looks better when you photograph with it if you're looking for a really good product l'oreal infallible Pro matte so this is what it looks like and I actually think it's a cheaper version of the Armani face fabric foundation because the texture is pretty similar you can see right away I used a lot sorry but you can see how it has more of a matte finish if it's a little too matte for you you can actually water it down with an illuminator a highlighter and you can just break it down a bit apply it on your face board a semi matte dewy finish morphe brushes they win this year they have so many brushes you can choose from all shapes all sizes and most importantly they are well-made quality is exceptional it feels really good on the skin and you can get synthetic brushes you can get real animal hair if you want and there's also different levels of brushes so there's like beginners brushes and then the pro brush line they're also made here in the US burbank so support your local economy yay so if you're a huge brush junkie morphe brushes are amazing anastasia makes some of the best eyebrow products out there so one of the products that took the world by storm is their dip brow pomade it comes in a really nice glass jar like this and you need an angled brush or a liner brush and you just use just a little it has like a pomade cream texture but once you apply it on your brows you can really feather it out and build a beautiful new brow shape if you're looking for a really good liquid lipstick that's not drying that has non basic colors look no further than Jeffrey star he definitely makes more like statement colors but if you want to get colors that are more neutral everyday colors he has them too so look no further than Jeffrey star and also I'm a huge supporter of the beauty community I like supporting the small people the people who are just starting their business the more you support these people the more jobs they can offer for others I know this is going to sound really biased but I wouldn't say this if I didn't believe it it's the M cosmetics waterproof mascara is the bomb it's so good and it really does work I have Asian lashes so my lashes grow straight down they're super thin so I need something that's more waterproof based because it has more wax in it so it can help hold the curl the magic of em's waterproof mascara was actually not just in the formulation but the brush too so we made sure that we had to pair a really good brush head with a great formulation because if you have a really good formula but a bad brush it's not going to do well if you're looking for a really good waterproof mascara and it is going to run out soon because I'm not going to reformulate this again I'm basically starting the entire makeup line from the ground up so you get it while it's gonna last because I have at least well I don't have anyone on me right now I should get some before I run huh I'm going to have to agree that scribble the liquid liner that I made is still the best liquid liner that I've used it took two years to formulate this and the reason why it took so long was because I wanted to find a best brush maker that can make a very specific type of brush tip that can help the user create the thinnest lines and the thickest line in one sweep my favorite color has to be tattoo black and black coffee just because when it dries it's a true matte color so it looks great in photos I recommend checking out em cosmetics comm before they're all gone because I'm not going to reformulate this either Mac historically has been known for making some of the most coveted lip liners one is called spice this color even I knew about this color name when I was 12 years old and I was reading these magazines and how it was always sold out and I think it's still sold out so when it comes to lip liners they don't mess around they don't play I didn't go too crazy with some of the luck stuff yes price point does matter but it's really like how we're fine the quality is the ingredients and the packaging and just it feels luxurious so the first one that we're going to start off with is drew a their kitten liner paraben free felt tip liquid liner is it's divine it's really beautiful it has a lot of flexibility so you can build very even lines if you wanted to and you can go like really thin to thick lines this is great if you want easy simple perfect cat liner so the finish is more satin than matte which if you're looking for more of a matte finish I recommend looking elsewhere but I kind of like how there finish is because it looks really luxurious it has like a really nice beautiful Sheen to it juhi again you win you are a great brand because you really know how to make great products I love their highlighting pack first off let's let's just take a moment and appreciate how much thought they put into their packaging you can connect them together and you can pull them apart you need to three different highlighters one is this pearlescent opalescence shimmer that's great for people with cooler undertones you have another color that's more like a champagne gold so anyone with a warmer undertone in the last was my favorite because it's rose gold I love rose gold and rose gold looks great on everyone neutral tones cool and warm it's a beautiful romantic color and if you also want to do true strobing this is a great product so a great highlighter Pak Joey obviously the most used eyebrow pencil this year that I've personally used myself is by it cosmetics this is their Universal brow pencil the color is universal taupe and I think I've answered this a few times people always ask me if you are stuck on an island what three makeup products would you bring on you I'd rather have GPS Superman and food but in this case if makeup was the only thing I needed I would have a really good taupe someone with blonde hair and someone with dark hair like myself can both wear this brow pencil at ease NARS makes this great creamy concealer so the radiant creamy concealer it is what it is it has a brightening effect and it's creamy and when it dries it has a more natural skin texture so not dewy and not matte so it's great to use alone or if you want to apply powder on top of it you can build and you can layer on top you want to splurge on a really good concealer check out NARS try it out at Sephora or wherever you can try out NARS products and you'll see why it's celebrated when it comes to powders I personally think Laura Mercier makes some of the most beautiful powder finishes the formula is so amazing I mean it's really hard to find a loose powder that can compare to Laura Mercier's I like to apply it with a stippling brush because it's so fine that you don't really need that much just tap it off with it lightly brush it on your face like so just dabbing it on it feels really nice it's it's almost like powdered silk which is why I like it so much so if you're looking for a really good loose powder that you want to splurge on Laura Mercier has your back so there's loose powder and then there's powder that you can use as foundation you can double up as foundation it cosmetics made a really great foundation powder called celebration foundation this is what it looks like you use a brush if you want to lightly dust the product on your face but you want to use a sponge if you want to layer it on a bit more and pack it on the texture is really lightweight it has a nice beautiful true matte finish and it doesn't feel drying which is why I like it so much so it cosmetics they make great products and their celebration foundation is by far one of the most well-received product in their line if you're not a huge fan of powder foundation because maybe have dry skin like myself you should actually check out their celebration foundation illumination which is a sub line of this line that has this product in there that actually helps illuminate the skin so when you buff it on your skin you start seeing this beautiful glow so if you're not really into that dry matte look check out the other one it actually took me some time to find a really good neutral palette because there's so many right now in the market but there's no one on the market like Tarte I do know that Tarte cosmetics is cruelty free like they really do pay attention to texture and product finishes so what I love most about this Tarte lip palette is that the powder doesn't feel like powder it really does feel like clay so if I'm like taking a brush and I'm dusting it the fallouts are really minimal and it's really fine price point is a little high but I think it's worth it because you're going to be using this practically every day I apologize because I am NOT Korean so I might butcher this name but I'm not going to butcher how amazing this is because this is by far my favorite cushion compact product it's by this brand called subha soup soup soup sOooo soup when you look at it I mean I'm gonna be real with you it's kind of like old lady ish looking but the reason why it's because this brand is made for an older demographic women have a little more money and they can splurge on quality product it has such a beautiful coverage you can really build there's SPF that's built in you can Pat this on and then apply a little bit of loose powder and you have a beautiful natural finish so if you are cushion compact crazy and you want to find your Holy Grail cushion compact this brand by far is my favorite out of all of the cushion compact that I've used amorepacific co-pays Jerez believe me I love all those products but I think this one is by far the best one if you're having a lot of problems with your pores and it's clogged instead of using the tried-and-true method of ripping it off with some tape or paper mache you can actually try out this really cool brand called skin me so so this is the pore beauty nose pack and I found this on Amazon I bought it on a whim even though everything was in Korean because they had really good reviews you take this soaked cotton pad and you put it on your nose and you wait 10 minutes and what it does that it preps your skin and it's and there's a chemical in there that pushes all of the blackheads and all that gunk onto the surface you take it and you scrape all of the whiteheads and blackheads off and it comes right off really easily without having to rip anything off and the second step is this witch hazel extract where you put this on for another 10 minutes and it relieves and smoothes your skin if you're looking for a really good on face mask camera lab makes my favorite so there's different ones you can get this one is for hydrating the skin this one is for brightening the skin this one helps with any blemishes this was recommended by one of the rice bunny team members she swears by this so it's a two-step process the first step is wetting your face and applying this on like a moisturizer and really working it into the skin lathering it in and the second step is using another dollop scrubbing it just getting all of that dirt all that layer off and then rinsing it off and your skin is apparently supposed to feel brand spanking new another product recommended by one of my rice bunny team members is this one called alpha hydroxy I've used this myself and it's actually really good it's a great moisturizer if you're looking for something that's really simple and lightweight no fuss you know it just gets the job done it moisturizes your skin I like to take it between my fingers and rub it down and then just Pat on my skin and it's only seven dollars on Amazon come on guys peach and lily curates some of the top selling products in Korea that you really can't find in any other stores so they recommended this as a top seller it's by far my favorite or refining mask you just need a little bit it's pretty substantial too you need like a small amount and just apply it on you on your nose unless you want to apply it on your entire face you weight roughly like five ten minutes and then rinse it off and your pores I don't know what's in here I don't know if it's like unicorn boogers or something but it really works and it's amazing Avene Siegel fate interesting name but the product itself is simply divine this brand sent me a bunch of other things something told me to open the box and I opened it and I read a few pages on there PR stuff and this brand can actually rebuild your skin's barrier and I thought that was a little gimmicky but I tried it out of my hands and the next day my hands were so soft and supple I hadn't seen it like that in a while because everything that's been so dry and dead out here so if you're looking for a moisturizer that is ultra hydrating but it doesn't feel heavy look no further great product okay you guys know how much I love this brand this is by Egyptian magic this is their secret magical cream it's an all-purpose cream that has I think like 13 ingredients only 13 or 33 how many yeah I think like 13 ingredients it just looks like really thick pomade wax the magic comes when you rub down the product between your hands and it becomes all oily so you need a little bit of heat and this works as like a simple pomade I can break it down and use it as lotion which is what I'm doing right here two great all-purpose balm if you're looking for a non basic way to wash your face if you tend to have like very sensitive skin and you're looking for a more gentle alternative you should check out aromatic up you get a little scooper that way it's clean and you don't contaminate the product itself and this is what it looks like you have to put it on your face and work it into the skin so it starts breaking down the makeup so if you're wearing like a lot of makeup theatrical makeup if you need something that removes everything off your face without stripping your skin of its natural moisture this brand is incredible I love it they have great stuff and this is a great cleanser to tatcha makes perhaps the best skin mist I've ever used so their dewy skin mist is great to use if you want to refresh your skin you can also use it as a primer to prep your skin first and once you apply makeup on top of it your skin really does look limits it doesn't spray like your normal skin skin sprays or skin fixture it's really really thin but before you use it you have to shake first and then spray so you hold it roughly around 10 inches 12 inches away from your face close your eyes okay speaking of tacha I love tatcha and I also love their cleansing oil I think by far they make one of the best cleansing oils it's so lightweight it's not like a heavy oil that feels oily and slippery it's a very beautiful silky formulation it really does clean everything off your face and it leaves your skin feeling really supple and hydrated skin eek makes this really unique product that gently removes dullness and dead skin off your face without having to scrub any micro beads or exfoliant it uses a chemical exfoliation that is pretty gentle it doesn't sting your skin it doesn't feel irritating at all and once you're rubbing it in it really does collect all the dead skin all over your face wherever you have this product and once you rinse it off your skin feels like a baby spot it's amazing first time I used the touch of sunscreen I knew right away this is going to be my official new sunscreen it doesn't feel like a sunscreen it feels like silk it smells so nice it doesn't smell like a sunscreen it doesn't feel sticky when you apply it on your skin it's amazing and I feel like my skin actually looks better after I apply the sunscreen on so it kind of works like a primer at the same time so I recommend it for any of you sunscreen junkies or for anyone that you're buying it for we're going to start with sinful colors because when you're normally buying something that's mass a lot of times you want to do at least two coats but what I love about simple colors is that you can actually layer the colors so it's great if you want to do like a nail cocktail you want to like throw on a blue but then put a red on top of it to turn it purple so it's great if you want to be all painterly about it and it's affordable I've seen this on practically every nail guru on YouTube and on Instagram this is whereby this um some people call it fish beat beat I'm the worst when it comes to pronouncing anything but I can tell you that it is a great fast drying top coat within a few seconds it's dry just make sure when you close it like you close it all away don't leave it a little open because it will dry really fast and it's going to be really hard to open it so that's the only downside to this product even though I think it's amazing overall not everyone has money to get gel nails or maybe they can't get the at-home kit however you can still get something close to a gel like formula without the UV light and this is actually made by Sally Hansen no lamp no light required you just paint this on like normal nail polish and you add your topcoat and voila you have gel like nails I don't think it's exactly like traditional gel nails but it's it's pretty close and it does last longer than normal nail polishes trust-fund Beauty makes great nail polishes they're vegan they're cruelty free a great indie brand and their names are hilarious like one is called beverly thrills another is like rich bitch another tried and true luxury nail polish brand that i go crazy over is deborah lippmann the packaging itself is art beautiful it looks substantial it feels substantial and most importantly the paint formula is beautiful she is like great top coat cuticle oil the whole shebang Deborah Lippmann you make great nail polishes thank you for that I really appreciate it when it comes to oils you want to try and find really good essential oils there's great lavender oils out there in the market also tea tree oil is a great oil to use if you have any blemishes on your skin or your skin in general just feels really fatigue if you dab a little bit of tea tree oil on it your skin will just instantly wake up it's a great natural product that you can use that is readily available and the invest in really good quality oils a little goes a long way coconut oil has so many uses this one is by Vita Coco but there's a lot of other great coconut oils that you can buy I'm not just recommending this I'm just recommending organic coconut oil in general with coconut oil you can add this to your beauty regimen you can add like a teaspoon of it and your coffee instead of Kraemer it's a healthier option and there's so many different ways to use coconut oil if you have a great coconut foundation you can pretty much do whatever besides coconut manuka honey is another cult favorite of mine I don't use it just for the taste I also use it for medicinal purposes so if I have a sore throat or I feel like I'm bout to get a cold I try my best to avoid any medication and pills and over-the-counter stuff because I really want my body to activate its

you hey everyone I have here an edgy look for you to try out have your face foundation ready and let's go because this look is so I heavy fill-in and shape or brows first your brows are the frames to your eyes for this look I recommend keeping your brows skinnier with a higher arch you want to find a brow pencil that has a wax base so that when you fill them in the wax will lay the hairs down so that they don't stick up just create little strokes and watch your brows magically come to life try and use a spoolie to blend out the marks to help soften the look so that your brows don't look as if they're drawn on but for some of you who don't need to fill in your brows well aren't you lucky using here in my New York City Smokies palette or just find any silver smokey eyeshadow palette apply a shimmering pale peach color on your lids the trick to using silver eyeshadow is to make sure your base is warm silver can make your eyes look a little bit too cold like steel so warm it up with a soft color now select the metallic medium gray color and using a small brush create an edge by following the natural line of your eye dabbing the brush along the way and once you have the cat eye shape fill in only the outer corner of your eyes leaving the rest of your eye clean okay so now that you have your Vixen cat eyes in place let's break out your liquid liner I'm using here my new scribble liquid liner that just launched in tattoo black I decided to name it scribble because you can create thin and thick lines with a flick of the brush if you want to find the perfect liquid liner look for a brush that's flexible and can give you the greatest control the formula has to be smooth you should be able to create the perfect line with ease no skipping or dragging is so draw your line so that it contours with the cat eye and if you want to go a little more injection on this look because it's so popular draw another thin line under the first one for that exotic look take your time when you're creating your dual lines we all know that liquid liner is not the most forgiving beauty product but once you've mastered the line you can create endless looks alright just curl your lashes and give them a few good squeezes your lashes are supposed to look curled not crimped and from here just apply a clean lash lengthening mascara I would avoid dramatic lashes since this look is all about the eyeliner and if you want to balance out your eyes just apply mascara on your lower lashes of course I'm using here my favorite water liner in rose gold I'm going to apply this along the inner corners of my eyes and waterline to help brighten them up and because I'm feeling a little fancy I'm going to add silver lining inside the empty eyeliner space and if you're feeling ambitious create a very very thin outline along the cat eye shape this is going to give you a fun graphic look from here just contour into your thing because this look is so sharp and edgy I want my nose to look a little more defined for that outer worldly I look create this little line along the inner corner of your eyes and just blend that bottom lashline out for a smokier look we're almost done sculpting your cheeks with a bronzer load up your brush and locate the natural shadows where your cheekbones are and accentuate the shadow by shading the bronzer around here to help bring back that romantic finish add a touch of pink blush on your cheeks and then just finish off your look with a berry matte lip color this is a gorgeous color to try out for spring voila we're finished now it's time for some awkward Posey if you're wondering how I created the smoke hairspray and some accidentally cut on my face oh the things we do for beauty have fun and good luck it's giveaway time I'll be giving away three full sets of my scribble liquid liners tattoo black coffee black snow gunmetal edge Black Forest Navy script silver lining and bronze script and here's how to enter you have to be subscribed to my channel and like this video and just comment below telling me what make a product you would like for me to create next three winners will be selected and this giveaway is opened worldwide good luck and I love you

doesn't matter if you slept five hours or eight waking up is never easy so what's the first thing you do when you wake up do you check your phone to see if you still have time to snooze in yeah or are you like me and you like to chill in bed to go online even if you're in a hurry you should always take care of your skin before you worry about makeup gently cleanse your skin and apply a light moisturizer then apply makeup like you normally would for high schoolers when it comes to makeup keep it simple and fresh you have your entire life ahead of you to experiment with try and enjoy your natural youthful Beauty that you're already blessed with if you have amazing eyebrows bring out your eyes if you have beautiful lips wear a gloss and if you have gorgeous skin add blush to your cheeks enhance your natural beauty the working world is not as forgiving as high school in college it's definitely a different level of stress Master your time by having your 5-minute makeup routine on lockdown when you look good you feel good however if you prefer to freestyle at least try to have a general idea or style for your look at school everyone wants to show off on the first day but try to pick out something you're going to feel comfortable in all day like a loose tea or a flowy skirt and some chucks if you feel comfortable you're going to look comfortable here's a tip from someone who's done with high school if you want to be cool just don't try too hard try to layer on pieces so that you can easily take them off in a heated classroom or pile it on when the a/c is on full blast like at the library and if you're not at school you need to make sure your space is inspiring especially when your work revolves around being creative one of the easiest ways to be expressive at school is with your backpack you can customize it to your style in college it feels like you spend most of your school life on a computer so why not personalize your laptop all you need is a clear laptop case and an instant camera for photos using your favorite photos place them in the cover with double-sided tape if you're in a lecture hall filled with a sea of nameless students it helps to put your name on the front of your laptop so that the professor learns your name faster than anyone else when you're stuck in a cubicle with florescent lights and it feels like you're in a dungeon try to place things around you so that you can stimulate your five senses try to include a candle for smell healthy snacks for taste a stress fall for touch and a speaker or headphones for sound there's nothing that's going to jumpstart creativity like having a visual representation of your aesthetic whether you're in high school college or beyond the path to success starts when you get up and go so of course good luck special thanks to Natalie and crispy for the collaboration you 
imagine just waking up one day and becoming the number one meme where people make fun of you because of your acne she woke up to this and I figured our topic today would be about cyberbullying confidence and dealing with acne who better to have as a guest than Ashley then kept in touch thank you so much for being here and welcome thanks for having me so the first question is from Stephanie Williams have you ever been cyber bullied if so how do you cope with cyber bullies if not how would you deal with them so at first I didn't pay attention to the comments I was getting negative or positive I just won't look at them because I feel like if I did try to look at the positive ones I would see the negative anyways yeah and so I just didn't look at it at all and that's kind of how I coped with it but then after I got tagged in the photo and I was getting a bunch of notifications on my phone a day yeah like it's like buzzing yeah blowing up like out of control and you can see I mean when you do get a notification you see the preview and so I would see just the beginning of the negative or positive but obviously the negative ones are gonna stick out more negative words you know yeah ugly words like that that you your eyes are like attracted to especially when I do know that that picture is posted and I do know that people are being negative about it so like I feel like that negative words are just like shooting out at me I was just like you know what like I want people to know that they're like hurting real people like not just me but like everyone else and so that's why I made the video when people are being so negative it's like they're almost like they're talking to a cartoon or like someone should yeah yeah like I'm real like you don't think memes are real and tell you're a meme people online are very honest they see this as an opportunity to just vent and purge out all of their pent up feelings that they have inside and sometimes when you connect with people even in real life you come across people who are not really nice who might not like you and you also come across people who changes your life and they become your best friend so in a sense it's part of life too so I'm moving on to the next question we have here from Sarah she asked any advice to YouTube beginners on how to deal with cyberbullying you've practice yourself and that has worked for you the Internet is a reflection of society and you get everything you get great stuff you get terrible things it's all about how you filter out all the things that you see have that disclaimer in your head that built-in cancel later to just quiet everything so that you can focus on your true calling what you need to do what you need to get done your talent your gifts like positive things just continue to surround yourself with positivity because if you're going to always listen to the noise pollution to the cyber bullies you're never going to give yourself time to focus on building that relationship with the people who really love you just take all that negative energy that people are projecting onto you and turn it into something positive and that's what I loved about what you did is that you started a campaign called cure the hate right so I started this campaign called cure the hate and it's just about like acne shaming and I wanted to deal with my cyberbullying by starting this campaign so that other people could be like motivated to you know maybe hopefully stop cyberbullying how do you define acne shaming today especially with social media um I just feel like no one feels confident like in their bare skin anymore I feel like acne shaming is just shaming people if they have acne like even if you know you cover up your acne with makeup like for instance I cover up my acne with makeup and people still shame me for having acne cuz you know we're dealing you can see from an anonymous person how do you help a friend or younger sibling who is being cyber bullied I have three younger siblings and I was terrified that they were gonna get like bully because of me also like because people you know know who I am and we live in a small town everyone knows everyone so it's like they have said stuff to me like my friend saw you and I just feel like I'm like embarrassed for them because of me like I just try to laugh it off like oh my friend saw your pic you know what I mean I just showed like oh yeah like did she you know big did she what they say about it you know and if they did say oh negative things they made funny I just like well you know that's okay like songs are not making fun of you or as long as I'm stronger you're the be stronger one older and I feel bad that they have to go through high school and stuff and like they might have to deal with that in the future it's like a scary thought I just want you know me to be brave for them and I don't want them to have to if they ever had to go through something like that they could look to me like you know you will went through it yeah so that's good yeah you're like such a good big sister thank you what are some resources that can help me with being cyber bullied what are some resources that you went through when all of this ordeal was happening to you um I actually am partnered with a Tyler Clementi Foundation it's like a pledge where you can sign a agreement to sign against cyber bullying with them I'm in college and I'm still battling acne how can I stay confident in myself when I'm ashamed of my adult acne okay so that's like exactly what I'm going through because in high school I didn't have acne at all I mean like of course just like a couple blemishes but not like anything compared to what I have today and my mom always tells me like she feels so bad you know like I don't you know like you should not have acne at your age and stuff and I'm like I know honestly I'm kind of lucky I didn't have to deal with it in high school because I feel like that's where you're more judged and stuff as an adult you do get judged more but like in college people are way more chill and just like understanding and more free-spirited not so like catty and yeah and just like judgmental toward people like in high school so I just feel fit I don't know I put on makeup everyday to hide it I mean I'll go places without makeup but that's like to the store and stuff and I just try to say confident and I just like you know what who cares you know I have acne it could be so much worse I try to think I'm lucky compared to other people you know what I mean like people are done with stuff way more serious and acne just asked me like first world problems yeah like it'll go away like some people don't have anything yeah yeah like yeah it's embarrassing like of course but if you really feel self-conscious you can always put on makeup you if you don't want to put on makeup then just I don't know I would just try to I try to be just confident in knowing that you know this is the one negative thing I have to go through today then oh wow when you what's the first thing you say to yourself to boost your confidence that's a really good question I mean I can't think of one thing I say but there is something that kind of loops in the back of my mind all the time it's that I have very little time to accomplish what I really want to accomplish in life and that's the biggest motivator for me in life is that time is limited tomorrow's not promised but today is and what I can do today can affect tomorrow and build a better promise tomorrow for me I just I don't know I I tried no no I like that your boss says they just say it out loud you guys gone here you could do all that I was gonna say believe it honestly what I think that I'm a boss Hospice yeah no but really no when I need to be confident I just think of like I'm being confident for my family and my little sisters honestly that's a boost of confidence for me just um I know like you know a lot of people saw my story and I hope that they see that I'm confident today even though I do still have acne and I am still dealing with acne I just try to stay confident for like other people more than myself Michelle my fears often get the best of me when achieving my goals how do I block that out to stay confident and focus on what's important have a hobby on the side that has nothing to do with your job your work your school something you do on the side outside of this world that you have that you live in that brings you closer to your higher state of self so if painting brings you closer to there and even if you're not good at painting just do it on the side for fun so that you have something that's positive that shows that even if you're not good at it you're doing it because you love it it's part of your expression yeah I was just gonna say obviously fears like everyone's blockage of doing what they want to do but once you get through that it's like I don't know it's like a different world like once you break through your fear you're fearful it's freedom if you guys want more information on cure the hate visit my link below thanks for having me I need a thank you thank you you 
hey guys welcome back to mastering art up and today we're going to talk about you guessed it Christian compact everything you need to know about which is the best cushion to look for the best color for your skin type and the best techniques have fun and of course good luck don't worry if you're new to cushion compacts here's a quick one on one they originated from Korea and normally they provide a light weight share coverage the packaging as you can see here is bulkier than your average compact because it has to create an airtight seal to keep your cushion fresh if you look inside you'll find an applicator which is usually a dense antibacterial circular sponge like this in a porous sponge that's soaked in foundation BB or CC cream here's my favorite pro tip just like how you're flipping the mattress to turn the bed flip the sponge when the product starts to run low it's kind of like go on up for the sponge the application is pretty universal all you have to do is load the applicator sponge and start blotting onto the skin and small even pads choosing the right cushion compact all comes down to selecting the right finish and coverage for your skin tone and type if you have fair skin then you know the struggle of finding product that matches your complexion when I say fair I mean skin that is paler than a ghost so pale that your face is naturally blown out in flash photos but it's all good because those of you with fair skin have a decent range of brands to choose from many of my favorites are from South Korea if you have a light to medium tan skin tone you have a lot of options to play with a lot of the Korean brands will carry only a few shades that generally fall in the light to medium skin tones here are some of my favorite brands to check out because cushion compact is relatively new in face makeup unfortunately shade range is limited but there are brands who carry shades for deeper tones cushions are also available in color correction shades yellow helps with discoloration purple combats dullness peach brightens dark circles and green neutralizes redness now we can move on to recommendations for different skin types when selecting the cushion compact for dry skin instead of finding one that is foundation based look for one that is BB or CC cream based for application use a good moisturizer and hydrating primer you can even spray a moisturizing toner on your application sponge before applying in order to keep your skin hydrated and the foundation from settling into fine lines from here just continue building your desired coverage by adding thin layers I recommend pressing and lifting like this to avoid streaks and dry patches here are some of my picks for dry skin when it comes to selecting a cushion compact for combination skin you have a wider range to choose from since you can tolerate compacts for dry and oily skin for application start by applying your cushion compact around your jawline and cheeks building coverage as you go from there dab around the t-zone area with a Beauty Blender in order to avoid buildup and once you're done immediately set this area with powder for a flawless finish here are some brands that you can try out for combination skin if you have oily skin be aware that cushion compacts are not the best choice because of their dewy finishes no worries though there are cushion compacts for you just try and find one that has a mattifying or satin finish stay away from the ones with hydrating benefits and look for one that has a lightweight formula when it comes to application start by using your favorite mattifying primer something like milk of magnesia that will soak up the oil on your t-zone and keep you matte throughout the day after building your desired coverage finish off with a mattifying spray and apply translucent or mattifying powder to keep your skin looking fresh here are my recommendations for oily skin both acne in mature skin are grouped together here because both types require extra attention the trick is to keep your skin balanced you want to look for cushion compacts with added skin care benefits and stay away from heavy formulas with harsher ingredients for application start with a primer to help smooth out fine lines or blemishes from here you can apply with a damp sponge to avoid excess product and fine lines be sure that you're applying in thin layers because most of the formulas are sheer you may have to touch up with a spot concealer on blemished areas once you're done with the application finish off with a hydrating setting mist and here are some brand recommendations oh and special thanks to everyone who was in this video who decided to show up and show their face without makeup lending me their beautiful faces you can follow them on their social which I will add right here and here and here and here thank you so much for watching this video guys I hope it inspired you to find your best cushion compact and I'll see you on the next one love you guys bye you 
yeah we are the misfits we're just crazy kids summer is right around the corner and I know a lot of you are going to be traveling to some amazing new places so I'm going to show you how I pack for my weekend bag I like to couple my toothbrush with a brush protector to keep it clean that's right don't forget to floss here's a toothpaste brand that I really love and no I was not paid to promote this it's just really hard to find a toothpaste that is alcohol sulfite and fluoride free also don't forget to pack your breath spray something else I like to bring along is this exfoliating pad that helps prevent ingrown hairs while softening the legs think of it like a buffer for your legs oh and how cute is this stumpy little razor very easy to travel with I use these to thoroughly remove my eye makeup just dip it in a little bit of makeup remover and that's enough to remove any stubborn leftover eye makeup if you can stay awake and brush your teeth before you sleep you can definitely use these wipes to clean your face at the same time no more excuses for sleeping in with your makeup another product I like to throw into my bag is a sleeping pack this concept was developed in Korea sleeping pack or sleeping mask is a product that add a hydrating layer on your skin locking moisture in so that when you wake up your skin is supple and fresh this is by far my favorite all-purpose skin cream you can use it as a body lotion makeup remover one time I even used it in my hair in place of pomade I always have this little guy in my bag a hydrating mist if you're flying often times your skin will feel dry because of the recycled air using a hydrating this will help alleviate this if you prefer skipping hair washing every other day bring your dry shampoo this will keep your hair fresh so here's my travel friendly brush it's a small palm sized brush that has a cover to protect the bristles bring along a hydrating or calming face mask and throw this baby on before you sleep if you want to travel with less liquids because of the crazy TSA rules pack in a stick moisturizer instead this one has a nice cooling effect and it doesn't leave your face feeling all sticky you know how much I love my air cushion I obey makes one of my favorite ones this one in particular has a high SPF so I can reapply my on screen while touching up my makeup throughout the day I'll bring a silk pillow slip to help prevent creasing on my face plus it feels extra soft and luxurious my phone always seems to be permanently dying because I'm always on it this bad boy here will give my phone 10 charges seriously it's a beast can't forget our Sunny's or you're transforming brooch or amine headphones and if you want to capture your favorite memories the old-school way bring your instant camera all right time to back watch me fit everything in this medium sized cat bag the key to staying organized is to have a place for everything I like having different bags for everything I'm carrying so that you can just reach in and pull out whatever you need in hurry oh don't forget your wallet mine here is this sunny side egg' if you're spending long hours on the plane avoid jetlag and tired eyes by losing soothing eye masks after ten minutes I'll reuse these guys on my brows my cheeks and nasolabial folds yay happy skin carry less fluids and use a stick moisturizer on the plane it's easier and less messy and then Pat your skin to let the product absorb they say less is more in this case add a bit of concealer under the eyes around the mouth and forehead and then apply CC cream to even out the rest one of the many reasons why I love air-cushion is because of the sponge they provide it's so good sometimes I'll actually use the sponge more than the product because it blends everything out so well find the golden ratio for your brows by measuring it out like so well I can't really vouch if this is the most accurate way however I can say that your brow shape will drastically improve when you measure it out like so once you've mapped out your brows fill them in to redefine the shape let's move on to eyeliner instead of black try a different color even if it's subtle like a dark navy this will accentuate your eye color create a subtle wing using a creamy eyeliner it's easier to be more precise if you start with the edge of the wing like this and slowly work up the thickness of the line wait when you're done with the shape tight line your upper and inner waterline to punctuate the shape of your eyes and create an illusion of a fuller lash line to prep your lashes for mascara give them a good lift with an eyelash curler add a coat of volumizing mascara to thicken them up and then apply fake lashes for myself I prefer natural looking lashes because the heavier ones tend to weigh my eyes down however everyone has different eye shapes so my eyes will look better with heavier lashes and vice versa so experiment with different lash types until you find the right one that suits your eyes create more depth to your face by lightly contouring focus on the hollows of your cheeks your temples and your neckline this will give you a beautiful glow and of course don't forget to show your hair some love finish it up with a leave-in cream and then to style it in place to feather proof your lip color use a clear lip liner because it's colorless you can't really mess up here outline your lips and then using lip brush add a bold lip color lining the edges and then filling in your lips if you're good at coloring and staying within the lines and this will be a piece of cake for extra glamour top it off with a pigmented gloss hope this inspires the one or lust inside of you happy travels and of course good luck you

it's fine I'll give it to him he is really funny I tried to let this team off I tried because like I said I she's she has all these responsibilities and everything so when she comes home we're trying to to make her laugh and crack a joke you in there and like I think I developed ABS because all I read too is is laugh around anything it buy some fun stuff like those unicorn slippers and stuff like that that's me me in the first-level I did was in Paris I did the first move which is shocking because he's an out of Clerk I tried to help her and that's when we first got into contact and no stayed in contact ever since that was me mm-hmm who said I love you first I think it was me I think it was me but but it was kind of awkward yep I don't I don't think all right I never asked actually if you remember me saying it for the first time who is the better driver mm when comes to technique I would say me because um in Switzerland we have a very good driver licence process I mean it's really tough it's too expensive but it's it prepares you very well for for for the road I get there faster to me that's better doesn't matter who I endanger and him skidding I guess I mean if you take in the fact that I also drive a motorcycle you know never mind maybe he's a better driver than me maybe I'm just in denial I think he's a better driver because I forgot he he knows how to ride a bike a motorcycle I mean mm-hmm so you know what he's a better driver I'm so sorry I doubted you Don I'm so sorry I doubted you let's show the reflection more I do and that's I don't know it's probably my mind like I said my talent side it's very showing I'm always touching her just letting me know I'm around her when I'm in the same room she doesn't care about public display of affection he will go up industry to kiss me I like that and it's a way to show my love and in a sweet and delicate way of actually when he did that I was really shocked because I didn't expect that from him so I was I was really really shy because he did that it was kind of nice to know that he is not scared to show his feelings it's just for her to know Tom you who has a figure I have a very small appetite um but she doesn't need that much heater I have a bigger appetite hey I may not look it but I can eat it pretty much the same I would say I would say it's 50/50 I eat his leftovers he knows his answer depends depends for what he does hands down he takes the longest to get ready he takes like an hour 45 minutes all my friends know that hey Michelle event is at 6 o'clock I'll pull down like a 4 o'clock Michelle is very fast though she's just like she can shower in less than 5 minutes being ready like it's crazy I've never seen that she's actually very very fast I'll tell him that the event is at 7 even though it's at 8 just so that he can get ready earlier like he takes his time when he gets ready like he's like lint roll in every single inch of his body I think more time because I'm very like I said I'm a neat freak so everything I use everything I do I have to put it back at its place and really like make sure there's no mess actually he's more stubborn hands down more stubborn than iron stubborn hands down probably Michelle he's got like horns on the key is hard-headed but it's true like sometimes she's a little bit stubborn and I try to I try to dilute that if she really wants to do something nobody can nobody can stop her what kind of question is that oh my gosh that's terrible that's like oh well I don't want to think about I just want to throw up oh I would Michelle is so kind she could never do that she's way too kind for me oh no I could never miss Michelle is very special for me like I could not even imagine it hurting each other that would never be no I guess we would rather die I'm all about survival struggle the fittest I will eat him I will eat him I will go fishing with something hunting I will find something I would never I will never touch her and she would never touch me I'm the better singer I don't sing I like I barely I barely memorized rap rap lyrics karaoke experience okay he has zero I have like 50 she she sings she has a beautiful voice well these new songs boo-yeah boo-yeah boo-yeah done I am he's a b-boy he like he's a natural dancer I mean you throw on any beat he'll start dancing and do you like crazy spins and they're waving DDR don't don't even touch him with DDR like it's all in except for Jimmy Jimmy is good I first met Dom when I was in Paris the city of love seat of lights and it's very magical he was like he jumped out of an anime that's I thought so what I thought was like very slow motion with the little Boca lights and bubbles and his eyes are like you know what it does that little little watery eyes well actually maybe that was music house magic what do you need his first impression he was he probably thought I was cute the first thing that really like God to me was like oh Sh she's she's very small she's so cute so that's my first my first thoughts when I when I really saw her for the first time and beautiful hair he probably thought she is so tiny she's souls and brown hair dark brown hair I remember dad very very beautiful here first thing I noticed about him was that he is so tall so that was the first things like hello but I just I really needed to get your hair for this coffee I really wanted to help her because I heard I heard her speaking English so I knew that she would never come back it's not like she speaks French and oh maybe she's Parisian or something so so I knew for sure that she was not from here and she was not from Europe and that if I didn't talk to her at the time like we would never meet again so he probably knew that I was going to fall in love with him I think he knew that but I didn't know I think he knew the truth before I even did I think she knew that I liked her no it was really I mean it was pretty obvious I mean trying to help her and it's kind of goofy but hey if you describe Dom in one word what would be Dom in one word epoch in one word one angel so I would say I would have to be one - doesn't really suit me but I want to be with herself I date gosh it doesn't matter where I go I mean wherever I go with him it already feels like a date to me it's not about the destination or the place or the setting it's about the company we can do pretty much anything we've been on vacation together as well and was really really funny we got lost together we we yeah so I would say anything anything I do with her ends up really funny and we have like amazing memories wherever I am it doesn't matter I'm happy like I'm at home when I'm with him okay and what would Dom eat every day he would eat pasta he would eat exactly penne pasta pasta that's something I could eat every day spaghettini or or or pending every day every day he's probably gonna say chicken bird chicken pho especially if it comes from a mom okay hello ah Dom Dom's favorite color black he loves black black my favorite color is white I like white flecks black too he probably thinks it's white mmm I would say black but I hesitate the call that suits her bass will be white white and black he would say black or white I will go with black oh my favorite body part on dawn that's a that's a very inappropriate question he's probably gonna say like my ABS my pegs I don't know probably my eyes I think she would see my eyes right gosh I don't know he has a great back I love deltoids makes no sense at all it's my thing okay don't judge me um and I love his nose I think he has a great jaws actually everything he's perfect looking like he's he looks like an anime like he looks like something that's not even real like I like everything about him I can't choose maybe not as eat I don't like meat the first thing that comes to my mind her lips oh she has a slightly bigger lips than than normal and I think it's very sensual it's very attractive in a girl maybe my lips maybe he's a dude and and beautiful hair like I said very thick hair very luscious hair so hair and lips she has thicker head and a head now be most beautiful she has better hair when he gets out of bed it's perfect hair I don't understand I think he's in like oh yeah Oh for me like I would send Michelle cuz it's lushes it's long it's it's thick when I see him like dumb baby Don and when it's done properly it looks amazing Tom can you grab the mail for me always freaking beautiful so annoying uh but I don't know yeah what's it Michelle oh man come on I'm messy fine I admit it I'm the messy one I I'm messy all right I'm sorry I'm very scattered brain that's the artist in me I don't clean up after myself I will but it's gonna take a while it might take like two days later but it's not because I don't care it's because I'm busy no that's just an excuse I'm just messy I'm sorry you know see Michelle who's the most efficient asian girl she gets things done very very fast and very efficiently yeah but sometimes like I said like the details are all right she gets a little bit messy on the details he probably says it's me I'm efficient he knows that he's like oh yes Michelle very fishy oh gosh how many kids do I want I guess at least two just because if I had one kid I wouldn't want I wouldn't want to have an only child just because I wouldn't want my son or daughter to be alone growing up I want them to have someone to play with kind of like you know my brother and I we were best friends growing up Oh I don't know I'm so definitely - boy and girl but three wouldn't hurt I would three would be nice so I can have an older middle and youngest I don't know I mean it's it's still a question that's it's still brainstorming he I think he would want the same like at least two the three wouldn't be bad but I think he'd probably just went - I would say - but who knows if I if we have three or four it's okay yeah I would be mad at three nice two already boys girls boy and girl a boy and a girl it was fun having a younger sister and an older brother it was really fun oh gosh who loves better person more that's a tricky question ah who loves each other more oh I don't know I don't think hmm no I don't think anyone loves the other person know what I hope we equally love each other I would assume and I would want us to equally love each other I I think it's it's very it's very cheesy and very cliche but to me it's like breathing air you know like we all share the same amount of error I know I don't make any sense right now I would say 5050 it's the single all right how did we do dumb both you guys hot oh I'm Way more romantic than you are what yeah no no yes no totally window just being Italian doesn't matter I know that oh you're being racist you should think so raisins right now since when can't Vietnamese American women be remain that's true I won't be mad at that one actually I'm your better better judge or I Drive faster I Drive way

you can film a 720 video with this drone they say drones are the future I'm like well drones are now I see drones like flying around my apartment sometimes I mean people are just flying and filming stuff and this drone right here you can rent for $10 a day but there's a lot of other great drones that you can get like the Lily the Phantom I mean there's endless amounts of drones and there's going to be more coming out this year too because whenever you film anything with a drone you just get this bird's-eye view this aerial view of something that just feels so significant and substantial and if you want to be super official which we always try and recommend people to be official you want to register your drone so you can register at FAA gov and all the information is right there so I am Karen oh she low-keyed launched this aesthetic and style that she has been cultivating for a bit called BB hoods BB hoods is her reinterpretation of taking the idea of babyhood and bringing it into adulthood so I'm going to Lyme call Karen I'm a Xiao hey Ron can you explain the style of BB hoods taking baby hood aesthetics like what basically what mom would trust you when you're a toddler those type of colors primary colors or even like um pastel colors and really the whole idea is like oh we don't really want to grow up um always have a mom I'm a child and then you dress that way too I remember you're also telling me it's not about like looking super sexy it's the exact opposite right it's like essentially dating it the clubs and not exactly the body I'll let you go I know you're busy I'll talk to you later yeah all right so me and this know you're not in the studio I'm here right now well yeah I'm not really yeah I'm no I'm in my my office where you at oh really I'm right next door oh my gosh all right oh yeah hey I later yeah I'll see you later bye why I wavy but a liquid lipstick gives you the opacity of high concentrated lipstick but it gives you the control to create the type of shape that you want and I'm pretty sure in the next year or maybe two years you're going to see more drugstores launching their own version of liquid lipstick but of course when it comes to beauty trends they all happen first online and you guys were the first to really talk about it and use it so I wanted to show you some really cool brands to check out because there's so many liquid lipsticks out there on the market now the best part about liquid lipsticks that when you apply it on you set it and you forget it that's it it's it's there it's stuck on your lips until you have to remove it with like a cleansing oil or a lot a lot a lot a lot of makeup remover so another trend that you're going to be seeing this year will be the use of online influencers and creators lending their voice and talents for games for TV shows and for more mainstream type of content and appeal I lend my voice for the game Marvel Avengers Academy and playing the character Jessica Jones swoozie who's also Warmachine is in it ASAP rocky I believe is Falcon it was really legit and I was actually really nervous and the director would say okay Michelle you have to grunt as if someone punched you and you have to fall down as if you died like okay it takes place in this university called you know the Avengers Academy and you basically play as your favorite Avengers as if they were in college check out the game on iOS or on google play my mascot is the shield's but there are six other mascots that you can choose from all the other influencers and whoever gets the most votes will get the mascot and the winning mascot of the people who voted for it will get a free character that is supposed to be awesome so the next thing I want to talk about is how everything is becoming instant especially when it comes to food you can instantly get your food delivered to you within five minutes when you're here in Santa Monica have you order from uber eats if you want to order your groceries you can order from instacart comm host maids the postmates is just a great way to order in food from your favorite restaurants if you want to try it out without having to go out to the restaurant and sit down I also love supporting post maids and all these other delivery services just because it gives me a chance to like give nice tips to the people who are delivering it I feel like yay like you know people have a job like they get to go to a store go to a restaurant order something and deliver it and you know makes me happy so you have all of these cameras that are coming out that are going to be available for 360 videos and pictures and one of my favorites of all of them is the Ricoh theta just because it's so beautiful it's it reminds me that MIB memory erasing stick the fact that it's so easy to use too which is why I love it so much so if you're looking for like a great easy-to-use 360 camera to just you know experiment with check out the Ricoh theta it's available and if you're looking for a place to upload or to watch your 360 content so that you can share with other people check out little Starcom they're basically like the youtube of 360 where you can upload your content on there and showcase your 360 world to your friends and family and share it in that way you can even build your channel on there too so if you're looking into 360 storytelling and you're trying to find a platform to host all that content check out little star all about charcoal there's this particular charcoal puff I actually discovered on peach and Lily calm I know most people prefer wetting it and then they exfoliate their skin but I use it dry the reason why I use it dry is because I notice right away how polished my skin and my lips look right after I use it so if you're looking for another way to just exfoliate your skin without using microbeads because I know right now like I think microbeads are banned r.i.p microbeads r.i.p we appreciated everything that you did for our skin but not for our environment it's not worth it the difference between using something like a micro bead and an exfoliating gel is that a micro bead physically exfoliates your skin but appealing or exfoliating gel has certain chemical properties in there that actually exfoliates the skin so you feel the dead skin layers just like falling off your face your hands have to be dry your face has to be dry or else it's not going to effectively peel everything this may not sound like something new to you I know we've all heard about Beauty blenders and sponges it's everywhere everyone's using it you can find them in all shapes and sizes like the heart shape here and there's one that you can get on a an applicator like this you can just apply it blend out your concealer foundation and of course tried-and-true other Beauty blenders some of these Beauty sponges are really dense so when you squeeze them it's a little harder to squeeze there's more resistance but when you find another Beauty Blender that you can squeeze all the way through because it's Airy it's more porous this is when you know this is a great Beauty Blender because I can just squeeze it and do this do that if you find one that's denser it's gonna be harder but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not effective it just gives you a different outcome I recommend and a lot of people recommend dipping it in water or running it under the faucet so that you still get squeezing it so you don't want it to be wet you just want it to be moist because you still want that airiness and that porous effect sometimes I find that some people they apply the makeup on the sponge and then they just tap it a hundred faces like no no no that's not you do it you got to make sure you wet it first and it's all about just building up that thin layers thin layers when I was in Japan and we went to a Harajuku district we just saw so many people with Salem and button space buns and it was actually really cool because it was really nostalgic and just made me feel like a kid again so I know that I've been seeing a lot of people taking the whole space bun look and reinterpreting it in their own way there's people doing it with like braids and dreads and there's others doing it with like beautiful colored hair very anime look and if you look at something like Star Wars which is much more wearable the whole space buns look it's a very beautiful out a worldly type look that I'm really diggin and I can totally see people rocking this at music festivals and even guys - I know this sounds crazy but I see more guys wearing buns like maybe not space buns but why not athleisure style is becoming really popular and it's becoming more mainstream I mean it is what it is athleisure it's wearing athletic looking clothes but leisurely it looks casual looks low-key and also like the shape is really beautiful too like I love yoga pants I think they look great track pants let 'ok jackets are awesome too this is a pseudo bomber jacket it's basically a casual look that feels super sporty but with a hint of that urban edge to it and I kind of like this trend because you know the clothes are super comfy it looks really fashionable and put together and you're going to see like a lot of new tones and textured fabric like mesh and neoprene patches will become more mainstream this year than last year just because it's just a great way to personalize something and make it you because I think now this day and age everyone's buying the same clothes from the same store and they just want something that's more unique patches gives you that ability to add something to tag something that makes it you and unique and for me it also feels like a tangible way of adding like a sticker or emoji to something which feels really relative but has more of that nostalgic feel if you want to find really cool patches that you know you want to make sure that I want to make sure I buy this patch at someone so-and-so doesn't have at Caesar place oh I actually wanted to show you guys the February if C bag just because I'm actually really proud of it I'll okay to help design it I sent my design team the bag design team an idea to do like a really cute pixelated envelope with a heart on it for February and they actually did it and it looks really cute so this is what it looks like feels so satisfying to rub we have this yacht tape nail polish you guys remember the ciate brand right the ones with the little beads you could paint your nails and then you had the those nail beads so they make incredible nail polishes and they have these mini nail polishes they're like chibi nail polishes are so cute oh yes Josie Maran ever since she launched her line in her argan oil I just knew that Wow I just want her brand to be part of my brand because I love her story and I love how she went from model to businesswoman so this is her Josie Maran Argan enlightenment illuminizer wand which looks like this it's gorgeous you see how it has like a beautiful illuminating glow super travel friendly guys I love trusty you know it's funny when I first got like trestique products I actually thought this was the product so when I was applying it on like wait it's not working then I realized no dah Michelle it's a cap so if you open it boom and this is their baby blush stick but I also like to use it on my lips too because it gives like a really nice tint what I like to use I like to apply directly on my fingertips blend it and then just Pat it on my cheeks like that oh we have here the perfect formula pink gel coat this is a great strengthening a Polish that you can apply directly on your natural nail it helps strengthens brightens and protects the nail and it's really pretty color I'm saving the best for last cuz I love my it cosmetics this is their popular cult favorite buy buy under eye concealer it has anti-aging properties in it it's waterproof there's like hydro collagen in it I don't know what that means and there's like vitamin C and K all jam packing is tiny little dig how cute is this I mean those are my favorite products from the Ipsy February bag and of course I love the bag it's so cute so I wanted to enter and report with some really cool accounts that I found on Instagram so I'm going to call it gram gallery just because they're so ascetic they're just so creative and I want to like show them some love just because I feel like they should get a lot of followers I mean there's so many other people with a lot of followers and it's always about selfie selfie selfie here's some other alternatives that you can look at that can reinvigorate your imagination and creativity and just get you thinking outside the box yeah guys so let me know if

[Music] once upon a time well more like a few years ago it was a beautiful summer day in Paris and I was exploring the city after work [Music] this was my first time in Paris and I felt like being a little adventurous so I went off to see the magic of the city of love I went just about everywhere the museum the Eiffel Tower but I wanted to try a real Parisian cafe so I stumbled upon one and decided to have a cup of coffee it didn't take me too long to figure out that this was an authentic French cafe as in the menu had no English translation and you guys know how awesome my French is the server however politely asked me something in French well at least I think he did so I was really embarrassed and I felt really bad and just when I was about to break out my phone to look up some translations someone tapped me on the shoulder and asked excuse me miss do you need help I can speak French for you [Music] oh my gosh I was so awkward and shy he was so sweet and ordered everything for me in French and we ended up staying at the cafe for a few hours talking about everything before we left we decided to keep in touch and exchanged our emails and numbers the next day I had to fly home but he was on my mind the entire ride home if you're in a long-distance relationship here's how you can maintain it Dom and I made sure to always find time to talk we found ways to have fun with it we were able to share our favorite moments I kind of went overboard and pretty much showed him every single meal I ate food is where the heart is won't meet us and he would share his favorite moments with me too it was almost like a window to his life I really felt like I was there we also shared our favorite songs to each other he dedicated a playlist for me and I'd listen to it on my way to work I made him listen to TV love songs besides sharing messages songs videos or other links we'd share real tangible things he would send me his favorite t-shirt and spray his cologne on them when you have something you can hold it doesn't really feel like a dream anymore [Music] I know it's tough but it's okay long-distance was not meant to be easy it's hard for a reason that's why having sentimental things like t-shirt sweater handkerchief even a plushie can make you feel closer to your love I sent down my favorite plush bunny I even made sure to spray my perfume on it so that he really felt like he was sleeping next to me I can't stress how important it is to communicate right when you wake up and before you go to bed you always want to have the first and last words for your love come on it doesn't take much effort to say hello or good night and the most important tip always have a date to meet this isn't pen pal stuff this is the loving relationship so if you're ready to commit make a date I can't think of a better feeling than knowing you're about to see the person you love those butterflies in your heart get anxiousness savor it and when you see that smile cherish each moment [Music] and when you're together be yourself don't put your best foot forward show all your flaws show your bad habits heck get into a fight every once in a while there's no such thing as a perfect relationship only a strong one and the only way to grow stronger is to overcome challenges like I said cherish each moment be yourself and love freely don't hold back tears later DOM and I were finally able to see each other and funny enough we were reunited in Paris someone once told me the good things come to those who wait but I believe that dreams are really waiting for you and my dream was waiting for me in Paris so I went after it we had our first kiss under the Eiffel Tower love is not always about being with someone love is about discovery you'll discover new parts about yourself that you never knew love will change you but it's up to you if you let yourself change for the better or worse I know for me I'm always ready for an adventure and I'm not holding back love knows no boundaries so keep your heart open and stay strong [Music] good luck [Music] 
if the universe is like water and you flow with it you'll be led to where you need to be I put a thought out into the universe asking for a direction like a drop of water hitting the surface the universe ripple and the waves drew me in to my motherland Vietnam I wanted to know where I came from first maybe that would give me a clue to help me understand who I am I was enchanted by the vibrant lights colors and laughter they told me how every lotus candle in the river will help bring real luck happiness and love into my life all of this river represents the universe then perhaps it's up to me to create my own look happiness and love but I had to think at first the power of thoughts and prayers I had to remind myself not to forget that if you can think it believe it and put in the work it can happen spirituality doesn't have to be so methodical just like a river there's different paths you can explore flow towards the one you feel drawn to keep moving stay curious take in the moment there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path be inspired get in touch with your own beauty and your flaws it's the combination of the two that makes us all unique after understanding that notion I realized how grateful I was the people the sounds the flavors the friendship the family to experience this extraordinary gift we call a you so now that I know where I came from I have a better understanding of who I am and where I'm going I hope this inspires you to fulfill your personal legend good luck

hey guys so in this video I'm gonna show you how to rejuvenate and take care of your skin cat the human wants to say hi everyone sup going on okay so in this video I'm gonna give you a very in-depth tutorial on how to rejuvenate your skin and these are the tips that I personally use myself so I know this works really simple I'm keeping it to 5 tips so the first one the most important is to cleanse your skin to clean it the key to rejuvenation is making sure that your skin is clean so it can absorb all the essential good products that you're putting on it so you want to make sure that any cleanser that you're using is effective especially if you're someone that's wearing a lot of makeup or you have waterproof mascara I know this is unconventional to what you guys hear but try using cleansing oils instead of facial soaps or any harsh chemical soaps that are out there on the market doesn't necessarily mean you have to spend a lot of money you can go as simple as extra-virgin olive oil and this is honestly my favorite makeup remover and also homemade cleanser it's so homemade you can just literally use it from the bottle if you're going to be using an extra virgin olive oil you want to find one that's certified organic especially if you're putting it on your face you don't want to use something that is low quality so find a certified organic extra virgin olive oil to apply in your face it's going to melt down the makeup it's going to be easy to remove and also it's going to help nourish the skin too just because it doesn't strip away the natural oils that are already on my face but it helps break down the products at the same time without irritating my skin for those who are worried about like acne prone skin just because you're using oil on the skin does not mean it's going to make it any more oily in fact it's actually going to help nourish the skin and keep it from getting more irritated so instead of using any harsh chemicals look for a product that is more organic has less alcohol less parabens and find something that is more gentle on the skin so this is why I recommend using oils on the skin when it comes to cleaning and removing any makeup and I know there's gonna be nights when you're going to be super lazy when it comes to removing makeup however if you find time to brush your teeth you can definitely find time to remove the makeup so just invest in a good makeup remover this is one that I love by Kummer lab what I like about these cleansing wipes is that it doesn't feel like a makeup remover where once you remove the makeup your skin feels dry there's added moisturizer in here and it feels more hydrating when you're removing the makeup instead of just stripping everything dry so whenever I'm feeling lazy primer lab cleansing veil is my go-to makeup remover step number two is to treat your skin and there's different ways you can treat it one of my favorite ways to treat the skin is to use a clay mask this is one by Cal Lian it's a Korean brand ever since I've been using this I've noticed that my pore size decreased dramatically it's amazing and I know there's bentonite clay and other organic natural ingredients pretty sure there's like magical ingredients in here but it really works clay mask is a great way to clean out any impurities and toxins from your skin what it does that it draws it all out and it removes it and it brings it to the top of the skin so that you can just rinse it right away find a clay mask that works really well for you you can find really good ones at Whole Foods I know there's a lot of really good natural ones that you can use and also the old-fashioned trick that I used when I was in college unscented kitty litter I know that sounds crazy I have a cat so I know how crazy that sounds but a lot of the times when you look at the ingredients of unscented kitty litter especially organic unscented kitty litter it's really just bentonite clay and bentonite clay is found in expensive or very well made clay masks like these that you can find on the market it's crazy and what you do is you take the powder of the kitty litter you wet it and then you apply it on your face just like a clay mask and you rinse it off another treatment that I love using is a honey asked and what makes honey so unique is that it's nature's antibiotic so not only will it help lighten the skin but also has healing properties in there too where it helps heal the skin and nourish it my favorite honey to use is manuka honey it's much more rich in antibiotics than normal honey that you find on the market around the grocery store shelves and it's a little more expensive so if you are on a budget manuka honey might be a little more expensive but I love it because I don't just use manuka honey for my face whenever I have a sore throat or if I'm feeling sick I take a teaspoon of manuka honey I just eat it and the next day my throat feels better and I don't feel as sick so it's really a wonderful way to heal the body and the skin I do this twice a week where I apply manuka honey on my face I leave it for about five to 10 minutes and then I rinse it off and my skin just feels amazing so this is a really great way to treat and nourish your skin and if you're feeling a little fancy then I recommend using a really good well-made skin mask and this one is by Innisfree I discovered this brand when I was in Korea and I found the store and I loved every single product that they had in there it's amazing quality they believe in organic natural products and what I love about this mask is that it's a two-step process so you have the serum that's attached up here that you peel off and you apply on your face it's vitamin C and then you apply the mask on and right when you remove it your skin just feels brand spanking new if buying mask like this is a little too expensive for you there's a way to make your own it's really simple all you need are rectangle square cotton sheets like this and essence what essence does is that it's softens the skin it lightens it and it also helps prepare it for all the other products that you're going to apply on later so what I do is I take the essence I douse it all over the cotton pads I let it sit for 10 seconds and then I start stretching it out and then I peel it layer by layer applying it all over my face leaving it for about ten minutes it's good enough and then just peeling it off and your skin is going to feel so fresh and so rejuvenated and then it's ready for step number three step number three is to tone the skin so when it comes to toners you want to be careful with what's on the market right now because there's a lot on the market that has a lot of alcohol in it and what alcohol does that it dries the skin that's the exact opposite of what you want to do so you want to find a toner that doesn't have a lot of alcohol like this one by B the skin this is by far one of the best toners I've ever used I love it and besides using this toner sometimes I'll switch it with apple cider vinegar this apple cider vinegar is by far the best that I've ever used it's called Solana gold it's all organic again you can find this one at Whole Foods or you can buy it online I'll add the link below I love this one because it's raw it's unfiltered so what I do I take two cotton pads one soaked in water one soaked in apple cider vinegar I wipe my face with apple cider vinegar and then I wipe off with water and I just keep doing it back and forth until my skin get that tingly sensation you don't want to use apple cider vinegar raw on your face because it might sting a little too much and it might be a little too strong for the face and that's why I recommend offsetting it with water so water apple cider vinegar and just start mixing it up and your skin is going to feel incredible it's going to be like thank you so much for not piling on all these chemicals on my face and giving me something that is natural and raw step number four is to nourish the skin you want to find ingredients that are good for the skin that's going to give it that luminosity so finding products like vitamin C that you can apply all over your skin is going to help give it that boost and it's going to help produce more collagen this one I found on Amazon is by all Naturals it's by far one of my favorite vitamin C serum it's 20% vitamin C which is pretty potent another serum that I love is by B the skin and boy is it super powerful so two pumps is all you need and what you want to do is after toning your skin you want to apply the serum on first before moisturizer and just patting it all over the skin a serum is kind of like a moisturizer that has a boost of power think of it like a moisturizer without the moisturizing benefits but it has all the popped potent ingredients in it for example let's say you don't have the best diet but you take supplements serums are like that you may not have the best skincare routine but using a serum will make a world of a difference because you're adding a lot of powerful active ingredients on the face they'll help heal and nourish the skin another good vitamin to use on the skin is vitamin A or they call it retinol and this one I use is by I obey I love this one you don't need a prescription to get this retinol you can just buy online or over the counter what I do is I take a little bit of retinol I apply it on my forehead my nasolabial folds a little bit on my crow's feet area and the rest around my cheeks and what this does that it helps the cell turnover faster so that your skin rejuvenates much faster but you have to be a little careful because retinol can dry out your skin so make sure you apply on a really good moisturizer afterwards or else your skin is going to start flaking and it's going to get really irritated if you need something stronger then you can start using a retinoid cream and this is prescription only so I have one that's point zero five percent and I use this one to start around my forehead and again nasolabial folds and boy it really does make a difference and I know this is really strong because sometimes I find that my skin can feel a little dry so I used just a little bit but my personal favorite is the one that you can get over the counter which is not as strong as the prescription one alright guys so the final step step number five is to hydrate your skin find a good moisturizer that is not going to feel greasy or heavy on the skin people tend to think the heavier the moisturizer the better but that works better for older skin if you have younger skin or you're below 50 you don't really want something that's too heavy something that is light refreshing and hydrating but that's not going to weigh the skin down one that I use every other night is this one by aromatic ax it's a beautiful moisturizer I love the texture it comes with a nice little scoop so that you don't really contaminate it and you scoop it out and break the product down between your fingers and you Pat it on the face and your skin will feel like a baby but smooth the next morning it feels so good and it doesn't feel as greasy or oily another moisturizer I love using besides this one is an oil based moisturizer same brand aromatic ax it doesn't have to be this oil it can be like argan oil olive oil coconut oil any oil you can safely use on the skin it's going to not only help hydrate the skin but the skin will also feel like it's natural so it's not going to have that irritation so that's pretty much the final step hydrate the skin moisturize it and you're pretty much ready to sleep and rest whenever you're shopping don't compare prices don't look at what's expensive look at what's effective besides cleaning the face hydrating the skin is the most important and remember guys don't neglect drinking water just because you're putting all these products on the face don't expect miracles because half the battle is also what you put inside the body all right guys I hope you enjoyed this tutorial I had so much fun sharing my skincare secrets with you guys don't forget to subscribe to show some

another beauty trend that's been around for a while but it seems like it's more prevalent online now is contouring different parts of your body personally I feel like makeup is a fun art where you can express your vision of beauty honestly whatever makes you happy but like everything in life moderation is key the technique itself is pretty basic all you need is a darker cool tone matte color in areas you want to receive and a highlighter to draw attention to areas you want to stand out and if that's not enough there's brands making body contouring kits now - like this light contouring kit stay tuned for the back contouring kit guys just kidding maybe not we'll see faux freckles say that five times full freckles beau freckles full of a bubble this trend has been popular in Asia for a while but usually around spring and summertime is where you see most people experimenting with this look my favorite way to recreate realistic looking freckles is to use matte products like a matte brow pencil you want to apply small dots across the bridge of the nose where the Sun normally hits the face if you're looking to elevate your freckles to the next level give the foil freckles look Ajay it has a futuristic feel that captivates beautifully in photos and you can get creative by using stars or glitter foil to touch up your look color correcting makeup has been a huge trend this year most people don't actually need to apply color correcting products to their face and if you do use them you want to be sure to apply very sparingly the tried and true colors you can find in good color correcting palettes will include green which neutralizes red tones and it helps with rosacea stubborn acne and sunburns peach neutralizes blue and purple under-eye circles on fair to medium skin you want to use orange for darker skin tones and it works really well for covering up bruises veins and tattoos yellow helps with hyperpigmentation and dark spots pink can be used as a highlighter on fair skin to help brighten areas and lavender neutralizes yellow tones to help brighten your complexion and here I'm going to feature my favorite if see products for this month first one we have here

hi dreamers I wanted to create a beauty look inspired by my aura photograph each and every one of us has energy pulsing through our bodies and using state-of-the-art technology we can actually see the electromagnetic waves we radiate from within these waves are translated into colours so I invited a team of experienced or photographers to come into the studio for a reading this machine was able to capture my inner light each color corresponds with a mood and treat how you feel on the inside reflects on the outside you might not be able to see the light but those who are sensitive can sense it I guess you can say this is kind of like an inner selfie after seeing my own aura I was inspired to create this dreamy look that will make it look as if you're glowing from within alright let your inner beauty shine through by starting with a clean face I'm using here this soy milk cleanser to keep my skin supple and smooth put some on your hands and spread it all over your face massage your face as you go and rinse off to clean alright so moving on to a matte pore reducing primer evenly apply this product using a stippling brush onto the lips you can add a touch of a moisturizing lipstick with a hint of tint this will enhance your natural lip color giving your lips a nice flushed look there is definitely beauty in simplicity time for foundation take a few pumps on the back of your hand and load some onto your stippling brush the goal is to avoid covering your entire face you just want to even out your skin's natural texture and color focus on the areas around your nose lips and eyes for a bit of coverage around your eyes use a creamy concealer to conceal your dark circles try finding a hydrating concealer because your under eyes tend to be a little bit more dry than the rest of your face take a little extra and tap it on as eyeshadow base remember to be gentle with the delicate skin around your eyes Tugg it's totally normal if your lip shape is not even if you want to reshape them take a little more concealer on a small synthetic brush and line your lips to even out the shape afterwards just be sure to blend out with a sponge whatever you have left over just even out your eyes and blend that out as well okay now you can take a nude highlighter and accentuate areas of your face wherever the light naturally hits your face accentuate that area you can apply along your brow bones inner corners of your eyes a little on your nose cheeks and Cupid's bow here's a fun tip drawing small crosses on your cheeks will help highlight without looking too harsh and with a brush slightly blend out the highlighter light will reflect wherever you apply this highlighter this will give you that enchanting glow as for your eyes take a sheer creamy eyeshadow and Pat it all over your lids for a wash of color try finding a beautiful lilac color and if you want go for a more iridescent look on your eyes as if light is coming from within take a frosty white shadow to brighten your inner corners and bring this glow all the way up to your crease framing the inner half of your eye place any leftover product on your brow bone and tap it along the lower lash line this will give your eyes a halo effect onto eyeliner we don't want this look to appear too harsh so just tight line your eyes by lifting up your lashes quickly and gently gliding the pencil along the upper waterline if your eyes get watery it's totally normal once you've tight lined your eyes add some of this pencil eyeliner on an angled brush and wing it along the upper lashes let's give some love to your lashes find a mascara with a tiny wand this one is perfect for getting extra close to the roots of your lashes creating a tight lining effect so comb through your favorite mascara that has a natural finish you want to make sure to keep your brows looking natural for this look so use a pencil or powder to fill them in enhance the shape but don't overdo it brush the hairs into place and blend out the color if your brows appear drawn on try using feathery strokes this will give them a more natural finish all right take your favorite highlighting powder and we're basically gonna cheat that glow from within use a taper brush highlight on the areas on your cheats where light is naturally hitting it and whatever is left over on your brush just tap a little on your forehead unless you already have a nice curved forehead I'd skip this step continue building up your highlights until you've reached the glow you're satisfied with using your index or ring finger dot some product under your eyes to punctuate the halo effect and if you want you can even highlight your collarbones so that the light can reflect off of them and if you're looking to give your lips that aura light glow use a lip liner that's slightly deeper than your natural lip color line your lips and blend it up just keep repeating until you're happy with the shade and shape of your lips to soften the look of your lips take a soft pastel lipstick that complements your skin tone and place it all over now with a frosty shadow from before Pat it on the center of your lips finish it off by adding a nice tinted oil that will add extra moisture and shine don't neglect the hair it needs to be shiny too I'm a huge believer in using hair oil take a dime sized amount of argan oil in the palm of your hands and rub them together to warm up the product and from there just run your fingers through your hair focusing on your ends keep finger combing until your hair feels soft and you see that shine all right and now you can style your hair I'm gonna keep it simple and use my trusty old hair clip that's super 90s looking clip the sides of your hair back and take a few front pieces to frame your face and now my dear you're done go out there and let your beautiful aura shine through I believe that Souls recognize each other by vibes not by appearances so put out good positive energy and thoughts good vibes only please if you happen to have your aura photograph taken tag me and use the hashtag inter selfie until next time good luck dreamers Oh

grapefruit slice it open down the middle and remove as many seeds as possible it's okay if there's a few left because you can always strain them out then begin by squeezing the grapefruit juice out into a large bowl you want to squeeze out about two-and-a-half grapefruits to make enough juice moving on to your lemon cut it in half and remove the seeds and squeeze about ten medium-sized lemons into the bowl you can just combined it with a grapefruit juice to sweeten this up add 2.5 tablespoons of stevia I'm using stevia because it's a natural low calorie sweetener without any extra fillers go ahead and pour all the juice into a pitcher then fill it up to the top with club soda and now slowly mix everything together it's going to get extra bubbly for the glasses I wanted to add an extra sweet touch start by pouring some honey into the bowl and lining the rim or a glass afterwards just place it hat down in sprinkles to decorate the rim as you can see here I placed some raspberries in

pan from there you can add this lemon jelly to give it that sweet touch go ahead and place them into the oven for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees you want the petals to turn into a golden brown color you'll know when they're ready when they look like this now you can sprinkle some powdered sugar on top and enjoy your treat try making a face mask completely out of natural ingredients I'm just going to use here plain Greek yogurt buttermilk vanilla cake batter and banana lemon and honey start with your yogurt and begin pouring in the cake batter and buttermilk mix up all the ingredients until

create your cookies and then bake them in the oven for the tops of the cookies roll out yellow fondant with a rolling pin with the same lemon cookie cutter cut lemon shapes out of the fondant add this to the tops of your cookie and use water to help the fondant stick better to the cookie pinch the edges of the fondant and shape it down on top of the cookie using a black edible marker draw on your

hi guys it's summertime and if you guys are looking for a new way to refresh yourself whether it's through your body mind or soul or space watch this video and I'm going to show you my favourite things that I'm loving right now so let's start off with my favorite beauty products all right so I'm going to show you guys my favorite skincare products that I've been loving I'm dying over the first one I want to show you is creme Earl AB it's an interesting cleanser because unlike most cleansers that are either foamy or creamy or sometimes even soapy this one has a bubbly texture a few pumps it's all you need the bubbles they help bring the dirt up into your face and you can just wash it right off and you see how it starts bubbling up it's going to feel so smooth and so clean without over-drying it out so after cleansing my face the next product that I've been just dying over and I'm using every other night is the creme err laughs perfecting hydrating mask so I'm going to show you what it looks like so you're gonna pull it out like so and this is essentially what the mask looks like treat yourself to a nice mask every once in a while you guys deserve it now if you're not much of a face mask person but you're more into deep huffing your eyes this is the eye mask that I swear by it's called skin Iceland and they say that this will de-puff your eyes within 10 minutes I've tried it but I mean it's pretty accurate and their forehead mask I think is very interesting because I've never seen anything like this so you have one for either wrinkles or for under the eyes or you can use them for both so this is what a under-eye mask looks like I'm so leaving this on for about 10-15 minutes and you'll notice right away that your eyes will look more deep huffed and more awake alright so besides skincare let's move on to makeup what I really want to talk about this summer is how important skin primer is I think skin primer is an essential beauty product to have during the summer time because it's a great way to mattify your face control the oil and also your makeup will last longer especially during very very humid nights I know this sounds little bias because it's from my own brand but I believe in it so much that's why I recommend it the smoothing face primer just a few squirts that's all you need and when you apply makeup over it it's going to feel smoother it's going to last longer and you'll notice right away that your face will look more matte and if you're not living in an area where there's a lot of Sun or maybe you're trying to avoid it but you love that sunkissed look then I recommend my makeup mood enhancer this is golden candlelight and I'm just going to add this right on my cheekbones and you'll notice right away the brightening effect and so now like my skin has this really beautiful glowing effect especially the cheekbones so if you're looking for a way to lift up the cheekbones add a highlighting color right around this area and this will instantly lift up your cheeks if you're looking for that instant bronzy sunkissed glow then try either a bronzing body lotion or this one by Saint Tropez is called one night only so this is what it looks like just apply this on your body once you take a shower or you know taking a bath it washes right off it's really it's a really subtle difference but I think it's nice because sometimes like for me I don't really want to look tan I just want that sunkissed glow so this is a great way for me to get that look without having to commit to a sunless tanner that's going to last up to five days so this is what it looks like this is with the instant body glow and this is without if you're not into that instant body glow and you want something that's going to last a little longer then try a tented self-tanning lotion or mousse check out this one by l'oreal paris so it has this moosie texture and you just evenly apply this all over your skin on your body and it's going to give you this really nice natural-looking bronze tan alright so let's talk about hair this is a really fun product that I think it's adorable and I've been loving its red kins pillow proof blow-dry spray they call it a two day extender so what you do is you spray it right on the risk want to go in and get the product in there brush everything out and that's it your hair is going to look more fresh and it's going to last longer it's not going to smell or like have that greasy texture so the last beauty product that I want to show you guys is honestly I like to save the best for last and the reason why it's because it's really sentimental to me this is the Kiehl's original musk the cool thing about it is that it's unisex so a guy and a girl can wear it so DOM and I we share this and I think it's interesting because when he wears it it smells a little different and when I wear it and so I think this musk what it does is that it enhances your pheromones for me it smells earthy and for Dom it smells really masculine and woody here are some cute little accessories I wanted to share with you guys because they're so cute and I'm going to start using them but I wanted to show them in the packaging before using them so these are by bando and so these are their hair clips so you can just add this right in your hair and here are their twisty ties this one is honestly my favorite design I think it looks like a nice bracelet but it also works as a hair tie too apparently they don't they don't snag at your hair because they're made out of elastic bands and so they're very gentle to use on your hair so if you're looking for a way to play up your hair check out Bandos hair ties and hair clips are super cute and speaking of wrist bands or any just bands in general I don't know if you guys have ever heard of Nikes FuelBand this is what it looks like what you do is you wear this on your wrist and it monitors every action you take if you're running you were jumping so it's really great for those who are looking for a more active lifestyle and you want to catalog what you're doing and every movement that you're making when you're exercising or especially when you're doing yoga I recommend finding a color that really speaks to you so what color speaks to you are you guys more into blue pink purple yellow just let me know in the comments section below speaking of nature and being earthy I think you know being very conscious of the environment and using recyclable or renewable items like canvas bags when you're doing shopping they really do inspire me to be more eco-friendly and be more conscious of the environment and you can't get any more eco-friendly than using a glass bottle and they will last much longer than a plastic bottle it's made to a Fibonacci spiral so the design itself is very symbolic and beautiful and so besides that it comes with this beautiful cork sleeve and my favorite part about this bottle is you can see at the end it's really faint but it's beautiful honestly out of everything this is my favorite product that I really recommend if you're looking for a way to refresh everything around you start with what you're drinking and what you're taking in your body and so find a glass bottle that really suits you and so this one is by nature's design I love it I recommend it it's something that is really special to you too I wanted to show you guys a few really cute speakers that I got for myself and this is so freaking cute it's by bando again this is their Jem speaker I feel like I don't know I feel like a character from My Little Pony or like Sailor Moon or something it's adorable and speaking of fabulous speakers I think this one is just as fabulous so when I'm in the studio and I'm doing a bunch of conference calls this is my speaker so I plug everything into here I don't know about you guys but I'm all about coasters and just a fun way to kind of just protect your table from those cold darn drinks so gem coasters is so pretty whenever I have like an artist's block or I can't thank her I just need to kind of like reset my brain this saves my life it really does if you are a huge fan of Mario Kart you and I like we're gonna be best friends we're besties because this is my life I wish my life was like Mario Kart I don't care what anyone says this is the best game ever so if you're like me and you don't really watch a lot of TV or more online but you still love TV I mean you love the big screen check out chromecast it's awesome it's so easy to use just plug your chrome right into your HDMI so you can watch all your favorite shows YouTube videos or Netflix Hulu Plus Google Chrome and much much more so the last thing I want to talk about is Kindle Fire HD stay tuned because I'm going to be giving this away and I'll let you guys know when and how to enter to win this all right I know that was a lot of stuff I showed you believe me I had to cut that down in half because I had I have way more products but I think I'm going to save it for another video I hope you guys enjoyed this video and you earned and you were inspired by what you saw if there's anything I really want to emphasize on it's going eco-friendly like getting glass bottles you know like using canvas bags it doesn't really take that much effort really starts from you exciting news M Cosmetics is now on Amazon which is awesome because I love Amazon actually a lot of the products you saw in this video were from Amazon I'm all about the two days shipping two day free shipping I shared my prime with like four of my friends and family members so they get to enjoy two day shipping and quite honestly you know it's a place where I can shop and I can feel comfortable and I can trust and that's why I decided to partner up with Amazon because I really believe in them I believe in their shipping I believe in their customer service and so if you have an Amazon account you can now find em cosmetics on there it's legit it's official it's from me send me your favorite products by hashtagging wish list so I can find them and maybe I can feature them in my next video other than that thank you guys for watching

hello what's up guys I'm assuming you clicked on this video because you're probably feeling stressed out a lot of anxiety maybe just you know you're upset about something whatever it is I wanted to make this video to remind you guys that it's okay to feel stressed it's very natural but the thing is you can't feel stressed all the time even something like this the phone a machine messes up and remember guys we also have to charge these things they don't just run on forever even they need a break and so if something like a cell phone a machine needs a break imagine us we need to give ourselves time to relax to recharge to fine and seek that inner peace this day and age where everything is moving so fast and we're always wanting to be in the know we're trying to keep up with everything there's this pressure to always be on but there's nothing wrong with just turning everything off I admit sometimes I can be the biggest hypocrite if there was such thing as a workaholic Anonymous I would be the first person there hi my name is Michelle and I'm addicted I'm addicted to working and I'm always stressed out so I had to teach myself throughout the years how to just slowly unwind and find that path towards relaxation and if I can do this guy's you can too so I really hope you enjoy my personal tips all right turn off your phone I know it's hard but he's got it unplug think of it like a digital detox a hot bath is a great way to kick things off making bubbles adding oils minerals or even a bath balm like this little guy into the water can bump up the soothing factor sometimes we forget or we're too busy to find the time to take care of ourselves but with the right music candles and oils you can turn your own bathtub into your very own luxury spa if you're not much of a bath person hot water can still play an important role a nice warm drink like tea hot chocolate or even lemon water can soothe stress away soup helps sweat out toxins from your body chicken cabbage soup ramen and my favorite fuh are my go-to distressing food every once in a while take your time when you're eating I'm sure you have moments when you can only eat on the go or you only have five minutes to spare but try to dedicate one meal a day where you can really sit and enjoy the meal because food is healing and a blessing don't forget to make time for fun whether it's reading playing games watching a movie a show I forget my personal stress in no time reconnect with yourself by doing something you love this is why finding your passion is important everyone has one and if you think you don't well you haven't looked hard enough try as many things as you can and don't be afraid of being bad at it at least I'll steer you in the right direction on what you're truly gifted in did you know that the right scent can really help your psychological and physical well-being they call it aromatherapy and there's different ways to try it out like lighting scented candles have you ever tried incense no well it's not just for religious or ceremonial uses it serves a variety of purposes like aromatherapy meditation and more and there's different types of incense that you can try out like this one here it's a direct burning incense where it requires a separate heat source like this piece of charcoal and once it's hot enough you can add loose resin on top of it and it will slowly create this lush fragrant smoke another form of aromatherapy using essential oils you can apply on your pulse points like your wrists and neck and sometimes if I want to bump up the intensity I'll apply on my forehead and heart ah my favorite find time to meditate alone time and quiet introspection can really help I like to use tribes or soothing sounds for my meditation like this Thai pet in singing bowl it's my ultimate chill-out instrument and if you don't have a singing bowl you can still tune in to your favorite calming sounds like nature and instrumentals trust me the right music can help you chill out what's your go-to chill-out song you want to take this time to breathe taking long deep breaths just let your thoughts go focusing on keeping your mind still and

sorry sorry I'm late Finn and I were fighting the shark and science cat and I lost track of time anyway I'm here now milady and I have brought to you half an orange come on nice no make that cream yeah that's good oh and young-ja I'm gay yep again shouldn't be up see Dad mmm oh that's better hi had to make sure my translator was on so what do you get when you combine a unicorn with a rainbow a rainy corn inspired by one of my favorite enchanting characters in Adventure Time Lady has perfectly pink skin so begin by lightly stippling on a base of BB cream or liquid foundation I prefer using a BB or CC cream because it feels lighter than foundation plus it has a moisturizing base so will also help moisturize your skin too BAM the power of good concealer is pretty much as good as magic you can use your ring finger to blend or do what I'm doing taking the back of the brush and patting to blend all right now take a cherry red lip balm and dab it on the lips to prep and soften them for later I'm going to throw on some blue contacts circle lens better yet if you want to give your eyes a more magical look and now that your eyes are magical next step will require priming your eyes I'm using here a champagne shadow primer gently dabbing it on my lids with the ring finger apply a bright yellow on the center of the lid this will be the base color for the rainbow with another clean finger or a brush apply a sky-blue along the outside corner of the eye Pat it on and blend around the corners to soften the edge load up your brush with a shimmery lighter blue and blend into the crease patting as you move along the eye for more control take a blending brush and blend to soften the edge let's try to keep this look soft like a cotton candy and now take a hot pink shadow and to create that beautiful rainbow effect take a flat sided shadow brush and dab this color into the crease you want to try and keep the lines subtle pink is a very strong color if you use too much it might overwhelm the eyes a rainbow is created when light is reflected through droplets of water in the sky to give that shimmery effect of water droplets apply a sparkling shadow on the brow bone the next color will be purple with a smaller brush add this along the lower lash line to balance out the eyes you want to make sure to add a cooler color on the bottom since we have pink on top on the inner corner of the eye by the tear duct apply a shimmering white shadow to brighten up this look all right take out your black liquid liner gently feather out a black liquid liner on the top corner of the eye keep the line thin we want to make sure that your eyes are as open and as round as possible just like ladies so that means curling your lashes and applying generous coats of mascara Lady Rainicorn doesn't have very defined eyebrows so this brow look is really up to you I want to try and keep this natural looking so gently filling your brows with the neutral tone color close to your natural hair color because I'm wearing a blonde wig to match ladies hair brush a little bit of a blonde brow gel over your brows to lightly tint them to really make the eyes pop line the bottom waterline with a rose gold liner this will really open up your eyes more for the lashes I need a little more help in this department so I'm going to apply individual lashes the trick for this step is to use a clear glue and to apply with a tweezer so that you have better precision okay so now you're ready to move on to the rest of the face for your cheeks a rosy pink cream blush will do the trick apply this on the upper cheekbones and blend it out with a fluffy kabuki brush because you might need a little more definition around the cheekbones take a bronzing blush powder and apply this on the apples of the cheeks blending to the outer corner of the face as you go Lady Rainicorn has a delicate small mouth so if you have full lips take your concealer that matches with your skin tone and erase the sides of your lips this is going to create the illusion of a smaller you want to make sure to blend so it doesn't get cakey and after this just powder to make sure the concealer doesn't slip inside alright time for some color use a pink or a rose lip color and apply this along the opening of your mouth to create a sweet delicate look this lip look is very innocent looking perfect for lady alright now your magical look is complete magical colorful and completely adorable this is Lady Rainicorn now all you have to do is learn Korean and find your boyfriend Jake oh poor guys Aska oh goody bandit evocative of it insisted on Inga Kiana but this one device met me on a hanger PETA yeah and that means good luck in Korean 
what's up everyone so it's back-to-school season so I'm going to show you guys how you can style your hair your makeup and your clothes Monday through Friday easy effortless and chic so let's start with the favorite day of all Monday Monday is awesome actually no I'm just kidding I'm allergic to Mondays Mondays suck because it's not loved the most I think we should show Monday a little more love by showing a little bit more enthusiasm so what I recommend is just going to school with comfortable clothes so just dress for comfort because you know like on the weekends you're just chilling and sleeping in you just want to roll out of bed with your blanket and I think this is a great compromise because sweaters are awesome they're kind of like in a sense like kind of like blankets are wearing a blanket to school so monday dress for comfort for your hair I recommend either putting it up in a ponytail in a bun just keep it effortless if you need to spray some dry shampoo or you want to like jig it up a bit I recommend a really good hairspray like there's hair spray that I'm using is by Marc kill the scent the fragrance is amazing it smells really good so you have a really cute guy that sits behind you in a non-creepy way Tuesday I love Tuesday people ignore Tuesday I feel like we should also give Tuesday some love so Tuesday I recommend either sporting like a really cute tee or if you really want to go a little bolder you can do something really fun and rock a retro t-shirt something from the 90s 90 stuff is the best you have like your options with ninja turtles or maybe you can rock like a Power Rangers t-shirt you have three more days to go and Tuesday you have to have something that's going to brighten up your day so a fun graphic tee is the best and if you're gonna wear your graphic tee you can either throw on like a jacket something denim something tough or you can throw in a beanie if you can't really Rock a beanie even either you can put your hair up in a cute ponytail or you can just put it down and again you should keep it really simple in cash because you know the closer we get to Friday the more dressier we're going to look um makeup should be really simple again I think just mascara having your brows done a little bit of concealer that's all you really need however whatever is comfortable just rock it and let's move on to the next day which is Wednesday hump day even though that sounds really inappropriate why do we call it hump day I think it's because it's the hump in the middle of the week I don't know if that means like humping something or maybe it's a hump in the week whatever let's bring it back to appropriate level um I recommend wearing something really fun again Tuesday was graphic tee but maybe Wednesday can be something that's more wordy maybe it's your favorite quote that can inspire you or your favorite name brand or maybe it's a really awesome meme that you can wear I was watching Mean Girls over the weekend and I actually forced Dom to watch it he's never seen it he was cracking up and I wanted to wear this shirt because you know paying homage to Mean Girls Wednesday's got to wear your pink or yeah or else you might not sit at the table with the cool kids so make sure to wear your pink on Wednesdays just kidding I'm gonna wear purple or whatever depending on your dress code if you have this really cute dress but it's spaghetti strap top doesn't necessarily mean you can't wear it to school you can just layer a t-shirt over it and it's gonna look just as cute the thinner your dress is the more you can start layering on top of it and there's ways that you can style the t-shirt so it's a little more form-fitting and it fits your body better and it looks like an actual outfit just have fun with it I mean you're in school you're allowed to experiment with different styles so anything with a nice dress I think will look very appropriate for hump day Thursday I love you Thursday because you're so close to Friday but I don't love you as much as Friday so you're kind of like my second lover on the side but Thursday I will give you some love because Thursday should be the day to just toughen up your look or keep it really really Street keeping it form-fitting either wearing like a long Mac dress that's form-fitting to your body um maybe even like throwing on a faux leather jacket or a denim jacket with like faux faux sleep faux leather sleeves sorry faux leather shoes and it can be inspired by la street style but for this one I was more inspired by New York Street style where it's much tougher there's denim there's like faux leather black and white goes with everything and it's going to be a timeless color combination so it's not going to go out of fashion it's a good investment if you want to just have a wardrobe that's easy where you don't have to think about anything try and stick with monochromatic colors that's what New Yorkers do I know that's what I do and it's so easy to just wake up and just get dressed in the dark and walk out the door and you're still gonna look freaking awesome and I think for makeup you can really play up your lips you can either rock a dark lip or a red lip keep it bold keep it simple - you know Thursday keep it cool whatever Friday TGIF TGIF thank God I'm a female I'm just kidding thank God for Friday's or thank God it's Friday I don't even think you should use God's name in vain right thank goodness it's Friday no but seriously Friday I took the golden child everyone loves Fridays either you look your best or you dress your most casual so I know in the corporate world when people are working usually Friday's casual day so people get to dress down instead of dressing up but I know for school people want to dress up like it's the weekend you can hang out with your friends you can just blow off homework and just chill and sleep watch Netflix you know sleep in it's really what I did sleeping in who's the best honestly just wear what you want I think Friday is the day where you should really express who you are and really experiment with different fashion styles so you can either go for like that goth look or the punk look or if you want to do more preppy or you can bring it back down to cash I mean it's really up to you or you can even dress up really nice at the end of the day it's just school people they don't remember you for how you looked or they don't even remember you for what you did they remember you for how you made them feel so as long as you're a good person and you're always happy people will keep that with them for a really long time so it's really the attitude that counts most when I was in high school all I wanted to be was the popular girl because I felt like the popular girl had everything she had the boyfriend she had the friends she had the popularity and I was never that girl and I think it wasn't until junior year was when I just stopped worrying about it I told myself who cares I have two more years of school left might as well just enjoy this because I'm not going to be able to see any of my high school friends again just have fun guys um don't take things too seriously it's high school when you get into the real world things are a little more different there's a lot more responsibilities you really have to own up to now that you're in school especially high school or middle school learn as much as you can and really make your friends and just have fun alright guys that is pretty much it I hope you enjoyed my tips in my crazy little rants here and there and have fun with life because that's what life is here for it's not going to be perfect there's gonna be a lot of ups and downs and you just have to go with the flow and just keep a

constant bearer of these sun shades cuz i'm a little sunshine when the sunlight beckons our way Oh you 
ask nish okay so how do I motivate myself I think coffee is my motivation this definitely helps wake me up that's the first step to anything wake up get your brain work in and from there organizing your entire day so I recommend just adding little notes and reminders on your calendar so that you can just hit every single thing and just get it done bam bam bam whether you're running errands or you have like a lot of stuff to do like homework just add it on your calendar and just get used to being on a schedule that way you're more motivated to just knocking everything out for me I divide my time between New York and LA which means I have to film all my stuff in LA and then when I go to New York I have to work on em stuff and business stuff so for me having a calendar with all of my art in ER Aries and my plans and my activities on there really helps illustrate my entire week so that I know exactly what to do ooh oh I hope my mom isn't watching sorry mom I'm just kidding I am I don't think I'm brave enough to have a tattoo I think it's so permanent and and the idea of having something that's going to be on you for the rest of your life that's kind of major if I were to get a tattoo it has to be symbolic it has to be a part of me like no different than a beauty mark so if I were to get a tattoo I don't know I'd probably get a lotus flower or a cross or something that it's very symbolic to to me and um but would I get a tattoo yeah I'd rather just draw one with a sharpie haters and rumors it's part of life it's like noise pollution honking all that and you know sirens you hear outside it can be very distracting and noisy but you can choose to kind of cancel it out you don't necessarily have to listen to it don't put yourself out there in public if you don't want any haters or rumors because it's going to come regardless not everyone's going to like you and you kind of have to deal with that because it's life I mean that's how people are people think differently so I had to learn all that I had to tell myself not to be such a people pleaser not to live by what other people think of me but just live the way I want to live and take care of the people that I love and I hold dear to my heart so once you get that and once you understand that and you live by that rumors and haters are no different than the honking and sirens that hear in the back ground it's just noise and I'm just canceling it out three wishes gosh three wishes can I wish for more wishes cuz I can give everyone wishes now I can't do that the first thing I would wish for is world peace absolutely no more Wars world peace everyone getting along with each other and respecting and loving each other the second thing I would wish for is no more world hunger I don't think anyone should starve you know that's that's a basic necessity that we need as humans and just the idea of someone starving like I would wish for that to go away so that would be my second wish and my third wish I would kind of save it I would save it for someone someone really special because I wouldn't know what else to wish for I mean I have everything I need in my life my mom and my family and the person I love and my friends and I have a great job so what more what more can I ask for cutlery that's a random question like a knife or something a fork spork at least like you can do both I do everything with chopsticks my I cook I eat with chopsticks I can cook with chopsticks and by the way you want to try and eat Cheetos and you know sometimes your fingers can get really yellow when orangie try eating with chopsticks oh yeah no evidence yeah I would totally be chopsticks because Asian proud of it the greatest advice from my mom happiness is the only thing that matters it's not money it's it's only happiness she's awesome I love my mom I love you mom gosh how do I feel when I watch my older videos I changed a lot I'm definitely not the same person but it's kind of cool to see that you know it's like a little window to my past and it's a great way for me to reflect and for me to see how much I've grown as a person honestly it's still a little weird cuz I don't like watching myself I don't like watching any of my videos like once I upload them I try not to watch them anymore but um if I do happen to stumble upon an older video it's it's really cool to see that my favorite childhood memory oh gosh I think when my sister was born the first time my mother brought her home and I had a baby sister you know like someone that I could take care of and I love and I could teach she was so little she was tiny she was this big and I remember I was just cradling her and I was only nine years old at the time but I knew that she was she was special and that she was going to be the person that I would teach and I would love unconditionally and I was a big sister you know it was a great responsibility to have and it was a great one of the greatest memories I would always treasure for the rest of my life anime mmm like the recent ones I've been watching like attack on Titan I don't know if I want to live in that world I don't want to worry about Giants and/or Titans attacking me so definitely not attack on Titan I've been watching killa kill but again that's not a world I'd want to live in either I would choose Kingdom Hearts because at least you can travel to different universes and go to like Little Mermaid or move on world or you know like Halloweentown and all that oh yeah Kingdom Hearts I would be Sora if it was a girl version of Sora he's so fun and epic I've Goofy and Donald they're like my besties they've already eat one food for the rest of my life man it sucks well you know like animals do that they eat grass and stuff they don't complain well if I were to choose and I would have to choose something that would feed me in every level like I would have to have my carbs my veggies my proteins um chicken feh my mom is chicken feh no seriously it's a bomb it's so freakin good it is so good actually I want some right now what was my favorite subject in class um man was definitely not math let me tell you me and math like water and oil we do not mix do not get along probably chemistry not Breaking Bad style of it I like chemistry I like I like understanding what we're made out of just understanding that there's always a cause and effect you know like chemistry is very powerful I think chemistry is is a subject that a lot of us tend to undervalue I have a deep appreciation for chemistry there's nothing shady there olive oil laying around and the pots it's okay chemistry biology not math my guilty pleasure I love watching horror movies I don't know that's considered a guilty pleasure by love horror movies not slasher film just scary ghost movies I guess it's a little weird I like reading up about aliens and supernatural stuff I love watching documentaries on that and I don't really share that too a lot of people so I guess that's my guilty pleasure my favorite tradition growing up was always that it which is Vietnamese new year's I loved it I thought it was amazing when our families would all come together and we would get red envelopes from our relatives and the older people and inside the red envelopes was either like you know a dollar 50 cents or maybe sometimes if someone was generous like five dollars like one time someone gave $10 whoa I mean that's a lot of money like for a kid and my brother and I would try to compete and see who would get the most envelopes I'd want to carry on the tradition of Lunar New Year so for sure that why do people always want to know that like it's Oh sucks no girl is gonna have one product come on let's be real but if I were to choose one concealer at least I'll look awake and that's all it matters I do not leave the house without concealer I need just a little bit to function it's like coffee concealers my coffee it's weird I always knew that I was going to be an artist the first moment I was drawing and writing up all these stories I knew right away that I wanted to do something creative I think that's why I signed up for for band and I played the trumpet piano and I took art classes I always wanted to do something that was creative where I can express myself and I think that's kind of why I do makeup tutorials that's why I make them because I'm expressing myself but I'm also I think the best part is that I'm teaching other girls or guys how to express themselves to how to be creative to like it's this cycle you know that I'm so thankful to be a part of and even though everyone was telling me be a doctor be a doctor it didn't steer me away from I guess my destiny which was to just be happy and I chose that and that's why I do what I do and I have the best job on our favorite place to get away I think as long as I'm with dawn that's all that matters it's not about the setting or the place or location I mean it's nice it's like a nice backdrop but it's really the person the company that makes a difference I could be anywhere in the world but if I'm with Dom I feel like I'm at home so wherever I'm with him that's where I want to be any superpower if I could have one superpower what could be a really cool power to have I'm stuck I'm torn between two healing the power to heal people like instantly right when I touch them to heal their wounds to heal their sickness or the power to control time to manipulate time to kind of like bend it to slow it down to move it faster to go backwards but I think if I were to choose just one I'd be healer I'd want to heal people and help them and I would go around the world and just heal people one after another that's what I would do what's up with all these deep questions I was expecting to answer like what's your favorite food or what's your favorite color legacy I'm not that high-minded I I don't care to leave a legacy I just want to live my life and take care of my family take care of my mom and my brother and sister and my family take care of DOM and that's it I think I think that's a beautiful legacy right there like to me legacy doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be placed in the history books you know like I don't care about that I just just want to be a good person a good friend a good in the future hopefully a good mother and I think that's the best legacy just be a good person with all you need to do and for me I hope I'm on that - leaving a good legacy what does a fox say what does the Fox say it says do whatever the Fox you want hmm thanks guys for all these questions I was I mean honestly I didn't know which ones to choose from you guys tweeted and facebooked all these amazing questions to me um if you want to see more of ask mish Jezz hashtag ask mish and ask me your questions and what I'll do is that I'll just add them to the list and film a few more so let me know what other questions you have for me and I'll answer them as soon as I can so I'll see you guys in my next video bye good luck [Music]

hi guys it's been a while a month since I've seen you I missed you all so much I'm so sorry I was traveling for a month straight now I'm finally filming and I want to share with you all the stuff I was able to find on my travels so let me show you all the goodies I was able to find so the first product that I'm going to show you is called a snail recovery gel cream it looks like any other lightweight gel cream you can see right here and it doesn't have any sticky feeling we have here a few masks that you can get so if you're not a big fan of snail try a snake revitalizing face mask instead it relaxes your facial muscle by softening expression lines green tea is also another popular mask it you can find in Korea we have two different green tea masks that you can get of course you can't go wrong with eye patches here are some other cool mats that you can find this one is I thought was really interesting and cute it's called kiss kiss lovely lip patch makes your lips softer and more kissable so it's kind of like a mini facial for your lips how can you resist this so cute now if you're looking for a way to give yourself rosy red cheeks and use these masks they're super cute they're made specifically to put on your cheeks and what it does is that they hydrate and they soothe your cheeks and they also make them a little rosy I thought these were adorable they're so cute besides skin care I was able to find a lot of cute makeup products that I'm going to share with you it's called too-cool-for-school here's a packaging for their CC cream a dinosaur Godzilla style on a building you can see right here this is a 2:1 one CC and concealer squeeze a little bit out so this is the CC cream and the cap the top it's a built-in concealer stick then this one is called break time lip tint bomb this is the cap oh it smells so good it smells like a popsicle stick Korea they're all really generous they give you so many samples these are all free samples that they are able to give out samples are kind of like the lifeline for a lot of these cosmetic stores because they want people to come back and repurchase and so even if you buy just one simple product they'll give you at least I think five samples so here are some of the samples that was able to get alright I'm going to show you the mascara that I got it's called pop-up mascara how impressive is this I freaking love this mascara because first off it's buildable so you can keep applying applying applying and you have a lot of playtime with this mascara and also what I like about it is that it's so smooth I'm going to show you the back actually in the packaging because I thought the way they did the bar code was really sick it's a building here's some other interesting products I was able to get this is um acne patches by next care so these little acne patches you put them over your acne kind of shrinks the acne down and you can also put makeup over it so you don't really see the bumpiness of the acne and there's also more acne patches from different brands this one is by skin food skin food is a very popular skincare beauty brand in Korea so you peel these patches off put it over your pimple you can apply makeup over it just leave it alone and this will also heal the acne and get it so that it doesn't fully form and shrink it and this one is by inners free these acne patches are even thinner than the ones by skin food so you can kind of see the thickness of the patches on this one the ones by inner spray super thin I mean there's thin as the plastic sheet it's insane this is the you cream called back to baby and you like do little babies looking at each other this is a mineral BB creams adorable because the packaging alone sells for itself you want baby smooth skin this is the BB cream you get Innisfree has beautiful color products first off I'm going to show you this lip gloss or this lip tint and I'm wearing right now this is their shadow pencil there's a few that you can get you don't want to deal with brushes you just want to highlight here and there so this is a great way to do fast highlighting blend it out it's really lightweight and the thing about it is that Korean girls they don't like to wear a lot of heavy colors heavy makeup they want more lightweight product lightweight texture and so just because you're not getting a lot of pigments doesn't mean it's not good quality it's actually what they prefer so the last product I want to show you is this adorable tony moly mr. smile patch smooth is out your smile lines within 20 minutes oh it's kind of weird it's like gelatinous it's like jello okay almost like mustaches try and lay down because they're gonna fall off because they're super wet like putting slices of jell-o on your face you know what smile lines are good shows that you've lived a very happy life alright everyone I hope you enjoyed all of the products I was able to find and discover in Korea and I hope it inspires you to go out and try

 If this Halloween you want something elegant,   I will teach you to recreate one of the most iconic aspects of Hollywood.   Ready for breakfast?   Prepare the liquid latex and place a little on a plate or cup.   The next? Some paper handkerchiefs   Start cutting the tissues.   It is better to make thin layers when creating this look.   Now, we start cutting each leaf, making irregular edges.   Now you have to put latex on your face.   I will not lie to you, it smells a little bad, like a dead fish.   Beautiful, I know.   Begin by applying the paper to the liquid latex before it dries.   And now you just have to keep adding more layers.   The secret is to make thin layers.   Do not worry because the paper is stretched.   It must have wrinkles and textures.   You must work fast while the latex is liquid   because it is going to dry.   Start applying on the nose.   You should be used to the smell already.   And if not, you're a zombie and you already smell like a zombie.   Make sure you do not cover your nostrils   or you will not be able to breathe.   But you can cover your lips.   Make sure you have eaten before and be well hydrated.   It will be difficult to eat and drink   unless you make a hole in the mouth.   In this tutorial I decided to cover my mouth.   When you're happy with the texture,   you must apply a little   of base or cream skin color on the paper mask.   Put it over your zombie mask.   Do not worry about covering everything   because we will add makeup.   Use a neutral eyeshadow palette that has dark cherry   or brown.   Load a brush and start applying   this color on the edge of your mask   to create bruises and decomposition.   Mix the color up to your eyes to make them look empty.   So, basically imagine that you can make yourself   the eyes vanished badly tonight.   Try hard.   Darkens the outline of the eyes and the sides of the face   to help recreate the appearance of skeleton.   If you want to look like you're rotting,   use face cream or sunscreen with high SPF   that will clear your skin tone.   A little touch on your forehead,   the sides of the cheeks, to enhance the cheekbones ...   On the nose to create more depth in your makeup.   With a red lipstick or facial paint,   I'm using EM Lip Gallery on "Love Me",   spread it over your lips and mask area.   Surprisingly, it feels very good.   Beautiful, and now with matte eye shadow,   begins to darken the edge of the wound   to create a 3D effect.   Tap the edges to mix the colors,   so that your wound looks more realistic.   Before doing this look, add fake nails to your accessories,   because they are going to be the teeth of your zombie.   Make sure you use the file to look like teeth.   You just have to cover the back of the nails   with liquid latex   and stick them on the lip area to create   teeth down and up.   When you have all the teeth,   prepare more paper,   and start putting a little more around the teeth.   When you have a good texture,   Start covering the paper with red paint or lipstick.   Place black around the nails,   and put it everywhere to make it horrible.   Darkens the rest of the makeup.   Remember, it's your chance to exaggerate, so do it.   If you want to increase the horror, put accessories on your eyes.   Now the grand finale.   Increase disgust with fake blood.   You can make it with red dye and corn syrup or buy it.   Start painting on the wound,   letting the blood down the neck.   Add a little on the teeth and, if you wish,   Add a little bit on the pearl necklace.   I hope they are not real pearls that you are using.   Put the tiara on your head,   if you're Holly Golightly of Breakfast with Diamonds,   or create another zombie character.   What zombie will you be this Halloween?   Leave me a comment to tell me and share your Halloween selfie   using #lookmish to find your look   Happy Halloween, have fun, and as always, good luck.   GOOD LUCK

hey everyone hope you guys are having an awesome summer if you are heading out to the beach or pool make sure to watch this video because I'm going to share with you my favorite beach beauty essentials so let's get started with the first and most important product you should bring with you sunscreen or sunblock I recommend at least SPF 30 when you're outside in the Sun especially if you're at the beach or pool I'm using here my current favorite sunscreen by kula this is SPF 30 and it's a sports sunscreen which is really nice because it's sweat resistant you can just spray it on sweat like a maniac and you're still going to be protected I prefer spray on sunscreen because it's easier and it feels really good too and after you spray it just go in with your hand and really rub the sunscreen onto your skin even like the strap area around here you still want to protect that because UV rays will still find a way to seep through so go on and spray on it don't just spray this on your face you don't want to miss your face or anything instead spray it on your hands just go in and then Pat your face right around your decollete your neck area and then you can just spray the rest of your body I recommend reapplying your sunscreen or sunblock every two to three hours if you're out in the Sun and it's directly hitting you try your best to stay under a shade or umbrella but you know what it's summertime it's kind of nice to just enjoy the Sun every once in a while but if you're doing this everyday definitely protect yourself and cover up alright if you're looking for a new way to protect your face without slathering on sunscreen I recommend my new favorite BB cream by linage so this is what it looks like and if you open it up has a really nice sponge it feels really soft and cushiony and bouncy I can't explain it like it's like a baby's butt well it's not your usual throwaway sponge so what you do is take the applicator you have to open this other airtight compact so inside here you have this sponge that's soaked in BB cream rather than using and squeezing out all this product on your hands and then just slathering out on your face you're just using just enough very little so with your sponge you just take it like this and you Pat it on top of the BB cream on top of the sponge and here you have just enough product to apply on your face so you just go in and you'll notice right away how even your complexion is going to look how easy if this is it's so lightweight it's so airy and the best part this is SPF 50 it also has right nning ingredients to help brighten your skin and layer this over and over again it looks really natural Thank You Rebecca Minkoff for designing this awesome bag um Jun zip C bag you should also be receiving Laneige BB cream but a trial set you can see it right here it's really nice because you get to try all three of the colors that they have they have it in light medium and dark and my favorite part drum roll you get a miniature version of the sponge very similar experience what you do is you take your sponge and you load it up and you just go in and you just Pat it on your face like this and voila we're finished I find that sometimes even I forget to use sunscreen lip balm very important when you're out on the beach so I have here Sun bum SPF 30 perfectly sufficient enough to use when you're out on the beach just layer this on and slather it on your lips it has aloe vera vitamin E and it smells smells like bubblegum all right you guys know I don't leave the house without filling in my brows even if I'm at the beach and I'm only there on vacation I'm still going to have a little bit of brow pencil on so take your favorite brow pencil and this one is by Ofra universal and just lightly feather in and fill in your brows you don't want to fill them in too much because you don't want it to look as if you have a full face of makeup and just follow your natural brow shape should be good again you don't want to look too done up you want to look nice without looking as if you're wearing a full face makeup I'm not a big fan of wearing eye makeup to the beach but I totally get it if you have to go for a celebration like a fourth of July barbecue party or a birthday party at the pool you want to look a little more jazzed up not too natural-looking so what I recommend is just taking a little bit of an eyeliner color or eye shadow and just using it on your lower lash line I'm using here a shimmering blue eyeliner because it's sweat proof it's not going to like smudge when I'm going into the pool or if I'm sweating and what you're going to do is you're going to take your eyeliner and stick with like a nice metallic or shimmering eyeliner and just line right under your eyes just follow your lower lash line and that will give you like a nice pop and again that's optional this is for those who are going to a party you don't want to forget your mascara stick with either a waterproof mascara or a water-resistant mascara Kors got curl your lashes apply generous coats of mascara and that's all you need and don't apply mascara on your lower lashes because they might smudge even if it is waterproof better to be safe than sorry right you never know there's no guarantee in anything because you have sunscreen lip balm on you can wear lip gloss or whatever lip color I don't recommend using lip gloss alone because it's not really good to wear when you're out on the beach and get sunburned so make sure you have SPF on your lips first before applying any lipstick or lip gloss I love lip glosses it's so easy to put on I'm so sexy looking your lips instantly look bigger and sexier and juicier one of my favorite things about the beach is Beach hair beach hair is so so sexy thanks to the saltwater in the air and in the water and it gives your hair this nice volumizing textured look there is a way to recreate beach waves and you can use a product like Marc Anthony's Beach spray gives your hair like really nice dreamy looking waves and what you do is that you wash your hair and it's damp just take your Beach spray and just spray it all over your hair and just let it soak in and just style it by like crunching it and twisting it you can create little twists is like this just leaving it and then just let it go and once it dries it should give it like a really nice natural beachy wave it's really pretty now you want to smell like you just came back from the beach so I recommend getting a really nice summery body spray or body mist spray it step through it or you can spray it directly on your body and that's all you really need nail polishes I'm wearing here SC summer 2014 collection in the color urban jungle which is this gorgeous off-white color and this beautiful blue called I'm addicted and seriously I'm addicted to this color it is gorgeous and it looks good with everything once you're done from the beach and you're heading home make sure to wipe everything off your face I know you might get really tired and you might not want to wash your face but definitely shower and just remove everything off your face I'm using here Olay Hendrickson's truth to go wipes so just take your makeup wipe and fold it over your hand like this and just go in and wipe it away once you're done with half of your face just flip it on the other side and wipe on the other side that way you get to use every single inch of this makeup wipe alright so if your hair is damaged like mine oil will save and repair your hair so take your favorite hair oil or you can use this one by Dove it's macadamia oil and you just need like a few drops not too much and just focus on the ends of your hair because that's where most of the damages are taking place will help nourish it back so it looks healthier and shinier alright guys so that's pretty much it I will see you in my next video thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you guys have a blast at the beach or pool make sure to take lots of pictures and share them with me and tag me so I can find them and like them and of course I'll see you guys next time I love you my good luck with everything bye you 
who knows what's gonna happen in the future I say live for today and dream for tomorrow because nothing is ever promised before applying makeup make sure your face is polished and moisturized I recommend exfoliating your skin twice a week if you have normal to dry skin three times a week if you have oily skin and if exfoliating is too harsh on your sensitive skin try using a gentle makeup cleanser instead try and avoid any products with harsh chemicals so that it doesn't irritate your skin final one that has natural ingredients and once you're all skin care DUP and you want to boost your makeups longevity use a mattifying face primer apply this product on any oily spots on your face like your nose and forehead really work the product onto your skin because you're creating a barrier between your skin care and makeup and once you're all primed up let's get started with face makeup using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream and with your clean fingers brush or my current fave cushion cream sponge apply your product evenly on your face and buff to blend out to create a smooth even finish perhaps in the future dark circles will be a thing in the past but for now concealer will do the trick find a neutralizing concealer that can cover up those dark circles especially for any of you who aren't getting enough sleep you want to find a product that will offer high coverage you'll find that you're going to use less product and it will look much more natural and less cakey okay so powder a way to seal your face makeup in unto the road some people don't need to touch them but for the rest of us filling and reshaping them can make a world of a difference don't believe me well watch a little flick here and there and watch your brows come to life with the black creamy eyeliner take the time to run the pencil along your lash line and feather it out and if you're going for a nonchalant look stop here but if you want to clean it up and give your line a nice edge use an angled liner brush and start smudging the line to sculpt your perfect liner shape try and find a creamy eyeliner for this technique or else it might get a little draggy and we don't want that not for your delicate eyes find the natural contours of your eyes but instead of marking it here go a tiny bit higher to elevate your eyelid shape I know this sounds weird but trust me take your blending brush and blend out the upper line for a softer look curl it up and sweep generous coats of your favorite lash lengthening mascara lashes are a nice eye accessory to play around with but some parts of the world people wear fake lashes every day it's part of their daily routine and that's why it's important for them to find fake lashes that feel like you're wearing nothing at all remember when I elevated my crease line higher well it's because I'm going to use my favorite eyelid tape by DUP it's a Japanese medical grade eyelid tape that's safe and gentle to use on the eyes I've been using these for years and I swear by them eyelid tape can give you the ability to transform your eye shape it's super easy to use and by the way I recommend doing this before makeup but I wanted to show you this trick near the end to give you the complete transformation using the tool provided insert the double sided tape into the desired crease spot you want to find where you want your crease to be and adjust accordingly to make sure everything is sticking properly it takes some getting used to but once you get the hang of it you'll have so much fun creating different looks almost done with the makeup let's add some color to your cheeks I'm going to use a natural-looking pink blush on my cheeks Pat to blend with your fingers or brush and for my lips I'm going to use a nude lip liner pencil and I'm also going to double it up as a lip color focus on the middle section of your upper and bottom lip this will give you the illusion of fuller lips and using the same pink color I had on my cheeks add this along the outer corners on your lips for that three-dimensional look and if you want dewy looking skin use this Korean skin illuminator it's such a pretty youthful look that will give you that playful finish because if your face is too matte it might make your face appear flat looking for the nails try an electric blue or any color with glitter for a fun party look finish off with a touch of sparkle on your lower inner lashline and upper lid and now we're finished and if you're intimidated by the futuristic trend a pair of metallic or holographic shoes is the ideal way to get in on the look without making a major commitment and if you're looking for shopping therapy guilt calm is the ultimate online shopping destination offering top designer brands up to 60% off and this is where I got my look take lots of pictures and have fun alright let's finish this look off with some manga inspired photos with my favorite man dum is there such thing as watching too much anime now special thanks to Josh Madson for capturing these moments good luck and I'll see you on my next video you

[Music] I always believed that we as people are multifaceted beings there's a part of me that loves darkness I feel like I can hide in the shadows and disappear like a mystery I know it's cheesy but this is my ultra ego you want to start off by pulling your hair back and using a cleansing wipe to get rid of any excess makeup dirt and oil on your face you want to start with a clean canvas as the temperature gets colder your skin's natural layer of moisture tends to dry out you can get rid of any flaky dry patches by using a microdermabrasion skin exfoliant warm it up in your hands and work the product onto your skin using the circular motion and once you're done just rinse it off your skin should look and feel polished after you exfoliate try to moisturize your skin or else it's gonna feel really dry and stiff you want to find a hydrating moisture mask to soothe your skin and now that your face is hydrated do the same on your lips coconut is a natural humectant which means it will help draw moisture in and keep your lips supple longer coconut is life all right moving on start taming those brows using a quality slanted tip tweezers try not to go overboard because you want your brows to stay full and natural-looking allow for some time before going out because there might be redness from the plucking using a cream highlighter apply this to the tops of your cheekbones you want to do this under your base to give your skin a natural dewy look if you want to look younger a dewy complexion will help get you there one of my top three favorite cushion compact is by I obey this compact is called the six second compact as they say one is sold every six seconds I wasn't paid to say that true fact the cushion applicator provides a light feathery coverage that won't cling to any imperfections you don't really need to cover your entire face just spot treat your face until redness and blemishes are less noticeable all right now it's time to break out your favorite concealer so I've been using this cushion concealer and at first I didn't think I would like it but now I kind of use it for everything concealing and highlighting for this one you can use it under your eyes as well as other dark spots on your face such as blemishes and the areas around your nose and mouth so just blend out your concealer until it looks natural now it's time to set your face by stippling on some pressed powder I have right here this Daltons you see powder it's pretty unique because it has green and pink beads to even out any imperfections and discolorations on the skin what's nice about it is that it doesn't have a cakey finish before you buy any powder read reviews or test it out to make sure it's not chalky the powder should look and feel silky and refined find a dark cream eye color like a deep plum or burgundy and warm it up between your fingers when I only have five minutes to do a smoky eye this is my go-to method apply the dark cream shadow or eyeliner directly on your eyelid lightly with your ring finger if you want more precision use your pinky finger keep dabbing to blend the shadow the more you blend the smokier and softer it'll look so now add a favorite pencil liner and using the back of your tweezer to hold the eyelid in place create small strokes like this along your waterline personally I think this is the easiest way to apply eyeliner it's pretty much foolproof and provides a nice smoky effect for more precision you can take a stiff angled brush to create that wing see you'll be a master at the smoky eye in no time tightlining is when you apply liner into the rim of your upper and lower lashline it feels kind of weird at first and your eyes might water but you kind of get used to it oh the things we do for beauty use a black felt tip eyeliner to punctuate the shape and intensity of the wing perfect on my lazy days which I have a lot of I skip eyelash curling however it's useful for opening up your eyes unless you have naturally curled lashes lugging when applying mascara to your upper lashes look down when applying it to the bottom look up or straight that way your body's natural reflex doesn't freak out when it sees this dick poking near your eye moving on to the brows using the taupe eyebrow pencil create feathery strokes to imitate little brow hairs using an angled eyeliner brush add fullness to the browse by fluffing them out when your boo is complaining that you're taking way too long to do your makeup tell them next time browse over bows when both eyes have the perfect lines use the wings as a guide to add more dimension to your crease with a small eyeshadow brush and using the same cream eyeliner intensify the depth of your eyes okay let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the cheeks find a dark bronzer that's three to four shades darker than your skin color to carve out your cheekbones with a fluffy angled brush to keep your contour as natural-looking as possible use a light hand and try not to get too close to your mouth add bronzer along your temples to accentuate your face all right back to the eyes find a glittery eyeshadow and with your pinky because it's super tiny pop the shimmery eyeshadow along the inner third of your eyelid blending with your ring finger this will help bring more magic to your eyes by now my lips are nice and soft thanks to the coconut balm and it's ready to be painted black before I apply any color make sure there's not a product left on the lips you want to remove any lingering concealer or foundation with a wipe giving yourself a clean smooth canvas to work with okay now the moment of truth break out the darkest lip color you have start with the biggest areas on your lips around the center of the bottom and top lip it's kind of like painting within the lines so start with the largest areas first from there carefully apply the lipstick to the outline of your lips and it's totally fine if it's not perfect because we're gonna clean it up later if you want more precision use a small lip brush to adjust the lines for a cleaner shape very nice alright moving on to hair if you're not using argan oil in your hair you're missing out all the nutrients lost during coloring treatments and heat dialing can be restored if you use oils like argan oil the Royal Egyptians were known to have beautiful silky hair thanks to oil what you want to do is warm up the oil between your hands and finger comb through your hair for that silky finish [Music] and now it's time to transform into my alter-ego there's a lot of beautiful temporary tattoos that you can find online or on Etsy find your favorite design that speaks to you if you don't know exactly where an important part of the design is going to be placed what I like to do is cut a notch in the paper before I apply here I cut out a little notch in the middle of the neck application so I know exactly where to Center it and once you have it on and it's nice and centered Pat lightly with a water soaked paper towel or sponge try to make sure that it thoroughly wet if you want to check to see if it transfers peel back one side slightly and if the tattoo is revealed you can safely peel the whole thing off from here just add more tattoos where you see fit tell your own story through these tattoos the art and design should inspire you don't worry they're only temporary so you can experiment as many times as you want with zero commitment now my alter ego look is complete if you're gonna recreate your alter ego look make sure to tag me in all your pictures so that I can see them and like them I love you dreamers good luck [Music] [Music] you 
shamian koala hi gorgeous I have here a beautiful look for you to try out to ring in the Lunar New Year it's the year of the goat or sheep a year of promise and prosperity before we begin we need to have a fresh clean face so take a cleansing wipe and gently prep the delicate area under your eyes making sure that your face is completely clean we need our skin to be free of any oil in dirt and if my under eyes are feeling puffy I'll use a treatment like this to help perk them up it's kind of like a cup of coffee for the eyes yep thank the internet for my late nights let it sit for a few minutes and then just wipe it off with a wet clean tissue okay now that my eyes are awake one last step before moving on to makeup is priming the skin find one with a built-in moisturizer a primer helps create a smoother skin surface minimizing pores and fine lines however if you're a teenager you can skip primer you don't need this stuff so just apply this baby all over your face or just spot treat on any problem areas like an oily t-zone now you can take a dab of concealer and gently apply under your eyes you want to be extra gentle because this area is very delicate all right if you're looking more alive than you are good so we can now move on to our favorite foundation or BB cream for a while I've been substituting my foundation with a cushion compact like this one this was a gift from Korea come tsamina instead of using your hands or a brush cushion compact has a very specific application with the cushion sponge provided dab it on the sponge soaked and BB or CC cream and very lightly dab on your face like foundation BB or CC cream from Korea is very different than BB and CC cream from the West the coverage is light to medium and the finish is dewy so I recommend trying different formulations before settling with your Holy Grail so continue dabbing the cushion sponge all over your face until you even out your complexion want to know how to cheat a flawless complexion use a lightweight highlighter there are two parts to healthy-looking skin complexion and luminosity a highlighter can help punctuate this by giving you that boost the key less is more you need just a little small dabs here and there on the high points of your cheeks and forehead and tip of the nose and Cupid's bow ready to blush with a shimmering peach blush load it up with your brush and locating your cheekbones lightly dust the brush all over this area building up the color for this look you don't want to look as if you're wearing blush it should look as if you're really blushing alright it's time to move on to the eyebrows if you have sparse brows like myself here use a matte powder that's a few shades darker than your own hair color and lightly fill in your brows if you need more definition use a brow pencil and sketch little hair marks with your spoolie brush blend and soften any harsh marks [Music] onto the ice take a matte taupe eyeshadow color and contour your lids sweeping the brush back and forth make sure it's blended we're going for a soft look [Music] now take a deeper terracotta color and deepen the outer corner blending and diffusing the color into the creases with a fluffy shadow brush with a smaller brush use a shimmering sunset peach and build the color up starting around the inner corner of your eyes and blend out this is gonna help warm up your eyes tap a small brush into a vanilla highlighter and very carefully blend into the inner corner of your eyes and along the lower lash line this will help bring more light to your eyes and dab whatever is left along your brow bone for extra definition going back with the fluffy brush soften and blend the colors together using an eyeliner in a plum color carefully line your upper lashes making sure to stay as close to the lash line as possible mmm everyone looks good with the winged eyeliner so go ahead and sketch that line out make sure it tapers up because this will help lift up your eyes and if you want a fuller lash line tight line your upper waterline this might feel uncomfortable at first but believe me it will look good no pain no gain if you want to brighten your eyes take a white eyeliner and gently line along your lower waterline and add a touch along the inner corners of your eyes and if you want a more subtle option try a peach or a rose gold eyeliner you know what time it is time to perk them lashes hold your lash curler for a few seconds on each eye vadhana so if you're lacking in the lash dept leg myself here use a lash primer to give your lashes that boost it's like stilettos for your lashes coat your lashes from root to tip making sure to flick the wand out at the ends now you can take your favorite jet black mascara and place it over your lash primer to complete the lashes apply generous coats just skip the lower lashes and instead mix your taupe and terracotta colors together and staying as close to the lash line as possible shadow in this area now it's time for some glam yes honey but real talk here at the start of the new year fireworks banging pots and pans basically making real loud noises right after midnight was said to help ward off any evil spirit and bad luck instead of fireworks and bang and pots and pans I'm gonna use this glitter liner as a symbolic gesture just place a little around your inner corners to add a fun accent lighting up your eyes now for those lips in Chinese culture red is a symbol of happiness and good fortune so for this look I'm gonna rock a matte red lip okay so this lip liner has an ankle tip it's actually pretty useful because I can create any shape and line with ease if you want a bold look over try a little over your Cupid's bow and make the lines angled very carefully fill your lips in focusing around the edges and now it's time to top it off with a red matte lipstick so fill in your lips I'm get it if you have a dark plum lipstick or eye shadow softly build around the corners of your mouth notice how this creates depth giving it a darker touch blend the color with a brush and then reapply the dark plum if you want to increase the intensity and once you are happy with the depth reapply the red lip color to top off the look for extra credit use a flesh tone pencil and sharpen the edges for a flawless look mmm we're not done yet you want to smell as good as you look so dab a bit of your favorite fragrance or essential oil on your wrist and gently press them together for a lasting effect I want to know a trick that will drive that someone special crazy apply a little behind your ears and along the sides of her neck mm-hmm for your hair try a volumizing oil spray working towards the end and just finger comb through your hair to distribute the product evenly finished yay the year of the goat or sheep is all about being thankful for the things in your life and staying positive about where you'll go in the future so are you ready to ring in the Lunar New Year with a fresh start I know I am thank you I love you and good luck [Music]

hey again so this is video two for best of 2015 products first video was all things beauty now we're moving into haircare fashion and accessories tech products apps TV shows and beyond this video is going to be pretty long so if you don't have time to watch the entire video you can click on the different categories right here and I'll take you straight there so I'll have it listed right here and you just click on it take you straight there there's a lot of fun things for us to go through so let's start with the first category I love new me hair products because they're well-made they're beautiful looking and it's probably one of the few curling irons that I've used that really gets hot in fact I have a few scars right here it really shows that they really engineer other products to be at a certain temperature so if it's 300 degrees it's most likely going to be 300 degrees this is a great product too because it's a three-in-one so you can actually change out the head and put in a smaller barrel or a bigger barrel and switch it up so you can get a variety of different curls my third video I ever uploaded or fourth or fifth was this tutorial on how to make romantic curls and I used the same brand fabulous they're nano titanium Flatiron is really special because one when you close it you notice right away that it's a true flat closed so you can really get every single hair and flatten it secondly it's titanium based which a lot of people say that it's better to use on your hair than ceramic plus it makes it shine too which is nice so here's a funny story about this hair dryer that everyone at rice bunny studio loves and here's a reason why it's so janky looking it's because it's been used so many times but because it's been broken and there's like tape on it and there's cracks on it it shows a lot of wear and tear but it still works great you have to have a really well engineered hairdryer you want something that's going to work really fast that's quiet that's going to dry your hair efficiently this product does all of that all in one first thing I want to talk about is good hair good hair fast America moist works really well because it does exactly what it says on here three minutes all you need three dollars three minutes miracle moist hair and it works really well besides this product which is great if you want to rehydrate your hair especially if it's always dry because maybe your coloring it a lot another great deep moisturizing conditioner is by mane and tail dang this conditioner is like legit it's probably one of the few conditioners that I noticed right away when I was blow-drying my hair that it felt really soft and my hair was hydrated again and it's also really inexpensive too which is a plus besides that if you're looking for a more natural way to hydrate your hair you can actually try cream of nature this is their argan oil leave-in conditioner which has zero alcohol so it's not going to dry out your hair you spray it all inside your hair you leave it in and the next day you wake up your hair looks like a magical unicorn but before you activate it you have to shake it so that's the only way for it to work and then Shh spray your car hair if you have very dry coarse hair like myself you're always looking for a product that's gonna leave your hair looking beautiful especially after a blowout and you want it to last with days Neutrogena is triple moisture is going to bring you closer to that holy grail look there's a lot of ingredients in here that will leave this film on your hair that's going to polish it and you blow-dry it it dries it actually locks everything in within like day five even though your hair might smell a little weird your blowout will look amazing so just dry shampoo that is moving on it's a 10 this is their miracle leave-in product this is how I use it so after I wash my hair I spray it on the ends and then I start blow drying it and I notice right away how just how it just leaves my hair feeling really hydrated it doesn't leave any excess residue or anything it really feels silky and smooth and I notice right away how healthy you're looking my hair feels and how much stronger it becomes after like a month using this so we're looking for your miracle leave-in conditioner it's a 10 it's a 10 so on top of you is this incredible charismatic loving passionate hairstylist you could tell he really cares about ingredients a lot of the ingredients are inspired by like his mother's heritage and his family where they're from and like beautiful exotic ingredients and most importantly like the outcome of the hair looks great Octavio made this great sea salt spray that has algae extract you want to build up your hair and you want to like get it beachy looking with the waves and adding that beautiful texture this is a great product that will help you get there what I love most is the algae extract and how that also adds in a lot of nutrients back into the hair and it just makes it look and feel healthier Carol's Daughter makes this really incredible split end sealer it coats this conditioner over your split ends it doesn't glue it in but it coats it so it seals it in if you're in the process of growing out your hair something like this could really help out too last but not least is the Victoria Secret hair hi shiny serum I don't know what's in this product but it really does give the shine that it says is it shiny it's shinier than this pigtail this gives a slight hold put it on your hair and you have like straight hair you can have straight hair for days you another brand that I love and a huge supporter of is chlorine this is their hair mask and it's mango flavored you know mango scented even though I want to eat it because it does smell like mango puree I leave it on for five minutes and even within five minutes my hair transforms when I blow-dry it great product moving on to another incredible leave-in conditioner that everyone on my team swears by is Moroccan oil actually I think it does make your hair healthier it doesn't feel heavy at all you leave it on and you rinse it off it's called intense hydrating mask for a reason because it really is intense and a little does go a long way I normally when I use something like this I don't cover my entire head I just cover the bottoms because this is really where most of the damage is your newer hair starts here older hair is here so you want to add majority of it here and just a little bit up here but you don't really need conditioner on your roots because that could actually clog up your pores so I like to just shampoo it and leave the natural oil that's going to come out later and then on the ends that's where I add all the oils one of my team members swears by using this Eva NYC she uses the speedup blow-dry spray right after using the Moroccan oil hydrator her hair has never looked better in her life I kind of agree with her because her hair has been looking really good this year but it works for all hair types it's great if you want like a really beautiful hydrating blowout spray this on your hair and blow out your hair and it looks amazing so two products that you should work in conjunction with each other this fragrance is called Elizabeth and James and they work together with this dry shampoo company and they made this it smells really good it actually smells like perfume so you spray it on your hair damn it really does smell good I want to spray this like all over me you want to get something really nice for someone that has colored hair and they can't really wash their hair a lot but they want their hair to smell nice skip them this dry shampoo I mean this is just a beautiful gift the packaging is amazing the scent is divine and dry shampoo itself works really well too without drying out your skin it doesn't leave that nasty white cast either if you've never heard of nu nu you need to drop everything right now and go to their website in you and you comm check it out see some of the fun fashion pics that they have holographic skirt super anime looking Styles fashion I mean they they really play on the tumblr vibe that you're seeing right now most importantly they mesh a lot of the trending is that you see in Japan they take a little bit of that and they merge it with the internet generation style so if you're trying to find a really cool clothing website for Gen Z or millennial nu nu is a great shop to look at when it comes to sunglasses no one does it better in my opinion then cocoon breezy if I want to buy something really substantial in the sunglasses genre I want to go to one that is designed by someone who's really passionate about sunglasses and also unique designs because when you want to invest in good sunglasses you want to make sure yours stands out so Coco and breezy look at this they just understand contours and shade they know how to like mix really beautiful elegant lines with curves and everything just looks good on your face I can put on any of these sunglasses and each one has like a little bit of a different personality than the other ones but they're all like statement pieces and speaking of statement music festival season is going to be around the corner and people just want to look different and unique so when it comes to psychedelic anything I feel like holes I wear knows what's up they were the first to make these kaleidoscope sunglasses and a lot of them that they had at first were really hard to look through because it was a prism effect so when you wear them everything looks like a prism it looks like you're looking at the world through a kaleidoscope these new ones that they made are much easier to wear because you can actually see through them and it still looks badass there's a lot of great temporary tattoos out there in the market but there are some that you should invest in because when it comes to really great flash tattoos you also want it to last long and you want it to look like a real tattoo I found that paper self makes some of the most realistic looking tattoos that look like you actually have a tattoo one arrow tattoo is also a great brand and by far my favorite out of all of them is by terrified the reason why I liked how to fight so much is because you can customize your own tattoo and they come in so many different shapes and sizes and illustrations so you really have a lot to work with if you want the most variety check out tattoo by speaking of trendy patches are still in there going to be even more trendy this year I believe as long as it has a smooth surface you can apply these hipster patches on anything and everything and they're so cute I think the designs are really fun and really relevant and current to this generation if you're into giving your eye a makeover you should actually play around contacts you'd be surprised because a really good colored contact lens can really change the look of your eyes the most realistic looking contacts that I still think are the best and I know I've been supporting them since my seductive vampire video is solidify the quality is amazing they are hard to get because you have to buy it online however I think it's worth it you'd be shocked if you really clean it and you keep it in good condition it can last up to a year I normally don't like teeth whitening because sometimes I feel like when I use it my teeth just feels really weak and brittle and sensitive but glow does the exact opposite it comes with a gentle to use teeth whitening gel you apply it on and then you turn on your glow device that looks like something that Apple would make I mean it's really beautifully designed it's simple you charge it via USB turn it on those blue you put this in your mouth and you leave it on for eight minutes and once it beeps it means you're done you remove it and your teeth looks at least two to three shades lighter so if you're trying to find the perfect gift for someone who drinks a lot of coffee and tea and they want white teeth glow is something I highly recommend it's a great brand a great product and it just looks really stylish and cool for the music lover in your life you want to get them something that is going to elevate their space so jawbone makes my favorite mini jambox which is great because I like to bring this with me whenever I'm traveling if I go to a hotel sometimes they don't have the best speakers I can just pop this out activate it via bluetooth and play my favorite music and it's so small and portable and it's really easy to charge sometimes I forget about charging this and I have it playing for two weeks straight so it's a great product for anyone who loves music and they want something really cool 2016 is going to be the year where oculus rift is launching Morpheus is launching so there's going to be a lot of 360 devices and headgear that's going to be out which means there's going to be a need for 360 content in pictures and videos so you're probably wondering well how can i film and make 360 content Rico theta has solved that problem for you this little device here that you see that is smaller than my cell phone can take 360 photos and videos at an ease it's really easy setup you turn it on pulled it out and you just take a picture video but I think the most effective way to take 360 videos or content is to put it on a selfie stick you can activate this on your phone via bluetooth so you press it and turns it on it takes a picture video and yeah how it's able to take 360 pictures and videos is because it has to ultra wide lenses on both sides so it captures everything and anything so be careful with what you capture with this if you have an aspiring cinematographer or director that you really want to impress look no further than this gorillapod this is a great tripod to use if you are hobbyist in filming or you want to do it professionally I mean is great to bring on the go it's a simple setup you can manipulate in any way you can put the GoPro on here you can put a Rico theta on here you can rig your camera on there it's built in a way where you can actually wrap this around practically anything so let's say you're hiking or you want to do like a really beautiful landscape photo but you need height but this is really small you can actually wrap this around a tree and it works as a great tripod this is a great tripod that can adapt to any situation and environment and which is why it's highly recommended on this list so a lot of people ask me Michelle what might do you use to do your voiceover very easy I use the blue Yeti you hook this up plug it into your laptop computer iPad whatever and you can adjust it to do a voiceover you can adjust it for a music session there's different adjustments where it can record different sounds in different environments I like to use this as a voiceover because it's just really easy and also the sound quality is really good for the price last but not least even though it's not really technology but it kinda is it's old-school technology is this Polaroid camera aka Instax film by fuji film this is their Hello Kitty Edition and I got this in Japan obviously because it's Hello Kitty and because it's super cute it's a great gift to get for you know the little princess in your life or Prince if you can't find the Hello Kitty Instax camera anywhere or maybe the price is a little too high you can get the normal insects mini so this is their normal one it takes the same exact pictures as the Hello Kitty one only difference is that one has a Hello Kitty body the other one is the normal one made by Fujifilm and they come in a variety of different colors and they're all super adorable looking if you're forgetful like me Tyl will save your day so tile is this little nifty attachment that you can attach to your keys you can attach this to practically anything like a book bag and you can find it by linking it to your phone so if you've lost something with this attached to it you can easily find it you guys know how much I love my chromecast I swear by my chromecast they've made an audio cast version where it can take any stereo and turn it into a Bluetooth so you plug this in and then you can Bluetooth your music on there really easy and it's great to bring with you on the go when you're traveling or you're visiting a hotel or pretty much any place you want to crash a party and take over their stereo system just plug this in there and go for it this is the tilt ribbon car charger it looks cool because it is cool it doesn't tangle up as much because I know a lot of people with car chargers wires are everywhere doesn't look as aesthetically pleasing so if you want to get something that is well designed and also it works really well too it has an extra USB Drive here and the charger part look no further tilt makes the coolest stuff if you're a huge runner you're very active and you love listening to music these urban ear headphones are amazing because you can put them in your ears and they stay on they're not going to fall out and the quality is exceptional to sound quality's great besides the fact that the quality of the actual product is great too it's really sturdy definitely check it out when you're trying to find really good pair of headphones for someone who's very active and on the go let's move on to app recommendations there's so many cool apps out there and so little time that we have so let's start off with star walk - I'm a huge fan of space I love astrology I love learning about planets and star constellations I think there's so much more for us to learn about it and this app called star walk - is really great because besides the fact that you can learn about different constellations they also have a great tool where you can learn about a planet or a star what it's made out of and imagine like a Wikipedia but more visual a lot of people ask me Michelle how do you edit your Instagram pictures I have my ways of doing it but enlight really does help bring me there faster and light us a great photo editing app where it does so much more than just photo editing you can do a lot of complex graphic design on it it's intuitive it's so easy to use it's really fun to use - so if you want to find a photo editor that's not basic enlight is your tool and you can play with it and adjust it and really turn it into your own art piece if you're that person who has to Shazam everything you should check out this other app called SoundHound where it's like Shazam but it's very community oriented so there's a song that you really like and you listen to it via SoundCloud it will find that song it'll also curate a list of songs that are similar to it or people can curate it and you don't have to just go to an iTunes link you can find a song elsewhere - oh my gosh guys I love Airbnb there's something about renting from someone's own home or their own environment it feels more real and authentic and Airbnb is a great app where you can find all of these like unique hidden treasures that people have the app is just very intuitive easy to use if you are someone who just loves traveling if you have a little bit of wanderlust in you Airbnb is a great app and it's free I think so it's great crossing road is like a Frogger but upgraded and not as basic you play as a chicken and you can choose the different levels and scenarios and it's just a great way to pass the time but this is what it looks like it's so cute yes play oh I mean I think I'm gonna die oh no I okay I just died I remember using uber like a year before anyone else started using uber and I knew that this was going to be the future of Transportation and sure enough it's true uber is everywhere and it's a great way to get transportation if you don't have a car if you can't drive if you're too inebriated the fact that uber is really affordable for someone who needs transportation that's great plus like everyone gets their own private driver it's kind of cool I wasn't sponsored by uber to save any of this a lot of times I don't have time to cook for myself because I'm doing a million things and I don't always want to order takeout but there are restaurants that I love eating at but sometimes I don't want to go there and wait in line or do a reservation get all dressed up just to eat a really good meal so coast mates has solved all this for me I use post mates to deliver all of my favorite meals from different restaurants that I don't personally want to go into because one deal with traffic - I just don't want to go out and three I'm kind of a homebody I like staying home and I'm totally cool with someone bringing food to me imagine having your entire year in one second so this app one second every day does exactly that it takes one second out of all the videos that you have on your camera roll and it compiles it into a playlist basically and it plays one second of every day as long as you take at least a few seconds of something that day it's a fun way to do a vlog without having to commit to a blog you ever had someone that owes you money or have you gone out to eat and you paid for the meal because someone else didn't have the money and they can like pay you back later well now you can make sure they pay you back later with this app called venmo so if you have to pay someone back this is a really simple setup you download this app and you can send the money through the cloud into their bank account and magically they will be reimbursed less drama right there's a lot of app games that are fun than a whimsical that are kid-friendly sometimes you want to play something that's really intense because maybe you're that person which there's nothing wrong with definitely check out the room it's not as crazy as Silent Hill but it has a similar vibe where you have to survive so it's a puzzle based game where you have to solve these puzzles and basically get out of the room TV show recommendations boss Berger is one of my favorite primetime shows right now because I feel like my family is similar to them like everyone has their own unique quirks and the dialogue is amazing Tina is my favorite character but then again gene is really growing on you too I love the show I recommend it to anyone who's looking for a really fun family-friendly show where they can watch it with the people they love and their family members another great show I wouldn't say it's family-friendly well actually it could be but it's probably my favorite animated cartoon show right now called Rick and Morty it's oh my gosh I don't even know where to start if you're a huge fan of Back to the Future and you love the dynamic of Doc Brown and Marty Rick and Morty kind of created very similar characters where you have someone like a Doc Brown and you have someone like a Marty and it's a grandfather grandson where they travel together they partner together and they travel through different dimensions on their crazy adventures if you're looking for a show that has witty dialogue that has crazy intense plot lines and very original and also really scientific and smart and clever Rick and Morty is going to be your show Tokyo ghoul is my favorite anime this year it shines a lot of light on duality in general so if you're looking for like a great psychological thriller something that's very action-oriented Tokyo ghoul is a great anime to check out and it's become like such a hit in Japan like it's inspired like a whole pop culture movement out there I'm sure like people who are huge Tokyo ghoul fans will agree with me that it's a great anime to watch if you're still waiting for season 2 of attack on Titan that's not going to happen for a while you can watch Tokyo ghoul and that was satisfy you until season 2 of attack on Titan last but not least Adventure Time Adventure Time is oh it's such a magical show it's magical it's beautiful it's kind of tragic at the same time if you know the underlying story it's so much bigger than what you see on the screen it's probably the most beautiful cartoon show right now that I think is artistically beautiful and the coloring is amazing the characters are really dynamic and fun and you really do feel like a kid again when you're watching Adventure Time and besides feeling like a kid there's a lot of underlying adult themes it's really thought-provoking so on the surface it looks like a kid show but it's so much more than a kid show yes price point does matter but it's really how we're fine the quality is it feels luxurious 
hey guys I have a special guest here that wants to see hi to you guys her name is Kat the human look Missy hi the first tip I want to give you guys when it comes to making new friends is having a common interest with someone there's so many people in this world and I'm pretty sure you guys walk past hundreds of people all the time how do you know that you have something in common with them how do you know of that person's going to be your friend you don't that's kind of the whole point of life is not knowing what's going to happen and not knowing who you're going to meet but I think if you open yourself up to it and you are showing people that you have a certain interest that you like there's going to be certain people who are very like-minded like yourself that's going to pick up on it don't underestimate the power of having a sense of common interest because it really does bring people together doesn't necessarily mean you have to have everything in common if they're speaking to you if they're making a comment like oh my gosh I love that song oh my gosh I love your shirt tell them where you got it I love your jeans - where did you get that BAM already right there you have common interest with that person so what do you do from there you engage and that's the next step you're not going to be able to make friends if you're not the one actively engaging with them to ask them questions I mean if you're actively engaging with them they're going to engage back with you and that's when you can really make that connection and that's step number three connect with that person you can add them on Instagram or Facebook and that's when you will know if this is someone that really wants you in their life or vice versa give them an email I mean you don't really need to exchange numbers right away can just be as simple as hey you have Instagram can I follow you is that cool I think it's polite to show that you know you're asking to follow them friendship is not just one thing there's different levels of friendship but how do you know if this person is more than an acquaintance is when you're constantly texting them or you're chatting with them online your video chatting with them you're sending them links and messages if you're honestly dialoguing all the time that's when you know that hey you know what this person might be a cool friend that's when you can go to step number four which is exploring go out with them go try a new restaurant go watch a new movie with them that's why it's called exploring it's because you're doing something new and fun with them and I also feel like you know when you explore something with a friend it's memories that you're creating together and the final step is sharing share secrets share an intimate moment after you share something with that person that's when you can really establish trust like I trust you now because I shared something really important to me and I shared it with you you respected it and now I can trust you and once you establish trust it's like the best feeling ever friendship is not simple there's a lot of hard work a lot of time and commitment it's like a part-time job you have to put your hours and you have to commit to it or else it's not really a friendship it's a two-way thing I'm not saying every day you need to do something with them but I think send them a text message or an email saying you know I'm thinking about you because sometimes life gets in the way and when it comes to life things will change you will change you're gonna constantly evolve you might think I would never do this one thing but then you do it and you change or I'm I never believe in this one thing but then you believe it and that's what happens people change and when people change friendships can change unless you change with them and so just put that in the back of your head when there's gonna be a time where you're questioning your friendship and don't blame it on yourself because that's part of life you're changing things will change and you can't get mad at that because you have to kind of just go with it and accept it and move on you know enjoy the fun moments you had together don't dwell on the past and also don't beat yourself up if you don't have five million friends that's not the point it's about quality not quantity I'd rather have one amazing best friend than 100 fake friends and that one friend you have hold on to that person love them and respect them and if it's time to let go because things change just let it go and just keep moving forward so best of luck to you guys I love you so much good luck and I will see you in my next video and remember even though we are friends online and we may not have ever met each other I do think about you guys I pray for you guys I send positive thoughts out to you because I truly believe there's goodness in every single soul deep down if you keep digging there's light inside there and we have to remember that everyone carries light within them we just have to seek it and find it and inspire them to shine even brighter that was cheesy too bye guys I love you bye cuz I wouldn't have it any other way you were waiting down the aisle you wanna go wee-wee shame come on oh yes show your butthole in my face that's lovely bye okay so I've hair all up see that's the downside of having a cat I have like a million cat hairs on me and I have in my mouth cat livers you can understand so we hitched a ride little buddy and crossed roads electricity and she told us powdered children yeah she told us powdered cheese 
When you were a child, who did you want to be? I wanted to be like my mother. She didn't wear a cape, or shoot lasers out
of her eyes. She was someone who wore a smile and made
people more beautiful. I remember telling her clients how I wanted
to be just like her when I grow up. "You'll be poor if you become like me," she'd
tell me. "Become successful, like a doctor, then you
can make money and be happy." When you're a child you don't really understand
the concept of money. You just want to be happy. "But money buys happiness," they say. From an early age my ambitions were driven
by the expectations of others. And being the people pleaser that I was, I'd
spend the rest of my youth chasing after my mother's dream, becoming successful. When I was old enough to help my mother out
at the salon, it was then when I realized how she did more than making people look beautiful. She made them feel beautiful. She was always smiling. But I knew behind that mask she was hurt. Every other night my parents would fight and
it was always over money. I wanted my family to be happy, so I grew
up determined on one day becoming successful. Senior year of high school, while filling
out university applications, an epiphany hit me. If I pursue my studies in medicine, I'd be
spending the rest of my life fulfilling someone else's dream instead of my own. My intuition led me to fill out an application
for art school instead. I felt so selfish, but I had to confess to
my mother. She was heartbroken and scared that as an
artist I'd struggle to make ends meet like her. But I promised her that I'd find a way to
take care of our family while still pursuing my ambitions. She trusted in me and gave me her blessing. The first day of art school was special because
all new students were given laptops. This became my window to the world, a vital
tool for all my creative needs. But soon enough, reality would remind me how my
dreams came at a cost and I needed to make money. I found a job listing for a beauty advisor
position. I completed the interview but got rejected. Yeah, it sucked at first. But then I was reminded how God, the universe,
whatever higher power you believe in, has three answers to your prayers: Yes, Not Yet, or I Have Something Better. God was right because that 'Something Better'
happened to be the very first beauty video I created. I was sharing my everyday natural beauty routine. Nothing groundbreaking. I didn't expect anyone to watch it. But after checking back, I couldn't believe
all the viewers and comments pouring in. That one video changed the course of my journey. The early days of YouTube was magical. No one was really making videos for money. But once it was possible for creators to monetize
their videos, I was able to leave my part-time job and turn this little hobby into a thriving
career. I did it, Mom! I became successful and I was happy. My channel renewed my sense of purpose. Eventually my hard work paid off. And after saving up enough money, my family
was taken care of first. I felt so fulfilled. Creating these videos didn't feel like work. It felt more like a dream and I didn't want
to wake up. My growing channel caught the eyes of
higher-ups who grew intrigued. It wouldn't be for long until I'd be swept
away by opportunities and promises. I said my goodbyes and left my family's nest
to pursue the American Dream in the 'Wild West.' It was hard to leave my family because they
were all I ever knew, but my intuition told me to go and I had to follow. Moving to a new city by yourself can feel
isolating. And in the city of dreams I found myself surrounded
by people who heavily influenced my career. They had big plans and kept me busy until
that was all I ever knew... busy. The taste of success was like a drug and I
couldn't get enough. I figured, the more productive I am, the more
successful I'll become because money buys happiness. I grew to understand how happiness came at
a cost because I had to honor what I signed on the dotted line. At that time it was worth it. I was able to retire my mother and take care
of my family like I promised. But it wasn't enough. I still had more dreams to cross off my list. Once I was a girl with dreams who eventually
became a product... smiling, selling, and selling. Who I was on camera and who I was in real
life began to feel like strangers. Money can bring out the worst in people and
I was no exception. My insecurities got the worst of me. I became imprisoned by my own vanity and was
never satisfied with how I looked. The life I led online was picture perfect but in reality I was carefully curating the image of a life I wanted, not had. Money buys happiness, they say. But all dreams come to an end and I'd have
to wake up to face the harsh truth. The road to success is not only paved with
failures, but you also become a target. I had to battle through several lawsuits from
people who wanted a piece of it. This nightmare took a toll on me. It nearly broke me down, but I wasn't ready
to give up. So I kept myself busy, taking on more projects
and more work. "Become more successful and one day you'll
be happy again." Staying busy was my only way I was able to
cope with all the stress and anxiety. It helped to numb the pain. Years would go by and I find myself becoming
more isolated and disconnected from my family, friends, and you, my viewers. I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do or who to talk to. I felt so alone and I had too much pride to
let you see me at my weakest. I felt so depressed and I didn't know why. I wanted to be forgotten so I began posting
less online. During one of my sleepless nights I found
myself watching one of my earlier videos. I'd forgotten how genuine and full of life
I once was. It was such an innocent time. Before the money, before the fame. I felt like somewhere along this journey I
lost myself. Was it because of money? I spent my whole life chasing after success
only to find myself running away from the very thing that mattered... myself. My true self. In the end, I wasn't fooling her because deep
down I wasn't happy. I've grown to learn how money can buy many
things, like peace of mind, comfort, status, anything but happiness. At this moment, I was feeling so broken, but
my inner child wasn't ready to give up on me. She reminded me how it's never too late to
start over. Although money can't buy happiness, if there
is one thing people wish they had more of, it's time. So that's what I did. With my money I bought myself more time. Time to find myself before I lost myself. My intuition told me it was time to leave. So I followed. They say, "If you want to fly, you have to
give up everything that weighs you down." And I wanted to soar. I packed up what I could fit in a suitcase
and left. I left everything - my dreams, success, the
life I built and worked so hard for... all behind me and didn't look back. I took refuge in a place where I could find
meaningful time to heal, learn, and grow. It was in nature where I found peace again. No Wi-Fi, no distractions. Just me, nature, and my thoughts. This world I was disconnected from embraced
me again and nurtured my broken spirit back to health. Echoes of all the noise and anxiety that once
polluted my mind began fading. With my mind at rest I was able to reflect
and confront my ego. Memories of my blurry past began to take shape. I was reminded of all the trials I went through
and how those trials forged me. Every experience, choice, good or bad, molded
me to become the person I am today. But they don't control me. Recognizing this gave me the power and freedom
to finally decide what I wanted from my own life. And I wanted to be happy. You can't buy happiness, but you can create it. Right then and there I made a conscious choice,
an effort, to create happiness around me. I did so by letting go of anything that was
holding me back and inviting things that would elevate me in every way. I wanted to learn again so I became a student,
and the school was life. Growth isn't for everyone. Some people want to stay the same forever,
but not me. I was ready for growth. With all the time I was able to buy, I spent
most of it learning, dreaming, creating, and exploring the depths of my curiosity. It wasn't happiness I was looking for. It was the truth. My quest is still not over. There's still so much more for me to discover
and learn, and that takes time. So what now? Truth is, I don't know yet. I just want to create and that's what makes
me happy. Back then I was just someone who was showing
you how to look more beautiful. Now I want to show you how to feel more beautiful. Music by Kristofferson Song titles:

hi again welcome to pillowtop number seven where we're going to talk about a lot of work-related things alright the first topic is how to have a healthy work-life balance second is dealing with work gossip and lastly women in business and what it means today how do I deal with gossip friendship issues within a group without causing a snowball of drama if you think you're the peacemaker in your group of friends your role is really important because sometimes friendship can kind of go off the railings because maybe there's a misunderstanding and a lot of times it is a misunderstanding so if you come in bringing up the drama and bringing it forward to everyone's attention as long as you keep it secular and you remove your emotions from it I think that's going to help ease the snowball effects but anything that involves calling someone out it's never going to be easy it's never pretty because you're you're basically calling out someone's ego and there might be a small battle but sometimes you have to go through that battle in order to overcome it and it doesn't happen unless you bring it up how do I limit gossiping I think the best way to limit gossiping is to learn new things to read new books to watch new shows to open yourself up to new things that are not about people because sometimes we can get so hung up on people their personal life what they did and it's so easy to just talk about their mistakes they made or what so-and-so said and what he or she wore there's this quote that I love I can remember great minds discuss ideas average Minds discuss events small minded people discuss about other people I can totally understand why people like doing it's like junk food you know you eat it and it tastes so good but you eat too much junk food it's going to start catching up on you you're gonna feel it you're going to feel more fatigued you're not going to feel good because that energy that negative energy will start attaching itself on to you so my best advice is you know be a great mind don't be a small-minded person Michele how do you feel about more women now being part of business normally run by men and hashtag power to women right flexing emoji well I feel great it's awesome it's great to be born in this era and we're going through a time now where because we have access to the Internet because more and more women are tech savvy and they're learning really fast and they're adapting really fast that's why there's more businesses that are being developed by women that are being brought up by women I'm not surprised in Vietnam a lot of businesses are owned by women the women there have a lot of power they hold a lot of power they buy everything they run the entire household a lot of them prefer working and they would prefer the men to stay at home take care of the kids I think for the longest time a lot of people thought that women could never be in the business world because they don't know how to run it they don't know how to manage it but I believe that times today are proving it wrong women running women focus business it just makes more sense because they know what they want they know what they're producing they know the team that they want to build we've been living in this era of of this society for way too long way too long where women are shunned they're not given the voice or the platform to pursue their own career to pursue their own education to pursue their own life that they want to lead and if I can do it I didn't go to business school I came from a mother and father who are both immigrants didn't speak English so I had to learn English on my own had to learn it through TV and through school and had to learn how to speak Vietnamese at home everything that I know of today I had to teach myself I had to learn from other people bring on mentors and also adapting silencing my mind and just observing quietly and adapting to that even when I was doing YouTube everyone thought I was crazy everyone thought I was stupid like they literally said oh that's so dumb you can never make money on YouTube why would you do that why not just go get a corporate job I followed the beat of my own heart and that beat led me here is it a bad thing if you are only going to school and not getting a job I think it sucks if you go to school and you rack up a lot of debt and you can't get a job I think that really sucks I also think it sucks that you can't get a job because you don't have education when you're in a precarious spot like that it all boils down to really your determination and what you're willing to do to adapt into this new world faster internet is changing everything you'd be shocked if you learn one specific skillset that a lot of people need and they can't just have a robot replace you'd be surprised at all the opportunities that can be opened in your way because you are a master at the skill set this applies to everything not just makeup or art I mean there's going to be a lot of startups that are coming up and so there's going to be a need for people who know how to crunch numbers who know how to program and who can code things really well when they're building websites or apps or other applications and all these things you can learn online you can learn how to edit online you can learn how to draw online you can learn anything online I have a very labor-intensive job how do I keep from looking so tired and being too tired to have fun on the weekends when I work I mean I could tell you like the tried and true method sleep more drink water yada yada yada but you already know that I already know that and even I don't do that I mean you're looking tired you'd be surprised what a little bit of a peach eyeliner can do on the waterline what a little bit of glimmer in the inner corners of your eyes good brows can do good hair even sunglasses too you can cover up tired looking eyes with some really cool sunglasses if you do look tired maybe you are tired and perhaps you should look into meditation that doesn't really take a lot of time to meditate you can do 10 15 minute meditation in the morning and feel infinitely better throughout the entire day believe me I do meditation all the time and I feel so much better after I do my meditation and my breathing exercises drink more green tea instead of just coffee all the time because coffee can be too much caffeine and you become too dependent on it and maybe that's why you can't sleep so you're just drinking too much coffee do things that are kind of boring that you know you'll fall asleep - so if reading a book makes you fall asleep then have a book by your bedside and just start reading it and then you'll fall asleep faster instead of going on Instagram or watching Netflix videos I have a dream of becoming a CEO of a fashion design company is starting the business myself the only way to get there I believe you don't necessarily have to start a business to go into the industry of fashion and designing and if you do want to become a CEO it's a day-to-day work if there's like a ship you're the captain you're the one who is leading everyone you're making sure everyone gets there it's not just a title that's cool it sounds sexy CEO I'm a chief executive officer of this company but that means you have to oversee everything you have to oversee finances creative hiring people firing people Human Resources dealing with profit loss or profit growth I mean it's all based on you and your vision so if you feel like you are a person with a strong vision you have great leadership abilities you can lead a group even if they don't even like each other and that means you have the qualities of a great CEO but you don't necessarily have to be a CEO to run a business or to even be involved in a meaningful way in a business there's other grades c-level jobs you can do like CCO which is the chief creative officer or CEO who you're going to be in charge of operating everything chief operating officer that's why internship is so instrumental whenever you're trying to figure out your place in this work environment because you can kind of shadow someone and see and and just adapt and learn from different workplaces and environment and pick and choose what you think is tailor-made for you before even choosing a title or a role CEO or being this or being that person I think the most important thing out of everything is finding the right team figuring out the personalities that you can work best with what do you do when you start a business but it fails well hopefully you can learn from all the mistakes all the good things and all the bad things and reapply it to your new business or reapply it to your new job or your new career destination look at Apple Apple is one of the most prestigious bankable companies in the world and they had a lot of failures they had a lot of launches that didn't work they had a lot of things that just didn't click with the audience in their customers but that didn't stop them from having a thriving business you learn way more when you fail than when you succeed that's something I can guarantee you on ok I think those were all the questions thank you so much for submitting them guys and thank you so much for watching I hope these tips and advice can help you guys make the best decision for your life best of luck with everything namaste I love you guys I'll see you my next video bye you

hey guys if you're going to be at any parties or music festivals this look will definitely turn heads I was inspired by Holi an Indian festival that celebrates the arrival of spring most of us don't wake up looking perfect well I just want to look awake so I like to apply soothing under eye patches because it will not only help reduce puffiness but rehydrate the skin if you're going to be partying into the night use a pigmented primer that has a slight shimmer to help even out blotchy skin tone and if you already have naturally flawless skin jelly this can work on its own without foundation as for the rest of us mere mortals use your favorite foundation to even out your complexion okay so I've been loving this BB cushion cream by lineage it's kind of different but it has a really cool sponge on sponge application but it gives you a really smooth finish and if you're going to be dancing outdoors you'll need a product that will feel light and fresh on your face using here my trusty old great cover-up concealer it's time to put that ring finger to action apply on those dark circles and blemishes to cover them up it's like Photoshop in real life and once you've perfected your skin powder over to finish off your face makeup sweep the powder brush on your face to set your makeup so that it's budge proof and take your powder with you for touch-ups or just bring blotting sheets because this look has a bold eye I'm trying to keep my eyebrows on the thinner side it's going to help balance everything out draw little hairs on your brows to give the illusion of fuller brows unfortunately not all of us are blessed with full brows but that's why eyebrow pencil was invented to help out the rest of us okay we're gonna need more primer it's always a good idea when using highly pigmented shadows to prime the lids as well as the top and bottom lash line I primer will help boost the color intensity of your shadows speaking of color intensity let's use this electric palette by urban decay using here a bright blue eye shadow load it up with an angled eyeshadow brush and line the eyes with a bold color of your choice this will act as an outline and define the shape I want to create for the whole look next take a complementary color I'm using hot pink here and outline the eye socket blending up and out as you go notice how I didn't use any bright colors on the very center of my lids this will give you a more wearable look to intensify the eyes use a bright pencil liner of your choice and apply on the waterline all the way from the inner to the outer corners now it's time to perk up your eyes curl the lashes and apply generous coats of a buildable mascara and now on to my favorite product you guys know how much I love my Kyoto scooter of stick conjure the sides of the nose as well as the jawline to make your face appear slightly more angular contouring helps add structure and definition to the face so wherever you add your contour lines will help receive that particular area adding a slimming effect and just blend it out with your fingers and now your face will have more definition in photos with so many colors going on in the eyes just apply a little bit of a matte bronzer in the hollows of the cheeks to give you those supermodel cheekbones and just Pat to blend remember a little goes a long way same goes with the lips a nude lip color will look best with fluorescent eyes and if you're really feeling bold just go for a stronger color ah with spring finally here it's time to use self-tanning lotion it's a fast and healthy way to transition from winter to spring without burning yourself in the Sun and if you're looking for a fun spring textured nail color try this one out by nichole OPI two coats is more than enough don't be scared to try bold colors just like colored pigments makeup washes right off get messy be fearless and have fun good luck you 
hi everyone so this is episode number four for pillow talk with special guest Karen hi do you guys remember Karen from summer goals she was the really cute girl the one that did this probably a lot of it topics are how to deal with failure rejection sacrifice and living by your parents standards okay okay good alright this is by relaxed to nature when we hear the word rejection it usually means something unpleasant but is there a positive side of rejection sometimes we tend to feel like rejection is a bad or negative connotation because that's what society displaces on us however I always had this belief in this mantra that rejection would be a blessing in disguise rejection is just one way of directing you to the right place that you need to be everything happens for a reason so if this doesn't happen right now then something else is meant to happen I heard this one saying that really resonated with me and hopefully it resonates with you guys on God or the universe always has three answers to any of your questions or concerns it's always yes not yet or I have something better so at least a Chan asks how would you tell your parents about wanting to live your own life and not something they would expect from you I think a lot of times we feel like our parents don't understand us right but if we don't communicate with them what we want they really won't understand us it's true I know my parents were immigrants so I knew like they went through so much and they didn't want us to go through the same hardships when I graduated from college I was told that I needed a nine-to-five job imagine trying to explain to your pants like hey mom and dad I'm going to quit my job now and make youtube videos I think for them to really understand why this means so much to me is that I showed consistency and the things that I want I'm not just saying hey mom dad I want to become a youtuber or become a painter but instead I show them that I'm doing it that dedication shows maturity and once you show maturity to your parents that's when they can start believing and you trust you it's so true so rashik oh she asked how do I deal with failure it's depressing when I can't live up to my own standards as an example that I can get from myself as them when I first started my youtube channel I have this like expectation in my mind like how I want my videos to turn out but if I kept having that expectation then I would not keep uploading things because I would just be disappointed every single time I just need to keep practicing and practicing and practicing and each practice you can you know give yourself a pat on the back like wow I did it you know like I I stepped out of my comfort zone to achieve something that I couldn't before so instead of thinking of a failure think of it as many accomplishments you didn't get you to that fun pat on the back many accomplishment all the time he thought it he's doing that to keep it going failure invites change that's how I see it and change could be a good thing age I guess I'm scared about going to college and realizing I don't like my major or career decision please help it's okay like seriously it's okay if you don't know what you want to do even up until the point you graduate it takes time I mean for some people it takes them a lifetime to find their passion College should be like a introduction to a new world for you to explore you're going to learn a lot about being on your own being a responsible adult being responsible for your time I feel like college teaches you a lot about time management like if you have a class at 8 a.m. you have to wake yourself up you're not going to have your parents here we can you up I know for a fact that right before I went to college I thought that it was going to be a lot harder than high school but it is easier because you don't have to go to six classes in one day you might be going to two to three different classes yep and you end up having a lot of time in your day and you can pick your teachers yeah you get to pick your teachers enjoy this moment because you're not going to be around this many creative like-minded people in college because when you go out into the real world it's really different it's actually harder I feel like people actually say oh the real world is really hard and I never really understood it until I had to go into it so enjoy it please to choose are sweeter asks how do you pursue a career and art well being recognized for your intellect love your voice I think society often discredit or doesn't give enough credit for creative people and if you just look around you're like everything around you look at the magazines or like clothes or packaging right every room yeah there's someone that thought about how to put all that together whenever there's design there's a sense of intelligence behind it but it's another form of intelligence that's not about words or writing or books or science its visual or its sound its audio or its taste if you want to pursue a career in art there's so many different paths you can take you don't just have to be a painter you can be a social media manager that focuses on the creativity of the social media creative director um you could also be a stylist I mean there's so many different facets of creativity don't just limit yourself to one final question is from Eleanor poit she asked Michele how do you deal with feeling isolated and lonely cool love you there's nothing wrong with learning how to be comfortable by yourself in your own thoughts good people will attract good people I think feeling isolated is only temporary because you'll eventually be attracted or you'll find good people to eat to surround yourself with and if anything I think it's a blessing in disguise because you filter out the not-so-good people on their life and so you only have like a handful of good people in our life and those are the only people that you do want in your life anyway if you want to find people if you want changing in your life you have to invite that change and sometimes that change can be scary but you need to have that challenge to push you into a different direction for your personal development so that's pretty much if guys these were all the questions thank you so much for asking these great questions we hope you guys enjoy the video and hopefully they were helpful I read the comments on the summer goals video and as you see thank you and love you yes subscribe to Karen's channel I will add the link here and Instagram here there there bye everyone best of luck with everything we love you bye 
Hey guys! What's up? So today I'm gonna show
you how to create fuller luscious, juicy looking lips 
without a needle So let's begin with my first tip! And if
you don't have it you might need to visit your local dentist It's a toothbrush. And of course your
favorite lip balm. The one I'm using here is rosebud. Very very popular and a cult
favorite. With your toothbrush, load it up with the lip balm or vasoline petroleum jelly, whatever you have around
you. Instead of brushing your teeth start brushing your lips in a circular
motion like this. You want to make sure that your toothbrush has a harder bristle instead of a softer
one because you want it to be hard so it he can exfoliate it properly Like this. So keep scrubbing it I'd say scrub it for like a good two
minutes. You don't want to overdo it. So just wipe everything off and Ooh, this is definitely bigger. Should be
good to go. But if you want this to last a little
longer than an hour or so I recommend either using cayenne
pepper or cinnamon powder. Either or will work because it's going to swell up your lips and your lips will probably look fuller
for a good two to three hours depending on how hard you rub it in. Just doing a test on your wrist first
because you want to make sure that you're not allergic to either the
cayenne pepper or the cinnamon powder. So I like to take a
little bowl like this. You can either use your
favorite extra virgin olive oil like this one right here, or again
your lip balm. Pour either the olive oil or mix in a
little bit of the lip balm into your bowl. And you really don't need that much just
a little bit A little goes a long way, and you don't wanna waste good olive oil I'm going to use the cinnamon powder to
show you how it works. And you really just need a teaspoon. I like to just guesstimate and pour a little bit in And that looks like a teaspoon - good
enough So it's gonna look like this. And you're going to mix up the mixture. Just start scrubbing your lips in a circular motion. It's going to promote blood flow to your lips and kind of give it a stinging sensation and swell it up. So with your toothbrush start scrubbing
it on your lips I think my lips are going to look super huge at the end of the video because this is only, I'm still in
the first tip. A little tasty, interesting, spicy. And the
cool thing is that everything I'm using here is organic and it's
all-natural, which is really nice. Okay I think that is enough. You'll know
when you're done because you're gonna
feel that stinging sensation It's not painful it's just like a nice little sting, you know? It's kinda like when you're eating spicy
food and you have some of the spiciness on your lips It's the exact same feeling. So with your paper towel again just wipe off. So here you can already tell that my
lips, they look a little fuller So this already is going to look
fabulous and amazing and it's all-natural. and if you're not much of a DIY person and you prefer buying then check out Bliss' pro tools series. This is their fabulous pout-o-matic. So I'm gonna try it out and see if it works. It's battery-powered It looks like a toothbrush but it's
really for your lips. You can hear it, it's a machine and it spins. You use their fab-u-lips sugar lip scrub. Kind of load it up on the brush. It's getting really interesting. Press the power button to power it up and juicy fabulous lips here we come! It wasn't as abrasive as my toothbrush. The bristles on this brush is extremely
hard. You can scrub the plaque and the floor with this thing. Tip number two is good old fashioned lip liner. The trick
is to find a lip liner that matches your natural
lip color. And I'm using here Makeup For Ever
aqua lip. This is my favorite lip liner pencil. Alright, so this technique is called
overdraw and when you're overdrawing what you're really
essentially doing is lining outside your lips just a tad bit. You
don't want to overdraw too much or else you're gonna get super crazy looking lips. Enough talking, I'm gonna show you. So what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna take my lip liner. and you want to make sure it's sharpened. The first thing you wanna do is smile. Either smile like this or do this. Because you want the surface
of your lips to be flat so that it looks taut and it's easier to try to draw over it. So I'm gonna do a little smile. And then start outlining just a little outside your
natural lip line. And depending on the shape that you want
to create you can either create a strong cupid's
bow or soften your cupid's bow and rounding it
out a bit. Essentially, you know, just have fun with the shape. I recommend experimenting and playing with different
shapes because you never know what's gonna look good until you try all of them. So you can see right here I drew a
little outside my natural lip line. And it doesn't look crazy it still looks
natural. What you want to do next is fill in the lips. So make sure to bomb up your lips, but remove a little bit of it because if you don't your lipliner is gonna slip and
slide and it's gonna stick on. So go ahead and fill in the rest of your lips.
And here we go. Can you see the difference? So after this what you want to do is you
can either add like a nude lip color, and this is going to
enhance the fullness of your lips or good old fashioned lip balm and just
focus on applying this on the center of your lips instead for a nice
three-dimensional look. The next tip is a very unconventional
way to not only plump up your lips but to remove any fine lines and
wrinkles. So if you're a huge smoker and you stop smoking or you know you want to
get rid of the smoker lines around your lips or as you age you lose a lot of fat and
volume around you lip area, so it starts
deflating which, you know, unfortunate, but there is a way to help reproduce collagen and also remove the
fine lines. Honestly I love this trick. I've been
doing this for the past six months and already my lips have looked completely
different and The trick here is Dermaroller. You can
either go on Google, Amazon and look up Dermaroller. I
don't if you can see it from here but these are microneedles and what you're
doing essentially is your micro needling your lips and it's creating little microscopic
tears and holes on the surface of your skin or lips.
First I like to roll it vertically and then horizontally, then diagonally on both sides. Also, you know, have an even pressure. You don't wanna press too hard because
its gonna hurt. It's like as if you were kissing your boyfriend and he had a very rugged beard - that's what it really
feels like, which is not a bad thing I'm mean, if you're into that stuff. But, you know, no pain no gain right but not even than painful. So after you rolled your lips and you've microneedled it, from here you can start adding serums, you can add oils, or you can even
use something that I prefer - lips enhancing products. It's by
Jouer. Jouer, Jouer? Did I say it right? Jouer, Jouer? Just let me know in the comment below if I said it right because I'm really bad at my French. Really good stuff though so I like to then, after I my microneedle my lips, then I apply a generous amount of this product
all over your lips like this. So just apply this on and sleep. And if you want to get a
little fancy schmancy with you lip product you can instead use a collagen lip mask
like this by Satin Smooth - their collagen lip plumping mask and they look like this. I'll show you how ridiculous it looks but it
does work beautifully. And again, do this at night cause you know, can you imagine doing this before lunch, you'd look ridiculous. So put this over your lips. This is why I recommend using it at
night when you're sleeping so it's like this. If you're gonna be sleeping with your lover I recommend not wearing them because they look a
little scary Your lover will thank you cause your lips will look awesome and fabulous and yes I said lover because I don't know if you have a boyfriend, husband, whoever it is it's someone you love. Tip number four is
really easy. You can either use a concealer stick
or a lipliner that is a flesh tone color. So I'm using here Mac, but you can also use NYX wonder pencil You can use concealer too, really
depends on what you have in your makeup bag or makeup kit. But I'm gonna use the combination of
both cause I'm gonna to show you how this technique works. So focusing right on the center of your
lips, what you wanna do you is fill in this area right here. You can see already that my lips have
this beautiful three-dimensional look. And you wanna add a bit more on the bottom of your lip. This will pop out your
lower lip giving you more dimension and highlight right along your cupid's bow. So now
that you have your concealer or lipliner in place, what you want to do
now is blend everything out. You want to keep the lightness along the
center of your lips. So don't over blend, just feather out the
edges like this. And if you want you can bump it up a bit too Blend blend blend. So now that you have everything blended the last step is to add a nude lip gloss over
your lips. Alright. We just faked fuller looking lips thanks to concealer pencil or a flesh
tone lipliner and lip gloss. I'm saving the best for
last. So tip number five is to use a lip enhancing suction cup tool like this. I found this
one online through Amazon and it's called full lips. It's
a lip enhancing product. It's a very simple
device, there's no machine and it's not battery-operated or anything
and this is what it looks like. So what this does is that it creates a vacuum around your lips and that way it promotes blood flow and it
brings all the blood into your lips, instantly
plumping it and I would say that this out of everything, this will last the
longest. So if you want to play around with fuller looking lips, you want to take like a cute selfie or even if, you know, you want to get
surgery or lip injections but you don't want to commit, you wanna see
how it looks first, this is a really great tool to use before you commit. So I'm gonna show you how it works. You can either put water around the edge and this will create a seal. I found another technique that
works just as well Putting this over my lips, sucking the air out, leaving it for, I would say, like a good 10
seconds. I'm mean you're going to feel the blood rushing into your lips and it's going to start
feeling very very swollen. It's not like the cayenne pepper, I mean this is a different feeling and once you're done, what's gonna
happen is that you might get a little scared because it's pretty much stuck on
to your lips. What I do to instantly detach it is I
blow the air back in and remove the vacuum. You wanna see some crazy big gigantic Angelina Jolie lips? Watch. Ooh, woah. That really worked a little too well. Va-va-voom lips. No, but look you can already see how much bigger my lips look. And it's all through  creating a vacuum. Simple science can solve anything! I wanna see how far I can take this cause it's actually really fun. This is really fun to do with your girls and you can
take some crazy pictures afterwards. And snapchat it. Ahhh, they're so big! Sorry, okay so what you gonna see a lot,
oftentimes you're gonna get this redness around your upper lip area so it's gonna go away. The finished lips,
fuller looking lips Full looking lips! Duck face, honey! Alright guys, I hope you enjoyed this
video. I had a lot of fun giving you these demos, even though
some parts were very awkward. I hope that you find them helpful and

looks. Show me your juicy lips by tagging me either through Instagram or Twitter so I can find your pictures and like them. I love you so much, thank you so much for

Because you want your surf... you want to make sure that you want to make sure... so before... before you start overdrawing blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah doesn't even matter cause it works, that's all I care about. So... (cough)... So wear this at night 
how do you overcome the desire of staying home and doing nothing when there's so much you want to do because you don't know where to start the most important thing before you start anything is you have to figure out what exactly you like there's so many incredible exciting things you can do offline and it's just waiting for you it's waiting for you to step outside your house so I think you kind of just have to step outside your comfort zone and do something that excites you that you're passionate about what have you found your calling but you're too scared to pursue it for financial and time reasons so oftentimes when you want to pursue something you have to destroy everything destroy your ego destroy your doubt destroy these things that are holding you back from building something new if you're just taking care of yourself you do have an advantage because you can take a lot of risk but there's more and more people involved and more people you have to take care of you do have to be a little more strategic and careful when planning out anything jobs your career if this is just you and you have a great idea but you're scared to pursue it because maybe you're scared of failing that's all on you if you really do believe in yourself first you can achieve anything how should someone go about finding their calling if they can't narrow down their interest if you have multiple interest I think that's a plus because you can start fusion a together take something that a trait that you really like an interest that you love and remix thing it into something else sometimes I feel like society will try and push you to focus on only one thing but I really do believe that's that's such a small way of looking at things life already is so vast and there's so different components and variations of what life has to offer why should you just choose one thing I feel like you should just make what you want you should choose what inspires you and then remix it in your own way and do it in a meaningful way that makes you happy because ultimately that's what matters question is I'm finishing college this year and I don't have any direction I don't know what to do in my life you and everyone else in this world I think it's nice to have goals they're aspirational however if you want to plan out your entire life it's not going to leave any room for spontaneity or that magic to happen you should look at what society is missing where do I go in life what do I do well let me ask you this what's missing in life that you feel like is missing because ultimately those are the three most important questions that we should ask ourselves every day Who am I where am i from and where am I going how do you define yourself because once you know who you are where you're from then you can have a better idea on where you're going how do I deal with the fact that I usually think only negativity it's hard to change my thoughts to be positive we should look at your environments what's around you is there a lot of dark colors is there a lot of dark sounding music do you have a lot of negative people around you the environment around you can really truly dictate your behavior how you think a lot of people who live in Seattle you know sometimes they don't see a lot of the Sun and they get sad seasonal affective disorder sad it's so crucial for you to build a safe environment around you I know not all of you will have the luxury to do so because maybe your parents maybe they don't have money for you to build an amazing dream room or maybe you don't have a home maybe you're living from place to place that's a case and that's why it's so important to have good music around you your favorite candles your favorite blanket that you always have with you something that elevates you because if you're always surrounding yourself with negativity you will become your environment if you are in that environment where you just always feel sad move go outside more change up the music you're listening to something more upbeat something more elevating maybe even meditate you can change the way you think you can change the world around you why do people like having more friends means you're more popular like on Facebook and Instagram I talked about this in a few previous pillow talks defining what it meant to have success online a lot of people today I don't know why they really define success by how many numbers of followers and likes and thumbs up they get those are just numbers it doesn't mean anything you can have 50 million followers on Instagram or YouTube but at the end of the day of tomorrow Wi-Fi just shuts down what exactly do you have that's why the most important thing is health family happiness love shelter food and when I see people who care about having lots of friends on Facebook and they equate that to real friendship well I kind of feel sorry for them because out of all your 5,000 friends how many of them are actually going to show up on your birthday numbers of friends numbers of likes and followers online defines absolutely nothing in real life so Nicole so Yoko she asked I only have a couple of best friends and I tend to want the same attention I give them any advice for preparing for losing a friend give them this test have them take a test called the five love languages take the test because then you can figure out what love language they want and what love language they give so for example if you're the type of person where you know that you are loved by the person who gives you quality time that's a language however if you give love differently so you give love by touching them hugging them touching them making them feel loved that's another language too but it's not the same as what you want to receive so I wouldn't recommend losing that friendship I just say just let them try that test and see what their language is because you might not know how they speak the love language differently than you thank you so much I hope these tips and advice and my own personal experience can help you make better choices for your life and so forth and hopefully you guys can also continue passing on the good vibes and helping as many people as you are led to I always see you guys on the next pillow talk I love you you 
hey guys so welcome back to mastering the art of and we're going to be covering hair removal so there's so many options for you to choose from and this video will cover all of the different ones that you can play around with so let's get started let's start off with basics shaving when choosing the right razor you just have to determine how many blades work best for the area you're shaving sometimes less is more and if you're feeling adventurous try guy razors if you want to give shaving a break and try another method that leaves your skin smoother longer try a depilatory the formula has chemicals that melt each hair follicle at the base until your hair becomes easy and painless to wipe away the one tricky thing though is that you need to follow the instructions on the package and stick to them if you leave it on longer than recommended you could really burn yourself it's recommended to go without makeup for a few hours and avoid using any harsh face products epilator x' don't get this confused with depilatory even though they sound quite similar an epilator is a handheld device like this with a bunch of tweezers that move rapidly around a rotating drum to pluck any unwanted hair sound scary but hey it works try to find one that's rechargeable and waterproof so that you can use it on the go or in the shower the more tweezers epilator has the less painful it is to use epilator x' work by removing each hair at the root so that you stay fuzz free for full six weeks until your next hair growth cycle just be sure your hair is at least an eighth of an inch long so that tweezers can successfully remove your hair the trick is to move at a steady pace so that you get every last hair if you're looking to make your hair less noticeable hair bleach is a great alternative you apply it similar to how you would a depilatory leave it on for the amount of time it says on the directions rinse away the product and follow up with mild facial soap to neutralize the chemicals when at-home methods of hair removal just aren't cutting it sometimes you need to turn to professionals sugaring bwt here is going to give us a demonstration so sugaring which you can get professionally done is based from all-natural ingredients it's less messy in traditional wax if you're brave enough to do it at home here's a recipe on how to make your own what you'll need 1 to 2 cups of sugar 1/4 cup of lemon juice a quarter to half a cup of honey and this is optional a jar of course measuring cup skillet and spatula put all your ingredients into a pot or microwave safe Bowl and heat the mixture on high until the sugar fully melts and begins to bubble stir frequently and make sure all the sugar crystallizes and dissolves completely remove it from the heat and let it cool until the consistency mimics thick honey waxing is a great way to remove hair quickly and efficiently for your brows traditional waxing with strips is a lot more common since it's such a small precise area for a clean crisp brow waxing is often a good route to take however if you prefer a more natural look to your brows writing could be a better option it's really all about reference threading is a very popular method from the Middle East and will give you the most beautiful sculpted brows make sure your technician cleans and preps your skin one switch to move with the thread is all they'll need to plug any unwanted hair at the base here you can see the results of waxing on the left eyebrow and threading on the right now on to some hardcore hair removal electrolysis is done by inserting a micro sized aluminum needle into each hair follicle and zapping the cells that control the hair growth with a small jolt of electric current this process destroys each hair at the root and each hair is pulled out individually by a tweezer electrolysis is actually the only process recognized by the FDA as the form of permanent hair removal that can be more effective than laser hair removal if you receive consistent treatments are now scary but it works if you're looking for a less painful alternative to electrolysis laser hair removal is a great option the best candidates for laser hair removal are those with dark hair and lighter skin so it's best to get consultation done beforehand to see if laser will work for you like electrolysis laser works with each hair growth cycle so you should receive treatments every six weeks in order to see 80% reduction in hair the laser shouldn't feel more painful than a rubber band snap and this one at laseraway uses cooling air to make a treatment more comfortable typically it takes around six to eight treatments to see permanent results but you may need a touch-up every few years hair or no hair you're beautiful no matter what but if you want to get rid of it I understand guys I know sometimes it might be a little too much maintenance so I hope this inspires you guys to just try some different options but I mean it's optional good luck guys 
hi beautiful Jake is a makeup and I were inspired by the art of the tarot cards so we created these magical looks for you to try out the first look card number one is inspired by the magician the second look card number two is inspired by the High Priestess before we begin I wanted to shine some light on the history behind the tarot cards and what it represents to think these tyro cards are evil is a misconception in a stigma left by the irrational witch hunt days and other Dark Ages to say their sole use is to tell fortunes is also incorrect some texts refer the tarot cards as a language infused with the knowledge left to us by our ancients and our ancestors I read some fascinating parallels between the way tarot cards and cathedrals both encode knowledge in their own ways interestingly playing cards first entered Europe in the 14th century from Egypt and guess what they recalls Pharaoh key also known as taro in Italian everything you see on the card represents a metaphor with a deeper meaning when you read the tarot cards you can find philosophical social poetical and astronomical information I feel like this enigmatic language is similar to how we use digital abbreviations emojis or stickers to communicate for example lol could mean anything unless you understand the context as fascinating as these cards are we can't deny how beautifully illustrated they are if you're wanting a cool tone look with shades of silver and icy blues Jay Kissel will show you how to recreate the High Priestess look start off by using a hydrating primer to refresh and firm your skin once you're done use an illuminating under-eye concealer to brighten up your eye area continue blending and move on to brows try and keep the finished natural but maintain a defined shape brush them outward and begin filling them in working from the center to the outer end of your brows you can also use a bit of concealer to shape out the edge for a more polished look for eyes be sure to prime them with an opaque nude color like this set your base with an eye shadow and work the color into your crease now taking a deep Navy shade place it directly on your crease above the inner corner like this leave a gap in the center of your crease and from there place more color on the outer half creating a wing and just keep blending take your time and build up your color carefully once you're done find a dark purple shade and place it on the outer corner along the lash line work it up towards the navy color repeat this along the lashline and on the inner corner as well once you're finished take a teal eyeliner and place it directly on the center of your lids continue patting this vibrant violet color on your eyes and blend lightly into the crease to diffuse the colors if you have a white liquid liner draw a bold wing in the crease thickening up the line as you go bring the look together by using this lilac shade to connect the wing to your lash line using a black gel liner frame or inner corners and from there use the excess to smoke out the color on your lower lash line to complete the eyes tightline using a waterproof black pencil and apply mascara to your top and bottom lashes and if you're feeling it add a set of false lashes for that dramatic finish moving on to your face use a cool tone contour to chisel out your cheekbones and top it off with this iridescent highlighter with a purple dual chrome finish and to balance out your look keep your lips neutral with a nude lip liner and liquid lipstick J kissa is slaying in this look because she has the perfect balance between dark and light the high priestess symbolizes your inner voice and reminds you of your true power from within if you want to create the magician look start with a completely clean face and prime your skin blending out any excess primer with a duo fiber finish and once your primer has set break out a lightweight concealer to even out the skin tone under the eyes and around the corners of your mouth lend this out and then prime your lids try and be careful to not tug around the delicate skin around the eyes highlight under your brows with the nude eye shadow that's a shade lighter than your skin tone from there apply a metallic purple color on your lids and blend it along the outer half of your eye into your crease once you're done find your favorite liner to create an intense liner look place it as close to the lash line as possible and start applying for more precision load up the product onto the angled liner brush and from here you should be able to create a shapely wing moving on time to find a maroon shade use this color to smoke out your lashline area and taper it underneath your wing to create more depth lightly diffuse the color with a fluffy brush and smoke out the lower lash line take a small brush and add a rose gold color along your inner corner blending it along your lower lashes to finish off the eyes prep your lashes with a lash curler to perk them up and apply a few coats of your favorite mascara you want your lashes to be lifted so try and find a waterproof mascara because they help retain the shape better moving on to brows lightly fill them in with a taupe shadow slightly defining them with a waxy brow pencil for the finishing touch to illuminate the face use a highlighting powder find a finish that has micro shimmers not chunky glitters the finer highlighters will give your face that perfect natural glow to contour I choose a neutral bronzer to give a hint of definition without being too harsh give your cheeks a rosy blush along the outer edge of your cheeks and above the area where you place the bronzer this will help create more dimension once you're done with the same brush add a deeper bronzer along your forehead and jaw line and blend away almost done finish off your look by filling in your lips with a natural lip liner and slightly over draw and redefine your Cupid's bow by sculpting a rounder shape and top it off with a high opacity lipgloss in your lip liner shade add a touch of shimmering loose powder on the center of your lower lip and blend now your finished card number one the magician card number two the high priestess so which is your favorite card let me know in the comments section stay magical and of course good luck we love you you

you 
hi gorgeous here's a beautiful edgy look for you to experiment with this fall highlighted cheeks straight brows framing tapered smokey eyes paired with a peach nude or a vibrant blue lip oh and shout out to my designer friend at human aliens for making the sick bodysuit he combines my two favorite things fashion and anime okay let's get started before you beat your face with makeup you want to make sure you have a clean smooth canvas to work on this is why exfoliating is essential you can either use a gentle scrub to polish off the skin or my favorite way a gentle exfoliating peel like this one by skin Inc so I've been using this product for over a year and I loved it so much I had to get it C to sample it in the glam bag all you have to do is apply this product on your face and you'll notice right away your dead skin peeling off they kind of look like eraser crumbs weird and kind of gross but it pays off from here just rinse your face and now touch your skin it should feel baby but smooth this is my favorite hydrating skin mist no joke I wasn't paid to say any of this this dewy skin mist has saved my skin because it's so dry in LA after a few good sprays my skin instantly looks and feels supple for this look I decided to go for straighter brows with no arch so that means I'm going to cover up the corners of my brows I'm just going to use concealer but I recommend using either non-toxic glue stick or spirit gum with wax for a more realistic look however for the sake of this tutorial and me not wanting to remove the glue from my brows I'm just going to opt for concealer you guys get the picture for my brows I'm applying a soft mix of hazel and dark brown matte shade with an angled small brush draw a straight edge using the inner corners as a guide I'm tapering the line upwards this will create an illusion of a lifted face for your eyes warm-up some concealer between your fingers and use it as an eyeshadow base use loose fine milled powder on a fluffy brush to set the concealer on your lids this will reduce any creasing using the same brush apply a dark brown color to the outer corner and crease using a window wiper motion you can create a lot of depth and dimension with just one matte color it's all about layering and how hard or light your application pressure is now with a metallic burgundy shadow and using a small shadow brush pack this color onto your outer eyelid you want to concentrate the color as close to your lash line as possible to create more depth using a tightly packed blending brush blend out with the darkest color extending it to the crease and right underneath the eye from there find a warm tan color and blend this color under your eyes to balance them out with the same burgundy color accentuate the corner of the under eye and from there to sweep the shadow into a tight wing using a fine detailed ankle brush get your wing just the way you want it and once you've sculpted out the shape you like clean the edges with a makeup brush for that precise edge okay let's take a break from the eyes onto the face take a rose gold cream shimmer and lightly Pat onto the apples of your cheeks for that base glow and from there using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream spot treat your face to reduce redness or blemishes so that your skin tone is even and natural-looking if you're more into that poreless flawless face find a foundation that has a high coverage if you're like me and you prefer a natural skin finish use a BB or CC cream that has a light to medium coverage apply a light hydrating lip gloss and let it soak in to prep your lips with the same loose powder from before using a smaller face brush load it up and feather over any shiny area okay now back to the eyes using your favorite eyeliner pencil or any liner that has a small brush sharpen the wing and line the eyes one trick that I like to use is to start at the inner edge of the line and apply in small strokes keeping the liner angles and pressing it up against the side this will easily give you the thinnest line imaginable for the outer corner winged it out by outlining first and then fill it in with a gold cream pigment apply a tiny amount using the small detailed brush on the inner corners and bottom lower lashline from there just blend the look together by using the same color to illuminate your upper lid I'm going to use this nifty product from Korea it's a dual ended stick to give yourself puffy eyes or egg yo cell and Korean literally means charming skin first step a few millimeters under your natural lower lash line draw a line with the taupe kranj from there flip the pen over and use the shimmering white side to carefully dot between the line you just drew it's kind of crazy what a little bit of taupe and shimmer can do as if you need to make your eyes any bigger but if you want to give your lashes a good curl and apply generous coats of mascara I chose one that has long bristles so that I could literally comb through my lashes to separate them if your brows are needing to be tamed use a brow gel to sculpt them and shape this tiny one here is by benefit and it's perfect for travel and it has fibers in it to give the appearance of actual brow hairs moving on using a light pearlescent cream shadow added to the inner part of your upper cheekbones for that highlight action this will make your cheeks appear fuller and will give you a more youthful appearance now it's time for the lips to prep them and prevent any lipstick from bleeding out line them with a lip liner similar to your lip color and with your favorite peachy nude lipstick apply this on your lips patting it on with your finger to get rid of any excess residue if a peach nude is too basic for you go crazy with a new bold lip color this liquid lipstick from Jeffrey star is super fun and the hydrating formula stays put all day just make sure to carefully apply in little strokes and don't forget the sides of your mouth and in between your lips it doesn't matter what lip or makeup you decide to go with just make sure to wear it confidently because makeup is an expression of one of your mini sides express confidently and of course good luck

inspired by the zodiac signs let's start with fire the element of Leo Aries and Sagittarius christen here is going to show you how to light up your skin with these temporary flash tattoos these usually come in a pack so start by cutting out the ones you want to use you'll need some water a sponge or a paper towel remove the clear plastic off the tattoo and place it facedown on your skin apply a little bit of water to the back of the tattoo and gently press down on it try your best to keep it still because you want the tattoo to set in place and after 30 seconds carefully lift one edge up to see if the tattoo has transferred and if it has go ahead and remove the paper and from here just have fun they're kind of like jewelry or skin accessories and you can most def customize your tattoos by cutting them into little rings or forming them into arm cuffs like this for the finishing touch use tweezers to place body gems onto your skin decorate your forehead and the area around your eyes this will draw attention to your face and will bring the whole look together moving on to nails aren't they a breath of fresh air for realsies though air is the element of Aquarius Gemini and Libra crispy here is a Gemini so she's incorporating her sign into this fun look all you need is a black nail art pen and some white polish but if you don't have a pen you can always use a toothpick to draw the polish onto your nails start with a powder-blue base and begin drawing designs onto your nails just imagine your doodling go ahead and use your creativity the easiest designs to make are the ones made up of dots straight lines triangles or any geometric shapes try to make something different on every nail and you're done what an awesome way to show off your inner creativity and they're ready for a long hot day at a festival moving on to hair Dessie is going to show you this water inspire look by creating a fishtail braid water is the element of Scorpio Pisces and cancer first give you her some texture by using a dry shampoo this will make braiding easier and give your hair a PC voluminous look pin a chunk of your hair back on one side and then leave a piece down by your ear starting with the piece you left out begin by taking bits of hair from the outside layers crossing them over and adding them to the center like this continue your fishtail braid all the way down and use an elastic hair tie to secure and you want to leave a little free space at the end so that you can loosen up your braids like this giving it a more casual look go ahead and add some feathers and pleather accents behind your braid to give your hair that boho look dream for the stars but stay grounded on earth by rocking some sweet kicks earth is the element of Taurus Virgo and Capricorn here katie is going to show you how to dress up your old kicks with some fringe action you'll need but of course some fringe beads flowers like this and any charms you'd like to add for glue you can use special fabric glue or a hot glue gun start by measuring out how much fringe you will need to go around your ankle on your shoe then cut the measure piece off line the top and afterwards place your fringe directly onto the glue it should look like this repeat the same steps for the second layer of fringe afterwards just top it off with some cute flowers for the laces replace yours

balm oh and tame those brows keep them natural looking and softly highlight the brow bone and inner corner of your eyes using a metallic cream shadow Pat this onto your eyelid and use a precise eye brush to bring it down along your lower lash line moving on starting at the middle of your eye take a black gel liner and wing it out towards the outer corner smoke out the color by using a dark brown cream shadow afterwards just clean up your wing with any excess product left on your brush curl your lashes by giving them a few good squeezes and apply a few coats of an extra volumizing mascara give yourself a warm glow with some bronzer apply to the hollows of your cheeks towards your temples and along your jaw line once you're done with that go in with a vanilla or champagne highlighter and then set it in place with some powder for extra dimension add a neutral toned cream contour around your nose and blend highlight the bridge of your nose to bring it all together from here just touch up your eye area with a creamy illuminating concealer and diffuse it out with a fluffy brush it's time for lip service take a pink nude lip color and apply this on bring the stars to your lips by

what's up guys I'm going to show you how to look amazing on your graduation day because everyone's going to be taking pictures with you and you gots to look hot no pressure but I'm going to show you how to look awesome so let's get started okay we're going to start with skincare so for nice smooth skin I recommend exfoliating first before anything else exfoliating is a nice way to really just smooth out your skin get rid of all the dead skin cells and also if you have fine lines or wrinkles it's a great way to just polish everything out we're getting rid of all the dullness and we're scrubbing it out start around the center of your face first work around the nose really get in there because that's where a lot of the sebum and the clogged pores are out our writer on your nose but then around the corners of your mouth and right around the chin area to try to avoid the eye area because it's really sensitive you don't really need to exfoliate it and whatever you have leftover on your fingers use the rest to exfoliate your forehead remember you don't want to over exfoliate the forehead because it's going to dry out just focus mainly on the center of your face and workout because I'm wearing a dress I can't really do this but I recommend also exfoliating down your neck and decollete okay so I just washed my face perfectly clean see how smooth my skin is so after this I recommend using a really nice mask layer this over freshly exfoliated skin so you can really get in there and pull out all the dirt and excess oil um so I recommend using a nice exfoliating peel off mask this one is called hey honey hey honey I don't know if you can see it here hey honey take it off it's really beautiful exfoliating honey mask I've been loving it which is why I'm including it in a maze FC bag right here so hopefully if you have this bag you can get this mask it's amazing the best part is that it's there's honey and honey has natural healing properties it's amazing for the skin because it's also a natural antibiotic so squeeze a little out and start right on a center again wipe out go to the forehead and work your way down okay now we're going to play the waiting game um but during this time I recommend drinking a lot of water because if you're exfoliating your skin and your using a peeling mask it might remove a little bit of moisture from your skin so make sure to rehydrate your skin by drinking lots of water after using any exfoliant or peeling mask oh I can't smile hello there welcome earthlings like a music video I think we should be good you're going to know when it's done when you can just go around the edges of the mask and see if you can kind of peel it off and you see this area right here just around the edge of the mask if you can kind of peel a little bit of the edge that's when you know it's finished so go ahead and Christian Bale style like American Psycho I'm sure anyways good look at this ah so whatever you have left over on your face just rinse it off and we're going to move on to the next step all right so I just washed off my face so it's really nice and squeaky clean um if your skin feels really dry after using an exfoliator or a peeling mask it's perfectly normal don't freak out so it's really crucial to use moisturizer after any exfoliant or peeling mask and I'm using here a really nice natural night cream all right now I'm just going to moisturize my face so I like to take my moisturizer and rub it together to warm it up between my fingers to help break down the products you have a nice even application so once you have it nice and warmed up just go ahead and Pat it on your face don't like go in and I grow it on just go in and it on your face like this first signs of aging shows up around your eyes and neck area so don't neglect the neck perfect bring it on to the next step all right so the next step is important for those who are graduating outdoors it's really crucial to have sunscreen at least SPF 35 and this one here is sans tan it's a pure white mineral sunscreen really nice to have and it's also natural too which is really nice for your skin rub it between your fingers to break down the product so you have a nice even application there's different types of sunscreens you have physical and chemical sunscreen the one I'm using here is a physical size for you so don't be scared if your face looks super white like this you're using a zinc oxide sunscreen which is a physical sunscreen it's going to help give you amazing protection all right so I'm going to wait for my sunscreen to settle in and bomb up my lips I'm using here olive lips it's a nice olive oil rosemary lip balm super natural and really hydrating okay alright let's move on to face makeup I'm going to be using here a face primer you want to make sure your makeup can last as long as possible especially during graduation so make sure to prime your face moving on you can either use foundation or concealer to help even out your complexion I'm going to use a little bit of foundation but mostly concealer for this look so if you get to love me for me powder compact you get a complimentary free full size foundation that comes with it alright just a little bit of foundation as all I really need and then the rest is really just going to be concealer again starting around the center of the face just go in and even out any any blemishes or redness around the nose for me I get a lot of redness around the nose because of acne and also I break out a lot under my chin area because of stress so if you're breaking out a lot around the chin area most likely it's hormonal acne alright so I'm going to conceal my under eye circles and I think that's really all I really need to conceal at this point so I'm using here the great cover-up concealer by my own makeup line and I'm going to cover up my dark circles it's really important to blend down towards the neckline because you don't want your face to be super white and the rest of your body to be dark perfect alright from here just powder up and let's move on to the next step brows frame to face and on a day when your face will be the star of the show take your time when filling them in be sure to choose a shape that follows your natural brow shape you want soft feathery strokes you don't want your brows to look as if they're drawn on and you want to use a spoolie brush to blend out any harsh marks and lines now time for eye shadow I'm using here my sahara nudes palette neutralize the lids with the nude shade and then take a soft taupe color or brown color and define the outside corner of your lids working your way in use the same shadow color as you contour through the inner eye corner and down the sides of the nose easy alright next choose your go-to smudge proof eyeliner I'm using the one I made here called the water liner it comes with a built-in sharpener a sharpen liner is the best way to get the most precise and defined edge so just line the upper lashes winging out towards the edges then very quickly before the formula dries smudge the line to soften it and after it dries it should be budge proof and now just brighten your eyes with a yellow gold eyeliner I'm using here sunshine yellow and just line along the bottom waterline this will give your eyes that nice pop awesome okay so my eye makeup this foam is finished just wanted to let you guys know how important it is to look like yourself when you're graduating I know this makeup is really natural-looking and simple but there's nothing better than timeless beauty and you want to look like yourself when you're graduating I think simple makeup beautiful glowing skin is perfect for graduation you don't really need anything more and I'm going to show you guys how I curl my lashes without a lash curler because I actually forgot my lash curler so I take my fingers and I warm it up a little so I rub my fingers together like this with your index finger go in and lift up your lashes and kind of press against the lid it's a go up and press against your lashes and you're kind of crimping your lashes when you're doing this and it's not as effective as a lash curler of course but this will make do it's like you're giving your eyeballs a massage okay so my lashes are curled I don't know if you can tell but they're much more crimped and perky looking all right so I'm gonna add mascara okay so I'm just going to mascara my lashes up so just call your lashes apply generous coats of mascara just go in and zigzag up kind of lift them up lift up the lashes most likely you're probably going to cry on graduation day because it's beautiful day but really emotional unless you're not going to cry or you're wearing waterproof mascara I would avoid using a mascara on the lower lash line alright we're going to move on to bronzer so I'm using here this really cool too faced chocolate soleil bronzer so with your brush just loaded up with a bronzer using a powder brush or a blush brush can oak wrap yeah that's only know don't wonder if it tastes like chocolate I think this tastes like chocolate okay so with your bronzer go in and sculpt brush out first and then brush in and it smells like chocolate find the natural shadows on your face the natural contours on your face and intensify it blot it down brush out and then brush in and then from here it looks straight in the mirror and kind of see where the bronzer lies all right so I think we're good now if you really want a nice sunkissed glow take the bronzer again and add it along the forehead and just go down along the sides of your face and right on the jaw line this will help give you a slimmer look so when you take a picture your face won't look so wide it's gonna look slimmer alright I look nice and toasty so next step really simple just finish off with your favorite lipstick lip color lip balm I'm going to use this matte lip balm by Revlon I've been loving it color bruise I don't know if you guys have ever tried Revlon's color burst it's awesome it's a nice matte balm it's a cute little chubby stick chubby stick ahh I just go in and call it on your lips off like Buddha great okay I promise we're almost finished two more steps hair don't neglect your hair you want your hair to look beautiful and shiny I've been adding so much oil to my hair every night just right at the ends right here so I've been using oil on my hair every single night and honestly my hair has been looking super healthy so I'm using here this hair oil by balanced guru a few is enough I'm just going in trap it on the palm of your hands like so and while it's in your head rub it all over the palms of your hands and I just go in and as if you're combing your hair comb through your hair and really focus on the ends to taper it out because you really want to get at the ends of your hair because this is where all the damage is happening you're curling your hair or straighten it so the ends they're taking quite a beating the ends of your hair used to be all the way up here probably three years ago so it's really old and you have to nourish the ends of your hair you can already see a difference between adding oil I mean it's amazing so I recommend using hair oil on your hair on graduation day because it's going to look beautiful when you take pictures and whatever is leftover on your hands I like to add it on my body gives like a really nice shine moving on to the final step fragrance you want to leave a lasting impression when you're hugging someone whatever smells good makes you feel good spray it on as of lately I've been using Calvin Klein's and les euphoria what I like to do is I like to take my perfume and spray the air and then just walk through it and if you're like me I like taking my fragrance to go so here's a cute little version of the endless euphoria it's so small look at it I've been loving roller balls I think they're a fun way to add fragrance in your life you just roll it on your wrist and don't rub it together press it like this roller balls you get better precision where you're adding your fragrance so you can add it on the neck on the crease of your legs and the crease of your arm the reason why you do that is because heat comes from this area and what the heat does is that it heats up the fragrance and it lifts it up so that people can smell it better now I don't know that's true but I've been doing that all my life works for me so hopefully it works for you so I'm pretty much ready for graduation congratulations to the class of 2014 so proud of you guys this is the day for you to celebrate walk firmly walk proudly hold your head up high you worked so hard to earn this degree those endless nights of losing sleep stress going to school waking up early and making all those sacrifices to earn this degree you deserve it so proud of you guys my sister is also graduating this year Christine I'm so proud of

special touch for this one all you need is a basic collar some ribbon or embellishment and a hot glue gun from your local craft store first experiment and play around until you have an idea for the final design all you have to do is measure out the length of the color and cut your ribbon to the correct length then hot glue it on and for those of you who think ain't no one got time for this guess what this took less than 5 minutes to make and your dog has a collar that was handmade with love if your dog collar is janky and needs a little bit of that judge all you need is the basic collar fabric these are super cheap they're the perfect size and they come in a variety of colors and patterns don't forget your measuring tape pom-pom ribbon scissors and a hot glue gun first measure out the collar making sure to leave room for the buckle or clasp at the end now choose the base fabric this fabric will need to wrap all the way around the collar so measure the width of the collar and leave 1/4 or 1/2 room to glue next hot glue the fabric around the collar making sure the seam is on the inside now comes the fun part using your pom-pom ribbon or any decorations of your choice I'll glue this on the outside of the collar voila the last caller is this adorable detachable rose bouquet it's perfect for weddings and fancy events all you need is a collar belt in cream green and pink scissors and hot glue gun start by cutting out a piece of the cream felt so it wraps all the way around the collar with some wiggle room hot glue the ends together now it's time to make the rose buds cut out small circles of pink or floral colored felt now cut in starting from the outside a spiral once you've cut the center hold the spiral and begin wrapping the fabric around itself to create a small rose just repeat with each rose and don't forget to hot glue the ends and inside so that it's more secure next take your green felt and cut out tiny leaves from here assemble all the pieces together before you start gluing place all the pieces of the base felt and rearrange until you have an arrangement that you like using the hot glue gun glue down each Rose and leaf since this piece is detachable your dog can wear it to any parties and special occasions if your dog likes to get down and dirty here's a DIY dog shampoo that you can make for your best friend all you need is the clean

essential oil are potent a little goes a long way and when it's time to give your dog a good cleaning shake the shampoo massage it in and rinse thoroughly make your feline BFF this cool cat scratcher post for those who might think it's cheaper to buy a scratch post this quality DIY piece you see right here cost a whopping $10 you will need a wooden base two wooden dowels jute rope scissors a power drill screwdriver bit drill bit and screws ask around at your local hardware store if they have any scraps of wood to use as your base start with a three feet wooden post from any hardware supply store get them cut into two sizes along and a short post take your drill and attach a drill bit matching the size of this you intend to use I used a six by eight inch screw drill holes in the wooden base where you would like to screw the post in repeat the drill process for each post and then switch out the drill bit for a screwdriver bit now using the wooden panel as your base secure each post by drilling your screws into each peg using your colorful strong jute rope wrap it around the post shoot is a sturdy type of rope with a rough texture you can find it at almost any hardware or craft store keep wrapping and winding as tightly as possible and do as many layers as you would like to achieve your desired thickness and don't worry if it's not perfectly wrapped cats will appreciate the texture voila happy scratching elevate your kitties nest by making this kitty TP you'll need five two-foot sticks some string fabric safety pins a pillow soft rug or blanket begin by creating the texture of your TP with the five sticks and fan them out like a tent once you have your sticks in place weave your string in and out of the sticks and begin wrapping them together towards the top to secure it in place and once the structure is set it's time to add your fabric drape the fabric over the sticks like this and use a safety pin to keep it in place now all you have to do is add a soft blanket or rug into the tepee and it's all ready to go a perfect place for a cat nap for those of you with smaller fluffy friends like a bunny or guinea pig you can make a little spot for them to nest in all made out of wooden dowels for this you'll need a circular surface to make the shape for your dome some paint and a hot glue gun start by giving each of your sticks a coat of paint and your favorite colors let it dry completely before you begin gluing now attach the sticks to each other one by one around the container make sure the ends are able to rest flat on the ground before you begin moving it around make sure the glue dries after each piece and now it's done it's a cute little hiding spot for your pets to make this adorable rope buffet cut small pieces of carrots apples and lettuce and make sure they're small enough to be attached to a clothespin tie the string low enough so that your pet can reach and hang a few nibbles of food from each clothespin just layer the food across the string and tie it up close to your pets favorite hang up and now you can pause for cuteness the sad truth is that three million cats and dogs are put down in shelters each year if just one out of five Americans adopted a cat or dog from a shelter or rescue not a single healthy treatable pet would lose his or her life shelters and rescues are the best places to find your furry friend there's also a misconception that shelter pets are bad not true most of these poor animals end up in shelters because of their previous owners not the animals themselves there's a lot of people who have problems finding pet friendly housing when they move but the Humane Society of the United States is working to change that you can visit Humane Society org slash pets are welcome for the tips and resources on finding housing that welcomes pets the best way to find out how truly amazing shelter pets are is to meet one you can start by visiting the shelter pet project org or you can search for adoptable pets near you if you're an animal lover volunteering at your local shelter is a great place to start you might be able to walk dogs give attention to cats and rabbits or even feed baby birds a lot of shelters offer foster programs where you can help care for animals in your own home temporarily until they can be adopted out permanently a big warm thank you to the best friends pet adoption center in Mission Hills for letting us film at their location happy DIY inge give the kids to your furry friend and of course good luck [Music] you [Music]

flying out soon before you go watch this video where I'm going to show you my favorite in-flight beauty tips if you're flying under five hours just bring your favorite touch-up makeup however if your flight is a little longer let me share a few tips I picked up during my travels so just buckle up and let's go tie your hair up because we're gonna start with skincare I promise you it will be easy because almost everything is pretty much illegal to carry on board I recommend bringing a small vial of your favorite facial oil or your favorite travel friendly moisturizer facial oil is nice because it's concentrated you only need a few drops to cover your entire face whenever you're using facial oil try using a patting motion like this when you're applying keep some samples of your favorite skincare products when you're bringing your bag on board for those who get puffy eyes because of the high altitude or you're like me and you didn't get enough sleep the night before because you're a last-minute Packer bring on board some soothing under eye patches all's you have to do is peel them off and stick them under your eyes where they feel the most puffy it's kind of like giving yourself a spa treatment on the plane nothing wrong with pampering yourself especially during long flights careful not to drop one because that would suck and once you have them on enjoy it who cares if they look silly at least you're going to like bangin when you get off the plane just a few more things to do before you take that nap on the plane make sure to condition your lips slather on your favorite lip balm or lip conditioner your lips are going to feel extremely dry and crackly it's because lack of water and recycled air on the plane it dries the skin but your lips show it first I don't bring my hand lotion instead I use a body balm or butter because it's multifunctional meaning I can use it on my body hair and it's not in liquid form when I use it I like to scoop out the balm using the back of my thumb acting as a spatula I know it looks a little funny but it's better than using your fingers and getting it all up under your nails when you're using a balm or butter the consistency is really thick it's very dense you have to warm up the product to break down the texture for easier application and I like to give myself a hand massage it's very calming and it will help relax your body moisturize yourself up and get ready for your nap sleepy time I like to take my infinity scarf on board because sometimes it can get really cold so I bundle myself up in a scarf so comfy I know you're going to try and look all cute when you sleep but sooner or later you're gonna look like this when they announce that the plane will be landing soon it's time to wake up and get ready it's best to do your makeup 45 minutes before landing because it's gonna look more fresh first thing first remove your under-eye patches to reveal deep puffed eyes okay let's move on to the makeup tutorial I recommend bringing a portable foundation or BB cream in a compact that way you don't have to worry about spilling or getting it confiscated because the bottle is larger than three ounces even though it's only half empty you have your face makeup and sponge all in one so applying it on the plane will be a breeze I don't recommend bringing your loose powder on board because that stuff can get everywhere and create a poof of makeup cloud so just finish up perfecting your canvas don't overdo your makeup you want it to look natural and fresh as if you weren't even flying it's time to cover up the panda eyes use a concealer that has a heavy coverage if your dark circles are intense you want to use your ring fingers when applying product under your eyes because this area is very delicate a little goes a long way and with your sponge or a brush or even your fingers just make sure they're clean blend out the concealer for a natural finish if you look more awake you done good you can't complete your look without well-groomed brows with a brow pencil or brow powder start filling in your brows draw with light feathery strokes when you're filling in your brows for a more natural look I usually skip the eyeshadow part and stick to lining my eyes and keeping my eye makeup simple look for a creamy eyeliner pencil avoid anything sharp and pointy especially during a turbulence last thing I want is for you to poke yourself in the eye the reason why I prefer a creamy eyeliner so I can smudge it it takes a few minutes for a creamy eyeliner to dry so right when you're done drawing your line use this modular or a cotton swab to smudge the liner to soften it and if you need extra brightness try a champagne eyeliner and just brighten up your eyes by lining your waterline and just finish off your eye makeup with your favorite volumizing mascara because this eye makeup is so simple long lashes will go great with this look your in-flight makeup look is now complete simple and fresh right and if your hair needs a little TLC use hair oil or a matte finish pomade work the product between your fingers and comb through your hair for a nice finish voila we're done the plane should be landing soon so you can put away all your things and get ready for landing and if someone special is waiting to pick you up now's the time to do a simple wardrobe change get a girl I like to wear layers of clothes when I'm traveling because if it's cold I'm bundled up but if it's hot I can peel off the layers now no one can tell that you are on a long flight happy flying and don't forget to drink plenty of fluids have fun and good luck please subscribe to my channel for more videos you can find me on Twitter and Instagram at Michelle Phan Oh 
hi beautiful a lot of you have been asking me to create more hair fashion nail and makeup tutorials so an idea popped in my head inspired by Sailor Moon and Captain Planet these gorgeous ladies here including myself are combining our forces to create this multifaceted tutorial cosmic candy okay let's start with deci if you're getting bored of your plain black t-shirt or shorts look no further than the Stars for inspiration you'll need a few sponges brushes glitter spray pastel fabric paints and a spray bottle filled with water wet your sponge and load it up with a lavender shade start dabbing the paint onto the shorts when you're painting anything galaxy inspired it's all about creating depth with these colors make sure to blend out any harsh edges now that you have the base done it's time to layer more colors to give your shorts more dimension take a light neutral shade like a white or silver and use this as a highlighter wherever it feels two-dimensional highlight continue adding depth using mid-tone colors like magenta and teal and you can add that cosmic touch by carefully flicking white paint from a small brush look you just created stars pretty be one with the galaxy shorts blend out the edges as needed and repeat these steps to continue layering for your desired look and if you feel like you're at a good place use your small brush again for the finishing touches it's all about the details here you can create starburst planets whatever for that extra effect spray a little bit of that silver or white color thus creating a sprinkle of star clusters moving on to Kristen if you want to recreate her out-of-this-world nail look you'll need some makeup brushes these are denser than regular art sponges and will ensure even application to start take a protective base coat and layer this on your nails now you can coat an iridescent white polish on top of the base coat depending on your polish formula you will only need one to two coats now just top it off with a light pastel pink color because you'll have several layers of paint on your nails you're in this awkward stage where you can't really do anything that requires serious hand movements so gonna watch your favorite show read a book or go online basically kill time at least ten minutes for your nails to dry completely no one is perfect that's why nail polish remover was invented so load up an old eyeliner brush with nail polish remover and clean up any smudges perfect colors you will need are a magenta purple shade a vibrant pink and a powder blue and if you want a more subtle look focus on creating a statement nail instead of painting all of them you can paint directly on the sponge combining all the colors and press this onto your nail you want to use this time to experiment so unleash your inner monet using the pointed edge of a cuticle stick toothpick paper clip basically anything pointing make little crosses and dots to recreate the stars alright from here just top off your nails with glitter now it's time to dry that means time to veg out and be a princess because you can do anything with wet nails once you're in the clear add a clear glossy top coat and you're done so pretty Sailor Moon would dig this crispies hair color will change depending on her mood now she's going to show you how to give your hair that galactic edge using hair chalk first thing first make sure you're wearing a shirt but you're not going to miss because chalking is messy the night before prep your hair with a leave-in conditioner because chalk is drying to begin take a small section of hair focusing on the ends place it between a makeup sponge and blue hair chalk press lightly and pull through to get the best color payoff repeat this step using a green color applying it above the blue for a gradient effect and after you've done a third of your hair spray it with hairspray to set it before the color can transfer or shake off repeat these steps until all your ends have been chalked and set once you're done show-and-tell take a selfie in Tagus moving on to Katy she's here with a space-age lip look just be sure your lips are clean and prepped take a nude cream lipstick and load this color on your lips this will neutralize your natural lip tone helping the colors stand out using a fluffy brush apply a white iridescent loose pigment all over your lips now with a purple pigment brush this color along the inner corner of your mouth deepening the color as you go do the same with a teal shade placing it along the outer inner corner using a pearly blue color blend out the edges of the teal shadow onto your Cupid's bow and lower lip and with a bright magenta color do the same to the purple color and to bridge everything together use a rose gold color on your lower lip and blend if you want to accentuate fullness with an iridescent white pigment Pat this along the center of your lower lip to complete your look gorgeous a unicorn would approve eyes inspired by the bright colors of space start applying an iridescent vanilla color on your lids as a base using a baby blue shadow with your shadow brush place this color directly on your crease and blend back and forth find a matte pink color and apply this shadow right on the empty spot focusing on the inner half of your eye ready to make your eyes sparkle literally find a glitter liner that has a purple undertone and draw a line as close to the lash line as possible winging it out towards the end with a creamy white eyeliner apply this along the lower waterline in inner corner for a highlighting effect for that bold accent use an electric blue liner and line your lower lash line gently applying along lower waterline as well you want to be sure to stay towards the outer corner of the eye slightly blending it into the white eye pencil give your lashes a good curl from root to tip because what we really want to do is make this electric blue mascara stand out on your beautifully curled lashes sweep a generous amount of mascara on the top and bottom lashes if you're a highlighting freak like myself highlight your inner corner with a little more glitter and with your white eyeliner highlight your brow bone and blend out with the brush finished your cosmic candy inspired eyes are done alright everyone thank you so much for watching I hope you are inspired by all these fantastic looks created by these gorgeous ladies don't forget to show them some love yeah let me know which look you're going to try out tag me online so that perhaps I can spotlight your work love you forever dreamers good luck 
so I have a special treat for you guys I brought in David the dermatologist or David the derm I'm a dermatologist I'm based in San Diego and I specialize in treating acne in the past couple months I've treated 10,000 patients for acne via a website that I started cure ology and the idea is that we help make it affordable for people to get acne care from an actual specialist okay so first question is from Paula Hernandez and she asked what products do you use to avoid oily skin and breakouts thank you anything that's like non-community neck is best for your skin what are some ingredients that they should avoid that could clog the pores a lot of people get their pores clogged by something called Mira stone myristate and isopropyl palmitate and these are fatty esters that's the name of the molecule and if you look in the back of the bottle and it has those ingredients in there you can bet that your face is going to get clogged up with just a couple weeks of use so a trick for me you know given that you asked about what do you do when you have oily skin is is if you want to use a moisturizer use a gel moisturizer and this is a lot less likely to contain poor clogging ingredients goes on really easily and hopefully will help with your overall appearance and with the oil and it's the same time next question is by Marisol when and she asked how can i distinguish what kind of acne is caused by stressed by my diet or by my environment one way to really figure out the difference is to control one of them you can control right and it's hard to control your environment it's hard to control your stress level although you can do some things but what you can do is cut out certain things from your diet and just eat a really really healthy diet for a month and just stick to it if that fixes your skin then you know there was diet causing it yeah what kind of food do you know that can help with acne as you consume it I've tried kale juice and citrus green tea I think most importantly is the food that makes acne worse right and a lot of people like talked about the rumors does chocolate make active acne worse and studies really show that it doesn't which is great right because chocolate is delicious and but the the foods that I really noticed in all the patients I've seen that make acne worse or two things high glycemic index foods right so these are things with a lot of sugars and a lot of starches and then dairy products like milk and ice cream Oh interesting yeah and so if you can cut those two things out it'll make a bigger difference than anything you eat then anything to eat to help your acne so yeah I've noticed really big differences with outside and like within a month maybe they might be able to see like visible differences there are differences and it's the same case with me my skin is much better when I'm not drinking milk and you know the milk itself has hormones in it right and that that's sort of what drives like oiliness for your skin and in acne coming and I imagine that those hormones can also affect how you feel in general so I think you know just cutting down on milk is a healthy thing to do so I have some snap videos that you guys sent hi Michelle um for your pillow top question I was wondering how do I help prevent acne if acne skincare is giving me acne thank you I know a lot of people get affected by benzoyl peroxide it actually irritates their acne and it makes it worse and they flare up so other people are allergic to salicylic acid so I guess it really boils down to like finding what is breaking you out like what is that key ingredient in that acne product that you're using that that could be what's affecting you so I totally agree one of the important things is to look at the active ingredients like the benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid and those could be what's breaking you out and then also like we talked about before the comedogenic ingredients in active ingredients and if you try different products and still don't have any success you can go visit a dermatologist right and they can help you with actual prescription skincare that might be just what your skin needs I'm show how do you wear makeup without it making you have acne I love you I think it boils down to just knowing the ingredients and maybe even spot treating your face so instead of covering your entire face with makeup just cover the small little blemishes that you have dark circles if you have any a little bit of redness and practice having good skin care because if you really take care of your skin have a good diet you get plenty of sleep I know like I'm just saying the same thing that everyone else is saying but believe me when I actually practice that when I have good skincare I eat really well I drink lots of water and I don't like intake too much dairy my skin is visibly better I'm not an extra fee like I'm insecure because I have date I don't scared I might give you guys like a bad advice using this is amazing advice I'm trying to write it down right now yeah I am I definitely I'm like so self-conscious right now I have a real expert here that will give you see I'm like getting all red okay I'm gonna move on hi Michelle I'm sorry how you can get rid of hormonal acne because it's more harm oh no and things or from counter doesn't work so there's only one word that I know of is anti-androgen that's a great word some of the hormones that naturally go through our bodies whether we're men or women contribute to getting acne right and so what Michelle mentioned as an anti-androgen is something that actually tempers the effect of that and the most proven anti-androgen is actually herbal spearmint tea and it's been proven to help for a lot of different conditions that are hormonal ii related and I've seen a number of my patients have success just drinking you know a moderate amount not the only to drink tons of it right for moderate amount of a herbal spearmint tea can actually help with the no shots of it could actually help with acne and then of course you know if that's not working talk to a dermatologist or your gynecologist about you know any other type of hormonal treatment that may be necessary Michelle help I have scars what should I do which is I think she has really good skin she does your scars are not your suppose are not even that bad well I know like there's a method that a lot of people have been using that has shown great results for acne scars and pitted scars it's called collagen induction therapy where you take a derma roller that has tiny needles in there you know your entire face with lidocaine you rinse off your face and then you start rolling this device on your skin it sounds really scary because you're basically producing micro injuries and tears on your skin but it tells your body your brain to heal the skin to produce more collagen hence why it's called collagen induction therapy and there's been studies that show that there's an 80% increase in actually helping acne scarring I've actually seen a lot of people have been helped by it oh no so yeah definitely and I've also seen people who haven't but I think it's it's potentially really good idea especially for only if you don't have active acne show you have active acne it's going to make that a lot worse and the scarring problem could get worse as well but it's a really good idea yeah and what people do when they sometimes get a laser or any other procedure is get it on a test spot of your face first right and just to find out if you react negatively and it wouldn't be a bad idea with the collagen collagen induction therapy there yeah just do like one side of your face yeah so my first question is where could I begin in my search to just destroy all my acne to control my oils what can I do eating healthy what when you're starting to have a little bit of the red or inflamed acne you want to have something that kills bacteria right so a salicylic acid acne scrub won't help it doesn't kill bacteria very well so you might want to try something with benzoyl peroxide or something prescription those two types of skin care can really help with just sort of the red mild acne that comes up nice what do you think about the blue light people using blue light to kill bacteria do you think that's effective yeah I mean blue light works when it's powerful and of course the blue light apps on the phone are not powerful they don't do anything they actually make that yeah so like I've seen people someone in the airport putting a blue light against their face from their phone and it is a blue light don't do that yeah don't do that so now but there's there's certainly blue lights that work really well for yeah mostly through a doctor's office hi Michelle I love you um so my question is our facial brush is really beneficial or are they bad for the skin and also oh okay I was waiting for the other keep it clean especially if you're using a makeup brush that involves like any liquid products like liquid foundation cream based products that have more water base in it um bacteria they're drawn to water anything water-based so like just make sure to clean that rinse it out you know what I was seeing when I first started practicing was that it so many people were getting breakouts you know whether it was more severe or whether it was mild and they had a feeling that the over-the-counter products they were using just weren't really working well for them but they they just didn't want to go in to see a dermatologist you know whether it was they didn't want to skip school or skip work or whether you know there's also just a certain level of anxiety to go into a doctor but I knew that a lot of these people would be helped if they could we created this so that people can actually see a dermatologist or nurse practitioner and get skin care that's actually prescription for them just look on your phone yeah and you know the cool thing about creating this electronically is that we've been able to make it affordable for patients you take a selfie in your pair with your own nurse practitioner or a dermatologist and then as Michelle knows you get the medication customized for you shipped right to your door for all of Michelle's audience that might feel this way we've arranged for you guys to be able to try cure ology for absolutely free what yeah my first time here in Italy nice well my office has arranged that yeah and we really believe in that this is important well I know it works i-i've actually I so I did the whole cure ology thing I filled out my profile I took a picture a selfie and I know a dermatologist was actually you who reviewed it really fast and it was subscribed my own personal custom product I wanted to reduce built collagen yeah build up more collagen so you remember build up my college in my skin reducing the sunspots and also um also preventing a premature aging and wrinkles and I within a week I got my product and it was custom made for me and what I really like about it too is that there's an expiration date so it shows like the freshness of it because it was really made for you and it's active for a certain amount of time alright guys so that's pretty much it that is our pillowtop from our og professional here David if you want to follow him on his socials cure ologies right here can ask him all your skincare questions to him directed to him not to me professional and thank you guys so much for watching and best of luck with

topics for pillow talk number three our how to jumpstart your career how to survive a breakup and how to deal with jealousy feeling underscore th cz she asked hi mich hi I get so jealous if my best friend does something with her other best friend I can't deal with it do you know what to do next time I love you I know that some people believe that friendship is forever but I believe that friendship is fleeting because you change as a person and if you change or the other person changes they're not really the same person and so how can they really be the same friend part of friendship is also knowing and understanding when to leave your friend is they probably have families they have a significant other they have other people that they want to hang out with and so it's really important for you as a friend to respect their boundaries - friendship is not life friendship is part of life it's part of your personal development because as you make friends you gain new perspectives you gain new experiences and you find different parts of you that you never discovered before that doesn't mean that you can only discover that with one person here's a really good question from a fan Eclipse how do you know if you're jealous or just inspired inspiration ignites passion jealousy ignites insecurity also jealousy is such a wasted emotion it makes you look at your flaws you become much more negative being jealous is a reflection of your insecurities rather than being inspired is a reflection of what you want to be perhaps instead of looking at that person and finding fault in them find goodness in them and hopefully that can inspire you to become better or to try new things or to develop yourself in different ways EMM Kwon 12:08 I still have feelings for a guy I dated and we broke up but we still like each other how do I move on without breaking his heart time heals I don't know how long it was when you guys broke up I don't know Boo Boo's freshly new or it's been it's been years time separates memories that makes any sense the longer the period of time the more the memories will start to fade if you guys did breakup and you want to keep it that way and you still have feelings for each other it's gonna be hard but you have to ignore that person and don't follow them online don't stalk them try to avoid texting them not only are you holding yourself back you're also holding him back from meeting other amazing potential people hi Michelle how do you start your own business what tips do you have for someone who wants to start their own business this is by Rehim underscore Adele 1992 first most important thing you have to realize before you start any business is to recognize your passion in this idea because when you are your own business owner your own independent business owner you're not going to have a boss telling you what to do you're not going to have to clock in you're not going to have a whole system there for you you have to build it yourself oftentimes when you start your own business um it's a very small group sometimes it's just you and you have to wear a million hats you have to be your own PR your own CEO your own CEO your own marketer everything from there weigh your weaknesses and strengths everyone has weaknesses and strengths are you really good at administrative stuff are you not good at administrative stuff are you punctual are you not punctual but once you weigh your strengths and weaknesses then you will know okay who are the people I can bring on board to help strengthen my weaknesses okay moving on this is from at planet chips I have a boyfriend but he's always with other girls and I'm afraid that he'll find a better girl than me he's not going to find a better girl than you he will probably find a different girl than you but not better there's no such thing as a better girl if he's your boyfriend and he's hanging around with other girls well you have to talk to him let him know that hey I know that you're hanging out with other girls I want to let you know that I trust you if you're hiding it he's probably gonna think it's totally fine my girlfriend is okay with me hanging out with other girls but if you're upfront with him and you let him know hey you know I feel a little insecure but I love you I trust you believe me if he's a true gentleman he will respect the boundaries and he'll probably hang out with less of these girls MRSA leav MRSA leave is there any way to know whether our dream job is the right job for us so I know not everyone in the world has the luxury to do their dream job because they have to make money they have to hustle they have to accept a job that they might not want to do or they hate every idea has a million different roadmaps if you love origami have you perhaps thought about going to engineering learning coding devel being a nap designing even there's so many different paths that you can take and there's no one size fit for all rule for your dream job there's so many different things you can do with your giftings if you do have a dream job idea have that as a goal but leave room for yourself to grow and explore different options this is by path Morgan is stating in high school worth it it's not worth it if your grades suffer if it's putting a lot of strain and stress on you no it's not worth it at all absolutely not but if it's not doing any of that it's part of your teenage development is to date you'll know if it's worth it if that person makes you happy I really literally have to pack I have

hey everyone welcome back to career top or we're going to talk about all things career related I have here at Lauren Berger who is the quintessential intern Queen and she's going to help us on today's topic how to stand out during internship students have done so much work they'll and this amazing internship and then sometimes it stops and that's what we don't want to happen so one tip that I have is don't focus on the first impression we all know that you got to be there early you got a dress professional you have to volunteer for everything you have to be nice to everybody what about day ten what about day twenty what about the last day of your internship are you still maintaining that first impression or you still dress the part are you still eager and being nice to everybody or do you have an attitude now you know is your cell phone out are you texting all the time or you wearing flip-flops make sure that whatever you put out into the world on that first day you maintain that throughout every day of the internship so I think that's an important tip you know having someone that's not jaded I think you were mentioning like if they're breaking out the cell phone if you're helping somebody at social media then we understand absolutely it's so important to always be on and to be more responsive on social media but there is a time for all that too there is a time to show people that you're more aware and you're conscious of your environment to like helping out even if it's not your job to help that person out just ask hey can I help I think I'm here to help are like the best words you can ever say because I'm telling you someone's gonna take you up on that help sometime and they're gonna remember you as the person who's always asking others if they need help in the office what does one wear when they want to stand out in an internship when it comes to dress code but still following the guidelines but still standing out a little bit right so I think it's important to first of all identify what that company dress code is and that is a great question to ask before the first day of your internship because of course again you want to set that first impression and make sure you sort of look the part if you're unsure go with the safe choice especially for the first week or two of your internship after that two week mark you'll understand what people are wearing but I always say that if the dress code is let's say business casual you know that's a little bit borderline sometimes that means that dark denim is acceptable and sometimes it doesn't I would err on the side of caution and you know you're gonna want to focus on dresses skirts nice pants and tops and different combos that you can wear so invest in that great blazer get a white button-down shirt if it's summertime get one of those sleeveless you know collared kind of like what I'm wearing but the shirt version instead of the dress version you know get that shirt you can put that under any blazer and you know go to an inexpensive store and get a bunch of I'm like wearing everything I'm talking about here but you know get a bunch of like in inexpensive statement necklaces and you can kind of change it out but I really think with a bunch of staple pieces you know a good cardigan a good black pencil skirt you can really do a lot you're always going to use them when you get these staple pieces and like vintage shopping is also a great place to like find some of these pieces if you don't want to go high designer we also want to invest a little in quality too so how does one network I mean this is a really huge step for any intern who wants to get a taste of the professional world so I think first of all you have to network you have to be comfortable and confident putting yourself out there anytime you're invited to a professional networking event make sure you go at the office you want to try to build what I call below the surface relationships you want to really understand what drives and motivates the people around you you know maybe your supervisor is obsessed with his dog you know that that's an important fact to know because that's something that's really meaningful to him maybe the woman who sits down the hall from you loves to go on vacation and she just comes to work so that she can go on more vacations but learn these things about people is there a time when someone's overreaching like that's a professional you shouldn't be networking that way so what are the don'ts now yeah please I think it's important to sort of know the room so here's an example if you're at your internship and you're invited to sit in on a marketing meeting and you're in the meeting and all the executives are talking it might not be appropriate to just shout out an idea that's a time where you'd want to ask your internship supervisor you know in the meeting is okay if I share my ideas if you're hesitant just don't do it and remember you always have to be professional a lot of students have business cards now that's that's all the rage and in a business card yeah and I'm a big supporter of the student business card but make sure that you're not taking that business card and shoving it in people's faces you know the appropriate thing to do is to say I happen to have a student business card on me is it okay if I give you one I'd love to stay in touch with you so now that you've networked you made some great contacts how do you take your internship and turn into a job two weeks before the end of the internship you want to ask for that letter of recommendation you want to start making a list of everyone that you're going to send a thank-you note to after the internship and I would just have those ready so as soon as your internships over you can put those in the mail and that way everyone in the office gets one ASAP and then my secret intern queen rule is you stay in touch with your professional contacts three times per year you want people to remember you you don't want it to be awkward come a year later and say hey remember me I was that one intern from way back then can you help me get a job you know you want to get in a habit of having your name appear in that executives inbox at least three times per year because one day you will need a favor so again you don't want to sort of use up all your favors so you know hold the favors until you need them and stay in touch with everybody three times per year and that is gonna help you turn the internship yes into a job JIT keep in touch yep my question is how do I get more people to take me seriously in the workplace love you from Canada love you yeah I think it's all about acting like a professional check your stress at the door you know we don't need to hear about how stressed you are and how busy you are and all the other things you have going on all day long I think when you're at work be at work be totally present and in the moment and I think your co-workers will really appreciate that and they'll come to rely on you I think you're checking in with the people around you and you're showing that you care you're very thoughtful people appreciate that beyond professionalism it just shows that you're in human being hey Michelle my question is what are parts of an internship internship that can be the most challenging okay love you thanks bye so so cute I mean I think the most challenging part of an internship is that sometimes you're dealing with busy people who are multitasking who are several years out of school and they forget that you don't already know how to do everything at the company don't be afraid to ask questions there is no bad question to ask I think the one thing you can do is again take a deep breath listen to all the information someone is sharing always take notes the second year internship coordinator says I have an assignment for you notebook pen take it out and just take notes on everything they say and save your questions for the end that way you don't have to interrupt them but at the end of the conversation you'll go through that list of questions that you have thank you so much Lauren for being an amazing intern Queen and for helping everyone here who just wants to elevate their career thank you guys so much for watching we will see you on our next career talk bye good luck you 
what's that majestic human I always believed how a new year is kind of like a blank canvas and I like to celebrate this idea by enhancing my favorite features with a clean and fresh Beauty lick anyone of all ages can wear this look let's begin with a clean canvas before I attack my face with makeup I always like to start with a clean face to remove makeup residue use a makeup wipe to reveal a squeaky-clean surface if you prefer using a non oil-based makeup remover chlorine makes one that's enriched with cornflower extract I know not everyone has five minutes to spare but if you do show your face and love by nurturing it with the deep hydrating mask stress can tire the body and it reflects on the face so finding any bit of relaxation helps I'm substituting a traditional moisturizer for a dewy skin mist instead my favorite one by Tasha acts like a primer and illuminator and it helps reduce any dry patches on my skin try not to neglect your lips especially if you're wearing a lot of liquid lipsticks many can be drying so be sure to exfoliate your lips from time to time mmm this sugar lip scrub tastes pretty good okay finally we can begin with makeup I like to use concealer first and spot treat any blemishes quality concealers are hard to come by but when you do a little goes a long way spot treat and gently Pat like this to blend from there I like to even out the area around my nose and mouth because of excess redness moving on to the eyes load up your brush with a light camel color and begin making a subtle pseudo cut crease try not to create a harsh line like a traditional cut crease make it feathery take a matte charcoal color load it up with a tiny angled brush get close to your eyes notice how this gives an illusion of a thicker lash line when doing this just be sure to use a light hand with the same brush begin to feather out the darker color along your lash line sweep it out into a wing this will help elongate the shape of your eyes so from here just grab more color and begin to intensify the way taking your time and starting lightly allows you to build up the intensity in layers now using a small eyeshadow brush load it up with a warm earth tone shadow and begin to line the lower lash line like this I know this beauty style looks pretty simple but you'd be surprised the most simple and natural looks actually require the most time because of the blending layering and feathering and once you're done just blend it out with a fluffy brush yes there is such a thing as a Sailor Moon liquid eyeliner and I have to say it's one of my favorite liners I'm going to use this one over the previous eyeliner to sharpen the line begin tapering out the line little by little to create a tapered point this will provide the most line control giving you the perfect wing okay let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the brows first I'm going to use a powder to create the base for my brow shape if you want it to look natural the powder finish should be matte from here I like to layer a pencil over creating hair like strokes make feathery marks like so and blur the lines by combing is believed through your brows using your favorite lash curler my holy grail is shoes press firmly against the roots of your lashes and try not to pinch yourself keep pressing from root to tip to get the best holding curl all right now you can tight line your eyes using a warm brown eyeliner the definition it gives goes well with the color you already placed on your lower lash line now you can fluff up your lashes with generous coats of mascara I know for some people the idea of sweeping mascara through the lashes seems terrifying but honestly for me every time I swipe it's such a satisfying feeling I know I'm so weird so I found the best faux lashes for Asian eyes they're called diamond lash and I discovered them in Tokyo first off the reason why they're so amazing is because they're super easy to peel off and I don't have to cut down the link the ban is super thin and it fits perfectly for Asian eyelids BAM look how natural this looks okay once your lashes are set give them one more curl to get them all perky and excited and now you got some batty lashes I like to powder when I'm almost done with the makeup because it helps maintain the freshness look at how pretty this gradient blushes it's not your basic blush color but it's wearable watch use a blush or contour brush and sweep it back and forth to load it up with the color pop this onto your cheeks by softly blending out towards your temple alright you should feel magical now but if you're craving more dimension lightly contour use a matte neutral bronzer in the hollows of your cheeks and dust the rest around your upper hairline to balance out the face almost done finish off your look with a sultry pout prep it with lipliner if needed and top it off with a greyish nude liquid lipstick all right now you're done enjoy your body cell love you good luck you 
hi beautiful I have here a hauntingly beautiful look for you to try out first thing you'll need to do is to cover up your eyebrows with a glue stick you just need a small amount and smear this over your brows to flatten them down and once the glue is dried you can start with your face makeup this isn't really needed but if you want your makeup to last all throughout the night prime your face first this is going to help hold the makeup in place now using your black eyeliner start sketching on your face begin by outlining the eye sockets then the nose and hollows of the cheeks and if you need extra help I recommend looking at reference pictures of skulls and you also want to feel the actual bones on your face you can feel some areas popping out and others sinking in think of it like a small anatomy lesson and now break out that black face paint and fill in the eye sockets just wet your brush and load it on the cake to activate the paint I'm using a water activated face paint that's also gentle to use on kids from here just fill in your eye socket with this black color and feel free to stop here if you want to look like a cute panda now take your white facepaint and with your brush paint to white out the bone area start at the forehead and work your way down I recommend working in layers so that you can really build up the contrast where you need it and you know what don't worry too much about getting perfectly clean lines because later on we're going to be blending them out and just keep painting to reveal your skull you can also run this over your lips and don't worry because it's gentle to use on the skin and the best part about this is that when you're done it washes right off with just water you want to try and create depth and dimension by bringing out features on the skull that pops out like the cheekbones forehead and teeth now if you need better precision for smaller areas just switch on over to a smaller brush when you draw in the nose try not to cover the whole area just do the front section in a triangle like shape and because I have on a strapless shirt I'm going to paint my decollete as well you can always look for a skeleton shirt that goes up to your neck so that you don't really have to paint everything on but if you want to go all out just paint all over your body this is super easy you just have to loosely draw out the skeleton frame and don't worry about it being accurate because people will get the idea and from here with your black paint start filling in the empty spaces and of course covering up your flesh only letting the bones expose kind of like an x-ray the most important tip is to just have fun with this look so experiment and play around cry use a sponge with a dab of white facepaint to blend for a realistic skull look and if this look is too intimidating for you just get someone else to help you out to shame and once you have the deep hollows drawn on take a thin eyeliner brush and just draw the teeth on your lips remember they don't have to look perfect and if you prefer you can also use a black eyeliner to draw the teeth lines and now we're moving on to shading all you need is a fluffy shadow blending brush and use a mixture of black and deep purple to shade in the areas around the eyes lips cheeks and of course forehead this will give your skull look even more dimension and grittiness it's kind of like ìitís guru but for the undead and once you have all the shading in place use a sponge with a dab of a white face paint to blend to help soften the shadows and if you want that piercing gaze pop in some intense light contacts and finish off your makeup with black eyeliner on the top and bottom waterline and now you're done and if you're going for that fantasy finish just put on a beautiful colored wig all right it's time to slay mmm love ya and of course good luck music by my all-time favorite late night alumni key Hey an oculus of glass oh and my book makeup your life guide to beauty style and success online and off is now available wherever books are sold bye everyone see you in my next video you 
hey guys what's going on so in this video I'm going to show you guys not only how to groom your brows but how to reshape it and fill them in these are tips that I personally use every day and they're super easy I have all the products here in this cute little bear bag unfortunately I think half of the world's population is lacking in the brow Department so if you have beautiful thick luscious brows please embrace them don't pluck them we are super jelly of anything we wish you guys can send us some brow hairs I mean donates them please I can use them so go online find a celebrity or someone that you really like look at how they do their brows I think you know it's it's nice to find inspiration because it gives you ideas to work off with and also don't be scared to experiment I mean that's the whole point of makeup you could play around with it and you can just wipe it off if you don't like it so the first thing I like to do when it comes to reshaping my brows is brushing the brow hairs and to neatly flatten them so you can see the shape if this is something you can work with and from there if you want to especially if you have really long brow hairs and they have a mind of their own and they just grow in so many different places you can use a bomb to flatten them so let's say for example you're a little too scared to experiment with plucking away I don't blame you especially for those who have a hard time growing out their brow hairs because you don't want to over pluck and then you're waiting three months later for it to grow out so what I recommend is getting a good nude eyeliner getting an eyeliner that matches your skin tone so I have here my flesh tone eyeliner and the name is in the nude and what you want to do is use this nude eyeliner to basically correct and erase any of the stray hairs gives you an example of what your brows will look like before plucking them so you don't have to commit to a shape you can really just play around and erase any of the hairs that you don't like or maybe if you want to see what your going to look like with super skinny arch brows you can really do that and once you've mapped everything out all you have to do is take a tweezer I recommend tweezerman just because I've been using this since I was like 15 years old and you know they've never steered me wrong you know this is not sponsoring anything I really like tweezerman I think they make great quality tweezers because they're super sharp so find a really good tweezer you don't want to get a cheap tweezer just because they don't last as long so you can either use ice to numb the pain or you can use a teething gel for 4 babies you know when they're teething and the third and pain poor little guys they're so cute you can use the numbing gel and you can apply it over the brows and that will numb it a little so that you can pluck away but honestly I mean it's not that painful I'm sure you guys have gone through much more painful things but if you're very very sensitive then either use ice or a teething gel so with your tweezer what you want to do is you want to start plucking away the stray hairs that the nude eye liner has covered up pulling in the direction where the hair is growing because if you pull it the other way it might hurt a little and the faster you pluck the less it's gonna hurt I know so much work just for brows but believe me it's worth it so now that your brows are plucked and primed they are ready to be filled in this is my favorite part the first thing I do depending on the mood I'm in is I fill in my brows with a powder you can either use an eye shadow powder and you want to make sure the texture is matte because if it's shiny or has like a pearl texture it's not gonna look as natural rule of thumb is if your hair is dark your brows should be two to three shades lighter than your hair color if your hair color is light it should be two to three shades darker if you want a more edgy err look the brows should be darker but then again like I said it's always fun to experiment so whatever works with your face take our angled eyeliner brush and dip it in either the brow powder so Anastasia makes a really good one called brow is loose powder I have this one in medium brown and it's really good I love it or you can use a neutral Brown or taupe eye shadow color and this one is by Makeup Forever and load it up with your angled eyeliner brush and start filling in the brows we can color in a picture you can do makeup this is really easy so just fill it in and feather it out so don't worry about getting the shape down it's really not about the shape when you're filling in your brows with powder it's more about just getting the volume and just filling it in so that there's not any empty spaces however if you're looking for more shape that's when you can play around with a pencil and what a pencil does is that it gives you more freedom and more flexibility to draw on your brows in different ways I see the benefit of using both powder because it softens the brows and it gives a very natural look combining it with a pencil to get more of that structure so once you've filled in your brows with powder now you can take your pencil and you can start lightly just feathering in the brows just creating little strokes it's really simple you don't have to be da Vinci to do something like this if you can draw a line you can fill in your brows so make quick little strokes and just feather in your brows like so brows are not twins they're sisters and I know some of you feel like they're cousins or they're stepsisters and trust me I have days where I feel like they're not even related but um it's fine brows are not supposed to be identical because first off your face is not symmetrical there's no such thing as a symmetrical face unless you're Denzel Washington I think for the rest of us mere mortals we have very very asymmetrical faces and it's totally fine it's natural it's supposed to be like that in fact I will show you a picture of my face normally and now my face is perfectly symmetrical it looks weird so taking your spoolie this is really important the spoolie is just as important as all your other tools you have here take your spoolie and start brushing and combing everything out it's going to blend everything together so it's going to look more natural it's still going to have its structure but it's not going to look as drawn on so now that you've perfected your brows and everything looks amazing and your masterpiece is on your face usually I'm good from there but if I want to get really fancy schmancy I top it off with brow gel so there's two different types you can get you can get a tinted brow gel like the one I have here by lash M or you can use a clear one or again another tinted one by shoes shoe in my opinion makes the best maker products I love you shoe rest in peace I love you and I think what I love most is how small the brush is so adorable but it's so tiny and it really gets to every single part of your brows right now the trend is big brows the bigger the better that's what she said seriously the bigger the better so once you filled in your brows and you've you know manicured it so it looks great if you want to give it that beautiful edge and this is something I personally don't really do but if that's your look all good I can show you a way to create that perfect manicured brow look and what you want to use is concealer a really good concealer if I were to really splurge on anything it's really concealer and the reason why it's because I make makeup products I know how cheap and how expensive you can get I'm not saying to buy the most expensive concealer I'm just saying invest in a good quality concealer something that's going to cover up and last long that's what you're paying for of course I'm going to recommend my own brand because I made this I know it works and it's called the great cover-up and taking a tiny little brush just load it up and just start dabbing it over the areas where you want that sharp edge and if you're more like me and you prefer having that rugged brow look and you want something that's a little more natural and unruly um skip the concealer you don't really need it embrace the strays yes so I think that's pretty much it celebrate how amazing your brows look by taking a bunch of selfies there's nothing wrong with you know celebrating how beautiful you are share your pictures with me by hashtagging Michelle Phan my name either on Twitter and Instagram so I can find them and like them alright guys that is it hugs and kisses love you guys so much best of luck and I'll see you in my next video 
yeah kini yeah kini I hope you're in a mood for a beautiful Egyptian look that's fit for a queen for Egyptian inspired eyes make sure your brows are nicely groomed and defined it's important to make sure your brows complement the eye makeup brows are the frames to the eyes you should bring harmony to your face once you're done with your eyes it's time to use eye primer I'm going to use a tinted eye primer to help boost the intensity of my eye makeup dab a little bit of this on your lids and lower lash line to prep them using a creamy black eyeliner add a few marks around the outer corner of your eyes to create a cat eye shape it doesn't have to be perfect because you're using a creamy eyeliner formula we still have more play time to work and blend the line to create the perfect sculpted cat liner using an angled brush will give you better control and if you want an exotic look create a line like this on the inner corner of your eyes for that Egyptian look now this is a wearable look now if you want to play up this look try adding a metallic blue sky color on the lower lash line for a nice pop of color all right so break out your black liquid liner and very carefully draw an outline around the blue and layer the liquid liner over the cat liner to intensify the black so from here just outline the rest of your eye makeup until you have this graphic look with the azure color add this on the contour of your eyes and follow the shape of your eye makeup blend out the color until you have a gradient finish we're almost done with the eyes now it's time to curl your lashes Oh Koran with the tablecloth in my hair ah using your favorite dramatic volumizing mascara add generous coats onto your lashes for an eye-popping finish for the rest of the face makeup you can either add bronzer or contr contouring is a great way to play up your features you can create the illusion of cheekbones slimmer nose or a slimmer jawline and more right okay unless you want to look like a warrior queen blend out your contour marks for a natural finish I don't get to see the Sun much but I can cheat it with a Sunkist illuminator add this under your cheekbones for a beautiful golden touch oh and don't forget to blend out towards her neckline for that illuminating glow and just finish off with a lip color of your choice and I'm going to use a natural rosy lip color and for that golden finish add a touch of this eye shadow color on your lower lip and just blend out now we're done yeah kini yeah kini have fun with this look and good luck 
hey everyone so this is our first episode of career talk where we're basically going to talk about all things career related we're going to start from internships and work our way up to CEO so the first episode is going to be about how to get an internship and who better to segue into this topic then Lauren Berger the intern Queen in your book you talk about a trained list what is a dream list you can make this on excel on Google Docs on a napkin whatever you want just try to have it with you at all times so you can just pull it up on your phone pull it up in your laptop but the first column is going to be company so of course the company where you're applying for an internship the second column is going to be the company website then you have the company contact information so who's the internship coordinator what's their email what's their phone number then you're going to put the materials required some internships will require resumes cover letters letters of recommendation whatever it might be write that down you want to make sure that you follow directions if you don't follow directions I probably not going to get the internship so and then you're going to track the date that you apply for the internship and of course the internship deadline now the last column is so important because it's the follow-up category you are going to follow up two weeks after you submit your materials and that's why it's so important to track the date that you send your materials out you want to make sure that you're staying on top of these applications and you're reaching out you're confirming that people received your materials and you're really taking initiative and showing that you're interested is it inappropriate to hit them up on Twitter or Instagram or what are the rules and etiquette sure intern shipping yeah so let's discuss the social media etiquette so I think Facebook is weird I do I think it would be weird to find a CEO of a company on Facebook and send them a friend request I feel like people take Facebook very personally they use it to share photos with friends and family I feel like they don't necessarily want an interested student or even an intern finding them there I think Twitter is fair game as long as their feet is not private if their feet is public I think that's a great way to follow an executive at a company to find out what would interest them you know what drives them what news articles are they sharing you could tweet to them and say I just applied for an internship at your company I'm so excited and I've heard about students landing internships because of tweets hosting this sounds yeah it does work and then LinkedIn is a must I mean you have to have a LinkedIn profile and LinkedIn is a great way to search the company that you want to work for and then find out what friends you have in common a great trick is also to see which alumni from your college or university work at your dream companies okay terrible resumes I've seen resumes where the students just totally leave off their contact information so again if I'm an employer and I'm interested in your resume I want to contact you that's that's the next step the resume should really help you land the internship um make sure you have a professional email address I just helped my little cousin last week she had an email address that was like Princess 747 so I was like oh no no no we did a nice first name middle initial last name at gmail.com also make sure your education is on there as an employer the second I look at your resume I want to understand where you are in life now what year are you are you in college are you in high school when do you graduate that information is really pertinent on the resume and then also the formatting make sure it's consistent there should be the same number of spaces between every category so I think the best resumes I've seen have a little bit of color they're not doing the traditional formatting maybe they have a little side margin that lists some of their on campus or extracurricular activities make sure the information is chronological I've seen some backwards resumes where the first thing I'll see on there is from like 2002 and I'm thinking huh otherwise I would say that I just see a lot of resumes that clearly aren't tailored for the position that you're applying for if you're going after a social media position then you want to make sure when you talk about all the different experiences you've had you talked about social media you say things like Facebook Twitter Instagram whatever stopped chat whatever it might be cover letters if we have an employer who's hiring interns in Los Angeles and they get a resume from a student who goes to school in Oklahoma but maybe they're from Los Angeles the employer doesn't know that it's your job to connect the dots and say yes I do go to college in Oklahoma however I'm going to be home over the summer in Los Angeles where I'm from and I'm going to be available to intern from May until August or whatever the timeframe is also if you're a senior or even a high school junior maybe you're a college freshman you're a little younger but you're really ambitious call that out in the cover letter yes I'm a freshman but I've done all of my research and I'm ready and prepared to take on this internship letters of recommendation are also frequently requested so it's always good to have three different types of letters of recommendation on hand at all times one academic reference so that's from a professor who you had a great experience with I'm one professional reference so maybe it was your boss at your first job my first job was at the Red Lobster and then also a character reference so someone who's in your personal life in your social circle who can speak to your you know the personal traits that make you great for any position for the personal one family members do the counter note yeah I think you could definitely have family members I'm if anyone in your social circle has a really cool job or like a really unique take on again you and why you would make a great addition to any company I think that person would be great to write the letter make sure you're a nice person so the next topic that I want to read a back on is social media how do you monitor your social media so I always say give yourself the presidential test if you were running for president tomorrow what are people gonna find on you make sure that you're going through all those Facebook photos and I know it takes a long time block out a weekend to do it but get those ways a lot of the photos yes get those Facebook photos out of there I mean if you're hesitant if you're unsure just delete it because who cares you can save it on your personal computer the world doesn't need to see it you also want to make sure that you're updating these channels frequently a lot of employers are going to look at your Twitter feed or or Instagram and they want to know that you're integrating these tools into your daily life a lot of people are hiring you know Millennials and high school students because they want help with their social media presence so they want to see that you've been posting frequently and it hasn't been you know three months since your last blog if you don't want to private some albums what I recommend is just open another account and private that and just add your immediate friends and family and that way you can still keep that sense of freedom to just post what you want but then on your public accounts you can be more professional or just be be the best version of what you want your public image to be so how does one prepare for the interview yeah so the interview is so important because as good as your resume is if you don't walk in and if you're not a great reflection of the material mentioned on your resume you're probably not going to get the position of course we all know that you have to dress appropriately now companies today tend to be a little bit more casual in nature however it's still crucial that you're dressed to impress and don't worry about feeling stupid because you're overdressed for an interview I think it's really nice when a student comes into an interview and an employer says wow they really dressed up they're really taking this seriously so remember that's a good thing I would stay away from genes from flip-flops from sneakers for internship and job interviews so of course you go to the interview you arrive on time if not 15 minutes early you come with copies in your hand of all of your materials if the interviewer didn't have time to look at your resume beforehand you want to say here you go all happen to me I think taking notes during an interview especially if the employer starts to go into detail about what the position entails is completely fine so after the interview do you recommend sending a follow-up note a thank-you card oh yes um my intern Queen's secret tip is that the intern that sends the thank-you note gets the internship is it always the case no unfortunately it's not but I'm telling you it is like the bonus point so after the interview when you go back in your car to your dorm room or you go back home you want to take the time to write a thank-you note it can be five sentences long thank the employer for taking time out of their day to sit with you reference something you spoke about in the interview and tell them that you look forward to hearing from them in the future and I'm telling you if a company is deciding between two students and a thank you note lands on their desk the student that sends the thing you know gets the internship because it shows that they're thoughtful they're thoughtful and they're very conscious hi Michelle so my question is how do I get ready for a job interview because I can get really anxious and it's horrible so yeah love you oh alright the best way to get ready for a job interview is first of all take a deep breath and do exercises outside of the whole job interview scenario to try to build your confidence I always say talk to the subway guy like go to Subway talk to the sandwich artist but engage in conversation with strangers as silly as that sounds you want to get comfortable with small talk with people that you encounter in everyday life okay next question I love this girl how did you get an internship without experience most internships look for experience in the field I think I know what she's trying to say if you don't have relevant internship experience that's when you start to dig have you had a part time job if you don't have part time job experience what about volunteer experience have you and your family ever fed the homeless on Thanksgiving or ever volunteer that you know anywhere really at a Boys and Girls Club at a soup kitchen that's all stuff that you can put on your resume you can also put relevant courses that you've taken you know there's a lot of high schoolers that are going to these magnet programs and you're taking some really impressive courses so if you're taking a really cool art class a really cool technology class put that on your resume if you're working on any really interesting class projects that's also something you can put on your resume and then don't forget those extracurricular activities you know when I was in high school I was the co-captain of the dance team hey oh but that would go on my resume so don't underestimate the power of that on campus involvement and it is huge and something that employers tell me they really want to see a lot of so I want to thank you learn so much for giving all these great sound advice if you want to jump into the world of internships and you want to learn everything about this this is your Bible all work no pay is your Bible for all things internships internships are so important and I'll just reiterate that it all starts with an internship and it just takes one internship and you never know what the outcome of that one experience is going to be so good luck on your internship journey good luck guys we love you bye you

you know there are days when we just can't get her hair to look right but then we have those days when we look and feel like the Queen because I want my skin to look flawless I'm going to be using face primer first I actually recommend this product for guys who want to reduce a shiny face without the makeup look smooth this all over your face and let's move on to concealing take your favorite concealer I'm using here my trusty old great cover-up concealer and with my Beauty Blender sponge I have right here I'm going to show you my current face makeup routine with a little bit of concealer on the sponge I'm dabbing a touch under my eyes to brighten and conceal any of the dark areas and sometimes what I'll do is add a lighter concealer shade around my cheek area to create the illusion of fuller looking cheeks so just smooth everything out and powder up you can either use a sponge a powder brush or a powder puff to gently apply the powder on the area where you used concealer or foundation if your foundation or concealer has a matte finish you can skip this step alright time for the brows I'm going to be using two pencils and a brow filler to create my brow look for today I'm taking my brow pencils here called arch and using a color that matches my brow hair I'm going to fill in my brows if you naturally have full brows you might not need much work however for me I have to literally draw my brows on by creating feathery strokes once you're done creating your brow shape an extra step I like to do is add a brow filler brush this over your brows and you'll notice right away how natural they look find an eyeliner or eyeshadow in an amethyst color and outline the outer third of your eyes what you want to do is create a winged shape just by following your natural contour and from here just fill in the line as if your coloring in a leaf you want to make sure to leave the center of your lids at and from here with a brush quickly smudge the color to create a soft gradation you can use a blending brush if you needed using here a teal or turquoise color outline the outside of the amethyst color don't cover up the purple take the color down along the outer lower lash line and stop at the halfway point just blend in the teal so that it has a nice smooth transition into the purple the teal and amethyst combination will create this multifaceted effect it's going to look gorgeous under any different lighting just blend everything out and let's move on to warmer colors I'm holding here the pop eyes shadow trio using an antique metallic color remember when I asked you to leave an empty space on the center of your lids well that's because we're going to fill it in with this regal color and using the highlighter color here add this along the inner area of your eye to help open them up using a real gold eyeshadow well not real cool but you know what I mean add this on top of antique gold the combination of purple and gold will give your eyes this royal touch using a rose gold or champagne eyeliner pencil in your waterline to brighten up your eyes using your favorite liquid liner that's not black I'm using here a navy color but you can use a dark grey dark brown or dark blue line your eyes starting along the top inner corner of your eyes slowly connecting the lines to extend it out and from here just line the lower lash line just a bit using a blending brush find the natural contour of your eyes and start blending the blue and purple eye shadow colors to create a hazy finish because of the liquid liner we don't want the eyeshadow to have a hard edge keep it soft and help balance out the look so I've been using this mini shoe lash curler it takes a little more time to curl but you really get every single lashes on your eyes that you may have missed and once you're done apply your favorite lash lengthening mascara our Dell carries some awesome lashes I'm using here the 1:20 demo after cutting them to fit your lash line add a thin strip of glue on the lash band and wait a few seconds for the white glue to dry clear I think this has become my favorite product from my makeup line kee ad or scooter I'm using this double-sided contouring and highlighting stick to help map out my face so that you can see where the contouring is going before blending it out so from here just blend out your so-called war paint alright looks good so far alright time for some color be a bombshell blush add this on the apples of your cheeks mark your territory and with your clean warm fingers or Beauty Blender go ahead and blend so that it looks more natural alright we're almost done using here my red lip pencil fill in your lips ah a good read never fails and if you want to add a darker twist to your red lips just layer a deeper berry color over it this will give your lips more dimension a red lip is extremely high maintenance meaning you have to make sure the edge is clean and from here just powder the rest of your face so that your camera-ready finish off your lip by adding argan oil to your hair to give it that natural shine I've been putting oil in my hair to keep it hydrated and healthy looking a gold or red nail polish color is the perfect nail accessory for this regal look okay chicas have fun trying this look out share with me your reigning queen look by tagging hashtag Fon look and if I love it I'll make sure to

here's how to master the art of looking like a bronze goddess without the Sun you increase your cancer risk by 70 percent just by tanning once intense right every year more people develop skin cancer from tanning than lung cancer from smoking so if you want to protect yourself from the Sun and tanning beds try some sunless tanning options and here's my top 10 tips on ways to becoming a glowing goddess for this summer numero uno repeat after me exfoliate exfoliate exfoliate by evening out the top layer of your skin you're getting rid of dry patches so that you can create the perfect canvas to apply the product number to avoid deodorants if possible I know it sounds a little grody but deodorant can act as a barrier between your skin and your tanning products leaving streaky uneven application yeah number 3 don't shower or exercise for 12 hours while your color is still processing you don't want to do anything that may make you sweaty or rinse it away instead of being a Sun bum you can now just be a bum number 4 avoid wearing white clothes I mean it's kind of a no-brainer who ones are clothes covered in self-tanner number 5 tape your feet when you're tanning at home cut down on all the mess by taping the bottoms of her feet with painters tape it's gonna help keep the floors from getting dirty and the bottoms of your feet from getting streaked with color so if you still live with your parents they'll thank you for this number 6 you want to shave at least 12 hours before the reason why is because if you shave too soon your pores will be open potentially leaving you to brown dots after application number 7 lip and body cell you want to apply body style to your lips and hands to avoid unwanted streaks in color this will act as a barrier to keep a Tanner away from this area number eight apply at-home tanning mist in the shower skip the mess and clean up by playing the mist in the shower so that you can wash it right away after application no hassle number nine use a large powder brush to buff out any harsh lines sometimes your tan doesn't come out perfectly but with a small amount of product on a large buffing brush you can fix any streaks or any harsh lines number ten test it out highly recommend it to test a little on your back before applying to your whole body because you never know you might have a reaction to the product better safe than sorry right and here are the different ways you can get a killer tan without baking your skin I know the tanning section can be a bit intimidating at the store so here's a quick rundown on different options that you can choose from self tanning for darker skin isn't about changing the overall shade but rather to help even out any skin imperfections and give your already tan skin a healthy glow you want to make sure the tanning products that you're using is specifically formulated from medium to dark tones or else the product might not make much of a difference if you want to get creative you can use Tanner to do a little bit of body contouring focusing on your collarbones arms stomach and legs these self tanning towels come in medium to dark skin tones they also provide better precision than mousse or lotion and if you're looking for that instant pick-me-up use a gradual tanner to keep your skin moisturize and luminous for all you medium skin folks tanning is easier because most products are made for your skin tone a lot of the hassle is just trial and error and finding out what brands and formulas work best for you but if you're in a rush lotions and sprays from the drugstore are perfect when you want a touch of color for a night out or a weekend trip for fair to light skin uneven this is easy to see so begin by prepping your skin with primer then start with a light base coat and work your way up to your desired shade try and understand what undertones work best for you and I recommend steering clear of anything that looks too orange or warm based try using mousse and a tanning mitt to ensure an even application where can quick even strokes like this if you're not a big fan of reading the provided materials I recommend glancing at the instructions just in case because each brand has a different technique let's say you're not really into doing it yourself no worries a spray tan is a great option because technicians are professionally trained to give you the best sunless tan possible spray tans allow you to get a perfect even full-body tan in just one application these are great for special events and the best part is that you don't have to clean up any mess it all stays at the spray tan salon just make sure to wear old loose-fitting clothes and bring a towel so that you don't get any Tanner on your car seat so this is what an express tan looks like after one shower and four hours of development all right so that's it mastering the art of becoming the golden goddess good luck on keeping your skin happy and healthy so that it will stay beautiful

welcome to pillow talk this is my room and this is where we're going to have the most intimate conversations so you guys sent me a lot of questions I think over 4,000 the topics for this video online privacy dealing with boredom and insecurities in the digital age in this digital age it's very common for young ladies including myself to look on social media and see images of other young ladies with the perfect body and the perfect life how can we stop ourselves from comparing us to them thanks to hearts I've noticed on Instagram pictures of beautiful women everywhere I think that's exciting because I love beauty I appreciate beauty I'm a person who loves looking at beautiful things and I love creating beautiful things and sharing beautiful things however of course I have those moments when I feel weak it's a lot it's a lot of thoughts are coming into my head and I'm trying my best to articulate this it's human nature to compare yourself to other people because we are very adaptive and receptive it's totally normal to feel insecure it's totally normal to feel I guess jealous but you do have a choice with what you want to see you don't necessarily have to see these beautiful pictures of all these girls looking at their perfect portrayed life instead perhaps you can start following photographers or painters artists musicians there are so many other things you can follow online doesn't necessarily have to be a supermodel or a celebrity that has this perfect life that's what they want to show you the power of social media is that you become your own storyteller do you get to have access to all these apps and filters skin filters where you have that perfect airbrush phase you can even give yourself that size zero waste with a touch of a button I'm not even kidding I've seen these apps huge believer not doing that because that really does distort how you perceive yourself and very unhealthy don't give yourself such a hard time because you can do this dude you can portray your best version of yourself and your perfect life however is that all you want to show online I'd much rather be valued then wanted some make sense because as you grow older you realize that looks fade but what remains the same is your soul in your wisdom best of luck to you dreamer do you think parents should prohibit their children to use phones computers and stuff like this until they become older everything in moderation if you're going to give your child a phone or an iPad I would prohibit them having access to the Internet give them tools that they can use to create games for them to really invigorate their minds if you're going to give them access to the world that's tough because it's so easy to find you know porn on Instagram or on Twitter a lot of the times these social media platforms they're big they're massive but they can't censor everything because everyone's uploading around the same time it's really hard you know when you're a child you're you're absorbing everything you're sponge and if they have access to seeing all this vulgarity and that's going to imprint something on their mind I mean honestly people around the world still to this day they live perfectly fine without the computer and Internet so it's really up to you and your choice as a parent then again I'm not a parent so sometimes I feel like I'm a good with all those movies that I watch when they hit the big screen some scare me and want me to keep changing myself like the movie Duff how do you know or how do you feel when someone or a group of people is trying to use you and make you feel bad by putting you in a label or first off if someone is using you and they're your friend they're not your friend I'd much rather have one amazing best friend than for me to have 100 friends that probably don't even care about me so sometimes I feel like people they force themselves into a friendship because they don't want to be alone you know you don't have time for this I'm sorry life is too short so you're going to a school where everyone is trying to figure themselves out how can you really make quality quality friend friendship takes a lot of work it's like a real relationship a relationship that you would have with a boyfriend or girlfriend if there's no sacrifices in a friendship that's tough and if that other person is not reciprocating back to you you know this friendship becomes a one-way street that's not friendship focus on yourself focus on your giftings and develop that because that will take you places someone that's going to bring you down boom what are your feelings about retouching in magazines and on social media by the way I love you I love you too okay this is my honest opinion I really don't care when I see a beautiful picture of someone I'm not going to dissect it there's no point because I see it as art if someone wants to show their best version of themselves online why not come on let's be real when you're doing your makeup and you're curling your hair that's not what you really look like you did you really wake up like that I mean you have youth and beauty for so long just enjoy it I've got to throw a filter on it do it I moved to France for college and I'm away from my family and friends I have my own apartment now but sometimes it gets kind of lonely and I get forward what would you recommend to do when I'm alone I'm bored at my apartment thank you and I love you I love you too and you're not alone a lot of people are away from their family and friends and they're in college or they're you know they're moving someplace else outside the country and we can all sympathize I was there once too when I was in college and even when I moved out to LA by myself when I was going through this this is when I started my youtube channel boredom inspired new ideas it brought me to a webcam moments when you're alone if they're good things because they can inspire new ideas and thoughts it's nice because someday if you do start a family it's going to be tough to find those alone times and I hear this from a lot of my friends who are moms you know they have no alone time only alone time they have is in the shower this is the moment honestly in my opinion where you can really develop and become the person you will be in the future it's a lot of questions let's see how do you handle nervousness about your relationships online how do you keep them safe and strong well what I like to do is I like to send pictures I'll designate a day where it's like a Wacky Wednesday or a Freaky Friday where we have to send each other funny things not freaky pictures like funny things things that might freak us out you have to have consistency when you have relationships online because we're so connected to other things we tend to forget to connect with people can matter most to help maintain these you have to keep constant communication that doesn't mean you have to constantly text them all the time or you know have them on standby no that's not what I mean sending them a funny picture sharing articles that you read or liking their picture making a funny comedy these are things that you can they can really add a lot I mean it's a new form of communication is it communication that I believe we should always do no not necessarily because I do believe in the power of FaceTime and having that one-on-one relationship time that quality time with that person there's nothing more important than family friends and your relationship so that's my recommendation best of luck how do you deal with fake people I've learned that in life can't deal with fake people just got to cut them out ignore them I know it's tough but it's part of tough love you know you're born some people talk crap some people say good things about you and you die are you gonna live your life trying to make the people who are talking crap happy are you gonna focus more on the people who love you who will nurture you and who will better your life alright everyone so that was my first episode of pillow talk and let me know if you like this thumbs up or thumbs down if you're diggin this the idea of pillow talk is for me to have this one-on-one with you guys and to have that intimate talk because often times um right before I sleep I'm online for at least an hour replying back to my tweets to you guys on Instagram replying to YouTube comments and Facebook comments I call it pillow talk because I'm laying down I'm in bed I'm super comfy this isn't really my time to have that intimate one-on-one dialogue with you and so I decided to turn it into a video format if you have any questions that you would like for me to answer just hashtag cool talk and I'll go find your hashtag hopefully and feature them my video so let me know what you guys think I love you so much dreamers best of luck with everything and of course good luck I don't know what I'm doing bye you 
Hi majestic one. They say your room is your sanctuary. If that's the case, I want to share some creative
ways to help elevate the space and vibe of your room. Bring in the magic with this floating cloud
that's illuminated from within. All you need is a string, a paper lantern,
a battery-operated LED light, glue, and some Poly-fil. You can find Poly-fil at almost any fabric
or craft store. Begin by taking your paper lantern and fanning
it out. Carefully, using a hot glue gun, begin placing
glue into the ridges of your lantern and start inserting small clumps of fluff. You want to start with smaller amounts, creating
the first layer. Keep layering and layering until your cloud
reaches the desired level of fluffiness. So pretty! Loop some string through the clasp to tie
it all together. And just hang it up to bring the sky inside. Change is good and sometimes needed. And if you feel like your phone needs that
change, well, you can make a custom one. All you need is a pair of scissors and a clear
case. Once you have a concept in mind, bring it
to life. You can use craft paper, printed online images,
stickers, or whatever. Before you start, make a stencil of your phone
first, like this. Cut out your prints and place them into the
back of your phone case. From here just experiment. Comment below and let me know what print you
would like to have on your case. For me, I'm all about the sticker craze. Ever since I was a child I had an obsession
with stickers. I used to collect them and keep them in a
shoebox. Now as an adult, I can splurge on stickers. I know, I'm such a baller. Bring the sky closer with this constellation
jar. All you need is a clear jar, string lights,
some heavy-duty foil, and a pin. The thicker the foil, the sharper looking
the stars. Print out your favorite star constellations
to use as a template and line them up over your foil. Carefully, push your pin into the foil and
create holes where you want your stars to be. From here just line the foil up inside your
jar and push it up against the sides, molding it to the shape of the jar. And to illuminate your creation, turn on the
lights and place them into the jar. Seal the lid and voila! You can create this nebula in a jar by using
things you probably already have around your house for your desk or nightstand. Start with a clean, empty bottle. Have your cotton balls, food coloring, and
glitter ready. First step is to add food coloring to the
bowls of water to create your desired colors and add glitter into each bowl. Now break apart your cotton balls into thinner
layers to get the best effect for your jar. Place a layer about an inch thick at the bottom
of your bottle and pour the first color inside. Repeat this step for all the colors that you
want in your jar. You just created your own nebula in a jar. So cool. If you found time to make any of these, please
share it, take a picture, and tag me. I'd love to see what you made. I hope this video inspires you to be creative
and to help elevate your vibe. Good luck! Peace. 
hey everyone welcome to pillow top number six where we're going to talk about ego social anxiety and betrayal so three really tough things look at all these questions you guys sent first question is by just blossom seventy five and she asked Michelle how do you learn to do just what you love to do without thinking about what's going on in other people's minds having the mental capability of overcoming the problems that you're creating in your head is so key a lot of the times when people start worrying about what other people think you're displacing your insecurities on everyone else around you or the other way around maybe everyone else around you is displacing their insecurities onto you and you're reflecting that you have to stop thinking about what other people are thinking and think about what you're thinking that's so important what do you think about it what makes you happy what feels right to you because if you're trying to please everyone else around you you're never going to please yourself when it comes to your own personal projects your own beliefs your own identity its instrumental for you to own it yourself and to not have other people dictate how you should be how you should think what you should eat what you should wear who you should marry what type of job you should have it's all on you from Giselle and her handle is Harry's favorite underscore I wonder who Harry is Michelle the difference between confidence and stucco having confidence in my opinion means that you accept who you are you accept your your traits your positive traits and also your negative traits too but you are very accepting who you are how you look how you present yourself arrogance is different because it's based more on ego it plays a lot with insecurities your own insecurities that you have with yourself and overcompensating that insecurity by being overconfident and exuding that presence with everyone else it can be like a magnet because a lot of people gravitate towards someone that's very very confident sometimes borderline stuck-up because they do shine brightly but it can be a huge turnoff for a lot of people too because that type of attitude can be a little abrasive for most people who just you know they just want to do their own work quietly they just want to live their own life and dealing with someone that has that arrogance can be really difficult so your attitude is so important and if your attitude is less about gratitude and you're giving more attitude it's never going to last long it's going to be really hard for you to progress in life with an attitude that is built on arrogance rather than confidence so how you distinguish it is confidence is all about self-acceptance arrogance is built on ego and insecurity question from Inga at Inga photos Michelle how do I get a job when you have social anxiety jobs for people with social anxiety I can give you one in relation to what I know of so with Ipsy we invested a lot of our money into customer service and customer experience so we have a whole team of what we call if see care people who they answer your questions on Instagram on Twitter on Facebook wherever you ask your questions regarding your bags or your account or with Ipsy they go and they answer it and they get a chance to talk to people without actually having to talk to them in person so let's say you're not the best when it comes to writing but you're a great photographer or you're really good at editing these are jobs that you can do or you don't really have to communicate with people every day you can communicate with them via online messages and you can either like take photos or do or become a social media manager you can learn how to edit pictures or videos or you can learn how to draw you can still do great social stuff but without having to interact with people all the time because even with myself I get a lot of social anxiety whenever I go to big events whenever I go to parties and I have to meet people that I don't know because I don't really know who a lot of these strangers are I'm meeting them for the first time I can't really gauge them and I'm just very quiet I like to observe I like to see what the environment is like first before I interact before I even open my mouth because if everyone is talking really loud and they're having fun well I'll adapt to that situation and these are things that you can kind of consciously keep on the back burner whenever you're going into a new workplace or you're going to an event just observe the room first you know understand the vibe and try and adapt to that vibe even just listening you'd be surprised the power of someone listening is a gift so if you're a great listener you're a great asset to these social events because there's always going to be people there who are going to want to talk they're going to want to have something that really listens to them hi mesh hi love you love you too how clothes we wear can help with social anxiety this sometimes overwhelming with a little sad face Thanks the more comfortable I feel in my clothes the more confident I become I think the first thing again is just observe see what everyone else is wearing and if you want to adapt with it but the most important is really wearing what you love and feeling comfortable in it because I truly believe when you feel comfortable in something you're not going to only look good you're going to feel good because if you're wearing something where you're always like one really you know you're pulling the skirt down or maybe something is a little too tight and you're trying to suck everything in that is going to reflect on you that people are going to see that you do feel uncomfortable because you are putting off that vibe when someone sees that you're wearing something that's very genuine to you you're going to inspire conversations from people so imagine if you're a huge Star Wars fan and you wore a Star Wars necklace or an earring or a t-shirt and someone there is also a Star Wars fan they're going to come up to you and maybe say something and spark a conversation and boom right there you have interaction and you have a potential friend or someone that you can talk to how can you overcome the pain of betrayal tried-and-true method is time time is relative the richest person to the poorest person has 24 hours in the day what you can make in those 24 hours is all up on you the methodology that I do is I take the emotions that I'm going through anger jealousy resentment I take all of those negative emotions and I make something creative out of it doing something creative producing something making something can really help pass the time you're purging everything out onto a canvas onto a desktop onto a video onto your face believe me once you're making something once you're taking all of those energies and you're turning it into something creative and you made something out of it you feel so much better you feel more empowered and you realize that when you're waiting for something to happen you're on the universe's time but if you're the one who is actively making your own time now you are the universe creating your own reality and that's so powerful I have a boyfriend who will not let me look at his phone I think he might be cheating on me what do I do you shouldn't judge someone by what they're looking at on their phone what they have on their phone because that's so private I mean our phones have become so much more than just a phone it's become almost like our diary it has everything on there our secrets our thoughts what we research what we looked up and I don't think it's fair free for someone like you to have access to all that information because if he or she wanted to share that with you I mean that should have been shared already but maybe your relationship is not at that point where you can share things like that there are some things that you shouldn't know there's some things that you should know if you want to look at his phone he should look at your phone to keep things fair in that sense but if there's some things that you don't want him to see there's probably some things that he doesn't want you to see because maybe he's dealing with his own personal problems and he wants to deal with it in his own way you breaking into his phone I don't think that is healthy that shows also that you lack confidence in him so that might put a damper on the relationship how can I keep my own ego in check I keep my ego in checked by just calling my mom it's always important to have that one person in your life that grounds you they know who you are and they know the best parts of you hopefully that person can just be real with you and just tell you straight up that you know you're slipping it's so easy to surround yourself with yes people that can build a different reality in your head because if you're always surround yourself with people who are always saying yes or you're shielding yourself from criticism constructive criticism how can you ever improve how do you even know that you're doing anything wrong when no one is even calling you out whenever your bones are broken and it heals it becomes stronger that's what I believe you know when you get constructive criticism it strengthens you and you become more conscious on it and you work on it so be open to constructive criticism surround yourself or have one person in your life that can keep it real that's down with you and that will tell you straight up if you are acting out of line and the third one is to reflect on things that you've done and that can be a Sunday thing whether it's church or it can be daily thing every night before you go to sleep just reflecting on the day thinking about who did you interact with how many people did you elevate how many people did you piss off - I mean keep it real and reflect on that and become a better person the next day alright so that was it thank you so much for submitting all these questions they were really great I feel like I'm growing with you guys just kind of nice as we're figuring out how to live this thing that we call life thank you so much for just listening to my advice and my experiences and just being part of this journey I love you guys I'll see you on the next pillow talk why bye good luck with everything 
hi welcome to pillow top number two so I had you guys send in a bunch of questions this will be very exciting I'm excited to look at them because they're so good so we have some really really heavy topics to go over the first one how to overcome adversity online versus reality and what it means to be famous this is from Yves Louise aim I'm never happy with myself and when I see celebrities or famous personalities I tend to try to be like them because they seem happy what do you think in any advice for me on loving myself four hearts first off I love you please don't compare yourself to celebrities oftentimes we look at celebrities and we see how they portray this perfect life but you have to remember that this is the life that they want you to see very similar to our lives I mean when we have a public account we always want to show the best version of ourselves right however that's not all of you just like how it's not all of me thank you car horn yes keep honking everyone here's you at the end of the day we're all human I'm sure these celebrities you may think that they're happy but I'm sure they have moments where they feel vulnerable or they feel insecure we all do we have those moments too everyone's gonna have a different path when it comes to finding their own personal happiness I can give you a bunch of different lists but honestly it really comes from inside you know when was the last time you went to the mirror you looked at the mirror you looked at yourself and you asked yourself am I happy don't be scared to ask yourself those deep questions am i in the right relationship is this where I want to be in life am i doing what I love do I feel loved am i loving myself what I like to do is I like to maintain positive thoughts so if you ever feel discouraged think positive thoughts I know it's easier said than done but believe me it really does make a difference okay that was really cheesy but you know what sometimes cheesiness is truth right Feroze okay from Elysia mood tally bova do you feel like life was so much easier before you were famous you know quite honestly Fame has never really been something that I was pursuing being recognized for a talent yes absolutely I'm a creator at heart I artist I love creating things and like any artist we love having an audience that can appreciate our work it's definitely a little different I mean I do get noticed and it's easier for me to approach a business person to start perhaps a meeting is life simpler I don't know I mean I definitely have to be more careful with what I say a long time ago when I was a teenager I had a blog where I wrote a lot of dark poems I was very very emotional I was definitely trying to figure myself out I loved being able to express myself 100% because no one really knew who I was however the more popular I became the more I realized I can't really say what I want to say because I have to be a little more politically correct because my influence is global so I don't want to step on anyone's toes and it's sometimes it's really hard because not everyone is going to agree with the same thing that you agree with everyone's going to bring in a different perspective and that was something that I had to really accept and also understand that there's going to be someone else who believes in a different idea than you and that's okay and it was really hard at first when I started because if I made a video and I offended people I felt like I didn't offend someone but that other person got offended so you know unintentionally I I harmed or I heard that person you definitely pay a price with fame because you have to give up a lot of your freedom to really speak how you really feel a lot of these things I had to learn along the way and of course when you learn along the way you stumble a lot because you're trying to learn it and you're trying to adapt as fast as you can but for sure now I feel much more confident in my place I do miss moments where I can just go into a beauty store and not be recognized you know I just want to be a customer but you know what it's totally fine I really don't mind it when you guys come up to me and you want to take a selfie or you're asking me for recommendations because I love sharing I love sharing I love making people happy so more power to you guys I love you underscore make Hannah underscore what are the things that irritate you about your fame what would you like to say to people who think that fame has no downsides things that irritate me about Fame is people who you know once you become famous or well-known they hate on you for it the heat on you they say oh she sold out or he sold out or he or she forgot about the little people seriously just because we take an endorsement deal from a brand that we really believe in does not mean we sold out in fact it's the total opposite we're getting paid and we're getting recognized by a brand that we love ourselves and we want to promote I do understand that if someone else were to take an offer or a sponsorship from a brand that doesn't really correspond with them yet I can see how that's selling out however most youtubers and most people they're not trying to sell out guys they're just trying to put food on the table sure you can say well this person has so much money or too much money it's easy to say that but we don't know that they might have families who depend on them to every other famous person I don't really know what they're spending their money on a lot of the times it's not selling out sometimes you'd be shocked oftentimes the celebrity feels like their pressure to do an endorsement deal because of an agency or a manager or another third party that is bringing deals to these talents and so it's a different story for everyone okay so this is from a user on Instagram it's a sim mignon are you different in real life and online how soon I wouldn't say exactly I'm different online than I am offline if you were to come up to me to talk to me I would talk to you just like this I'm actually shooting this video by myself there's no one behind the camera it's just you and me so I I do feel like I am being myself and I'm not different I'm a very awkward person and when you meet me I'm very shy I'm an introvert whether you believe it or not that's what I know I am do I feel like I'm different online and offline not really there's definitely more to me offline than what you see online because what I show online is what I want to show to my followers but my global followers again if I showed everything I did offline you know it might not align with some of my other followers around the world I'm not saying what I do offline is that it's just what I do offline is personal and I want to keep it that way a lot of you guys who are watching this video and you might be teenagers you're going to be sharing a lot there is a change that happens throughout your life I tell a lot of people who tend to overshare a lot when they're younger you know just be careful with what you do share that might come back to you in the future you know if you're trying to get a job or let's say you are your own boss and someone leaks out those photos you know you might not care but your mom might care you know your dad might care your future kids might care you know just put that mental disclaimer up in your head before you press send because you never know who might see it hey it's Rachel she asked what do you do if your crush likes you but ignores you well your crush likes you why why is he or she ignoring you everyone's going to have a different reaction when it comes to explaining and also expressing their love or their interest in someone else if they are ignoring you what you can do as a last thing is just send them a playlist send them a playlist of all your favorite songs and just share it to them there's it doesn't even have to be romantic songs just your favorite song just to see if there is that interest again if you can you know bring out that spark and if you don't just move on I mean there's seven billion people in this world and you have the Internet you can meet someone amazing I mean DOM is from Switzerland and he speaks French there's going to be someone out there that loves you for you without makeup with just sweats and a t-shirt and a topknot D Jan's eight eight eight hamish hi did YouTube change you throughout the years and how do you handle the stress and expectations of being someone online love you first off love you too you know YouTube really inspired me and it gave me an outlet to create so I guess it did change me but it changed me for the better I'm much more inspired I look forward every day looking at all your comments and reading them but most importantly you know I have a place where I can spread my message in my vision and if one person is watching or listening that's all that matters X X underscore Christina underscore Phan underscore X X what would you name your first child and why mmm okay I will share one I'm just because you were so sweet and you asked I've always loved the name Apollo just the name itself there's something about the name that's really beautiful I think it has something to do with the a the oh and the two elves because my name has two L's in there too 11 to me is a very sacred number 11 and I see 11:11 a lot everywhere in my life in the clocks in the time whenever I look at my phone I see 11:11 when I'm going to an address and I'm trying to find a location I see 11 and so 11 is a very very sacred and meaningful number to me and it's I don't know it's such a beautiful celestial name Apollo sounds so majestic feel free to take it if she is dot made DC on Instagram she asked I was told when people become famous they give away lots of energy to others and can become weak or lose themselves have you ever felt that way how do you deal with it greetings from Spain ah thank you I live in LA and Hollywood is like a few blocks down you do see a lot of famous people and you do see that their energy is drained I mean it's true and a lot of it is because they're giving they give so that they can take so make sense they give their talents and giftings but they also need to absorb how do I say the feedback the energy from other people that's how they're able to perform however oftentimes you'll see a lot of these celebrities they give a little too much and they don't give back to themselves they're filling in the empty void with material objects and also validation seeking validation from other people because this is how they feel like they are full I mean Fame is like a forest it's a forest where you're not given a compass and you can easily get lost in there and this is why it's important to have the right people around you keeping you grounded and making sure you are walking down the right path by the way I'm sorry guys if my energy seems really low I am extremely jet lag I'm so jet-lagged I flew 13 times in the past 30 days which means I flew like once every 4 or 5 days um so my mind is kind of like a sea underscore hazel 26 on Instagram she asked does it scare you that you're a role model for so many people and that everyone who looks up to you and watches your every move even when you make mistakes how do you deal with that feeling you know when I first started online this was when I was 16 16 17 years old I was on this blog site called Sangha I only wanted to portray the best version of me I always made sure that my pictures were photoshopped a little you know I erased under-eye circles I wanted you know sometimes I even made myself skinnier I can't believe I did that it's ridiculous looking and as I grew older I realized you know what this is not the best way to build confidence you can't build confidence by constantly seeking attention and validation from other people self-love is important if you want to build self-confidence it really comes from inside it's like planting a seed you have to plant a seed you have to water it you have to nurture it you have to put Sun in it you have to love it and it grows it was tough at first when I did make mistakes and people people really highlighted my mistakes they would take screen caps and use it against me and sometimes even what hurts me the most are a lot of some of the screen caps you see of comments where I'm bullying people it's not even me it doesn't even sound like me I would never write that to someone and it hurts me that people go out of their way to do that I was really made fun a lot of you know screen caps where I'm doing my makeup and I'm you know like when you're making a face when you're doing makeup and your eyes are rolled back it's totally normal but they would take that screen cap and make fun of me for it I was really hurt I mean I was going through a lot of dark moments when all that was happening but that's why I have great friends and family around me you know they supported me and they they kept my my spirit positive they made sure that I was always looking towards the light and not looking at the negativity I don't really feel scared to make any mistakes because I know if I make a mistake you guys can learn from my mistakes and I can learn from it too and thus it makes the world a better place Charmaine love 2001 what do you do if there's people who talk bad about you and they hate you and are jealous about you well just don't do anything don't give them any attention don't give them any ammunition to use against you just ignore them and focus on the positive focus on your friends don't even gossip about them that was a simple answer right Shanaya underscore B 2004 who inspired you to start YouTube and why did you want to do it by the way I think your channel's awesome and I love you so much two hearts I love you too three hearts when I had my blog on xanga I had a few of my readers they were asking and requesting a beauty tutorial originally on my blog I wasn't really doing Beauty tutorials I was showcasing my art I was blogging my life as a college student and also before that as a high school student different girls were asking me Michelle how do you do your everyday makeup I didn't think my makeup was really that special I really shot that video because I wanted to share or how I did my makeup and I love makeup too and this is why I want to share with you guys you know don't ever feel afraid to share something that you love because you never know where it might take you or you never know who it might bring you to Julianna ciao I believe that positivity is the way to success law of attraction but I have a hard time figuring out how you become the always positive and happy person when you have negative people surrounding you at school or at home affecting your mood any tips it's not like you can change schools or change jobs but you can change the way you look at things and see things because the things that you look at will change people who are negative around you be positive bring in like some cupcakes to work or to school one day like doing positive things will have a positive reaction on others I know this I've seen it work those who are negative who only want to stay negative and they don't want to bring any positive elements into your life you have to cut that out life is way too short to deal with negative people anyways that is it with pillow talk my voice is dying I'm super jet-lagged I have to shoot another video for Mother's Day um but you know what I freaking love my job I don't even feel like it's a job it's a crazy adventure and I'm honored to share this adventure with you so thank you so much for just supporting me for always being there for me
