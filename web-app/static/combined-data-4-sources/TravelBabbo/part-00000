Travel Magazines: I still love getting printed magazines in the mail and reading them on planes or at the beach. Conde Nast Traveler was my favorite for 20+ years  but a few years ago they changed their format and lost me. National Geographic Traveler has always been good  with excellent photography. And the past few years AFAR has been my go-to for well-written travel inspiration. I like the magazine so much that I've traveled with its founders and staff half a dozen times now. 

But AFAR doesn't do many family travel pieces. So I'm excited that Twist Travel Magazine exists - pure family travel inspiration. I'm not involved with the magazine  but I read their Spring issue cover-to-cover on my flight to Berlin yesterday and really enjoyed it. If you still like magazines too  and you're into family travel  you can download their new issue for free. Let me know what you think.. My Galapagos post is now live! Per my post on Friday  it was an excellent trip - pretty much a perfect choice for a week-long school break. We let Metropolitan Touring South America Tour Operator plan every element  and it all worked flawlessly. Nice to be able to step back from trip planning for once. 

And then after the Galapagos we headed to Mashpi Lodge in the Ecuadorian cloud forest for a few days  which was just as amazing - in a very different setting. I'll be working on that blog post on my way to Berlin tomorrow.. The Galapagos! We had a great trip - pretty much everything we were expecting and then some. We loved the animals of course  but it was a stunning destination beyond the animals.  Even though we had wifi on our ship (and free wifi at that)  I tried to stay offline. So for now  here are four of my favorite photos. As I'm working on a blog post and editing more photos  I'll post them as I go. And I'll let you know when the blog post is live. 

I should say that we were really happy with the overall itinerary. Every day we did three activities  and there was always a choice of activities. I went snorkeling a couple times  went on several hikes  and did some panga (Zodiac) rides around the coastlines as well - always with some combination of the kids. My wife chose differently some of the time - like opting for a glass bottom boat instead of snorkeling  or going off in search of penguins on the coast while I was hiking - with whichever kids wanted to join her. It worked well. 

Our ship: the 48-passenger La Pinta from Metropolitan Touring South America Tour Operator. It was kind of a Goldilocks option - not the biggest  not the smallest  just right. 

More to come!. Have you been to Quito? We visited Ecuador's capital this week simply as a layover before heading to the Galapagos  but we really enjoyed the city - my new favorite South American capital. There's a great old town - closed to traffic on Sundays - very good street food and impressive sites. Plus it's colorful! Reminds me of a little of the Bermuda color palate. 

Our schedule: two nights in Quito (at Casa Gangotena)  then four nights in the Galapagos aboard La Pinta (operated by Metropolitan Touring South America Tour Operator)  then back to Quito for a night  two nights in the cloud forest (at Mashpi Lodge) and one more night in Quito before flying home. The kids will miss only two days of school total since most of this is during their winter break.. #ad Family travel is amazing  but cheaper family travel is even better! No matter where you stay  be sure to book and pay with your Capital One Venture card at hotels.com/venture to earn 10 miles for every dollar spent.
 
We had a great time in Jackson Hole  and absolutely loved both of our hotels  the Hotel Jackson and the Four Seasons Resort Jackson Hole. It was so much fun reliving my snow-filled childhood travel memories with my daughter  from playing in the snow to taking the tram to the summit to old time photos. And of course  because it’s family travel  there were also things that didn’t go right. I talk about it all in the post below!. Wow! The North American Travel Journalists Association just announced their 2017 winners  and I'm thrilled that I won a gold medal for family travel writing for this article! 

Enjoy! And congratulations to all of the other winners!. Did you know February is Seattle Museum Month? Here's a great post on how to take advantage of it  from my fellow Travelocity Gnomad Keryn Means.

#SeattleMuseumMonth. #ad Just a reminder that when you use your Capital One Venture card at hotels.com/venture you get 10 miles for every dollar you spend! We've traveled all over the world using miles  and it's the main reason we can travel as much as we do. And given that we stay in a LOT of hotels  I'm excited that the miles will now add up a lot faster.

Thanks to Capital One and Hotels.com we are heading to Jackson Hole  Wyoming next week to celebrate some of my earliest travel memories. Follow along on Instagram and Facebook! You can read more about our trip planning  and this awesome Capital One + Hotels.com deal below. Take your kids everywhere! And use miles for as much of it as possible!. I loved the suggestions for kid-friendly hotels recently. Now another question: what's the coolest hotel that you've been to or heard about? I'm planning an around-the-world trip with my 10-year-old in July and would love recommendations - specifically once-in-a-lifetime  unique properties. 

This is Giraffe Manor in Nairobi - one of my favorite hotel experiences ever. I'd also put Six Senses Zighy Bay on my short list  with its paragliding entrance  and maybe Four Seasons Resort Bora Bora  which is absolutely stunning. Please let me know what else we would love!. #ad What's your earliest travel memory? I grew up in Colorado and remember heading to the mountains often to (initially) play in the snow and then to ski. I love California  but my kids aren't getting the same snow experience! They don't get snow days. We aren't a short drive away from amazing skiing or sledding. And my 7-year-old especially hasn't seen much snow in her life. 

So when Capital One asked me to design a trip around an early memory  it seemed logical to head to the snow  and to take my youngest daughter. We leave next week! We're going to Jackson Hole  Wyoming  since they're having a good snow year and neither of us has been before. 

Read all about our planning below  and Capital One's new partnership with Hotels.com where you can use your Venture card to book places to stay through the site (hotels.com/venture) and earn 10x miles. That adds up to free travel faster - always a good thing! 

Do you have suggestions for us in Jackson Hole? Please comment below.. I've written a lot about what makes hotels and attractions kid-friendly  and I haven't been afraid to call out places that weren't kid-friendly. This is an excellent post from 14 family travel experts that's applicable to every hotel  resort  attraction and restaurant that wants to attract families. 

Click through and read the post  and then comment below on what 'kid-friendly' means to you. Did we get it right? That it has more to do with making kids feel welcome than it does with kids' clubs and bad kids menus? 

And to give credit where credit is due  the places in the past year that have really impressed us were:

Thomson Family Adventures - we traveled to Panama with them and wouldn't hesitate to travel with them again. A perfect itinerary and trip that entertained kids but didn't dumb down anything for parents.

Holiday Inn Express Waikiki - All IHG hotels  including Holiday Inns  stress True Hospitality  and we witnessed it in Hawaii. The staff constantly engaged with my daughter. 

Park Hyatt Tokyo - パーク ハイアット 東京  Six Senses Laamu  Tierra Hotels in Chile  The Peninsula Bangkok - Official Site  Aria Hotel Prague by Library Hotel Collection  and the The Ritz-Carlton  Cleveland - all excellent hotels and resorts that people don't necessarily associate with families  but all of which were excellent and welcoming.. Anyone feel like voting? I was honored last week to be nominated for a Shorty Award for travel influencing. I never planned on actually asking for votes publicly  but my 12-year-old daughter has been looking at the full list of nominees and REALLY wants to attend the awards ceremony with me if I'm a finalist. 

So if you don't mind going through the Facebook linking and email verification process  I'd appreciate your vote! Maybe we'll be seated next to Gal Gadot  Tyler Oakley or the cast of Riverdale - or at least see them from afar!. Who else is a fan of The Amazing Race? I've watched every episode for 29+ seasons - literally the only show I ever watch on a normal TV! Was excited when Travelocity asked me to write about Bali and The Laguna  a Luxury Collection Resort & Spa  Nusa Dua  Bali to coincide with last night's pit stop prize. Don't tell me who won it though - we only watched the first hour before the kids went to bed. Will finish watching tonight.

Bali is one of our favorite destinations! Definitely take your kids. I write about all of our favorite things to do in the post.... I studied abroad four times - for a year in Florence  Italy  two summers in Oslo  Norway  and one summer in Heidelberg  Germany. All were amazing experiences  and they led directly to my travel addiction and my career! 

Hostelling International has 104 $2 000 scholarships available for young adults who want to take an educational or service learning trip abroad but lack the financial support. Open to US citizens/residents 18-30 in LA  New York  Chicago  New Orleans and a few other cities. If you meet the criteria (everything's on their website)  apply!!!. In June we stopped in Singapore for a day and a half between the Maldives and California  and we loved The Fullerton Hotel Singapore. It's an iconic building (it used to be the post office)  and the location is perfect. I haven't written about it since I didn't know how many unique things I could say about just a day and a half in Singapore  but we're hoping to get back this year and experience more  and maybe at that point I'll have a blog post! At any rate  the hotel has all sorts of cool things planned this year for its 90th birthday. Highly recommended for (very) quick or longer stays!. Have you been through the Panama Canal? We've been to Gatun Lake and the Miraflores Locks a couple times  most recently with Thomson Family Adventures  but I've never actually transited. Fun? Worth a cruise just to do it?

Even if you're not transiting  or traveling around Panama  if you have a chance to stop over in Panama City for 24 hours  do it and go see the canal. But time it right. Our first trip  by ourselves  we saw ships on the lake (and lots of animals) but no ships going through the locks. Thomson  though  scheduled everything so that we were having lunch at the locks when ships were passing through  and they even set up a scavenger hunt in the Miraflores museum to make it more fun/educational.. Four years ago I started my website because our trip to Antarctica was amazing and a blog post was the easiest way to tell people about it. But soon thereafter I started writing about hotels and kid-friendliness. Two of my early posts were about disappointing stays and what the hotels could do better. And then I summarized everything I was looking for in a family-friendly hotel in this post: https://travelbabbo.com/my-kid-friendly-dream-hotel/. A quote: 

"I want to feel like our (well-behaved) kids are welcome. You can be the nicest  most formal hotel in the world  and your staff can still treat kids like valued guests and not like potential nuisances. I love when staff members go out of their way to talk to our kids and ask about their vacations  or give suggestions of things to do the next day. This can be housekeepers or managers or pool staff – anyone who comes into contact with the kids."

I've continued my quest for kid-friendly hotels around the world - and continued to be amazed sometimes and disappointed other times. The Holiday Inn Express Waikiki fell into the amazing category. Quite simply: the staff gets it. Part of that is Hawaiian friendliness. But a large part goes back to the True Hospitality of IHG - InterContinental Hotels Group. So I wrote about it! 

When is the last time you were blown away by a hotel staff's kid-friendliness? Where?. I'm excited that airfares to Hawaii seem to be coming down to the point where a trip to the islands is possible even for a long weekend. We had a great time during our short stay  basing out of the Holiday Inn Express Waikiki. Here's everything we did and what we would recommend for other families.. Last month I posted that we found out our home survived California’s Thomas Fire only after our Nokia camera came back online. Withings saw the post and wanted to send me home cameras to give to others affected by the fires. How cool is that? Now that I’m back from traveling  I’ve started distributing the cameras. Thank you very much to Nokia! 

(Not sponsored!). Aloha! Day three in Hawaii: no plans! We hadn't intended on having a full day  but moved our return flight back a day after our incoming flight to the islands was delayed by six hours. We woke up  had breakfast  and then explored the hotel. We relaxed in a pool cabana and swam. We played mini golf  shuffleboard and giant chess. We watched the fish in the ponds by the lobby. Then we got a few suggestions from the front desk. Lunch was at the Street at the new International Marketplace  roughly a 10-minute walk away. Excellent! Sunset was at Magic Island. And then dinner was at a conveyer belt sushi place not far from Magic Island - lots of fun  thanks to Sebastian at the hotel. We never would have known about it otherwise. 

Mahalo to everyone at the Holiday Inn Express Waikiki. We'll be back! 

#anihghotel #truehospitality. Day two in Hawaii: An itinerary 100% based on suggestions from the staff at Holiday Inn Express Waikiki. The concierge originally suggested a day trip to Kualoa Ranch & Private Nature Reserve and we booked both the secret beach excursion and jungle expedition tour. And then other staff suggested exact routing to Kualoa to see as many highlights in eastern Oahu as possible. So after breakfast at the hotel  we jumped in the car and headed east around the coast. We stopped at Hanauma Bay  the Halona Blowhole and Waimanalo Beach among other stunning lookouts. 

The Kualoa secret beach was a lot of fun  with kayaking  SUP  swings  kayaks and lots of relaxation  but we liked the jungle tour even more. For 90 minutes we bounced around an open-air safari vehicle as we explored the ranch and saw where Jurassic World  Kong: Skull Island  50 First Dates  Jumanji and other movies were filmed. I was a little nervous that my 7-year-old would be bored  but she loved every minute  and when we got back to the hotel we immediately downloaded Jurassic Park. 

Dinner was at TOWN  a farm-to-table restaurant suggested by the hotel. It was roughly a 10-minute drive from the hotel - probably the first time we've stayed in Waikiki that we've driven somewhere to eat. Well worth it!

More exploration coming up today! 

#truehospitality #anihghotel. Day one in Hawaii: Breakfast at the hotel  parasailing a few minutes away  impromptu ukulele  hula and lei making with hotel employees (every one of whom seems to have hidden Hawaiian talents)  beach time  the Waikiki Aquarium  and the Diamond Head Luau. Loving the central location of the Holiday Inn Express  the #truehospitality of its employees  and the warm weather! 

Today we're off to explore the coast a little and hit the secret island/beach and see where Jurassic World was filmed at Kualoa Ranch. 

#takeyourkidseverywhere #anihghotel. Hawaii! I’m on a plane right now heading to Honolulu for a few days of adventure with my youngest. After the cold temperatures in Colorado the past couple weeks we can’t wait to get to the beach - although we’ll be the least tan people there! Looking forward to checking out the #truehospitality of the Holiday Inn Express Waikiki and exploring Oahu. Follow along! 

My son is pictured in Waikiki at sunrise a year ago. This time I’m solo with my daughter. I love one-on-one trips!

👍 = Bocas del Toro  Panama (from our trip with Thomson Family Adventures)
❤️ = The Portara in Naxos  Greece
😯 = The rice fields and towers of Zhaoxing  China
😆 = Camping in California's Anza Borrego State Park. Another "would you rather" based on my Best of 2017 blog post!

If you could be looking out from any of these hotel windows right now  which would you choose?

👍 = Overlooking Tokyo  from the Park Hyatt Tokyo 
❤️ = Overlooking the Vrtba Garden  from our room at the Aria Hotel Prague
😯 = Overlooking Chile's Torres del Paine from Tierra Patagonia. I grew up in Colorado Springs  only a block away from The Broadmoor. It was basically the neighborhood hotel; where my friends and I hung out after school. We went to movies there. We fed the ducks and fished at the lake. We bought comic books and slush puppies at the drug store. Prom was held there. 

It's transitioned over the years into an amazing 5-star luxury destination  but I'm still 100% comfortable going by whenever I'm back in Colorado with my kids. And I always look into holiday events that I think the kids would like.

This year the hotel has culinary demonstrations centered around the 12 days of Christmas. Perfect for my foodie kids! On Christmas Eve we signed up for fried chicken  biscuits and gravy (four calling birds) and tomorrow we're going back for cheese making (eight maids a milking). 

Very fun  only an hour  and highly recommended if you're near the Broadmoor the next week!. Overwater bungalow question: Do any of you know if there are resorts in Fiji with overwater bungalows/villas that allow kids? We've stayed with our kids overwater in Bora Bora  Palawan and the Maldives  but for some reason all of the resorts I'm finding in Fiji  if they allow kids at all  don't allow them to stay overwater. I was optimistic about Koro Sun Resort and Rainforest Spa Fiji and Fiji Marriott Resort Momi Bay  but nope. I'd appreciate any suggestions! 

Pictured: My kiddos in Bora Bora. I hope everyone had an amazing Christmas! I'm going to close out the year with some "would you rather posts" based on my Best of 2017 (babbo.com/2017). 

Would you rather be relaxing right now at this pool (Tierra Hotels Atacama) after an adventurous day in the desert  or relaxing at an overwater villa in the Maldives (Six Senses Laamu) after a day full of  well  relaxation? 

👍 = Atacama Desert
❤️ = Maldives. Chicago! We flew in for the weekend to get into the holiday spirit and had a great time. What did we do? Oh  only the Christmas Market  The Bean  last minute tickets to Hamilton  ice skating  a visit with Santa  the Museum of Science and Industry  dinner at the restaurant my son's wanted to eat at for years (Frontera Grill)  and more. I'll have a blog post soon. But don't wait - if you want some holiday cheer  head to Chicago! And stay at the Swissôtel Chicago. It was a great base  and we loved our Elf Decorated Room complete with skating vouchers and milk & cookies.. This is my favorite post to write every year! So fun to think back on the past 12 months and what we liked best around the world. As always  this is meant to inspire travel - especially family travel. Hopefully something on this list will jump out at you and you'll find yourself booking a trip somewhere new and amazing. 

It's a really cool world  just waiting for you!. Are you on Instagram? It's still my favorite platform  and I enjoy seeing the Best Nine synopsis every year.

Although I usually get the best photos on photography expeditions and other non-kid trips  I make sure my kids are in over half of my posts since my goal is to inspire family travel. A photo of me on a camel in India with friends doesn't really do that.

Of my nine most popular photos last year  three had kids in them but six were from kid trips. In order  left to right  top to bottom:

Havana  Cuba - on a kidless photo trip.
Borobudur  Indonesia with my 10-year-old on our around-the-world trip.
Giraffe Manor in Nairobi  Kenya. All of the kids were at breakfast  but only my oldest daughter fed the giraffes the entire time! 
Bocas del Toro  Panama  on our amazing trip with Thomson Family Adventures in July. I walked around at sunrise and left my son sleeping.
Sydney  Australia with my six-year-old
The Great Wall in the afternoon. I've been four times but still haven't taken the kids. 
The Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi. Another trip without kids.
Naxos Greece at sunrise in August when everyone else was sleeping.
Bora Bora - early morning from our overwater villa. 

And none of those were even my favorite photos of the year! Is that how your Instagram works too - that your favorites aren't your most popular? Or do you generally agree with what photos get the most likes?   

My account if you want to follow along: www.instagram.com/travelbabbo. My new favorite product! 

We evacuated the California fires almost a week ago. Wednesday night when we went to bed  fire was heading towards our house. We barely slept. Thursday morning we didn’t know if we still had a house. And there was no one to check for us  since everyone else evacuated too. 

Then around 9am I checked my Withings app and the camera was back online  broadcasting a remarkably calm picture of my office. Such an amazing feeling to know the house survived! 

But then I noticed something that I had never paid attention to before - an air quality reading. We were able to monitor the air in the house remotely  and we knew when it was safe to return home. When I got the camera I wondered why it came from Nokia’s health division. Now I know. 

This isn’t sponsored! Just wanted to say how incredibly happy I am with this camera. I had a webcam by a different company in another part of the house and it never came back online after the power was out.. So we had to evacuate from the California fires early Tuesday morning. Our house survived  but the air quality is bad. Hopefully life will be (close to) normal again next week. 

I took advantage of the evacuation to re-do my Antarctica blog post - the first post I ever wrote. I re-processed my photos and added some additional photos and details. I'll be posting some new pics to Instagram next week too. 

Antarctica is seriously kid-friendly - a winter playground with penguins. NatGeo had recommended a minimum age of 8 and it was a good recommendation. My daughter (8) had a great time  but I could see younger kids not enjoying the experience as much.

When I say "take your kids everywhere" I mean it!. If you're anywhere near Orlando this month  I highly recommend visiting Universal Orlando Resort! The new light show at Hogwarts is amazing  and the Macy's parade is fun. Here's my post on everything holiday-related taking place.

If you go  have a hot butterbeer for me. I'm kind of addicted.. I love Instagram for family travel inspiration! And especially now that I'm curating the @familytravel account on Instagram  and looking at everything that uses the #familytravel hashtag   I'm finding a lot of amazing accounts. Here are my favorite 25 accounts that you should be following right now.. I loved the dialogue last week on my post about taking kids to Colombia and Vietnam. So here's another one for you: Israel. Coincidently it was another Thomson Family Adventures post last night that made me think of it. 

I've been all over Israel once and to Jerusalem a couple of times and loved it. But I haven't taken the kids yet. It's definitely not kid-friendly in the traditional sense  since so much of the lure is based around history and religion. Thomson includes zip-lining  kayaking  floating in the Dead Sea (so fun) and short trips into Jordan  which I've done as well. But I'm really curious if you've taken kids and what they thought of it. Jerusalem's amazing! But do kids appreciate it?. Thank you to Five Star Kids for including me as an Instagrammer to follow in its new issue! If you're in Australia and you see a copy  let me know!. Check out Travelocity's Cyber Monday sale!. Thomson Family Adventures just announced their two new destinations and I'm excited! I love Vietnam but I've never traveled there with my kids. And I really enjoyed Cartagena  Colombia this summer with my son (coincidently following our Thomson trip to Panama) and would love to travel deeper into the country. 

I'm especially impressed by the things they're emphasizing: food in Vietnam (my favorite food on the planet  or at least in the 84 countries I've traveled to)  and diversity and outdoor adventure in Colombia. 

Have you been to Colombia and/or Vietnam? Have you taken kids? I'm really tempted to book one of these trips next year.. I've had a crazy past month of travel  which has coincided perfectly with my #sponsored campaign with Zappos.com and Blundstone US. Here's everywhere that I went and how Blundstone Boots allowed me to pack light. 

#HowIRoam #ZapposStyle. Need a stocking stuffer for the traveler in your life? Or would you rather invest in travel this Christmas? Either way  I've got you covered! Here are my favorite 15 holiday gifts this year.. Universal Orlando! I flew in yesterday to attend the sneak preview of Universal Orlando Holidays. Universal has decorated the parks (as usual)  but this year they're going above and beyond with a new holiday parade (in conjunction with Macys)  and they're including the two Wizarding World of Harry Potter areas for the first time. The parade is excellent  and Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade are  well  magical. The best part: the new light show at Hogwarts. It's seriously impressive. It will be running every 15-20 minutes throughout the holidays starting tomorrow  so if you're anywhere near Florida  check it out!. I've been fortunate to stay in a lot of the world's great hotels  and the service is generally excellent. So when a hotel goes above and beyond what I've ever experienced before  it's notable.

I was extraordinarily impressed with the Park Hyatt Tokyo - パーク ハイアット 東京 when I was there last month with my 7-year-old. We were constantly greeted by name - exactly like you see in Lost in Translation  which was filmed there. Except that I'm not a famous movie star. And after I asked the concierge a quick question our first day about the best sunrise spot  I had a note slipped under our door with a suggestion  and several other employees throughout the day approached me with their suggestions and offers to help. 

At breakfast I was only asked for my name the first day. The next five mornings my daughter and I were taken straight to our favorite table  and the staff remembered our drink preferences  bringing them quickly after we arrived.

Our lunch at New York Grill was amazing  including talking with the restaurant's manager for 20 minutes about what we should see in Tokyo. I had similar conversations with the General Manager and Executive Assistant Manager of the hotel - who were seemingly always around  making guests feel at home.

And then last night it got even better. I was coincidently back at the Park Hyatt with AFAR for cocktails at the New York Bar and dinner at the New York Grill. No fewer than five employees throughout the hotel said "welcome back" to me as I passed. The General Manager had a present for me to take back to my daughter. And the hotel had arranged for 15 boxes of Udon noodles - my wife's favorite - to be waiting for me. I had simply asked in advance if it would be possible to pick up that many boxes when I was back at the hotel and they went WAY out of their way to do everything for me. 

So if you want an extraordinary hotel experience  I highly  highly recommend the Park Hyatt Tokyo. It's perfect. Rooms start in the low $400s. We've paid a lot more around the world for a lot less. And no  this isn't sponsored! Just a thank you to one of our new favorite hotels.. I've been back in Tokyo the past few days with AFAR - traveling deeper into the city  albeit without my kids. A fun trip thus far  including rooftop parties  a cycling tour through the city  a trip to the Tsukiji fish market  lots of sushi  and some amazing speakers. Here are a few images. More to come later! 

#afartokyo. Have you checked out my website lately? Just this week I've posted articles on:

▪️ The benefits to traveling with your kids
▪️ The 10 cities that should be on everyone's bucket list
▪️ All of the cool kid-friendly things to do in Cleveland
▪️ My perfect photography expedition in Salta  Argentina

Head on over! As always  my goal is to introduce you to places you may not have thought about traveling to  especially with kids  and to inspire you to book a trip. 

www.travelbabbo.com. We loved Cleveland! Basing out of The Ritz-Carlton  Cleveland  in 2.5 days we did 7 kid-friendly activities  including glass blowing  the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a Cavs game. My blog post on everything we did is linked in the first comment.

Have you been to Cleveland recently? Were you similarly impressed? What did we miss?

#rcmemories #rcpartner. Happy Halloween! What's the spookiest thing you've done while traveling? For us it was a ghost tour in Kinsale  Ireland last year. It was slightly scary  but fun for the kids  and even though we go to Kinsale every year to see family we learned some new things about this history there. 

If you haven't been to southwest Ireland  I highly recommend it! You can travel independently of course. Or there are a lot of group trip options. The best family-oriented itinerary I've seen is from Thomson Family Adventures  with things like cycling  horseback riding  kayaking  sailing and whale watching that we've never even done there. And I was happy to see that they include the ghost tour!. We're in Cleveland! The Ritz-Carlton  Cleveland invited us out for the weekend for their grand re-opening  following an 18-month renovation. We flew in yesterday just in time for  opening festivities  then walked around the area and had dinner at Michael Symon's Lola. The hotel is gorgeous  and Cleveland is impressive! Looking forward to exploring the city's kid-friendly side the next couple days. First stop: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this morning with my 10-year-old musician. 

#RCCleveland #RCMemories #RCPartner. Where in the world are you right now? And who would rather be climbing a palm tree today? I had to drive to LA yesterday where it was 109. Ugh!

This was July in Bocas del Toro  Panama  where the weather is pretty much always in the 80s. Perfect.

With Thomson Family Adventures.. I finally completed a blog post on my trip to Tokyo with my 7-year-old earlier this month. Please let me know what we missed! We'll definitely be going back.. What cities should everyone see before they die? I have my list. Curious what's on your list!. Thank you to everyone for the suggestions of things to add to our standard packing list! I've modified the post  and our list  based on some of the comments. And Nokia Health just contacted me and asked me to let people know that the travel/home thermometer we use is on sale through the end of the month. Click through if you're interested. It works great!. I've been in Argentina for the past week - first in northern Patagonia hiking  rafting  biking and kayaking  then then in Salta  exploring the desert and attending the #ATWS2017 adventure travel summit. The landscape is stunning here! I haven't had time to edit most of my photos  but here are a few from Patagonia. Andestrack Expediciones was amazing at arranging everything - such a fun few days that really pushed me.. In Tokyo I was looking at the packing cube of necessities that we take on every trip and I realized that it represents 48 countries worth of packing tips - what we've decided we could very well need everywhere we travel. So I did this quick post.

If you do something similar  I'd love to know what you include that we don't. Maybe there's something brilliant that we haven't realized we needed yet!. So my 7-year-old chose Tokyo for her annual one-on-one trip with me  and we've had a great time this week exploring and getting to know different parts of the city. We've based out of Park Hyatt Tokyo - パーク ハイアット 東京  in Shinjuku  and taken the metro every day around town - primarily to Ikebukuro  Shibuya  Harajuku and Mitaka - and we've walked between Shinjuku and Harajuku a couple times. 

I'll do a blog post at some point on our favorite things. But a few highlights:

1) The hotel. The Park Hyatt was the setting for Lost in Translation  still one of my favorite movies. The service is just as perfect as you see in the film  the view never gets old  the breakfasts are amazing  and it's a pleasure to swim in the 47th floor pool. 

2) We did a walking tour around Ikebukuro with Context Travel that my daughter says is her favorite tour ever. It was kid-oriented and took us through Tokyo's arcades  animal cafes  crazy stores and face-enhancing photo booths - places we may or may not have stumbled upon  but that we likely wouldn't have been comfortable exploring on our own. A perfect two hours!

3) My daughter didn't want to go the robot restaurant  despite my pleas  but we did have a lunch at the Kawaii Monster Cafe which was fun  and the food was actually pretty good. 

4) We tried to go to the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka yesterday but had no idea that it was so popular or that you need to get tickets months in advance (amateur mistake apparently) so instead we explored the nearby park and zoo  took a swan pedal boat onto a lake and had a great lunch near Kichijōji station. Turned out to be a great day. 

I'll post here when my blog post is up. And I may try to do a Facebook Live from here in a few hours  as we're packing to head back to California.. The best thing about jet lag: the sunrises! This was a few minutes ago from the @parkhyatttokyo. Waiting for breakfast now. 

#takeyourkidseverywhere #parkhyatttokyo #visitjapan #familytravel #gnomads #traveldeeper #afarambassador. And the spring break planning has begun! I can tell  because I've gotten four emails this week from people looking for "new" spring break destinations - places other than Mexico and Hawaii. 

The past few years our February winter break and April spring break destinations have been Bora Bora  Chile (Atacama and Patagonia)  Costa Rica  Africa (Kenya and Tanzania)  South Carolina  and Jamaica. All were excellent  and are covered on my blog. And then this summer we went to Panama with Thomson Family Adventures and I'd highly recommend Panama as well for spring break - similar nature/animals to Costa Rica but less touristed and less expensive. 

The Caribbean is the big unknown for next year. While it speeds recovery to book trips  a lot of the tourism infrastructure has been completely wiped out where they need tourist dollars most. 

Where are you going next year? Any plans to return to the Caribbean? Thoughts on timing? 

Pictured: Bocas del Toro  Panama. So every year I travel with AFAR on their Experience trips. The itineraries are always excellent  and they're true to the magazine's mission of inspiring people to travel deeper. The past three years I've gone to Mexico City  Montreal  New Orleans and Bermuda with them  and I'm signed up for Tokyo in November. They're also returning to New Orleans next month. Unfortunately I'll be in Argentina on those dates.

There are a few more slots open for both New Orleans and Tokyo. Meet me in Tokyo! It's actually a partnership with Hyatt  so if you have Hyatt points (or Chase Sapphire points that you can convert to Hyatt)  you can pay that way. Or head to New Orleans  which I can personally vouch for. It was an amazing few days last year. 

Info is below. Let me know if you have any questions.. I was just reading a report from the Adventure Travel Trade Association that asked travelers which activities should be categorized as adventurous. Their top ten this year: hiking; backpacking; trekking; kayaking; rafting; climbing; mountain biking; scuba diving; caving; and camping.

Do you agree? When you go on an adventurous vacation  what do you include? We definitely do more hiking and kayaking than anything else on the list.

Pictured: hiking in Chilean Patagonia earlier this year.. I've been in Kitzbühel Austria this week at an excellent Social Travel Summit  and tomorrow morning I'm leaving at 4:40am to fly to New York for the start of the #studyabroadbecause Summit. I'm passionate about studying abroad. In college I spent my sophomore year in Florence  Italy  and then followed up with a semester in Heidelberg  Germany. I kept going a few years later with two summers in Norway at the University of Oslo. And I've never stopped traveling  through marriage and now kids. It's not an understatement to stay that studying abroad made me who I am! 

Did you study abroad? Did it change you? Any favorite stories? 

(This photo was tonight overlooking Kitzbühel. Can't believe I'll be in NYC tomorrow! Girl vs Globe is pictured in the corner.) 

#stskitzbuehel. I'm not into scary things  but I really enjoyed Halloween Horror Nights last year. The attention to detail is amazing! The newest iteration opens tonight. If you go  let me know how it is!. One of my post popular posts is on my camera setup. I just updated it with a few new photos and my thoughts on the Sony a7r ii that I've been shooting with the past few months. 

Have you transitioned from Canon to Sony? Advice to make the Sony feel as intuitive as the Canon? Not sure how much longer I should give it before switching back.... What's your favorite layover city in Asia? For a long time I went through Hong Kong as often as I could  but the past few years I've stopped in Bangkok instead. Here's why.. My son and I were on this Thomson Family Adventures trip with the The Jet Set Family in July. I love this recap of the Bocas del Toro portion of the trip. It was probably our favorite part as well.. Thinking about traveling to Lake Como with your kids? Learn from our mistakes!. I finally wrote up some tips for visiting Universal Orlando Resort! Here are my suggestions for where to stay  where to eat  when to visit and how to save money. 

If you have questions  please ask them here or comment on the blog post and I'll answer them in the post. I want it to be as complete as possible.. My friends Mike and Anne have just released Ultimate Journeys for Two with National Geographic. Plan ahead - it's a perfect Christmas gift for couples who like to travel!. My kids all love Harry Potter  so we've made several trips to Orlando to spend time at Universal Orlando Resort's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It's never been extraordinarily crowded when we've been there - we go mid-week when Florida schools are in session  and we usually only spend time at the parks early in the morning or in the evening. I've loved photographing my kids there but  even with sparser crowds  I usually have to wait for people to move out of my shots.

For the past year I've been an ambassador for Universal Orlando (a member of their inaugural Blog Squad). I asked if there was any way that we could get access to Diagon Alley before the park opened. Done! We headed over at 8am yesterday and had Diagon Alley to ourselves for an hour. I was able to get the shots that I had always wanted  but I hate posing my kids and they hate posing for me  so for the most part they played and explored and did all of the interactive wand stations and I took photos. After a normal day of shooting I might have 500 photos and two are worthy of Instagram. Yesterday I took 700 photos and 79 made my final cut! I'll probably do a blog post with my absolute favorites. 

In addition to the pictures  there were some very cool things about this experience. First  we were able to see so many details that we've missed before - things in shop windows  architectural elements  etc... Everything is so well designed. Second  yesterday was September 1st  which is the first day of Hogwarts. My oldest daughter is 11 and on her birthday received her acceptance letter. So she was extremely excited to start her first year! In addition to visiting Diagon Alley we rode the Hogwarts Express from King's Cross 9 3/4 to Hogwarts  and we went into the castle. An extraordinarily perfect #potterhead day all around!. The problem with an amazing summer of travel (I've been home seven nights total since June 1) is that I'm way behind in posting about where we've been  and may never get caught up since more travel is ahead. 

Here are two photos that I haven't posted yet from Panama last month that I love. They really sum up the trip - the ocean  the cloud forest  and the family adventure. The kids on our trip all had a great time. If you haven't looked at Panama yet  I highly suggest checking it out. Thomson Family Adventures coordinated a very cool trip for us  with zero hiccups.. Last summer in Venice we did a photoshoot with Flytographer and loved the results  except for my son being sick and opting out of most shots. So we hired Flytographer in Prague last week to try again  and everyone was healthy this time! Nice having photos with the whole family... :-)

Photo credit: Eliška in Prague for Flytographer. My newest post for Travelocity - my 25 favorite hotel views around the world. 

What's the best hotel view that you've had? Comment with a photo if you can!. The other night at dinner we started talking about what pieces of advice we would give to other travelers. Here are our top ten.... Sunrise a few minutes ago from the roof of Aria Hotel Prague by Library Hotel Collection. Yesterday I walked over to Charles Bridge for sunrise and spent over an hour there  but it was a let-down - lots of other photographers and not great color. So I was lazy today and asked the hotel if I could get rooftop access for sunrise. Much better all around!. I know I was negative on the Santorini sunset experience earlier  but sunset tonight was gorgeous. 

This was right before a power outage that's still going on and seems to affect most of the island. On the plus side a lot of stars are suddenly visible.. I've always thought sunset in Santorini was overrated. It's pretty  but so many people crowd into the narrow passages of Oia trying to get a photo from the perfect spot at the perfect moment that it's overwhelming and almost claustrophobic  and the mass crowds distract from the beauty of the scene. Sunrise is far better. I walked around for over an hour this morning  only passing a few people  and the light was great - even better than sunset. Reiterating my advice from my Florence post two weeks ago  it's always worth waking up early  and if you've only visited Santorini on a cruise ship  come back and stay for a few days to appreciate the city with far fewer people.. Right now in Santorini. I'm finding our room location to be acceptable. :-). We had a great time in Mammoth Lakes last month! Here's my post with what we did and where we stayed. And just a note that I'll be offline for the next 4+ days  as my family and I are participating in the O.A.R.S. - Whitewater Rafting #100hoursunplugged challenge. We're turning off all electronics and enjoying Naxos and Santorini. I highly encourage you to do the same! 

By the way  Mammoth Lakes would be a great place to unplug.... I've always loved the photo booths throughout Florence  but we've never used one before. Now we have!. Harry Potter: 1
Sunset view of Naxos: 0. If you’re looking for inspiration for a last-minute summer road trip check out my Wyndham Rewards California road trip post below  and don’t forget – their summer offer of 15-20% off + 1 000 bonus points can still be booked through September 4!. When I lived in Florence 25 years ago  I very often would grab my yellow Walkman and head out walking/jogging before sunrise. It's by far the best time to see the city and feel the history. I've kept this tradition going on 20+ trips since then  although without music. Usually I leave my family sleeping and walk a circuit through the Uffizi courtyard and Piazza della Signoria to the Duomo and then back through Piazza della Repubblica and the straw market and across the Ponte Vecchio. Sometimes I head down to the Mercato Centrale or up to Piazzale Michelangelo  but I usually stick to the historic center. 

Today  for the first time  two of my kids opted to wake up at 5:45 and come with me. Fun having company! As usual there weren't more than maybe 20 other people out  and in most cases we had whole streets and piazzas to ourselves. Absolutely magical! And so different from walking through the city during the day  with hordes of tourists everywhere. One of my major annoyances is when people arrive via cruise ship  visit Florence for a few hours with thousands of others  and then complain that they didn't like the city because there were too many people. If you're one of those people  come back! And wake up before sunrise at least once to have the art  architecture and history to yourself. Then you'll understand why people love this city. 

This is what the Ponte Vecchio looks like at 6:30am!. I've followed Steph and Travelbreak since before I was a travel writer  and have been on the waiting list for this app since it was announced. Very excited that it's almost here! Highly recommend signing up now.. Italy! At the end of July we flew into Milan and rented a villa in Cernobbio on Lake Como. I've been largely staying offline  but have been taking a few iPhone photos as we've explored the towns around the lake (and across the Swiss border) and have been posting to Instagram. 

After a week of lake exploration  we decided to mix it up and take the train to Florence for a few days. We arrived yesterday and checked into the very cool Palazzo San Niccolò (a great option for families).

Today was all about eating. I had a great three-hour lunch at Irene Firenze with friends back in November and wanted to try it with kids this time. While our kids are pretty good with long European meals  we had never pushed it like this. We met up with Georgette from Girl in Florence and started an almost three hour meal with six courses of amazing food paired with three different wines and kid drinks. Our kids were AWESOME! They stayed off electronics for almost the entire meal and we all enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended with or without kids!. Two weeks ago we headed to Panama with Thomson Family Adventures. We were impressed with Panama - a great alternative to Costa Rica. And our first family-oriented group trip worked out really well. Here's where we went  what we did and what we liked.. So much fun yesterday in Mammoth! We started with a gondola to the top of Mammoth Mountain  hiked there for awhile  then came back down to Twin Lakes and kayaked  and then went hiking at Horseshoe Lake. I've been mainly posting to Instagram and Instagram Stories so check it out (@travelbabbo). Highlights: the gondola ride (pictured)  watching all of the skiers and snowboarders still on the mountain in July  seeing both a waterfall and a bear from our kayak  and having a great dinner in town at Campo. I highly recommend taking a summer trip to Mammoth!. Always get recommendations from the front desk people at hotels! Yesterday my son and I drove up to Mammoth Lakes to explore for a couple days. We checked in to the Tamarack Lodge and I asked Justen behind the desk where we should go for a quick hike to stretch our legs. He recommended driving five minutes to Lake George and hiking from there. It was stunning  and it felt so good to be in nature after a lot of flying and driving the past few days! 

This is at Lake George. We took along a hammock for rest breaks! Crystal Crag is in the distance. 

#visitmammoth #summerbrag #nosmalladventure. Always fun to be featured by Lonely Planet!. Happy Colombian Independence Day! We arrived in Cartagena yesterday and explored all day. Loving it so far. And honestly we had no idea today was Independence Day until a local friend just messaged me!  Should be fun wandering around today.. Good morning from Panama's Isla Colon!. Panama! I'm here this week with Thomson Family Adventures. Two goals - see more of the country than I did on a 25-hour layover three years ago and see if we're a group trip kind of family. I've been on group trips around the world  both cultural and photographic  but my kids never have. 

So far  so good! My 9-year-old son has clicked with the other kids in the group  and the first two days have been full of adventure - three boat rides including taking a dugout canoe to a (non-touristy) traditional village  lunch overlooking the locks of the Panama canal with ships coming through  a post-dinner walk around the Casco Viejo area of Panama City  sloth  iguana and monkey sightings  a scavenger hunt  and an amazing sunset dinner last night on the Caribbean side of the country. 

Follow along on Instagram  but I'll do posts here as well.. How do you recover from travel  and specifically from long flights? Exercise? Spa appointments? Nothing? 

For 13 years I've done Pilates twice a week  and the sessions right after travel days are the best - major stretching that puts my body back to where it needs to be. But this summer I've had one trip after another and have barely been home for Monday/Thursday Pilates. This local mountain bike ride after back-to-back trips to the Maldives and Montana was perfect and made me think that a couple hours of exercise should be my new recovery regimen. But I'm curious what others do. Have you found something that works well?. A giveaway! If you've followed me for a while  you know that we take our kids to Universal Orlando often  even though we live in Southern California. I've partnered with Universal Orlando to give one of my Instagram followers TWO 3-DAY TICKETS to Universal Orlando Resort parks including Universal Studios Florida  Universal’s Islands of Adventure and Universal’s Volcano Bay! Plus  a 3-NIGHT STAY FOR TWO at one of Universal Orlando Resort’s onsite hotels. Here's how to enter:
 
1) Just follow me on Instagram (if you’re not already) - www.instagram.com/travelbabbo.  
2) Tag a friend that you'd want to take with you to Universal Orlando in one of my two Universal Orlando Instagram posts from the past week (July 6 and today)! It's that easy! 

The giveaway ends tomorrow  July 13  so enter now! And several of my fellow #uorblogsquad Ambassadors are giving away the same package. Links to their accounts are in my Instragram posts. That's the only way to enter more than once.. I've always been happy to answer questions about travel blogging via email and direct messages  but at this point I can't keep up with the volume. So I wrote this post to refer people to going forward. I promise it will be my one and only post having to do with travel blogging! Back to actual travel writing tomorrow.... I love Instagram for travel inspiration! My favorite 25 accounts that you should be following right now.... My blog post on our Wyndham Rewards road trip from Santa Monica to Monterey is up! This is my favorite shot from the trip – my daughter swinging on the beach in Santa Monica. And the Wyndham Rewards summer offer continues - 15-20% off when you book two or more nights. Details are in my post!. Our road trip continues! From San Simeon we headed north to Carmel  walked around for a while  and then drove a few miles to Monterey. We checked in for a two-night stay at the Ramada Limited Monterey (using 30 000 Wyndham Rewards points)  had some down time  and then drove a couple of minutes to Monterey’s Cannery Row. Here my daughter is scanning intensely for sea otters – they’re everywhere in the gift shops  but we’ve thus far been unsuccessful at seeing them in the wild. Maybe today will be the day! 

Did you know Ramada Worldwide is a part of Wyndham Rewards? We're loving the Monterey hotel - a great feel/design  and it’s right off SR1 so it’s a perfect location.. A perfect night last night in San Simeon! We’re staying at the Days Inn here on our Wyndham Rewards road trip and couldn’t be happier with the location – just minutes from Cambria to the south  these elephant seals to the north  and the beach right down the road. Remember that all Wyndham Rewards properties are included in their summer offer – 15-20% off when you book more than two nights. Details at www.babbo.com/wr. 

#takeyourkidseverywhere. I went to college in Malibu  so I always love coming back. Continuing our road trip with Wyndham Rewards  we drove north on the Pacific Coast Highway and had lunch at the Malibu Pier. A perfect afternoon! And remember  when you book two or more nights at Wyndham Rewards properties this summer  you save 15-20% and receive 1 000 bonus points. www.babbo.com/wr.. Road trip! Wyndham Rewards invited me to plan a California road trip in conjunction with their summer deal (15-20% off two or more nights plus 1 000 bonus points – www.babbo.com/wr). We chose to start in Santa Monica and drive north to Monterey since my daughter has been wanting to visit the aquarium. Day one was Santa Monica and we loved it! We checked in to Wyndham Santa Monica - At The Pier and then headed out to explore  staying at the beach until well after sunset. This is one of my favorite shots!. It's only been a month since I published this and it's already one of my most popular posts ever. Crazy! I've continued to update the post as I've received questions from readers  so if you have any questions at all  the answers are hopefully in there now. 

Have you been to Volcano Bay yet? Thoughts?
