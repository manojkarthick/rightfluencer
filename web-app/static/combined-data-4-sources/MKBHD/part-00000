[Music] [Music] oh hey hey knocking I can be right drop the Cheerios the Nugget [Music] hey what is up guys I'm Kim PhD here and you've heard of nest right they're a company that's one of many that make a home security camera I've been a nest user for a couple months so I have a couple of their home security cameras I have their thermostats and I have some of their smoke detectors so obviously it makes it easy to keep it all in one place in one app it's not perfect there are definitely some minor annoyances but there are also some really well-thought-out features to it but now their newest cameras come out and it's called the nest cam IQ so shout out to Nets for sending a few of these over to the studio and helping me make this video it has a 4k sensor and updated design and some new internals and a new price tag so naturally the question is is it worth it this little guy over here is 300 bucks and also a lot of its best features go hand-in-hand with a monthly subscription called the nest aware subscription so it's definitely not cheap so what exactly are you getting with this thing well the design first of all is pretty clean as you can see the matte white look and as always the argument with a security camera in an office with a lot of obviously very expensive gear like this do you hide a security camera out of sight like up in a corner somewhere to secretly get footage in case anything happens and you need it or do you put it like right in the doorway right in the field of view so you know it's there to discourage anything from happening in the first place I chose the second option as you can see it's been in previous videos it's pointed right at the doorway you walk in you know you're on camera but at least it's not ugly so other security cameras are really unattractive but you might have seen it blend in in the background I consider it a pretty modern two-tone panda design it has that Eve from wall-e type of look I've got a swiveling head it connects to power bi USB type-c which is again modern and you can mount it to the wall pretty easily if you want to also so this thing is pretty clean and then the main headlining feature of nest IQ is the 4k sensor which actually needs some explaining technically yes there is a new 4k sensor inside the camera as well as all the processing power and hardware to support it but it is not constantly recording 4k security camera footage at all times that would be a little insane it is recording at all times in 1080p but because it is a 4k sensor anytime you want to zoom in up to four times on anywhere in the frame you can do that without losing any quality and it will continue to be full 1080 P even though you've zoomed in without losing anything that's the main benefit of having a higher resolution sensor so then the nest cam IQ as you can probably tell by the name is trying to be really smart with all this new hardware so it has a bunch of smart features to take advantage of having this new 4k sensor has facial recognition all this stuff so the normal full field of view for the camera is a hundred and thirty degrees using the whole sensor super wide angle as you can tell looks like your normal security camera footage but obviously really really crisp and clear zoom in four times on any part of the image and you can see it keeps its quality a hundred percent it's basically a lossless zoom and then you can keep zooming way in all the way to twelve times on the live feed if something's really getting your attention and you want to check it out now let's say someone walks into the frame nest aware recognize the spaces and humans and will sort of zoom in a bit and follow and track that person around the frame as they move it it follows them around usually with pretty decent success sometimes if you move fast enough it can sort of lose the subject but I've had no complaints about this it makes sense to follow the action and then those of you who are familiar with nest will know about the notifications array so I have mine set to turn off whenever I get here and then turn back on whenever I leave so if I'm out and it detects some motion it'll send a notification to my phone actually with a little clip of what it just saw which is pretty convenient the funny thing is probably like 95% of the time on the old nest cam probably like 99% of the time it's just like a random sunlight change or a leaf blowing outside of a window it would just send notifications for random things that weren't humans and I could set these hot zones where it's specifically monitoring that one zone but I just kind of left it on and got a lot of spare notification but nest cam IQ has been really good for me about not sending me all those spare notifications and just notifying me when it sees unknown faces or unknown humans in the frame because it's using facial recognition it can tell when it's a human and when it's just a blob or something else that it doesn't have to worry about and then on top of that you can set what's called familiar faces so instead of notifying me about an unknown human every time it sees something you can tell it to remember certain faces so it knows and can put in the notification if it's a trusted person entering so I make perfect sense for a studio like this if someone who works here walks in their faces recognized and it notifies my phone and has the person's name already I don't have to worry about it the weird thing is it doesn't let me turn on notifications for unknown faces and turn off notifications for known faces it still notifies me every time a person walks in but I'll know quicker if it's someone unknown or not seems like a pretty obvious thing I could add to the software right if it's not a known face I want to know if it's a known face I don't really care but otherwise yeah everything about this camera is better than the previous version better microphone array lighter speakers for talkback the camera itself is not waterproof so it can't be your outdoor cam but maybe able to make a 4k version of that in the future overall though this thing fits nicely into the ecosystem of products so my consensus on this little guy is it's really similar obviously to previous Ness cameras but a little bit better in every way so if you have a current Ness camera you probably don't need to upgrade you probably haven't seen anything here that's going to make you want to spend that money however if you don't have any security cameras you don't have an F scam I kind of highly recommend you get something just to be safe and this kind of fits itself nicely in the premium section of that market for a lot of people including myself who kind of value that peace of mind I think it's worth it so that's why I like them that's pretty much it let me know what you guys think maybe you'd get one of these or something else thank you for watching talked to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
hey what's up guys mkbhd here and this is iphone 10 and it's my favorite iphone ever by far and there's no doubt that in the history of iphones this thing is iconic it's more modern it finally feels like a new iphone that's a big part of why I like it so much but that's also the source for a few sore spots there's a learning curve to this phone unlike any other iPhone you see every other iPhone ever has just been home button rectangle screen rounded corners pretty much the same thing you note you're getting yourself into you know exactly how to use it and if there's going to be one big new feature every year it takes you two seconds to learn it and you're good I phone 10 is different with this phone there's maybe three or four big fundamental changes to the way you use the phone now it's very clearly still an iPhone you still mostly know how to use it but there's a couple things that are different that you'll have to get used to so on the outside is the shape we're used to the rectangle with rounded corners but this is the first time the display itself actually has curved corners and it's pushed right up to the edges of the phone or at least closer than they've ever been the commercials make it seem a little more dramatic than it actually is but hey it's 2017 phones have small bezels that's just the way they are now so in that way the iPhone catches up and it pushes everything to the corners and keeps all the front-facing sensors in the knotch that's forsaken not at the top it's actually not that big of a deal but we'll get into that soon just holding the phone though it feels great I think it's an awesome size but if there were a bigger iPhone 10 plus I would totally get that right now despite the larger display the 10 is definitely closer to feeling like an iPhone 8 then an 8 plus it still feels like a smaller phone compared to the others I've used and also thanks to the stainless steel sides it's definitely slippery and it's definitely going to slide out of your pocket at least once it happens to the best of them and it's crazy the silver it's so shiny and honestly we all know your phone is never going to look as good as it does fresh out the box unlike the more matte finish of the previous iPhone I'm not convinced this super shiny finish on the iPhones rails is going to last like this we've seen this before in other products it definitely gets chipped and scratched you probably already know I usually go for a matte black skin here which not gonna lie still looks pretty good but deep brands got something new for the 10 the grip so like the name implies this thing is supposed to be the best way to grip your phone look for a full review of this bumper later this month but I'll leave a link below if you want to check this one out a lot of people were asking about it when I showed it in my Instagram story but overall it's a pretty complete hardware package as you'd expect from a thousand-dollar smartphone you know it's the speaker's even though they aren't front-facing are still pretty good its water-resistant which gives you some nice peace of mind it has wireless charging it's no headphone jack welcome to 2017 but overall it's well considered and well put together is it now officially the most breakable iPhone ever thanks to having glass on the back yes yes the one part of the hardware of this phone I actually really don't like is the camera bump but not just for the usual reason like rocking on a table I've just kind of accepted that at this point but because of the new orientation a couple times I've noticed it's easy to accidentally get your finger in the photo or video you're taking just cuz it's all up in the corner it might take a couple days to get used to that and stop getting your finger and the corner of your shots but what's really become the signature feature of the iPhone 10 these are on the front and it is that notch up at the top of the display and there are two camps with this number one is I hate it it's ugly I wish it wasn't there and number two is I actually don't notice it anymore and just like with the essential phone I tend to fall more in camp number two when you want to make a 20-17 phone and you want to shrink the bezels you still have to put all the front-facing sensors all of the cameras and the IR blaster and the depth sensor you have to put that somewhere in 2017 some manufacturers keep a smaller traditional bezel to house it some try to go no top bezel and put everything in the chin so I'm try to minimize all the bezels and use a sort of a cutout knotch Apple has decided to go with a knotch and I don't mind it in fact I literally don't even think about it anymore in everyday use now obviously when you're focusing on it here as I'm talking about it and highlighting it on video it's really obvious you know the unibrow at the top it kind of just becomes a part of this iPhone tens character but you're never really looking at it during normal use like flipping through apps scrolling through Twitter Instagram whatever it disappears pretty quick now not everybody feels this way clearly like oh I've seen all the clever like hiding the notch stuff all the apps and the wallpapers and that I get that but because this is Apple and because they're stubborn and will never admit that any of their solutions are anything other than perfect they've come up with the opposite solution which is embrace the notch so in all their software and all the software they'll promote is apps that wrap right around that notch and fill up the whole display that's what an optimized iPhone 10 app looks like and since this is a taller aspect ratio apps will have to get updated to do this developers will have to get on their horse and actually put in the work and update their apps to get them to fill up the display like this and to be fair most of the big-name apps are already upgrading and embracing the notch like apple wants but there are still plenty that haven't updated yet and they'll be obvious when you see them because they'll have these big bezels up at the top and the bottom kind of like you're using them on an iPhone 8 again so slowly over the next couple of weeks and months all the apps you are using will get updated to embrace that notch whether you like it or not it just takes some time probably the biggest change developers have had to make to their apps for a new iPhone since the beginning so for the record the only time I really think about that notch is when I'm watching videos yes it gets kind of awkward here because when you're watching videos fullscreen the notch will cut off some of the display some of what you're trying to watch so if you want to avoid that you can actually double tap and it'll bring in the video you're watching on this OLED display now you have some more bezels but at this point now the video you're watching is so small you might as well not be watching it on a bigger screen it feels like the same size as the iPhone 8 so this whole thing is the main reason why I would actually want a plus size iPhone 10 anyway as for the rest of the display it's great Apple calls it a super Retina display I just call it their first OLED in a smart phone ever finally and it's it's pretty awesome it's a 5.8 inch panel high pixel density it supports the p3 color gamut HDR it has true tone it doesn't get as bright and saturated as Samsung's like no 8 and s8 displays but it is still bright enough not too cartoonish with the colors has a small blue shift when you tilt it off axis but so do many other Oh LEDs to varying degrees and it still has 3d touch although I pretty much stopped using that completely except for lock screen controls that I wish I could change so the screen is awesome and it's a big part of why this phone looks so good from so many angles so a good job Samsung now of course when you go to a full screen display like this you lose the home button so that's why iPhone 10 replaces that home button with whole bunch of gestures this is the biggest learning curve of any iPhone ever but it's still not that bad you swipe up from that bar at the bottom of the screen at any time to go home now anytime you see that bar it represents the home and whatever app you're in will close itself just like any other iPhone hitting a home button swipe down from the top for notifications but now swipe from the right corner for your control center and for multitasking again you have no home button so you swipe halfway up and then over to get through your recent apps that'll get you to that same card style carousel as before but overall once you get hang of this system once you get used to all this swiping which took me a couple days it felt pretty natural I actually started trying to swipe up on other phones which shows you how weird how much I got used to that the one that took me the longest was multitasking because I started off thinking you had to swipe up then wait and then the cards show up but that always felt so slow but what you really have to do to get this to work is you swipe up and over and I gets you to the cards way faster so that's a pro tip for anyone who is still swiping up halfway and waiting for the cards to show up like I was you're welcome and for those with small hands or who just really liked reach ability on the bigger iPhone you technically still have it here it's buried in the accessibility settings but you can do the little swipe down on the bottom of the screen to bring the top corners within reach and that makes getting a top gesture is easier with one hand I leave that on it's pretty useful sometimes now of course the other big change that comes with ditching the home button on iPhone 10 is he also just ditched that fingerprint reader which means as you may have heard they needed to replace that with face ID facial recognition face ID on the iPhone works really well most of the time it's not perfect and I think touch ID was close - perfect as far as fail rate goes but it's still impressively good here I talked about how touch ID is like the gold standard for quickly and securely getting into your phone in the previous video I'll link that below the like button of course and I still believe that touch ID is definitely still faster but face ID can get better with software updates and with time as millions of people begin to use it I think that'll happen and it still also has some physical limitations that you can become aware of and avoid just like touch ID had some physical limitations that you could become aware of like when your fingers wet or it doesn't quite work because of stuff on your hands or if you have a glove on stuff like that you just know touch IDs not gonna work so you put in the passcode face ID has some physical limitations - it works by bouncing thousands of little infrared dots off your face and back into the sensor and creating a map of your eyes nose and mouth it doesn't actually use the front-facing camera and it can learn a changing face over time it still recognizes you when you get a haircut or shave a beard or put makeup on none of this stuff has a huge effect on the dot map that made of your face it also won't be tricked by a picture of you because that doesn't have the depth of your face and I can also work through some pairs of sunglasses again the ones where the infrared light can get through but face ID has been known to fail when you're backlit or when there's like a ton of extra infrared light coming in basically from the Sun it's like how a dim flashlight doesn't work when it's really bright out same thing face ID is gonna get blinded by all that extra infrared light just gotta type in your passcode but those times for me were few and far between if touch IDs success rate was 99% to me it felt like face IDs success rate was like 95% now I can add up when you unlock your phone hundreds of times a day but again this can get better as it gets used more there's even some settings as well where you can turn attention on so it won't unlock if you're just holding the phone up to your face not only that but you have to be looking at your phone then it'll unlock and show all your notification data works pretty well for me just please don't do this while driving and even if face ID is this workaround - not getting the fingerprint reader underneath the glass in time for this phone I still think that at its best facial recognition on a phone is closer to secure seamless authentication than a separate fingerprint reader ever would be because with this you just pick up the phone and it works you use it you login you pay for stuff you download apps etc but if someone else picks up your phone it won't work it's that simple and then there is an emoji possibly maybe the most fun feature of iPhone 10 but you know it's hilarious these moving facial tracking and emoji are iPhone 10 exclusive you can't get this on any other iPhone so if you get one of these then you know the person that sent it has an iPhone 10 and weirdly enough if you send this to someone with an Android phone they just get a video message of this an emoji but here's the thing an emoji is just using the front-facing camera check this out an emoji is working and continues to work even when you cover the depth sensors and the extra front-facing sensors all that stuff it'll work when you cover everything except for it the front-facing camera which means they totally could have made these available for any other iPhone but they didn't man an emoji is the classic I have an iPhone and you don't feature classic Apple iPhone 10 also has some slightly new cameras same exact sensors for both cameras as the iPhone 8 plus but slightly better glass and now both are optically stabilized so this is gonna get you some meaningfully better performance with the 2x telephoto lens and zoomed in photos and zoomed in videos things like that which is good to see because I avoided using it with previous iPhones and as you'd expect photos from the iPhone 10 look awesome I'm especially happy with how much dynamic range we're getting HDR on previous iPhone cameras used to be a lot less aggressive and I kept asking over and over for a little more a little more and now photos really pop the sky is like always so blue details their color accuracy is tight it's not as good as the pixel twos camera just gonna say that right up front but this is a top 5 smartphone camera and no doubt if you want a video sample check out the Tesla rap video I'll link it below that's 5 minutes of 4k video from the sensor right there if you want to watch that and despite his tendency to overexpose I think it might be the best front-facing camera for video for any smartphone they've also added portrait mode to the front-facing camera for portrait selfies on the 10 but it doesn't work nearly as well edges get blurred super hard almost to a comical amount when compare it to something like the pixel - or even the back facing camera but the thing is pixel - does all this so much better because of machine learning and software so in theory iPhone 10 can keep learning and get this good - plus it already has better color accuracy so I'll be on the lookout for that software update now you may have noticed we've made it all this way into an iPhone review without talking about any of the specs shows how important that is but iPhone 10 is rocking the a11 Bionic chip and three gigs of ram and it's awesome in fact it's really really good I would say this is the most powerful mobile chipset in any smartphone right now the benchmarks are insane but this isn't for iOS this is for all the things that run on top of iOS the augmented reality apps the image processing the super slow-motion video all of that stuff at iOS is still iOS as you know I mean it obviously feels more modern because of all the swiping and the gestures now but as far as functionality it has all the same stuff and features you're used to has all the same quirks are used to like iOS this notification system is still a mess since they don't group apps together this is still easily fixable but there's plenty of other things I wish would be different about iOS - but it's Apple they're stubborn you'll get used to it and battery life on the iPhone 10 has turned out to be pretty great close to the iPhone 8 plus I would say again iPhone is a champ of standby time and it always has been so no problems there and it handles the biggest iPhone display ever pretty well thanks to it being an OLED I haven't had any problems getting to the end of a single day with full use if you want to use that screen on time metric it's usually around 6 hours so the bottom line and the question that I get the most often about this phone is so what do you think and if you made it this far in the video you already know what I think but in case you skipped to this part this is my favorite iPhone ever by far I really like it is it worth $1000 honestly I don't think people spending the money on this phone will be disappointed now that's not to say this thing is perfect it clearly still also has its downsides you know the fact that it's all glass on the back more breakable that's a downside the notch on the front for a lot of people that's a downside no headphone jack still a downside but those are all things that I think people who are buying this phone are already used to or were expecting and for that reason it's not a deal-breaker in 2017 so I'm happy to be carrying this phone so if you were thinking about going out and getting this phone go ahead I think you'll like it too until the next one there's been mkbhd thank you for watching tuffsy as the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys on TV HD here and the Samsung Galaxy s8 is everywhere and it makes sense because not only does Samsung have a massive marketing budget to put this thing in front of your eyes but it also happens to be a really great phone so makes sense but that makes it so easy to overlook LG g6 which is another fantastic phone it's actually LG's best phone ever it's kind of like the James Harden regular-season when Russell Westbrook just had like such a high-profile MVP caliber regular-season you did know that I thought I would get analogy well Golf has never been my sport Marquez but you're right the Galaxy s8 is a tremendous smartphone but smartphones are very personal things and for some people the LG G 6 might be even better this is true so let's get to it I'm mister mobile and this is LG G 6 vs galaxy s 8 so these are actually very similar phones both flagship spoke top-of-the-line Ford's offered by the respective manufacturers but right off the bat there have been some differences that can have a really significant effect on the user experience and it's all these things put together that have me leaning between these two towards the Galaxy s8 first of all the s8 has a better display in fact it is the best display on any smartphone which is huge it's an OLED so colors and contrast not only pop more but have a wider available range it's brighter and more visible outdoors and it has even slightly higher resolution coming in at a slightly taller aspect ratio than the g6 now let's not to say the g6 is display is bad by any means but nothing quite compares to the edge to edge curved glass display on a Galaxy s8 right now it's in a class of its own at this point in a year and that gives it this immersion factor it's often better for watching videos playing games etc because it lets you completely ignore the edges and just watch the content the black g6 is definitely not as bad with this but obviously it doesn't quite melt over the same way and reflections while they are a pain in the butt to ignore on video like this they don't feel nearly as bad in real life so there's that display advantage but then I just give the general industrial design and aesthetic award to the Galaxy s8 it is a much more sleek polished feel than a slightly more industrial looking g6 and again g6 doesn't look bad at all but put them side-by-side and the g6 kind of looks more like a rough-draft while the s8 looks like a final copy the rounded edges and nearly seamless connection between the glass and the front and back and the metal sides makes it feel like you're holding a smooth stone type of thing while the g6 feels like a traditional phone type of thing that rhymed but overall I give the aesthetic advantage to the Galaxy s8 and then there's just the specs on paper so I did say they're both flagships but again when you see the higher resolution display when you see the Snapdragon 835 versus Snapdragon 820 one you kinda have to give the edge to the s8 again in this category and then just from using it for a while you notice a lot of little things I prefer the headphone jack at the bottom of the phone galaxy f8 does that for me I prefer no carrier branding anywhere on the back of any model Galaxy s8 does that too and the GS 8 is just the tiniest bit narrower and light g6o the screen to body ratio is just that tiny bit better it helps and there's just a couple more features packed into the software stuff like the iris scanner and the first ever front-facing camera with autofocus but even with all these things there are still reasons to consider getting a g6 for your own personal use over a Galaxy s8 so for those reasons this is Michael Fisher for mr. mobile thanks man can I get some music real quick thank you so all your points on the s8 are well taken Marcus but the LT g6 has two huge wins over the SA I think and a few smaller ones too the first big one is projected durability the g6 is a chunkier phone than the SI then easier to grip I think but if you do drop it the g6 is also more likely to take a hit gracefully at least on paper it's certified compliant with mil standard 810g and now that's not always as rugged as it sounds and manufacturers can game test results a bunch of ways but LG has been good enough to let everyone in on which lab it employed to test the g6 as well as which procedures it used for that testing the g6 past 14 separate tests including low temperature high temperature temperature shock humidity vibration solar radiation low pressure sand and dust immersion rain and my favorite salt fog now Samsung will probably release a Galaxy s8 active that meets the same criteria it's done so for the past four years but if it follows precedent it'll be exclusive to AT&amp;T and also probably aesthetically challenged the regular s8 can be dunked in water like the g6 it meets the same IP standard but if it came down to which of these I'd rather take hiking on treacherous terrain or braving the salt fog fog of sirata for I'd take the g6 the other big reason I might choose lg / Samsung the camera not because the g6 always out shoots the s8 each of these can take some wonderful photos but because the g6 lets me double up that extra camera on the LG is more than mere adornment it packs a 125 degree lens that lets you capture much more of a scene without dealing with a clumsy panorama obviously this kind of dramatic framing isn't always what you want and that's why the standard shooter is there as well between the primary and wide-angle cameras the g6 can capture photos and video the s8 just can't a couple less things before I throw it back to you Marcus well the g6 is display doesn't have the saturation or contrast of the s8 the fact that it's an LCD means it may be less susceptible to burn in than Samsung's AMOLED also the g6 totally wins on buttons no half functional Bixby key to get confused with the volume rocker and yes the g6 is fingerprint sensor is way easier to feel out than the SAS organ ammonite mer okay let's kill the music thank you back to you sir so at the end of the day it turns out surprise surprise these are both really good smartphones in their own respective ways and you might have been swayed by looking at the comments section maybe people saying oh the Galaxy S eights way better or the G 6 wipes the floor with the s8 its underrated neither of those is completely true these are both really good options so that being said that puts it entirely in your hands to pick which one of these you'd spend your money on it's your call so that is it thank you for watching and of course thanks to mr. mobile for his contribution to this video you can see his channel right here he does a whole bunch of mobile related videos that are fantastic and again if you have any comments or questions feel free to leave them below I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] [Music] hey what is up guys I'm cabby HD here and I just want to give a shout out to my former self so I was at that Apple event a bunch of months ago when they were announcing the new iPhone and all that stuff and they also dropped air pods that they would be making these wireless earbuds for iPhones and then they announced the price and I tweeted this clearly I was not a believer but today in January 2017 air pods may be the most popular wireless headphones on planet Earth and if they're not yet they're certainly well on their way to being those I see these everywhere I see these out in New York City I see them at airports I see them at CES I'm just so used to seeing these in people's ears there's thousands of reviews and they're great reviews people are going out and getting these on purpose as gifts for themselves they're out of stock for the holidays they're definitely doing really well so in a way this falls right in line with the whole getting rid of the headphone jack thing as much as it sucks at first you have to do it eventually if you want to get wireless technology to improve really quickly so right around the time that Apple's getting rid of the headphone jack they also come out with what they feel is the best possible wireless headphones and that puts pressure on everyone else who wants to be competitive now marques wait are you are you changing your tone on this like you were hating on these but now suddenly these are the best possible wireless headphones yes I reviewed them I used them you can watch that video these are the best possible wireless earbuds obviously if you like over ear headphones those are a different category but nothing comes close to airpot as a recap here's what makes them so good three things number one the case it's super simple you just open it take the headphones out put them back in it charges them while they're in here and you can charge the case it's small it's really good number two the W one chip inside pairing this with an iPhone takes literally two seconds thanks to that chip as soon as you open the case it's working and as soon as you pair it you can start listening but not only that once you pair it to your iPhone for example it automatically is available to pair with any other Apple device you have signed in thanks to iCloud and that ship so that is legit and three is just use of use the whole experience you want to listen to music you open the case put the air pods in and you're listening to music it's already started playing if you're done you take them out of your ears it stopped playing you put them back in the case you close it it's disconnected it's off it's charging again it's ready to go the next time you need it simple the battery life is solid the sound is good enough for most people I mean if you're doing phone calls and just casually listening to music that's all people really want and for most people they stay in your ears pretty well when walking around or during a commute or normal activity I know some people that even work out in these it's definitely not for everyone but it's still true for most so the question is what if you're on Android like what's the best wireless earbuds for Android what's the what's gonna match the entire air pods for iPhone experience if you use an Android phone well after testing a bunch as you saw in the intro and I got to be honest my findings were not predictable or easy but I came to the conclusion that none of them do everything as well as air pods they all do different things better than others but it's sort of a mixed bag here is what you would think most likely would be that equivalent pixel buds made by Google for Android so those same prices air pods and their Bluetooth and they have instant pairing if you have a pixel but otherwise it's normal bluetooth pairing with any Android phone as soon as you take it out the case the sound is pretty good as far as audio quality nothing exactly mind-blowing here for the price the battery life is about the same and you can see they're not truly wireless earbuds so they do have this wire between them and they actually stay in your ears through that pretty clever wire method I know there aren't technically wireless headphones because of that but you can push the wire right up through the earbud to create this little modular custom sized wingtip to fit your ear and it works pretty well also the wire carries power between the earbuds so like don't ever cut this wire I think your ability to control everything is right around on par with air pods so you can move forward or backwards between songs but if you want to change the volume you have to ask Google assistant which you do by holding down on the side of your but on the right it responds to you pretty quickly and it's natural enough that I don't find it that weird it also reads your notifications as they come in so like a calendar event as it happens it'll just read it to you or a text message and a DoubleTap on the touchpad will just read off everything you have waiting for you there's also the live translation feature which I haven't gotten to work yet but has gotten some pretty interesting demos I'll link Linus's video below it's a beta it's a work in progress at best but at the end of the day pixel buds they're decent but they're just not quite airpot the fact that it's not truly wireless isn't a big deal for me but that is a difference but just the whole taking them out and putting them back in the case is a bit more of a chore thanks to that wire as great as this case is you know it's pretty it's soft it's the only one I've tried with USBC but I wish it was a little more robust and a little more elegant to use then just to look at and the pixel buzzes themselves are a little less comfortable in my ears just because of the main inside of your ear part being hard plastic usually with ear buds you know you get that flexible plastic or foam ear pods are sort of a hit-or-miss and so our pixel buds they're not flexible they don't try to be super in here but they just kind of hang on there I might sound like I'm being picky but I really am I'm just trying to find something that does everything for Android as well as air pods do for iPhone so we tested a bunch of the other top options here that worked for Android we tested the Bose sound sport freeze we got the new j-bird run we also did the j-bird x3 we got the braggy - headphones the Jabra elite sport the Arado Apollo 7 the Evo 1 and the air pods which actually also do work on Android technically turns out the best comparison to what I got from air pods on iPhone was what I got from j-bird run on Android so I've talked about jaybird stuff in the past and this is obviously their newest completely wireless earbuds set and it comes really close in a lot of areas and does some things better than air pods so as far as the big three the case the instant pairing and the ease of use the case itself is a little bigger it's more thick like bulbous still pocketable if you want but you could also just toss it in a bag not a huge deal and the headphones come in and out of it pretty quickly just gotta line up the pins and drop it on the magnets and it starts charging not quite the same level as air pods but you get the idea pairing is your normal Android pairing the first time and then every time you take them out the case after that you just open it up and it connects so again almost as good and then ease-of-use is great you just listen to it like normal or you can hop in the j-bird and my sound app and mess with audio profiles and changes the way they sound that's something they've done recently the seal in your ear with the flexible custom tip is great so they sound better than air pods for sure and they fit in your ear better than air pods or pixel buds especially for workouts if you move around a lot these are gonna sound great it is still microUSB on the back I wish it was USB see I've said that about other things but pretty much everything else about these as far as user experience goes this is the air pods for Android as far as what I've tried but of course for those curious about all the other stuff we tried here's a quick breakdown of the rest so Bose sound support free 250 bucks they are a complete package with good battery life sweat resistance microphones nice build but they're big the case is big the earbuds are big and they have this this whole left-right pairing priority so the right bud is the master and the left one follows in a way that gives a solid delay between your audio and the stuff on your screen so not so great for watching movies the Arado Apollo 7 250 bucks again these are a weird design and they sometimes fall out your ears even with different sized tips they're just kind of strange and when they do stay in they look the most like ear plugs not a whole lot of crazy or extra features here just straight-up ear plugs in a case no MIDI controls not that great the braggy - 160 bucks another big case and the earbuds themselves are a lot more exposed to pins lots of combinations of taps and holds on the side touch pads for media controls and just about everything you could possibly want to do with these so there's a learning curve to them but there's also four gigs of internal storage so that's cool the evo 1 or yellow one 250 bucks a sleek case even if it is micro USB the buds are not sweat resistant so that's to note and it's really easy to accidentally press the media controls on the side when you're trying to push them in your ears because it's just a touch pad so that was a bit frustrating they also sound like hot garbage like truly impressive are you sure it's not broken terrible audio Jabra elite sport 220 bucks best battery life of a bunch I'd say and you can see why they're pretty chunky stealthy all matte black sweat resistant they connect pretty easy and the raise indicators on the buds are nice but there's two on each bud so you kind of feel like you're shoving them in your ears when you try to adjust them tons of options for fit with the wingtips though plus it has a heart rate monitor and then j-bert x3 115 bucks these again are also not wireless obviously but just to note they still are really convenient they sound great customizable fit with the wingtips and ear buds again they stay in your ears super well and there's a clip to keep the flat wire behind your head with a minimal slack so it doesn't get caught in long hair also there's the only one with media controls on the cable not on the butt and then air pods 160 bucks so yes you can use air pods for Android you might not want to but it's decent they pair like normal Bluetooth earbuds and their sound is middle-of-the-road obviously and you lose a couple of the extra features like tapping for Siri and the play pause when you go in and out of your ears but otherwise pretty standard so all that being said here's how I would rank these as far as experience for Android from best to worst number one is j-bird run number two is j-bird x3 number three pixel buds then braggy - then I throw air pods in there then Jabra elite sport bose sound sport urato Apollo 7 hoping your favorite song plays on the radio Yivo one so alright what have we learned from all of this number one that air pods are actually really good I'm almost curious what a 2nd gen ear pods would look like maybe a shorter stem but that could be pretty interesting number 2 that pixel buds are pretty good wireless earbuds for Android but not quite as good as air pods are for iPhone although that almost doesn't matter to anyone because most people don't have both iPhones and Android phones and number three that jaybird run turns out to be pretty much the best possible experience for wireless earbuds for Android hopefully that covers everything I think the ranking tells all so that's pretty much it thank you for watching and let me know what you think of this general format I'm playing around the idea of having trying to get together everything from one category to surface what really is the best maybe there will be a name for it but let me know if you think and also I'll try to link everything I talked about in the description below again thanks for watching talk to you the next one peace

[Music] hey what is the sky isn't pbht here and I've shown you what's on my phone like enough times now you've already seen it this new series is dedicated to touring other creative people's hugs and looking at the tech behind how they do what they do so this is episode 1 with tasty knife set and his type of functional studio so through the vlogs and various Casey videos we've seen pretty much every conceivable angle of his studio and it can look like a mess like like chaos actually there's a lot of surface area covered there's stuff everywhere it doesn't fit the traditional visual of a neat or organized space but it is it really is it's one of the most neat and organized spaces even surprisingly so let's walk through each of these sections with caffeine it's this area behind me this is like my tool workshop construction area and the reason why I have that is literally to maintain the rest of the studio everything in here is always breaking everything in here needs to be built or rebuilt so it's nice having my little tool shop back there to do all that for those of you who have seen cases videos which is probably most of you you know that a lot of what he does involves literally building stuff like putting together new things that are purpose-built for exact situations or tasks and then once they're built you can keep them around or use them again if it comes up but this little tool area a little corner here is where you'll find the supplies to make that stuff all this is exemplified by build over by if you can't buy exactly what you need build it this is the overhead shooting rig so camera mounted here shooting straight down I can see the image here on the screen it makes it really easy for animation but this table is just like old busted up plywood and the Missis plumbing pipe because to buy one of these like a professional and super expensive but like this does all the pro stuff like it telescopes up and down this moves back and forth so it's a homemade overhead shooting rig so build over by again I'm personally a huge fan of headshots obviously but there's no denying it can take a lot of effort to set them up just right and get them looking the way you want every time unless of course you build a permanent rig to look exactly the way you want every time and this rig is a lot more nuanced than you might think there's a 2x4 with a Manfrotto baseplate screwed into it so he can clip any camera with the Manfrotto plate to it pretty quick and there's an HDMI monitor on the other side with a right angle cable that goes directly into the camera plus a remote trigger so he doesn't have to reach around and press the record button on whatever camera he's using there's a measuring tape on the side of the 2x4 to nail focus distance every time there's a roll of white paper France and white background a row of black paper for instant black background there's an iPad on an arm for keeping a shot list or anything else really and these four light bulbs in these circular diffusers make it a super soft shadowless light coming down onto the table their video lights basically the majority of my videos are shot on like portable cameras little cameras like this but I keep this big guy permanently set up here in the office for like the formal talking to camera footage this entire apparatus is built to make it as easy as possible for me to film myself because I typically don't have someone here to help me operate the camera so this big rig is actually another of the same camera it's a Sony a7r Mark to a 4k mirrorless camera that I've actually used in the past but of course it has a couple of video making accessories so the camera is in a cage made by tilta that basically adds a bunch of quarter-twenty screw holes a top handle and a pair of rails to the front of the camera so the rails on the front would be for something like a motorized follow focus to attach to the lens but Casey doesn't use that he uses autofocus so instead he uses the mounting holes in the cage for adding things like a monitor arm and a shotgun microphone for better audio and then this whole cage and rails mounts to the tripod directly so we can just move that around the studio this set up plus a single video light is pretty clutch this is my desk this is where I work all day every day I used to work in the back I like sitting back there better but the natural light on my face makes it a year from to shoot videos sitting at this desk this is like the laptop station where I do the majority of my editing and whatnot and then this is where I want to do my but this computer is just too slow to edit on so I just use all of this for data management 20 terabytes 20 terabytes 24 terabytes and then this is 60 terabytes I never delete any footage so the computer case you actually edits on right now is the 2016 MacBook Pro 15 inch with touch bar despite all its troubles and all its dongles it's the most up to date machine Apple makes right now and he and I are final cut editors so that's a choice and then the never deleting footage part as scary as it sounds is actually true and I suspect this storage collection will be growing pretty soon but for now I count about a hundred 50 terabytes of storage just at the desk and the monitor setup is all very specific as well so from top to bottom its inside video surveillance they're in hallway surveillance outside studio surveillance from a GoPro that's hanging out the window more outside studio surveillance you know just in case next door office surveillance and another angle down the hallway and on the bottom one and ultra-wide is the only one actually hooked up to the Mac Pro running a screensaver that just plays The Godfather one and a godfather to over and over on repeat so that's where he spends a lot of the time and that's where you could say the magic happens and then around the corner is a little nook around the back of the studio which sports a vertical TV connected to a vertical GoPro that's always on this area not so functional these are my dead drugs these have died for various reasons like this one says here crashed into Central Park pond these things happen this is a charging central for all of like my point-and-shoot cameras and the idea this is at a glance to be able to see that everything is charging and ready to go a little secret about this though is that most of these cameras I don't use anymore so this is actually about to be broken down and this wall is going to repurposed it's such a beautiful picture though I've been reluctant to actually take them off the wall this area back here this you should just be where I kept all of my gear but it felt really underutilized and I need to do like a chill spot in the studio so I put this couch in and this became like the gaming station one thing that's super cool underneath this couch we cut a big hole and put the subwoofer there so when you're playing call of duty like the machine gun the sound it literally shakes your ass because the base is so strong okay now I think this is a 65 inch TV it was the cheapest TV I can get off of Amazon looks fine Playstations not to the wall going anything on the floor right here and then up top here are my surveillance monitors behind me is like all of the gear all the camera equipment that I use for making videos almost all of this is is active and the idea with the layout is to have it so I can grab and go as quickly as possible this is the active drone area this is a phantom 4 Pro phantom 4 regular this is the Karma Mavic battery charging station propellers these are my cameras these are the cameras that all work they're fully operational batteries are charged ready to go even these older ones I still keep at the ready just because I have them GoPro set up over here SLRs point shoots lenses a little known secret of my studio here is that I really take advantage of the space under the floor so this trap door here this is like bounce boards lighting equipment c-stands and some more like weirdo esoteric gear like body mounts cool stuff I don't use it often it's like keeping the floor so the Casey Neistat studio is low-key kinda a masterpiece it's a tightly woven collection of Technology and video tools and construction tools that make it possible and maybe the most functional use of the square footage imaginable and it all comes back to two main things build over by and being a lot more organized than it actually looks it's not traditional and even just being there for the first time and me looking around as a video person and as a tech head and a bit of a perfectionist sometimes myself you notice a couple things number one pretty much everything is labeled like meticulously did you notice that like boxes of things categories of gear supplies tools equipment tech stuff it's all literally hand labelled so ideally you can find exactly what you need in second and the number to almost every wire instead of being invisible or shoved behind a desk like we typically do it it's strung out and visible and pinned up against the wall so you can trace everything to where it's then it's a different type of organization then maybe we're used to in a normal super clean studio and then number three the studio is exceptionally well lit I mean it is a video studio after all but everywhere you look there's lights ceiling lights dome lights diffusion satellites all things to brighten the space to give it a consistent even look and to give a subtle blown out bokeh when you're shooting video and to make it feel even bigger than it actually is everything is well lit all of them have purpose and place and it seems like every square inch of space every surface is used for something and that's what you can do when you've been in a space for a decade so that's been it thanks for watching hopefully you now have a better appreciation of the space you've probably seen in so many videos so thanks to Casey for the walkthrough definitely subscribe to his channel for more awesome videos all the time and I'll catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
hey what is up guys angka Bhd here and welcome to the always sunny Hawthorne California there's plenty of cool stuff here there's a Hyperloop test track form two yards away from me there's superchargers but we're here at the Tesla design studio where you often see some of their latest and greatest stuff what we're here for is to look at their latest and greatest car Tesla Model 3 so shout out to Tesla for this car for this week for this video shows they actually really care about you guys and this is only my second time ever in a Model 3 as rare as this car is it makes sense but we should we should probably name this thing [Music] you try so for a little context model 3 is important because of what it represents which is essentially the final step in the master plan that Tesla outlined a couple of years ago what they wanted to do was create number one a very expensive very low volume electric car which they did then use that money to create a slightly more high volume slightly less expensive car that they did and then use that money to create a mass market affordable electric car that's this so the number they landed at was starting at $35,000 but as you probably know with a lot of cars that say starting at a certain price almost none of those cars cost that actual price you get some options you kind of spec it up to look the way you want it to and then you have that final price same thing with model 3 so almost no model 3 is on the road are actually going to cost thirty five thousand dollars despite this being the $35,000 Tesla in fact this one that we're driving this week thanks to Tesla has quite a few upgrades and ends up at fifty seven thousand dollars so the options on this car to get to that price are obviously the base price of $35,000 long range battery upgrade so that's $9,000 the premium upgrades package $5,000 the red multi coat paint which is pretty sweet that's a thousand bucks the 19-inch wheels over the 18 inch that are standard that's 1500 and then enhanced autopilot which is five thousand dollars and then there's a destination fee of a thousand bucks and that's how you get to your fifty seven thousand dollar price so that's creeping up into Model S territory not quite obviously the base price is lower but now you find yourself not really comparing this to other $30,000 cars but comparing it to other 50 $60,000 cars that's just me I'm gonna shamelessly compare it to the one car I know best which is my Tesla Model S and just embrace it but that's how I'm gonna figure out if those options are worth it and if Model 3 turns out to be worth the price so let's get started [Music] so right off the bat something a lot of people have talked about in model 3 versus model s is air suspension versus this coil suspension Model S that bigger slightly older but slightly better car has air suspension which is very very smooth and adjustable and this coil suspension is not adjustable so you can't change the height of the car so it rides at a certain height always and it'll always be a certain firmness just depending on how firm those coils are going over smaller bumps or potholes or even turning you can feel it like it's it's a little more pronounced and it's sharper so air suspension smooth things out a lot more some people prefer air suspension I'm one of those people some people actually prefer coil suspension when they feel like they like that firmer grip but yeah this is this is definitely a bit different from model s all right let's give a low scale auto park a shot probably don't need help parking a spot this big but not a lot of 40 50 thousand dollar cars have Auto Park so you pull up in front to the car next to you when you throw it in reverse you get a button that says start press start the string will starts moving car starts moving in Reverse by itself and you can look at the rearview mirror if you want but it's gonna do everything from this point on without your input this is for those of you who have a fear of parallel parking one thing you do have to get used to though but it didn't take me that long is looking to the right for the speed and although generally the stuff that's usually behind the steering wheel there's no tech commoner obviously because there's no gears but you still kind of want to know if you're in Drive or neutral you want to know your speed you want to know your battery and while you're driving you don't want to look that far off the road but I've actually trained my glance now to go just over to the top corner of this screen instead of behind the wheel it's still just so quiet like when I turn the AC down here no noise no engine noise I mean it's electric makes perfect sense but still something I'll get used to sometimes you you start to hear every little anything that rattles anything that creaks you'll hear that instead highway driving like this gives the opportunity just to look around the inside of the car and I'm gonna echo a lot of things I've like read about this car but you don't really feel that until you're in it visibility with the glass everywhere is awesome rear visibility of the glass is huge the other glass above you and the front glass and the hood slopes down so much that you can you can see right over the front and nose of the car and you feel like you see just a road right in front so now we'd made our way up to the edge of the canyons now it was time for some slightly more fun and more uphill Canyon driving all right let's talk efficiency so model three is obviously a lighter car than Model S so it's gonna have better efficiency slightly better so the past six miles we've been driving uphill to get into these canyons and the watt hour per mile rating that's a relative measure of efficiency for these cars is pretty high it's up over 700 but we're about to turn around and go back down those same six miles and you'll see the rating is of course much lower because that's what happens when you go downhill an electric car regenerative braking let's do it [Music] so doing all this driving in these windy twisty turny roads up and down the canyons like this you really feel things like the smaller size of this car it's not a compact by any means but it has a smaller steering wheel and the steering ratio is actually tighter so that the whole car feels tighter and more agile and handling so it actually handles better but overall yeah the driving reminded me still a lot of my car not as fast obviously but still zippy and smooth and the linear acceleration instead of gear shifting is still pretty unique I kind of love it all right just like I was saying the power of regenerative braking we started at the top of this mountain six miles ago with 233 miles on this car's battery but can should get our efficiency on the way down we've used an average of negative 163 watt hours per mile which puts us at actually adding to the battery in our past six miles so now at the top we have 238 miles left on the battery all right now we're headed out of the mountains leaving now and we're gonna head over to the TLD studio which is about 45 minutes I'll show you exactly how many miles that is but we have plenty of range to go so I'm gonna go ahead and ring the car to them let them see it for a little bit check it out they don't like so on our way to John Studios still and this gives me a chance to demonstrate since there's a lot of cars on the road one of I think the most underrated features of any Tesla which is autopilot in stop-and-go traffic that's actually the time that I use it the most so what I do is double tap the stock down which is a little different I kind of missed that dedicated autopilot stock but now I can just not focus on driving I don't have to worry about stopping if the guy in front of me stops my car will stop the guy in front of me goes my car will go it's that simple if there's one thing I learned model 3 has over model s it's that it's more of a unicorn especially out here in California where there are Tesla's and Tesla enthusiasts everywhere this car is is still actually turning heads it's super rare anyway I figured it would also be useful to get some more candid opinions of some youtubers including one future Tesla Model 3 owner and current reservation holder I normally don't like red but I like it on this one I cause multi Co red it's different from like the darker founders red which looks kind of brown yeah right way distant gasp oh wait wait so yeah general consensus was no matter how you feel about electric cars yeah this thing is pretty cool just as cool as any other Tesla so now as someone who has driven and experienced this Model 3 for a little while what are my thoughts on it on the whole experience what you get for the money and are all the upgrade options worth it well at a base price of 35,000 I think it's pretty clear it's the best electric car in the price range right now but that's with no options but the options are worth considering the long range option is nine thousand dollars but that brings you from a base 220 mile range to 310 miles so basically nine thousand bucks for ninety more miles but that's basically plus 50 percent range and for a lot of people that's actually gonna be worth it people with longer commutes and longer daily driving the premium interior also goes a long way for five thousand bucks you go from a metal roof to the glass roof you get a much improved speaker system that for me qualifies as the loudest I've ever heard in a car heated seats power moving seats the wood trim in the front and the leather seats just it seems like a no-brainer to me so go for that the red paint you can totally skip and save your thousand bucks there but it is beautiful then again I am biased and then the 19-inch wheels that are slightly heavier and slightly less efficient you can also skip these no problem and get the baseline 18-inch keep in mind though if you're after performing might be best to wait all around for an all-wheel-drive version of model 3 to be announced and an autopilot for 5000 bucks I don't really see how you can get a Tesla and not get autopilot but if you do decide to go that way and then regret it later you can pay a little more to enable it with a software update because every Tesla out the factory has all the cameras and all the sensors to make it happen but bottom line I think this is a good looking good driving electric car and for the price it does some things even better than Model S right now like the futuristic air-conditioner event that's controlled on the touchscreen that can redirect airflow at your face or around your head pretty awesome the bigger area of glass around the back and the top of this car gives you more Headroom or just like the little things like the way the front trunk opens and closes easier or the touchscreen UI is a little bit cleaner and a little bit faster a lot of the stuff I'd expect to see in a Model S refresh pretty soon but it's obviously all still great to see in this cheaper car too so it's pretty clear I'm a fan of the Model 3 I was before I came out here to drive it and I still am now now that I have so that's been episode one of autofocus if you enjoyed it definitely hit that like button and let me know what car should I check out next thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys the next one peace 
[Music] so this is the iMac Pro it's Apple's first true Pro desktop workstation in years and it's pretty damn good so I made my first impressions video of the new iMac Pro using somewhere what I'd call like a mid tier iMac pros the 10 core the total price ran around 10 grand for that machine the a Mac Pro starts at about 5,000 bucks on launch day though I did order what would be the highest end available iMac pro spec config with the intention of making it my full daily driver I'm gonna give it a shot and replace the Mac Pro so that's what this is turns out to be the 18 core Xeon CPU 128 gigs of ram the 16 gig Vegas 64 and a 4 terabyte SSD and all that runs around 13,000 bucks and I have actually really liked it so a couple months ago I was wondering if I Mac Pro was a trap I was thinking I would try it and it would just be my interim machine until that fully modular and new Mac Pro comes out maybe this year and that may still be true but after using this I can really say that I can highly recommend iMac pro maybe not this 18 core one but this is one my favorite and new Apple products in a really long time so of course anyone considering buying one will want to know why should I get an iMac Pro over a regular high-end iMac you know you can get a maxed out 5k iMac with a core i7 64 gigs of ram all of that for about 5 grand so why pay more for this so this is everything that's different about this deceivingly different beast the iMac pro so the outside dimensions are exactly the same as a normal iMac which means same 5k display but also same big bezels and same huge chin and same non adjustable stand so you know part of the reason I was looking forward to the new Mac Pro is because I've never really been a huge fan of the way the iMac looks I'd rather use my own monitor I actually prefer dual monitors and a matte finish but that's not to say this 5k display here is bad in fact it's excellent it's one of the best and it always has been but here's what is new number one the space gray obviously I think it's hot I would love an even more like matte black undertone but I know we're not getting that so for now I can't appreciate the space gray paint the space grey keyboard the black buttons the trackpad the black lightning cable black Apple stickers even all the stuff that you can only get with an iMac pro it doesn't save the Magic Mouse from dumb design but you know at least now it's better-looking so number two the built-in speakers of the iMac Pro are actually significantly louder and fuller and better than a regular iMac now you may or may not care about that if you're a pro user you probably don't use the built-in speakers obviously don't I use an audio device to my external speakers and I also have this little Satechi little hub here that plugs and gets my ports around the front and goes right into the speaker but if you do use the built-in speakers that's a nice bonus and speaking of ports of course number three is those ports so the iMac Pro has a 20-18 workstation suite of high performance IO has four full-size USB 3.0 ports four Thunderbolt 3 USB C ports an SD card reader a headphone jack and tend to give an Ethernet which is pretty huge for networking professionals right there I'm currently using most of these ports on mine so for my external storage the Pegasus the audio device the red mag reader things like that but I have a couple left over so I haven't found that I need more ports but if I added another 5k monitor which you can do that would fill my Thunderbolt 3 ports but so far I'm alright now again it is an all-in-one but technically it's an all-in-one desktop and for any desktop I gotta say I usually want the port's to be pretty easily within reach so that's yet another reason why I'd prefer a Mac Pro but I'll link to this little Satechi hope I got right below that like button if you want more info on it and I'll also link the 12 South Stand I have mine on as well I've talked about them before in my setup tour video but there's that so number four is the built-in webcam so it's now rocking this 1080p FaceTime camera which you know this is also better than a normal iMac but it's not that great I mean we still have these incredible cameras these 4k optically stabilized cameras in this little device here but in this entire bezel of this whole iMac purim looking at this is the best they could fit apparently not a big deal so number five is the vents and the cooling this is pretty minor but I Mac Pro is dead silent even with a heavy edit going on in Final Cut Pro or a massive amount of multitasking it seems like apples pretty into keeping the fan speed low on this thing I've heard it speed up maybe twice ever while using it and both of those times is word during rendering and final cut so the slot at the bottom is air intake and the vents at the top near the stand or where the hot air is blowing out some people have definitely mentioned that it seems like the angle of the IMAX stand would take the hot air output and bounce it back into the cool air vent but I've never found that the fan spins fast enough to move the hot air out that fast so it just kind of hot air just kind of Rises and the cold air intake takes in whatever is at your desk level and that brings us to number six the one that really matters the internals like I mentioned this is a maxed out iMac Pro here so this is the 18 cores E&amp;W workstation chip the 128 gigs of air correcting memory 16 gigabytes of memory on that Vegas 64 GPU and the 4 terabyte SSD workstation grade parts and also something that doesn't get talked about as much is the t2 chip which is new to the iMac pro but that integrates a bunch of the smaller formerly discrete controllers into one like the cameras image processor encrypted storage etc and with the performance I feel like I've actually noticed a major difference in the way it feels both in heavy everyday projects and in the day-to-day which is not something I thought I would now you can look at benchmarks and obviously the 18 core Xeon and all the high-end specs are going to destroy a regular i7 and all of those and obviously I perform a little bit something like a custom built PC but just in the way I've been using it and it's kind of like the eye test I've noticed it feels faster which is awesome a lot of the most intensive work I do in the studio of course is video editing and that's actually pretty GPU heavy which matters more in Final Cut Pro I Mac Pro flies through this stuff like an iMac or even my trashcan Mac Pro never quite could and of course every I my craft ride has had Vegas 64 so that's important but cutting through and playing back a K read code at 12 to 1 or even 8 to 1 compression on the timeline would cripple a MacBook Pro it would just kind of chug along with a lot of dropped frames on any old Mac Pro but it plays through almost like pro res on this iMac Pro this is in the better performance mode obviously but I can add effects colors layer stuff on top and it plays it back smoothly after maybe a split second of buffering which is awesome it makes video editing feel a lot better it feels easier in a weird way so from top to bottom performance has been great you know the bottom just being swapping around the UI and just web browsing in Safari and Chrome all the way up to the most demanding work my Mac Pro has absolutely been worth it for what I've put it through so we actually have this kind of a unscientific scale for measuring render times and videos out of Final Cut Pro we measure it in how many games of rocket league we can play before it's done exporting so finishing an 8k raw project transcoding and down to 4k on the trashcan Mac Pro for example would you know you hit the render button and then you head over to the ps4 boot it up fire up rocket league and we get in two to three full games of rocket league before you turn around and it's done rendering and we can upload we got the ten core I mic Pro in here and it was the same thing you'd hit render and then you go over and fire up the ps4 get to rocket League and we get like one full game but by the middle of the second game you turn around and this thing is done already the 18 core iMac pro this literally happened we hit render and then we went over the ps4 and booted it up and there was like a little software update for rocket League so we fired that up and before that even finished before what you think got to start playing this was done exporting the video but even when it all goes normally everything boots and you fire up rocket League will get in maybe one game before we turn around and it's done and ready to upload damn that is immensely satisfying because now you you actually know that only the most major most intense projects will actually take a long time to render and more normal videos that are just a couple minutes long won't take forever so if it isn't already clear by now I really like the new iMac Pro a lot more than I thought I would I am fully aware that yes you can build a PC with a bit more for a bit less you can customize a tower infinitely more of course as a matter of fact I still plan on moving on to a fully modular desktop Mac Pro when it eventually does come out but now that I'm Mac Pro exists as a product and I've used it I can comfortably recommend it to what I would consider graphics professionals and Final Cut editors alike it's the elegant clean super-powerful Space Gray all-in-one it's it's the iMac I always wanted at the end of the day this is my new full-time daily use and editing machine for everything for now obviously I'm willing to deal with the bigger bezels and the non upgradable display and the totally sealed internals because the performance is that good and at the end of the day that's what I'm paying for if you are a Final Cut Pro Editor as a professional this is worth it 100% no-brainer if you're a pro using some other suite of apps like maybe the Adobe suite or something else consider if you can get away with doing all the things you do now on a regular high-end iMac or not so if you're an Adobe like the premier suite or after effects maybe not this would definitely benefit or if you're in like Maya or Maxthon again you'll benefit a lot here but if you're in motion or maybe something else maybe not but my last piece of advice if if you're considering buying an iMac Pro and you're trying to think about where to save money where you should upgrade because it's not an upgradeable machine I would say go with the 10 core if you can only upgrade one thing that seems to be the sweet spot in terms of cores versus clock speed obviously it's not appealing to be stuck with the same amount of RAM forever like you are with an iMac Pro but I think the 64 gigs of the base model is actually enough for a lot of people and then of course if you can find the room to upgrade one more thing I would highly suggest the GPU upgrading to the Vegas 64 that's where a lot of the big improvements with performance with Final Cut Pro and just with moving around the OS and general swiping back and forth between spaces that's all been improved with that so all that being said I Mac Pro turns out to actually be a pretty good buy especially if you're in the category as I described all that also being said modular Mac Pro this has me a lot more excited for that either way that's been it let me know what you think thanks for watching talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm poppy HD here and welcome back to another video and the Tesla Model S video series the one that's shot entirely on smartphones this one's being shot on cameras only from iPhone 8 8 plus and iPhone 10 it's all the same sensors on the back but the front-facing camera stuff will be for my iPhone 10 I like the idea of including the front-facing camera in these more often because number one people like to see what the selfie camera looks like and number two so you can hear the audio quality that's something we also have to talk about in smart phone video cameras might also do a video in this series with the Google pixel - since I said that's a great smartphone camera but for now again all iPhone here and this is about the Tesla wrap so the most basic question that I had before I did this but that you may also have as well is why would you wrap a car in first place why even do that that's a good question and there's a couple valid good answers to that question so the thing about living in the northeast of the United States is the roads are not that nice lots of lots of gravel potholes rock chips a lot of salt in the wintertime so to protect their cars a lot of people will put what's called a clear bra on the front of the car where most of the damage happens so it's like a hardened layer on the front of the car protects the paint underneath but it looks like there's nothing there because it's clear a full body wrap on the other hand is more used for like restyling or completely changing changing the paint color you've seen what I've done with the brand skins on phones it's like that but a much larger surface over the whole car so you can do that to change the color of the car but that will also still add a little bit of a layer of protection to the paint underneath you can take it off whenever you want but there was those two things that put me over the edge to deciding to get my car wrapped most people don't get it wrapped after 25,000 miles I usually do it like right when they get the car but uh yeah that's what we're doing so that takes us to New York [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's what it looks like when it's done I personally I'm really happy with it I'm glad I did it you call it a bit of a space gray that we ended up going with technically the color is three M's satin dark grey but with the black on the chrome parts it kind of has this sort of a sleep under the radar Space Gray look I think those pretty sick there's only a couple specific things to keep in mind when wrapping this exact type of car number one is like I showed the door handles that is a specific part that you can wrap all the way down to the body which is really cool second is if you have auto pilot version two Hardware there's cameras right here don't put a wrap over that and there's also cameras up here I didn't wrap this part but don't wrap that either that will actually interfere with the auto pilot hardware but I didn't do that anyway and another minor thing is this big chrome piece here if you wrap the entire thing then folding and unfolding the mirrors a lot might scrape the top so you can disable folding mirrors and settings I did that just to keep it pristine so either way that is it that is what a Space Gray Tesla Model S looks like I think Apollo is kind of a perfect name for it now that we've seen the final result shout out to Matt from phenomenal vinyl I'll link their stuff below they do great work and obviously it turned out awesome so here in New York and you're doing a car wrap check them out and shop Tesla for making great cars also let me know what you guys think of the video quality this has been split between iPhone 10 and iPhone 8 plus but I'm gonna let you guys know in a little moniker at the bottom which stuff is shot with which phone it's all been at 4k 30fps I think it looks pretty darn good either way Toshi has the next one please [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys MTV HD here and this phone is already comeback player of the year for HTC for 2017 you already remember how poor the use of space and money the U ultra was just a couple months ago well less than six months later we get this at a very similar price and Cu 11 so from the outside you might not see that much of a difference you know same shiny blue body same thick rounded design same lack of a headphone jack it seems at first glance really similar because it is but as far as packing features and specs into this phone they cleaned up real nice so it's run right down the spec sheet you have Android 7.1.1 with the same HTC software on top so Snapdragon 835 with the audrina 544 gigs of ram a 3000 milliamp hour battery a 5.5 inch quad HD display 64 gigs of storage expandable via microSD and a 12 megapixel F 1.7 camera with oh is now specs aren't everything they don't tell the whole story but here they do a pretty good job if we head down that spec list again besides just of course the very impressive numbers this phone gets a lot of things right so with Android it's already on the latest version later than most phones it's 7.1.1 so that's a good sign and hopefully it gets updates plus it has all the same features HTC has decided to add on top of Android the snapdragon 835 chipset we already know has been awesome and other phones plus four gigs of ram so we're expecting and getting top-notch performance here best-in-class and it's absolutely one of the smoothest and most responsive Android phones out there right now I'm just a little less confident with that full-time smoothness lasting as long as something like from a stock Android phone but I'm still very impressed with how HTC's animations just glide for the most part they use really short simple animations and that's what you want to see this thing's flies it's got a 3000 milliamp hour battery not the biggest number in the world but we're seeing this thing up or form phones with bigger cells and laughs comfortably all day thanks optimization and that's super impressive considering the display and that display is a 5.5 inch 1440p LCD display pretty bright it's definitely not the brightest and it can struggle outdoors so I admit that but still high pixel density and great colors anytime you're not outside is going to get a thumbs up there storage is all there 64 gigs out of the box with a microSD card slot and a camera has been absolutely killing it it's a 12 megapixel sensor big wide-open F 1.7 aperture and optical image stabilization really matters and helps it a lot in low-light plus it has that same Snapdragon 835 as the 1 plus 5 so it's doing auto instant HDR and this thing has been taking some killer shots so HTC could stop right there they've already wiped the floor with their previous phone pretty much no reason to buy the you ultra anymore but I haven't even gotten to the headlining feature of this phone so the main major headlining feature of the you 11 is a custom shortcut that's mapped to squeezing the phone it's called edge sense so this is for real so instead of a custom button like an extra key or an edge display feature or anything like that HTC has crammed pressure sensors into the size of this phone specifically in the lower half on both sides so you can squeeze the phone to launch any app of your choice it can be the assistant or the camera or your Instagram or whatever you want really or you can have squeezed to take screenshots or toggle the flashlight or instantly start a voice recording or turn Wi-Fi hotspot on so it's completely custom it can do a lot of things the question is squeezing it is that a gimmick or is that legit well I think that all really will depend on how your hands wrap around this phone and how naturally you think it feels to just squeeze the phone in the middle of using it it can be kind of a weird thing depending on the way you hold the phone to squeeze it to launch something maybe a bit unnatural the phone doesn't flex at all it's metal but HTC actually does let you calibrate how hard you want to have to squeeze before it activates edgesense so there's 10 different pressure levels so naturally naturally you'd think you'd want to set it as low as possible so you don't have to grip the phone super hard just to launch something but the thing is if you set the squeeze value to low you can actually accidentally start triggering it when you're just taking up the phone off a table I had it happen to me a couple of times it can be too sensitive or even sometimes when you're just pulling out your pocket it's not the end of the world but it still does launch that stuff accidentally but if you set the squeeze level too high then you need like a two-handed vise grip on the phone just a squeeze it hard enough to trigger it and that's not natural at all so you kind of have to have it somewhere in the middle got to make sure you calibrate it right I found it best at around level four or five and I also tried a bunch of different grips not everyone holds the phone the same way but basically if you do squeeze just one side of the phone that will activate it too so you can squeeze one side or the other on the lower half that'll be fine so while it was definitely weird at first for me to squeeze the phone instead of just pressing a custom button or launching my app it did pretty quickly get pretty easy with that mid-level squeeze pressure the more I got into it the more I got used to it you can enable advanced mode which lets you set different shortcuts to a quick squeeze versus a long squeeze kind of like a single press versus a long press if it was a button and you can really dig down and customize a whole lot of functionality just in squeezing this phone so if you're into it this phone is already a pretty complete package and then you add the squeeze feature on top of all of that and it becomes really interesting I would buy and use this phone if I was more of a fan of HTC software but I'm not a more of a pure Android person but this it's not perfect this one is definitely not perfect there's still no headphone jack that's still a poor use of space it's still super shiny and very reflective and I think the anodized matte blue look around the edges would have looked way hotter for the entire back of the phone but we still have this mirror and the fingerprint reader is still annoyingly small and the bezels are still annoyingly big so it's not perfect but this is a way better phone than six months ago and I think they have the right idea trying to do something new with interaction but still trying to make it feel somewhat natural kind of just in the grip of while you're using the phone every day but that will of course all depend on whether you guys buy this phone or not on what you guys think so let me know what you think is this pull squeeze thing a gimmick will it be dead in a year or is it the next big thing is going to catch on your guess is as good as mine but feel free to leave a comment below and then come back to an ear and say if you're right or not so that's pretty much it thank you for watching autopsy has the next one pace [Music] 
hey what is up guys I'm cubby HD here and this is everything you need to know about the newest version of iOS iOS 11 so I've done these same types of videos for new versions of Android in the past and as you've noticed while they're probably usually a bigger numerical jump forward they're also usually lately more of minor additions and small incremental improvements which are so really good but not quite as exciting as a huge one so iOS 11 just got the big unveil and not gonna lie it's a pretty big update both in new features and as a visual refresh there's a lot of new stuff there too and as a bonus most of your iphones will probably get this iOS 11 update at some point same thing can't really be said I can't really say everyone's phone is going to get that Android 8.0 update so these are the top 5 new features in maybe the biggest iOS update yet iOS 11 so number 5 is the way it handles screenshots so screenshots in iOS were pretty simple before you take a simple screenshot and it goes to the gallery in iOS 11 you take a screenshot and it sort of floats down here to the corner where you can take action on it whenever you want you tap on it and then it expands and gives you the mark-up tools - circle stuff or highlight stuff or do whatever you want with that before sharing it which is pretty awesome and as a bonus you can take multiple screenshots so want to here you can move somewhere else and take another screenshot there and another one and they all show up at the bottom where you can click in and view them all mark them all up and then share them one at a time or all of them etc pretty useful now number four is the new app store in iOS 11 well it's the same app store but it got a huge visual refresh of course I think a lot of developers will appreciate this one because the today section right over at the Left which is the default upfront can seriously highlight some apps big time here these featured cards are pretty good looking and of course you can still browse the other categories like you normally could does a dedicated games section now so the new app store is definitely very different if you get used to it pretty quickly it's going to be fun to browse kind of the same way you did the old app store just in a prettier way number three is the Siri improvements so from the time I've gotten to spend with the new Siri in iOS 11 it's a lot faster and marginally more helpful so first off I can do live translations now so I want to ask it hey Siri how I say what's the weather in German in German what's the weather I believe you and did you see how fast you reacted to the hey Siri Q like it reacts again but it seemed to react within like a second and start processing everything into that and you can actually edit what you said so technically if you want to type to Siri you can modify your question and do that too so I think even just because of its new sound speed it may be worth three matching it or reak impairing it to the Google assistant like I did in that previous video and then maybe some other assistants as well but it is still invaded technically so I'll let that fully-baked I'm just glad to see they're still working on it so number two is the visual overhaul there are so many new little things that are visually different in iOS 11 so from the minor stuff like the bars at the top for your signal instead of the dots and a couple of new icons like the new calculator and the way that looks and the new app store icon and the new iTunes Store icon all that stuff is generally flatter and simpler and more cleaned up that's kind of the theme here and the new lock screen buttons are flatter as well so if you have a pin to unlock your lock screen those buttons are glassy and clean and the dock at the bottom of the home screen doesn't have any labels anymore so it looks a little bit cleaner there too they just did a lot of cleaning up and then there's a lot of new animation so check this out waking up the phone with the power button that's new unlocking is even smoother I think double tapping the multitasking brings in the cards from the left and I I always thought that scrolling was a little bit jittery but it's very smooth now and just the launching of apps has a slightly different animation as well there is of course the new font as well and iOS so a lot of things are generally tidier and cleaned up in iOS 11 and you notice that of course with the many hours you put into using it you'll notice way more stuff but just right off the bat looking pretty good and then the number one new feature in iOS 11 is I guess the pretty obvious one you probably saw it coming is the new control center now when I first saw it on stage at WWDC my initial reaction is you probably judge from my tweet was a little bit lukewarm it didn't look all that weird in fact I think it kind of looked a little goofy when I first saw it but since I've spent time with it in my actual hands and used it my opinion of it has changed about 180 degrees plus the old control center and iOS was a bit finicky anyway let's be real so this is a pretty welcome change plus all the improvements to it are pretty dope so this is the new control center it's full screen it's one screen and you might think this gap up here is a poor use of space but it's not because you can add toggles to it it is actually legitimately customizable of all the things for Apple to make custom I wouldn't think this would be it but this is awesome so you go into the settings and you can add subtract or rearrange as many of the toggles in whatever order you want so this is what it looks like the zero toggles added and this is what it looks like with all them on not that bad and then in the control center itself all the control is pretty intuitive I think so you tap any of the toggles to enable or disable them like before the rotation lock also has this nice little animation and the brightness and volume sliders are way easier you don't have to go sideways and actually swipe to the next screen plus you can 3d touch any toggle and get way finer control on a bigger scale sometimes with more options appearing which is awesome pretty good looking if you ask me and of course you see the circle down here at the bottom that's our new favorite control screen recording so you can now record your screen to a video without any cables necessary and even turn the microphone audio on and off which could be super useful in a ton of ways wink wink snapchat doesn't seem to know you're taking a screenshot wink wink it's probably gonna be fixed with an update but not yet wink wink so let's customizable control center while it may look a little bit weird at first I think is the biggest and best improvement to iOS so those are your top five and like I said there's a ton of other little minor stuff that didn't even make this list that is still greatly improved in iOS 11 you can now click and drag multiple icons from the home screen and put them together and move them all to a new page at the same time the new volume control and everything else about the default video player in Safari is way better there's a new do not disturb while driving mode that will probably honestly actually save lives there's a files app for looking through and organizing all the files on your device and there will be person-to-person payments through iMessage and Apple pay which isn't available yet in this version but still seems like it'll also be pretty useful so overall I'd say this is a pretty big update just FYI this is still a Developer Preview technically so more thing could be added or taken away in the future don't want to get too carried away but the full beta is coming later this month and I think the full final free release for all your iPhones will be coming in the fall so let me know what your favorite feature is what you're looking forward to for me it's recording things on the screen a lot that's pretty much it thank you for watching Tut together the next one [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys MP PhD here and alright it's the one we've all been waiting for appala held an event today at their new spaceship campus in the new Steve Jobs theatre to unveil a couple things that may or may not have leaked a little bit beforehand but that were excited to finally see in person so there's a couple Loki's smaller announcements before the big one which was first of all the new Apple TV which now supports 4k and HDR we also got to see the new Apple watch Series 3 which now has a cellular connection and can make and take phone calls so that's all good stuff and we appreciate that but but we were really there to see is the new iPhone and what we got was two new iPhones we got iPhone 8 and 8 plus and we got iPhone 10 not really sure what 9 would be maybe we're just skipping that all together that's cool too so iPhone 8 an 8 plus or a spec bump to the current iPhone 7 and 7 plus so nearly identical design but it now has the glass back to support Qi wireless charging which is awesome to see it has a true tone display but the same sizes and resolutions and a new a 11 Bionic chip inside and some slightly updated 12 megapixel cameras and it comes in a new rose gold color which i think is more of like a copper or a faded like sandblasted kind of look so bottom line this is definitely an improvement it's an upgrade over what we currently have but even though this is called iPhone 8 this is definitely more iPhone 7s let's not get it twisted but then came the one more thing and that was iPhone 10 don't you dare call it iPhone X it's iPhone 10 so this is the phone that looks like all the dummies and models I was showing you guys earlier this year and now seeing in person now those things those things are staggeringly accurate so this is my focus and the time we got to play with them hopefully I can do them justice on video so iPhone 10 like we expected has the larger 5.8 inch OLED display but in a smaller body and then the other iPhones thanks to the tiny bezels so you have the display going really close to the edges of the corners of the display curving at the edges and then has that notch in the middle of the top and my main question when playing with those early mock-ups was you know how would Apple handle the in the display with the rounded corners well now we have our answer you get your time on the left side of it and your signal and battery on the right side and then basically depending on what app you're in the clock and the signal and battery will turn black or white to contrast with the background so if you're in a dark app they turn white if you're in a white app like Apple music or something they turn black so basically you can always see them and then certain apps most of them actually will go fullscreen and fill the entire display around the knotch which is really cool it kind of looks like the essential phone with a much wider notch it gives you that immersive look but then other apps a couple may be watching a video sometimes you can ignore that top bar and just show a rectangular aspect ratio but I guess the goal here is definitely to be immersive so the whole point of the display filling up the whole front of the phone is that you can fill it any time possible so developers will be on that pretty quickly so anytime an app can go fullscreen it definitely will and then the other big question was there's no home button so how do you go home well the answer is it's a gesture now so to go home on the iPhone X it's no longer button you swipe up from the bottom of the phone so basically any time you see that bar at the bottom that represents the home swipe and you swipe up to go home and to get to the multitasking panel you swipe halfway up so you got to remember the difference between those two and then there are three different swipe down gestures on this phone ready swipe down from the middle for notifications swipe down from the right corner for a control center and swipe down in the middle of the home screen for search so basically all these operations you know interacting with the phone that are now done on the screen they're all gestures to make that possible you can even wake the display by just touching it once it's a lot to get used to but I'm willing to give it a shot it's kind of what you get yourself into when you remove all the buttons and then the big story with this phone is that the front-facing sensors in that big tab up at the top are really advanced and they kind of have to be because Apple has replaced touch ID and fingerprints with face ID and facial recognition so I didn't get to test this much at all yet but I definitely plan on it because apples made a big deal out of it and a lot of big claims about how reliable it needs to be you know million-to-one chance that someone else can get into it with something other than your face it needs to be really secure because it's literally replacing touch ID but that's something I'll have to test for the full review now the last major change on the outside is the new cameras so yes the vertical camera orientation is new and just like I always say I think it looks better here in real life than it did in the renders and the iPhone 10 is rocking to those two slightly updated 12 megapixel cameras again and this time they're both optically stabilized so the telephoto lens should do a bit better have a better success rate in low-light do better with video etc so obviously photo and video quality is another thing that I got a test when I get it but one thing you'll notice is Apple is really trying to give some more customization options in their portrait modes I think that's probably triggered by what Samsung just did with the note 8 so now when you open the portrait mode on the iPhone you will get these extra modes that will try to adjust the look of the lighting so you can go from natural light to studio light to contour light to even stage light which is really dramatic and these will also now work with the front-facing camera as well so you can do portrait mode with the front-facing camera and that's with all these camera effects on your face which you know is gonna take your selfie game to the next level at least I think so and yeah you can actually change all this stuff after you've taken the photo as well so that right there the front facing camera improvements I mean honestly is enough reason for some people to consider getting this phone hilariously enough so the front-facing camera will also work great with this new feature in iOS called an emojis which is literally animated emojis it's like seven or eight emojis with faces on them that move as you move so in case you're ever wondering what did the Fox say sorry that's it okay that's a terrible joke but yeah now an iMessage you can send short videos with your voice coming from an emoji it's really good at making people make weird faces not gonna lie yeah other than that the rest of what's new with the iPhone 10 is the same as what's new with iPhone 8 so spec bump to the a11 Bionic chip so should have buttery smooth performance the glass back of course enabling qi wireless charging which I'm excited to start seeing everywhere now the OLED display is also now true tone enabled and it's this this beautiful new gesture enabled fingerprint a slab of glass and metal that will start at a thousand bucks when it goes on sale in November now are there concerns with it yes absolutely there's no promotion display which isn't really a concern actually but the brightness of the OLED panel was in question when the specs were revealed nobody got to take this phone outside or anything but I can already tell my note 8 display got brighter for what it's worth and now the power button on the side is also a little bit bigger and you can hold it down to trigger Siri and I'm telling you right now that's gonna cause a lot of accidental Siri triggers in pockets around the world for the next year just on that out there but whatever I'm glad it's finally revealed the rumors are over and this is iPhone 10 of course both these phones the 10 and the 8 and 8 plus will go under the microscope for the full review in the next couple weeks and months so definitely subscribe are ready to be the first to see these phones when they come out but I am liking what I've seen so far I'm really into the 10 maybe you are - let me know in the comments below thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what's up guys I'm cabby HD here and remember next bit they made that one phone that one time well razor a gaming company bought next bit okay I guess if read can make a smart phone then pretty much anyone else can to and essentially this has been a really interesting year for those new smartphones and new smartphone companies so it's official this is the razor phone this is a smartphone built entirely around gaming all the hardware decisions all the specs all the design the form factor and features are all made with the idea of making gaming as good as possible but as it turns out a lot of those things also make for pretty great everyday use too first of all the build quality if you've ever seen a razer gaming laptop you've seen the matte black finish with the logo on it this is that same finish no the logo doesn't glow RGB or anything crazy like that but I kind of like the stealthy look even though it's kind of a big phone it's pretty fingerprint resistant and it kind of blends in and being all metal all the way around it has a sturdy literally rock-solid feel in the hand now one thing you may be thinking is hey it's 2017 why doesn't this new razor phone have edge to edge displays like we're getting used to on all these phones now well this phone has big bezels on purpose like I said their mindset is gaming and gaming trying to hold a phone with an edge-to-edge display can actually be kind of tough there's not a whole lot to rest your thumbs on so instead they're giving us massive stereo front-facing speakers flanking the display on either side it's a place to put your thumbs while gaming and they also happen to sound absolutely incredible loud full crisp and surprisingly little distortion actually at high volumes and you can even go into the sound settings and mess with Dolby Atmos settings so movie mode or music mode or whatever you want to do just to get the EQ just right so yeah right off the bat you can see the hardware is built around making the gaming experience great but that also means the rest of using a phone benefits too the only downside I really see what this hardware is the buttons which are left over from the next bit robbing the fingerprint reader and power button combo on one side is kind of cool but the cheap tiny plastic feeling volume buttons on the other side definitely aren't but let's talk about this display though shall we if I know anything about gaming it's that we want the highest framerate possible at all times and razer knows that so they've built as far as I know the first phone to come to the US with 120 Hertz display 120 frames per second all the time on an Android phone that's incredible remember the iPad pro the new iPad pro has that promotion display that I've raved about and really liked in the full review this has that all the time it's a 5.7 inch 2560 by 1440 IPS display IPS because it's not yet possible to do this high refresh rate with OLED yet and it checks all the normal box of being a pretty good display it's decently bright but pretty contrast II it's crispy and then it's just so liquid smooth everywhere I've never seen Android runs smoother than it does on a pixel on any other phone until this razor phone now out the box that will actually be set at a 90 Hertz refresh rate sort of striking a balance between battery life and super smoothness but of course I've bumped it right up to 120 Hertz right away but that's essentially just a max frame rate so when you're not really using the phone or it's just sitting on an image or on the settings page or something nothing's moving it drops to a lower frame rate to save battery and then it picks up immediately again when you start touching it it's really impressed with variable frame rate stuff now not every game will take full advantage of this right off the bat but again Razer nose gaming pretty well and I have connections there working with big game makers and developers to get all these popular games optimized for 120 Hertz so in the next couple weeks when I see those updates I'm definitely gonna be testing that so the rest of the specs since specs are pretty much the Holy Grail when it comes to gaming Snapdragon 835 adrenal 548 gigs of RAM 64 gigs of internal storage and a four thousand milliamp hour battery that's that last part is the most impressive I think you already know that using 120 Hertz display at full brightness with graphically intensive games at 1440p that will burn through battery pretty fast having a massive battery is great for gaming and for the rest of the phone also in talking to razer they seem pretty proud of their their cooling and if you know gaming you know how thermals are to performance and essentially what they've done is created heatsink design that uses the entire metal frame of this phone to cool the CPU which is really cool I'll leave a benchmark for good measure if you guys are curious about that but the bottom line is performance should also be really great for gaming and for real life and then last but not least the software experience on the razor phone is pretty close to stock Android with just a couple of added features I'm a pretty big fan of the strategy obviously as I've said before and it works well here no bloatware comes on this phone the stock launcher is actually Nova Launcher prime so you get a ton of customization right out the box and while it's launching with Android 7.1 they are promising an Android Oreo update first thing next year and quarter one so that's another advantage to being near stock the cameras on the song I don't expect that to be too much of a focus no pun intended because mostly they have nothing to do with gaming right now but for what it's worth there is a pair of 12 megapixel cameras on the back F 1.75 on the main camera F 2.6 on the secondary telephoto lens and it's rocking an 8 megapixel F 2.8 wide-angle front facing camera that you can see in the speaker grille definitely not slacking in the numbers Department but I'll say that's something that's got to be tested for the full review but I mean basically I'm I've just been really impressed that they thought of all this stuff to go at their first try at a smart phone and execute on it so well did you see the packaging this might be the best smartphone packaging of any phone in this price point maybe of any phone at all right now it's got some pretty sweet accessories they're all braided cables and individually packaged and with stickers the whole deal well done Razer has expandable storage has this this really nice subtle chamfer all the way around the display USB see fast charging no headphone jack but it does come with an adapter with a THX certified dec I don't know how much weight you want to put in the THX certified part but not bad no headphones though but overall my impressions aren't off the bat are pretty positive at this thing I don't think I was expecting it to be this good mostly because like I said it's been really hard or really interesting to get a new smartphone company off the ground and do things well but it seems to be worth noting that razor isn't a new company and they know what they do well already gaming and they've built this phone around that they have a following of people who have the same tastes this zone could be a really interesting buy for those people to use every day and it turns out this enthusiast phone might translate really well to regular everyday use because all those things are good for gaming are still good in the real world only one way to find out though and that's through testing so I'll begin to that for the full review make sure to subscribe if you haven't already to be among the first to see the full review when it comes out but that's minute for the first impressions either way thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey-ya one feel really old iPhone 10 was announced two days ago hey what is up guys I'm to be HD here and iPhone 10 doesn't come out until November a full month or two after iPhone 8 will come out in September and Apple do this on purpose they're getting two different news cycles out of two different new iPhones and they'll probably limit supply like they usually do you know how Apple is but that just means that all the info that we have about the purchase decision for this phone is just in the presentation we got onstage and the hands-on time we got with it afterwards so I think that's all my thoughts about this new phone into the first impressions video which you should go watch its new definitely check it out if you haven't already but from that video it spawned a whole new sea of much more interesting questions about the phone and these are the five most important of those so number one a big part of the story for this new iPhone was that they dropped touch ID for face ID facial recognition to unlock your phone and the big question is will it be just as good well first of all the actual facial recognition technology is supposed to be really good it shouldn't be fooled by a photo of you it shouldn't be fooled by people who kind of look like you it should work in the dark a new question I've seen though is if you actually have an identical twin that looks identical to you will that fool it and answers yeah probably will if your girlfriend holds your phone up to your face while you're sleeping to unlock it will that work no because it won't work when your eyes are closed you have to open your eyes to use face ID so apples got your back there assuming you sleep with your eyes closed and one weird thing that people have been talking about is it looked like face ID failed in the first ever demo that Apple gave to the public which is what they did on stage with that new iPhone let's take a look at exactly what happened iPhone 10 now unlocking it is as easy as looking at it and swiping up and you know to try that again oh-ho-ho let's go to back up here and get right in okay so since then Apple has actually come out with an official explanation for what happened that they gave to nine to five Mac which was this people were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time and didn't realize face ID was trying to authenticate their face after failing a number of times because they weren't Craig the iPhone did what was supposed to do which was required his passcode in other words face ID worked as it was designed to so that makes perfect sense you know how if you try the wrong fingerprint enough times in a row it will ask you for your password if you do like I don't know 8 10 times in a row it stops listening to the fingerprint and just says putting your PIN well apparently it's the same thing if you try the wrong face too many times in a row so to me that just raises a question if people just look at your phone randomly is that gonna count as a failed unlock attempt like well there just be tons maybe hundreds of failed to unlock attempts if you just leave your phone on a table for too long and people walk by and look at it does that count are we all gonna be like Craig Sam some kind of doesn't have this problem because when you raise the phone it doesn't wake up once you hit the power button and then it starts looking for your iris and it wakes with the iPhone you have raised to wake so as soon as you raise it up its awake and looking for a face it could a drained battery could it constantly be looking for the wrong faces will we constantly be putting in our pass codes that I don't know basically I'm just hoping that face ID has been worked on enough and refined enough that this won't be a problem because that's why Apple took so long to implement this so number two is reach ability and overall one handedness this is actually a really big overlooked part of the iPhone 10 in my original video I didn't mention it that much but something you might not notice is this is actually not a really easy one-handed phone when you compare it to the current iPhone 7 plus or eight plus it has a smaller body yes but it's still a larger display which means you will have to reach further no matter how small the bezels are well made me notice this was having the home button or the home swipe all the way at the bottom and the control center all the way up at the top now someone who uses control center a lot that is a serious stretch and I have big hands so I know right away from there that means it's gonna be a two-handed thing for a lot of people I didn't get to mention that in my original impressions video but obviously looking back at the clips you can tell even with big hands it's not easy so that's something a lot of people will be using this device with two hands so number three is anything about this phone actually new no I mean pretty much every single new feature we saw demoed onstage or highlighted or headlined about the iPhone 10 we've seen it before in some other the bezel is display with a notch at the top while the essential phone literally just did that but many other phones have been bezel is over the past couple years in their own ways qi wireless charging this has been around for a while as well just last year Galaxy Note 8 Galaxy s8 LG v 30 have all had wireless charging plus many others space unlock that was a key new feature back in the days of Android 4.0 plus the note 7 came out last year with iris scanning even augmented reality there have been entire phones built around that experience but the fact is that doesn't really matter I mean you've heard this before Apple is never really first to things but they tend to lag behind and then when it's well established they leap in and do it really well and it's well we're find that's what we're crossing our fingers for with face unlock that's what we're used to seeing with other Apple features that's what's happening again here and to be fair I don't really know how they can say they're wireless charging is better than others but I am really glad that it's finally here so number four this is a thousand-dollar phone is this thing gonna be worth the extra money well that depends on you that's also a question I've been getting about the Galaxy Note 8 the phone I'm reviewing right now it's about $1,000 the question is always is it worth the extra money over its closely related brother phone really I think the better question is I phone 10 what does it do for a thousand bucks that the cheaper new iPhone 8 doesn't do so first of all it's an OLED display so it'll have a higher contrast ratio more saturated colors pitch black blacks it supports HDR now it's just overall going to look better it's also a higher resolution as 24 36 by 1125 at 458 pixels per inch and you also now get to say you have a super Retina display and then of course the display is fullscreen edge to edge much smaller bezels no chin you also have optically stabilized both cameras instead of just one so the telephoto lens should have much better performance and low-light much better video stabilization etc but then everything else is exactly the same the specs the performance the ip67 rating wireless charging bluetooth 5.0 the selfie camera all that stuff is the same on both so what I'd say is you have to decide if that premium design and the fullscreen OLED display are worth it to you he might be surprised how many people say yes people we just want the best possible iPhone so the number five is the little stuff just a bunch of random little nagging questions like how do you take a screen shot if there's no home button anymore well I didn't get to try this at the event but I'm guessing it'll move to do it exactly the same way Android does which is power button and one of the volume buttons and if Siri is triggered by a long press of the power button then how do you turn the phone off that's usually a long press probably just a much longer press of the power button so Siri is like a two-second hold down to trigger it but actually holding it for five to eight seconds will get you that shutdown animation well having face ID as your unlock prevent you from being able to just like sneak your phone in class or like sneak use it during meetings yes but also you could just use your passcode like before we all know the Space Gray version of this thing will be a fingerprint magnet but will a case or a skin on the back of this phone interrupt wireless charging the answer is No so skins are really thin no problem you can put it on the pad it'll still work and qi wireless charging i've seen on many other phones people have used some pretty thick rubber cases and put them on wireless charging pads and they still work so it'll depend on the thickness of the case you choose but ideally you can try it in an Apple store and see for yourself so there you have it guys I think the bottom line for iPhone 10 is this is really one of those phones where you'll want to wait to see the reviews before you buy I mean it's already more expensive than the iPhone eight and it's coming out a little bit after the iPhone 8 as well so you'll have if you have that luxury of being able to wait to see if this is the phone you want to buy do that watch the reviews then you'll know it is a really beautiful phone at first glance and in the hand it'll probably be awesome but obviously looking at it and actually spending your money on it are two completely different things so that's what I hope to help you with with these videos but that's pretty much it feel free to share this one with anyone who you think might want to know more about the iPhone 10 and of course the impressions video which I'll link above or right below the like button but that's pretty much it thank you for watching talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] name one book guy ISM can be HD here and today was Apple's WWDC 2017 and there was a lot of stuff announced actually so those of you don't want to sit through a video of the entire three-hour keynote that we sat through this video is for you so there were actually six main announcements at WWDC this is a top five so that means one of them didn't make a list so TV OS hope you don't mind didn't make the top five but you know it's better now it's refreshed it's got a new UI it now supports Amazon Prime video but yes about it so it didn't make the top five but now I know about alright so the number five announcement is a new watch OS 4 for the Apple watch now I'm not a big SmartWatch person and I don't wear SmartWatch that often but if you do you will notice that there are quite a few little improvements to the Apple watch they added some watch faces so a kaleidoscope watch face which is fun a Toy Story couple of washed faces and also now a Serie watch face which shows a bunch of new information and there's some other minor stuff like being able to send data back and forth between compatible gym equipment and your watch Apple watch is a pretty popular Fitness watch so make sense but all together and all these little minor improvements there wasn't really anything massive that would make someone who wasn't considering it Smart Watch now think about getting an Apple watch it was more of a bunch of improvements that would make someone who already owned one and stopped wearing it try it again maybe stop collecting dust on a shelf in the corner maybe it'll do that for me actually I'll try it so number four is a new version of Mac OS so the current version we have on every Mac the latest version is Mac OS Sierra the latest version now which now has a new name is called Mac OS hi Sierra that's that's it there's no that's there's no joke just that's the new name I guess the reasoning is it's supposed to be an improvement on Sierra like a perfection of all these little new features that make it great so it's hi Sierra I don't know just ignore the name again the idea here is the same it's a refinement it has a bunch of minor improvements things like safari now auto blocks those annoying autoplay video ads and I also have intelligent ad tracking prevention to help you stop seeing the same ads over and over all over the web it also now has a couple new filters and the Photos app does a split view in the mail app you know little things like that the nerd in mail of the announcement of h.265 support which is a new yo codec which will now also be hardware accelerated and built into Final Cut Pro let's go and apples not gotten serious about supporting VR and external GPUs so for VR they're now supporting the unity and unreal engines natively in Mac OS and for external GPUs are now focused on harnessing the power of Thunderbolt 3 and making that a more viable solution for a lot of people so there's now actually a developer kit with a reference box external GPU enclosure with a Radeon pro graphics card inside that you can buy from Apple I kind of want to get either way that's Mac OS hi Sierra that's the real name public beta coming in late June and then free upgrade for all Mac users coming in the fall now number three home pod now this was the announcement that was probably the most hyped coming into this event we knew like a tiny bit of what might be shown but there's a whole lot more that just got revealed and it was a bit of a surprise so the home pod is this this balloon size like toaster small coaster size high 5 speaker that also has some assistant features built in on top I know I personally don't think home pod is that good of an idea for a name I would've gone with something probably more like Apple home or Siri home or Siri speakers or whatever something like that but you know iPod branding is so strong and it is a speaker first so they went with home pod so this thing has seven tweeters these horns all the way around the circumference around the base so omnidirectional audio there and then a four inch woofer firing upwards and Apple spent a lot of time hyping and talking about how good this thing is going to sound it is definitely a premium hi-fi speaker first it's gonna have some smart features I can detect wherever you put it if it's near a wall it will know to bounce certain sounds off of that wall and spread out certain other sounds away from the wall it's supposed to be an extremely smart speaker and they spend a lot of time with that on stage now you couldn't really listen to it that well in the demo area but I did get to listen to one in a quiet area and I actually compared it to an Amazon Alexa and a sono speaker I can tell you for sure it sounded a lot better than the Amazon Alexa speaker and it sounded decently better than the Sonos - it has a lot of bass obviously the smaller speakers are lacking and plenty of highs to but what struck me was the mids were actually really full and rounded and legible where they weren't in the Sonos obviously the Alexa was not forget at all so I got to get one at home obviously and listen to it with my own music and my own sounds and figure out if it's worth it in that category but assuming the Siri functionality on top of it actually works well where you know you can use voice controls to listen to music and ask it questions about the music and ask it for the weather and for calendar appointments and hopefully it's gotten better since that comparison I did with it versus Google now assuming all that stuff is true then it looks like it'll be a pretty decent product it's supposed to come out for $349 in December so it's got some time before that comes out and before it's actually a finalized product but that gives it time to get good and we'll be able to see if it's actually worth that price three and forty nine bucks sounds like a lot but when compared to other high-end speakers that's right in line and hopefully it does more thing I hopefully also by December that gives us time to know what we can do with it like right now they advertise it as just like a Siri and Apple music box but what if I don't use Siri up what if I use Google and and Google play music or Spotify or SoundCloud or any of those things what work is just a Bluetooth speaker I don't know that's to be seen all right so number two is iOS 11 and it's got a lot a lot of little feature is added to it and then a surprisingly big visual refresh they didn't even talk about it that much but it's a lot flatter and more colorful now but it's clean it's clean so the new features include things like iMessage in iCloud so now when you switch between phones it'll also bring all your eye messages across you can Apple pay between people so now if you want to pay someone who also has an iPhone you can use Apple pay inside iMessage to pay them so that kind of makes it tough on things like then though and PayPal is this catches on there's h.265 video support again and there's also now at high efficiency image format which supposedly take a lot less space on your phone with all the photos you take and there's no image processing to make better quality photos from the camera and Siri got a new voice it's a little bit smoother and there's also a male version to use the programs for the next two days sunny sunny sunny I love the scenery especially in China machine learning and the control center is redesigned now this definitely looked a little bit odd to me at first and I didn't like it right off the bat but it's definitely going to take some getting used to I think this is one of the things we're going to have to get used to because iOS Control Center right now on the iPhone is a little bit finicky already so it looks to be an improvement to that even if it's not pretty the response to 3d touch it's now no longer paginate it so all your controls are your fingertips and it appears to have more control than you did before so hopefully this is something that I can get used to even though it's not the prettiest thing there's also some improvements to other first party apps like Apple photos and to Apple maps it's got things like Lane Guidance now which is long overdue but why I really like iOS 11 and why it's so high on my list at number two is because of what it did for iPad for the long time the biggest weakness of iPads for me was for how much they claimed to be able to replace the PC and be a primary machine for so many people they could never really do even some of the most basic things that pcs could do at least in the multitasking and productivity side of things they were severely lacking but I look 11 on the iPad now has for example a full-on dock like the Mac so a bunch of apps that you can store down there you have not only just the split-screen multitasking but you can copy and paste things between them you now have a full files app so you have access to file system on the iPad there's new scanning feature in the Notes app or if you take notes with the Apple pencil it will actually be able to scan that as text and recognize all your handwriting and then be able to archive and search through that with spotlight which is amazing and Craig on stage went through all this stuff and even more insanely fast I could barely keep up I was scribbling it all down but bottom line was it actually made me reconsider how I think about the iPad as possibly really being a first computer or a primary device for a larger number of people that's obviously going to be its own full deep dive I have to get my hands on the new iPad and that's definitely going to be its own separate video plus possibly the most underrated announcement from all of today's stuff and no one seems to be talking about it as much as they should is that the new iPads the new iPad pro came out you know ten and a half inch display slightly slimmer bezels but it has a display that refreshes at 120 Hertz 60 frames per second constant every animation and you notice it if I carefully dropped it onstage like oh it will dynamically switch between refresh rates you know lower pressure rates for slower tasks like reading but also high refresh rates and you normally go up to 60 Hertz on most displays but this will be 120 Hertz not just for gaming but for like all the swiping through the UI and swiping through pages and typing and drawing with the Apple pencil it's extremely responsive it's like butter it's like water like pulling your hand across the UI it's hard for me to show because this is all thirty frames per second video but trust me when I say it's very different and people should be pretty excited about that so that takes it to number one the highest profile new announcement from today's WWDC which is new Macs and the new iMac press so there were Hardware refreshes announced throughout all of Apple's lineup you got new MacBooks new MacBook Pros new iMacs there's now also a baseline $13.99 4k iMac and Nu baseline $13.99 macbook pro 13 inch and all beyond max now have brighter displays 500 nits standard which is great now has fusion drives by default which is math but they also now have the SSD option is faster and can go up to 2 terabytes so I highly recommend that and they're all running KB Lake Intel chips on the latest gen AMD Radeon pro graphics cards faster RAM more RAM and they added 2 USB type-c Thunderbolt 3 ports on the back of the new iMacs it's about time so now it's looking like a real nice solid 2017 refresh and that out of nowhere out of literally nowhere we got out of left field this iMac pro this all space grey matte black workstation grade beast of an iMac that I mean out of nowhere up to 18 cores on the CPU side workstation grade Zeon's AMD Vega GPUs up to 128 gigs of ram and then up to a 4 terabyte SSD and tend to give it Ethernet on the back and 4 USB type-c Thunderbolt 3 ports where did this come from it even comes with a brand-new exclusive Space Gray Apple wireless keyboard with the number pad a Space Gray trackpad and a dark grey Magic Mouse all for this workhorse of an iMac with a 5k display so I got to look at it I got to admire it I got to even touch it obviously this thing has my attention that even kept the SD card slot on the back which is great it's looking like a pretty robust suite of i/o for a pro user and the numbers in this section making it look pretty damn tempting for a pro user for someone who uses Final Cut Pro this seems like a machine that would crush final cut prep but the more I think about it it actually seems like this is a really elaborate trap set by like Johnny eyes preying on content creators who Mac froze are on their last breath this thing is going to be starting at $5,000 in December so it's not like you can get one right now you actually have to wait a little time or pre-order and get one in a couple months but if you think about it who on earth is in the market for a super high-end all-in-one with workstation grade parts that's totally not upgradeable what is a total beast you know you know if you want to think of two completely different things you can't upgrade the RAM CPU drive GPU any of the things in this computer but it's going to be an absolute monster people who are buying multi-thousand dollar workstation grade computers like this don't buy IMAX unless you paint them space grey I don't know maybe I'm not learning my lessons from the 2013 trashcan Mac Pro but I really want an iMac Pro this thing looks absolutely sick I don't have people from the photos I've posted and reactions on Twitter have also been really into it too but either way let me know what you think are you into this I'm mic Pro or any of the other announcements from WWDC 2017 I'm certainly interested to hear your thoughts down on the comments section below right below that like button we're all talking about it all day and that's where we're getting out down there so that's pretty much it thank you for watching this recap video hopefully it suffice your needs for not watching a three-hour keynote you got all the info you need quickly to share this info for anyone else you might want to see it that's pretty much it thanks for watching tough together the next one peace [Music] 
hey what is the sky ISM kabhi HD here and Twitter is so important like it's a platform it's like YouTube it gives millions of people a voice I use Twitter all the time your favorite people probably use Twitter all the time it's like a cultural phenomenon if you think about it oh you're not perfect Twitter there are definitely things that I've mentioned that I would change about Twitter in the past in videos and in tweets so I can expand on those things and maybe you'll agree dear Twitter many of us would generally like to see things in chronological order now I know RSS is dead and it's a cool thing to do now to try to predict what the user wants to see and put it up at the top you know Facebook does it Instagram does everything's all out of order now Twitter is just so pure just like a straight-up timeline and Twitter is super time-sensitive probably the most time sensitive of any social media so that's part of the reason I use a third party Twitter app to guarantee that I read tweets in order as they happen it doesn't like seeing a one-day-old post right above a two-day-old post right above a 45 second old post so at least when I press that show less often button could you actually make it show that less often please dear Twitter stop hobbling third party app so for those who don't know Twitter has sort of a history of making it difficult to develop a good Twitter app there's something called a token limit which is essentially a sealing to how many people can use a certain Twitter app and once you reach that number of users the app becomes useless to new users you can't login it literally doesn't work so several apps I've used have fallen victim to this really all it takes is the app getting really popular it reaches that maximum number of users and instead and that's happened with stockin that's happened with Android apps Mac apps iOS apps it's just kind of a pain so if you're going to do this you would think Twitter oh they must be working really hard on their own stock Twitter app the first party Twitter app must be great again I don't think I've seen a good update to the Twitter for Mac app in months so Twitter either stop being so developer and user hostile at the same time by hobbling third party apps or make your first party apps way better or both dear Twitter bring back at replies like the way they were three or four months ago it was just better that way your Twitter let us edit tweets it is 2017 and we have a giant machine digging a tunnel under Los Angeles to build an actual Hyperloop but we still can add a tweet we have the Large Hadron Collider we found the god particle we still can edit tweet now look I know there's a lot of cases against editing tweets and I get them you know what if what if you post something really great and it gets a ton of retweets and then you edit it to something heinous and terrible if you tweet something nice at a celebrity and then they retweet it and you go edit your tweet to say something really mean and then everyone sees it maybe this guy's on to something what if you get a million retweets for a hilarious comment then a company pays you to edit the content of the tweet to essentially advertise on a million people's Twitter feeds then Twitter becomes oversaturated with sponsored tweets people get sick of it and Twitter loses all credibility you know what anything is possible so here is the case for editing tweets you post something on Twitter and within a little bit you notice it has a typo in it so you can edit the tweet within 60 seconds of posting it and any tweet that's been edited has a little indicator and Twitter will show the edit history of any edited tweet so you can click that little indicator it expands everyone can see it boom clean done so this solves pretty much any of the downsides that there may be to editing tweets you know people make typos they happen this is literally just to fix that the half-life of a tweet is really short like much shorter than a lot of other things on the internet and that's already really short so that means most of the activity happening on a tweet is happening within the first few minutes sometimes seconds that have been posted so deleting and rewriting a tweet sounds like it works great for maybe most tweets but the most time-sensitive ones where the most activity is happening really quick you know 45 seconds and 3000 retweets later you notice a word is misspelled do you delete that tweet like honestly do you delete it like that little edit button just for that would be so nice and look in case you still think tweet editing might be a bad thing let me introduce you to a couple other social networks that you may have heard of that also let you edit post Facebook there's an edit post button full time not just for typos so anyone can edit any post ever and if you share a post then someone edits it it will show up in your shared post reddit is actually a perfect example in the comments you have up to three minutes or until your comment gets three replies to edit that comment without getting an asterisk so you can edit a comment whenever but if it has engagement then it has an asterisk and everyone knows it's been edited Instagram you can edit everything caption tags whatever Google Plus same deal right here on YouTube you can literally edit YouTube videos to add a blur to a subject to correct something without deleting the video it saves that the same URL and the video is changed Vimeo you can literally replace entire video files at the same URL in Vimeo you can upload a completely different video with the same title and everything and it stays so editing tweets doesn't seem that insane anymore just saying I think you got this Twitter you got this so you have it at the end of the day I think it's pretty obvious that Twitter could do none of these things and they continue to make crazy decisions all the time but we all just keep using Twitter anyway I'm going to keep tweeting you can follow me if you want that's pretty obvious but these things would make us just so much happier on the Internet and that's never a bad thing that's pretty much it thank you for watching coffee has the next one please [Music] 
[Music] okay so what just happened here what you just watched is me unlocking a phone with my fingerprint through the glass in the display which is pretty dope that's like a glimpse into the future of smartphones so for all knocking our phones lately for the last couple years we've gotten used to fingerprint readers touch ID became that standard and now pretty much every phone that comes out has somewhere on it this fingerprint reader for unlocking it but lately they've gotten shoved to like the back of the phone or the sides or just off of the front entirely to accommodate these full screen phones the bezel iseven the infinity display now I personally love the idea of shrinking bezels and I can see that future smartphone being completely bezel is all screen but that does of course come with a couple sacrifices one of which being where do we move the fingerprint reader you can put it on the back like we've seen a lot you could put it in the power button on the sides there's a couple possibilities you can even go the Apple route and totally remove it iPhone 10 of course has no fingerprint reader and they've moved over to facial recognition or face ID but synaptics has been hard at work on their own solution and that's what you just saw working it's called clear ID but whatever the name doesn't really matter what matters is it's a fingerprint reader underneath the display glass so the sensor itself is called the FS 9500 it's made by synaptics and it's being shown in this vo phone called the X xx plus UD it's a pretty weird name but it's on sale and everything it's the first phone that has this fingerprint sensor in it so it does it work in the exact same way that all these previous fingerprint readers have in the past almost sort of so you enroll your fingerprint in the software just like any other fingerprint reader you can do more than one finger if you want and then you'll notice I didn't scan my finger until a little indicator light turns on this is kind of how you know it's ready to scan and where to put your finger and then this is literally an optical sensor so it's a CMOS sensor the same type you'd find in a camera or in the smartphone camera itself actually so in order for it to work number one it has to be an OLED display it'll only be found in phones with O LEDs and number two it has to be shining a light on your fingerprint for it to reflect back under the glass and read it so when I put my finger on that indicator which is basically a helper for guiding my finger to the right place you see a light shine for a second a sort of a pulse that's long enough for it to read the reflection of my fingerprint on that optical sensor it's literally lighting up my finger for the sensor to see so you go from the screen off to raising the phone which lights up the indicator touching your finger to it pulsing the light and reading the fingerprint reader plus this pretty slick animation all in under a second and a half which is not bad so all that's pretty impressive and it usually brings a couple main questions to mine number one being does it affect the performance of the screen in any way No and number two can you see it like in the display at all if you tilt it to the right angle can you see the sensor and that answer is yes if you look hard enough and while the screen is off at the right angle with just the right amount of light you can see the little rectangular sensor under the display but it's definitely so subtle that you wouldn't notice it if you weren't looking for it and of course once you turn the display on or light up any pixels around it even at the lowest brightness it's completely invisible so this is definitely really promising I was personally impressed trying it myself and I think the biggest thing obviously for it to improve is that speed what I mentioned it's all about a second to a second and a half to do everything it's faster than face ID but it's slower than touch ID it's think of it as like a first gen of a new touch ID and the feature though consider this because this is just the first generation of what we're looking at it doesn't just have to be in that exact area it's not limited to just a little rectangle in the middle that's just where we're expecting it so that's where they put it but it's unlimited in size it could be the bottom third of the phone it could be the bottom half of the phone it can even be the entire display all of the glass could have a huge CMOS sensor underneath it that reads your fingerprint so I could see a phone in the future where you just take it out your pocket and just touch it anywhere and you're in your unlocked because you touch the screen but anyone else trying it wouldn't get in that's kind of like the ideal biometric authentication it's what face ID want it to be so with that in mind this first generation being this good already is pretty promising and it means we're closer to our goal of course of a fully bezel this phone as far as phones we could see this in in the future we're not going to see this in a galaxy s 9 probably not going to see it for the xlg flagship or the note but maybe a little after that I mean the sensors out there now it's in this vivo phone but like I said it's a bit slow so you know the big manufacturer is the LG's and apples and Samsung's of the world aren't gonna put this first gen product in their phone but I could see even as early as next year us having a much better much more refined version of this store to show up in phones a lot more often so I'm looking forward to that let me know what you think is this what you're expecting in the future of the iPhone and the galaxies let me know until the next one thanks for watching talk to you later peace 
[Music] hey what is up guys MP PhD here and alright it's the one we've all been waiting for appala held an event today at their new spaceship campus in the new Steve Jobs theatre to unveil a couple things that may or may not have leaked a little bit beforehand but that were excited to finally see in person so there's a couple Loki's smaller announcements before the big one which was first of all the new Apple TV which now supports 4k and HDR we also got to see the new Apple watch Series 3 which now has a cellular connection and can make and take phone calls so that's all good stuff and we appreciate that but but we were really there to see is the new iPhone and what we got was two new iPhones we got iPhone 8 and 8 plus and we got iPhone 10 not really sure what 9 would be maybe we're just skipping that all together that's cool too so iPhone 8 an 8 plus or a spec bump to the current iPhone 7 and 7 plus so nearly identical design but it now has the glass back to support Qi wireless charging which is awesome to see it has a true tone display but the same sizes and resolutions and a new a 11 Bionic chip inside and some slightly updated 12 megapixel cameras and it comes in a new rose gold color which i think is more of like a copper or a faded like sandblasted kind of look so bottom line this is definitely an improvement it's an upgrade over what we currently have but even though this is called iPhone 8 this is definitely more iPhone 7s let's not get it twisted but then came the one more thing and that was iPhone 10 don't you dare call it iPhone X it's iPhone 10 so this is the phone that looks like all the dummies and models I was showing you guys earlier this year and now seeing in person now those things those things are staggeringly accurate so this is my focus and the time we got to play with them hopefully I can do them justice on video so iPhone 10 like we expected has the larger 5.8 inch OLED display but in a smaller body and then the other iPhones thanks to the tiny bezels so you have the display going really close to the edges of the corners of the display curving at the edges and then has that notch in the middle of the top and my main question when playing with those early mock-ups was you know how would Apple handle the in the display with the rounded corners well now we have our answer you get your time on the left side of it and your signal and battery on the right side and then basically depending on what app you're in the clock and the signal and battery will turn black or white to contrast with the background so if you're in a dark app they turn white if you're in a white app like Apple music or something they turn black so basically you can always see them and then certain apps most of them actually will go fullscreen and fill the entire display around the knotch which is really cool it kind of looks like the essential phone with a much wider notch it gives you that immersive look but then other apps a couple may be watching a video sometimes you can ignore that top bar and just show a rectangular aspect ratio but I guess the goal here is definitely to be immersive so the whole point of the display filling up the whole front of the phone is that you can fill it any time possible so developers will be on that pretty quickly so anytime an app can go fullscreen it definitely will and then the other big question was there's no home button so how do you go home well the answer is it's a gesture now so to go home on the iPhone X it's no longer button you swipe up from the bottom of the phone so basically any time you see that bar at the bottom that represents the home swipe and you swipe up to go home and to get to the multitasking panel you swipe halfway up so you got to remember the difference between those two and then there are three different swipe down gestures on this phone ready swipe down from the middle for notifications swipe down from the right corner for a control center and swipe down in the middle of the home screen for search so basically all these operations you know interacting with the phone that are now done on the screen they're all gestures to make that possible you can even wake the display by just touching it once it's a lot to get used to but I'm willing to give it a shot it's kind of what you get yourself into when you remove all the buttons and then the big story with this phone is that the front-facing sensors in that big tab up at the top are really advanced and they kind of have to be because Apple has replaced touch ID and fingerprints with face ID and facial recognition so I didn't get to test this much at all yet but I definitely plan on it because apples made a big deal out of it and a lot of big claims about how reliable it needs to be you know million-to-one chance that someone else can get into it with something other than your face it needs to be really secure because it's literally replacing touch ID but that's something I'll have to test for the full review now the last major change on the outside is the new cameras so yes the vertical camera orientation is new and just like I always say I think it looks better here in real life than it did in the renders and the iPhone 10 is rocking to those two slightly updated 12 megapixel cameras again and this time they're both optically stabilized so the telephoto lens should do a bit better have a better success rate in low-light do better with video etc so obviously photo and video quality is another thing that I got a test when I get it but one thing you'll notice is Apple is really trying to give some more customization options in their portrait modes I think that's probably triggered by what Samsung just did with the note 8 so now when you open the portrait mode on the iPhone you will get these extra modes that will try to adjust the look of the lighting so you can go from natural light to studio light to contour light to even stage light which is really dramatic and these will also now work with the front-facing camera as well so you can do portrait mode with the front-facing camera and that's with all these camera effects on your face which you know is gonna take your selfie game to the next level at least I think so and yeah you can actually change all this stuff after you've taken the photo as well so that right there the front facing camera improvements I mean honestly is enough reason for some people to consider getting this phone hilariously enough so the front-facing camera will also work great with this new feature in iOS called an emojis which is literally animated emojis it's like seven or eight emojis with faces on them that move as you move so in case you're ever wondering what did the Fox say sorry that's it okay that's a terrible joke but yeah now an iMessage you can send short videos with your voice coming from an emoji it's really good at making people make weird faces not gonna lie yeah other than that the rest of what's new with the iPhone 10 is the same as what's new with iPhone 8 so spec bump to the a11 Bionic chip so should have buttery smooth performance the glass back of course enabling qi wireless charging which I'm excited to start seeing everywhere now the OLED display is also now true tone enabled and it's this this beautiful new gesture enabled fingerprint a slab of glass and metal that will start at a thousand bucks when it goes on sale in November now are there concerns with it yes absolutely there's no promotion display which isn't really a concern actually but the brightness of the OLED panel was in question when the specs were revealed nobody got to take this phone outside or anything but I can already tell my note 8 display got brighter for what it's worth and now the power button on the side is also a little bit bigger and you can hold it down to trigger Siri and I'm telling you right now that's gonna cause a lot of accidental Siri triggers in pockets around the world for the next year just on that out there but whatever I'm glad it's finally revealed the rumors are over and this is iPhone 10 of course both these phones the 10 and the 8 and 8 plus will go under the microscope for the full review in the next couple weeks and months so definitely subscribe are ready to be the first to see these phones when they come out but I am liking what I've seen so far I'm really into the 10 maybe you are - let me know in the comments below thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys the next one peace [Music]

[Music] hey what is up guys MTV HD here and one of the new pieces of hardware we got at WWDC this year was this new iPad pro now it looks obviously really similar in pretty much every way to previous iPads so you know may or may not be worth it some minor improvements in here so asked on snapchat what you guys wanted to know and believe it or not a lot of you actually did want to see a review of the new Tenma half inch iPad so that's what we're doing so I've been using it for a little bit a little more than a week now and my previous tablet of choice for when I did use a tablet was the old twelve point nine inch huge iPad pro so what makes it look huge but I didn't really use it that often I use it occasionally for watching videos and general media consumption nothing too crazy like that but this tablet has me using tablets again a lot more often so does everything you need to know about this new iPad pro so first of all you've seen an iPad before you're already familiar with the way an iPad pro looks all-metal rectangular body pretty exceptionally well built you can see the antenna lines for the cellular version up top and a ten and a half inch display is slightly bigger but in a similar footprint to the old nine point seven inch iPad pro so we just have some thinner side bezels now which I really appreciate we're also pretty solid but also very lightweight tablet to hold in the hand so it's comfortable which is good because you're going to be holding it in your hands a lot so what is new well number one is inside is a pretty big speck bump an iPad was already pretty powerful but now you might have seen use new headlines that the new iPad pro is almost as powerful as a macbook pro in a way that's kind of true it's benchmarking really high in Geekbench thanks to the new a 10x fusion ship which has a 12 core GPU and is very very powerful and capable it also bumped up to four gigs of ram and just through daily use I haven't come across any apps or any experiences really that truly pushed this new iPad pro to its limits this thing crushes everything you throw at it and I've played a variety of games mess with productivity apps and gone with them for long periods of time open and this I've had barely bricks of sweat it really only just gets a little bit warm and that's it the most impressive part is actually how many apps that keeps in memory and for how long like there was more than one instance where I went back through the multitasking UI and found an app that was open yesterday and tap to open it and it was right there where I left off which is pretty dope so a 10x fusion ship is a monster plus four gigs of RAM is great and now also 64 gigs of storage is the baseline so that's a pretty solid spec bump if you ask me the battery is about the same apple claims 10 hours again I found that to be conservative but pretty accurate usually good for about two full days of youth off and more though because standby time is so good I just wish iPads had quick charging that's one thing but I feel like they are kind of missing from the hardware lightning wish it was USB see but not expecting it so whatever but these things charge kind of slow for a huge battery like this I wish they had quick charging will be a lot more convenient and then the camera yes technically the camera on the back got a big upgrade as well it's now running the same 12 megapixel s 1.8 camera system as the new iPhone 7 which doesn't mean I don't endorse using it as your main camera or anything but it's now super overkill in the quality department for some new features will support like document scanning where recognizes text and 3d surfaces and can scan documents into the Notes app super accurately and easily if you want to use the camera for other things sure I get it it'll be an awesome FaceTime camera it'll take 4k videos with optical image stabilization like it's an amazing camera it's the best camera in a tablet but you just won't see me using it anytime soon now the speakers in this tablet still pretty good actually great because they're the best speakers in any tablet also has the quad speakers this has them on all four sides so if you're gaming or if you're watching a video or listening to music the entire thing kind of vibrates as this echo chamber and if you put it on a table the table starts vibrating it's loud it's crisp it's clear great speakers also but the biggest upgrade and the absolute most impressive new feature of this iPad pro is the new display so this screen is better in every way possible it's brighter you know up to 600 nits max brightness and it has that anti-glare coating and everything so it's more visible and bright environments it supports the wide P three color gamut now so overall it can produce more vivid bright colors and still the same high resolution as before so 264 pixels per inch beyond 1440p resolution but the real killer is what Apple calls promotion and have to name it or wherever but essentially the new iPad display is now capable of a refresh rate up to 120 Hertz unlike every other app will display on every device ever which is going up to 60 Hertz so the native speed of everything that's happening on the display is now 60 frames per second instead of 30 frames per second and you can definitely tell so even in this 30 frames per second video which can't fully do it justice you can see how responsive iPad is it's literally twice as close to one-to-one movement with your finger or the stylus as it's ever been before and it's awesome that the GPU keeps up with everything and pretty much never drops any frames because this adds a whole layer of butter to the top of the OS you honestly have to go to an Apple store or like borrow someone's and try it for yourself you have to see it to notice it but once you do I guarantee you'll notice it and then promotion also means that it can dynamically switch the refresh rate to go back down lower when you're doing slower moving tasks like maybe reading a book scrolling through a webpage something slower looking through photos but you won't really notice because as soon as you start scrolling quickly again or as soon as you hit that home button and start swiping it's right back to 120 Hertz so this is awesome I really enjoyed using it and it did make a really big difference in my iPad usage experience all the in-app experiences are faster all the between app experiences are faster and I really hope this comes to the next iPhone but that in a nutshell is the new iPad pro it's not necessarily any more Pro of an iPad than previous ones still runs the same OS still has just better specs so it's kind of like iMac Pro versus iMac it's just better so it's funny with a lot of these videos where it ends up just being a speck bump and I'm reviewing a device that's clearly a speck bump from last year the question is usually well is it enough of a speck bump to justify getting it or would you kind of fade away to the competition that's making big leagues forward but it turns out with this tablet there really isn't anything close in terms of competition you might remember my last video about tablets which was our tablets dead and the honest answer is if it's not an iPad it kind of is I don't get me wrong there are some two and ones and some convertibles not really pure tablets but those things are better at getting work done and better for productivity things with actual physical keyboards and things like that but as far as just a pure tablet goes great battery life really great display best camera and any tablet best speakers I would say in any tablet arguably best build quality in any tablet best performance in any tablet so this thing is a really complete package so you have it iPad pro if you don't already have an iPad probably a good time to get one if you do already have an iPad know that this is a really solid spec bump and if that's what you're looking for then this will fill that void that's it thanks for watching thought together the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey where's up guys of kabhi HD here and welcome to the smartphone Awards 2017 so we do it here I mean there were a lot of phones released over the course of this year from different manufacturers in different styles and different price ranges with different features all kinds of stuff like that so this show is the best way to figure out the best of the best of what's come out in the last 12 months so the way we do it here is I'm going to declare in each category a winner and then also if there are some other good ones I can declare a second-place sort of a runner-up which is also really good in that category and then maybe some honorable mentions every single phone on this desk was released during 2017 that's actually that hasn't always been true about this show but that's true this year you can check me on that so there's a lot to choose from so let's get started so category number one is best big phone so phones keep getting bigger every year there's almost no way around that even with the shrinking bezels and I'm a big phone person not gonna life there's a regular version and a plus version of a phone I'm taking the plus I'm taking the XL or the bigger one and so these are gonna be the best phones that take the most advantage of having a large amount of space so big display big battery big features etc and the winner for that category for 2017 is gonna be Samsung Galaxy Note 8 [Music] the note 8 does it all and in spent a kind of a staple big phone for a while in their lineup the biggest reason I usually want a big phone is for a big screen notate has that it's the best display on any phone has a pretty big battery it has big optically stabilized dual cameras it has a big stylus for those who are into that big specs and of course big software features to take advantage of being such a large phone I still remember when the first Galaxy Note came out like the first two were such a staple in like that tech on YouTube community cuz that was like the phone that had everything you would take that phone to CES cuz it had the longest battery life and a replaceable battery this is still that slight step above Galaxy s8 in their lineup it kind of always will be that way and holds a special place in my heart for that reason but there is a runner up and that came from actually a pretty new player in the space I mean it's as new as you can get they exist in the space for the first time this year and they happen to do a really good job of taking advantage of so much space in a phone and that's the razor phone the razor phone is an awesome use of being big in a world of these super thin bezels this phone is bigger than normal and shamelessly so it keeps the huge bezels and inside them it fits these huge speakers which are pretty much best-in-class and it also happens to have a huge 4000 milliamp hour battery it doesn't have quite as many you know big screen features as say a samsung phone it doesn't have as much split-screen multitasking fun it doesn't have a stylus and all that stuff but it's just a good use of space in the hardware department for being such a big phone I really like it so the next category is best compact phone and this is a rare breed not gonna lie like the compact flagship smartphone is much less popular just because phones are still getting that much bigger so the definition of a compact phone has changed in size especially but for me the definition is still going to be one that keeps as many flagship features as possible in a small package and so for that reason the winner of this category is iPhone 8 [Music] iPhone 8 is a legit flagship to a lot of people it has all the highest end specs and almost every single feature of the iPhone 8 plus except for the dual cameras and it's in the smallest package so it's easily the most compact if you're a small hands person if you want the lightest smallest device possible iPhone 8 is gonna do that for you it kind of got overshadowed by the slightly bigger iPhone 10 and even bigger iPhone 8 plus but if you're looking for obviously a great camera a pretty solid IPS display if you're still into the fingerprint reader on the front touch ID is still extremely fast I mean this thing is complete so that's getting the best compact smartphone but if you're looking for a runner-up in that category I think it's a no-brainer to give that to a slightly bigger phone but still one that keeps all the flagship features of its Big Brother and that would be the pixel 2 if their biggest complaint is that you don't get the better camera of the iPhone 8 plus on the iPhone 8 pixel 2 has the exact same camera as pixel 2 XL it's a little bit boxy and has a little bit bigger bezels but you still get front-facing speakers you still get a great display and you still get all the same specs and features as you do on the bigger phone so this is another smaller version of a phone that does all the same things as its bigger brother it might even have a better screen than the XL also another honorable mention shout out to the galaxy s 8 for being by far the best designed compact phone the s8 plus is its bigger brother but you still get the infinity display and of course all the same specs as the s8 plus in this smaller phone so again if you're in a smaller phones all the features of the bigger brother will come from those so the next category is best camera and this was a good one this year obviously everyone here on this desk has a camera on the back and most people take most of the photos in their life with their smartphone camera and the winner for this year this category actually took such good photos and videos that it spoiled me to the point where I didn't want to use some other phones this year because the cameras just didn't stack up it was that good they've always been good but this year was particularly great the winner for best camera in a smartphone is Google pixel 2 [Music] this was a pretty easy one for me the photos and videos from this guy but particularly the photos are ridiculous from pixel to and pixel to excel awesome detail dynamic range sharpness fast focus image stabilization low-light performance as it's pretty much great at everything and it's just super easy to use and on top of all that the portrait mode is incredible with one camera so again it does the same thing in the pixel 2 &amp; 2 XL I'm gonna link all the reviews of all the phones I talked about in the description below that like button so if you want to see all the sample photos and you hear me rave in detail about each one then you can check that out but for now just know that pixel 2 takes the best photos you can get on a smartphone my runner-up is one that I think actually does better video just because 240 frames per second slow motion high quality 1080p video is severely underrated and that comes from the dual optical image stabilized camera wildung iPhone 10 not a lot of cameras are capable of what this thing is in the video Department and it fits in your pocket which is awesome but I think most importantly despite its exposure problems iPhone 10 photos have the best colors like if I could combine the pixel twos image processing and dynamic range and portrait mode and sharpness and detail and all that with the iPhones colors I totally would so the next one is best budget phone so this is gonna be the one that gives you the most smart phone for the least amount of money that's what it's all about you can ask people everyone has a different definition of budget if you say what's the best cheap phone cheap means something different to everyone but either way you look at it this winner has the best smartphone bang for the buck the most phone for the least money and that one is the 1 + 5 t [Music] that's because for the price this thing really is a flagship from the design the all-metal build the thin bezels the dual cameras the high-end specs eight gigs of ram it's not skimping anywhere it even keeps the headphone jack but in a year where we've seen phones costing seven eight nine hundred even a thousand bucks the one plus 5t does almost everything they all do and it starts at 499 lat is serious bang for the buck and that's why it wins the award this year now a lot of people might be thinking wait a second 500 bucks isn't quite what I would consider budget and I agree again cheap is different for everyone so I'll give my runner up to Moto G 5 Plus which is still the best phone you could get under 300 bucks in fact it's probably closer to 200 bucks now we reviewed it so long ago earlier this year but it's still the best bang for the buck under that price range and also give an honorable mention to Huawei honor 7x all these phones are doing great things for the money and I'll repeat what I have said before good phones are getting cheap well not so much we still get thousand-dollar flagships but cheap phones aren't getting really good so the next category is best battery life this is pretty simple right we just look for the ones that have the longest lasting battery that will last an entire day us heavy users look for long screen on time and we look for being able to take it off the charger early in the morning and not touch it again until late that night with no issues and the winner for that category has been the razor phone [Music] so another award for the new comer in 2017 razor phone made a great use of that space that big chassis and that huge inside they put a four thousand milliamp hour battery in here and it showed it lasts a really long time they built this phone around gaming so a lot of their decisions were around gaming eight gigs of RAM because it'll make gaming better big speakers because it'll make gaming better huge battery because gaming is really battery intensive but a lot of those things just make a better phone so if you're not gaming all the time razor phone still has a huge battery which means it lasts almost forever so that's why I won the award this year I'll leave the full review link below if you want to check that out but also give some runner-ups or sort of an honorable mention to two phones that lasted a really long time one is pixel to excel the OLED display stock Android and huge battery did great for it lasted all day for me pretty much every time and also my iPhone 8 plus is still the king of standby time it's a huge battery and a smaller display because of those big old bezels but that just means it lasts you all day and if you use an iPhone you kind of know already this thing is really good so this next category is my design award and this is one that's actually kind of evolved over the years because it used to just be the one I had the craziest design it used to be the best built phone this year in 2017 is going to be the one that I think has the best combo of design and build and that's going to go to another newcomer for this year and it's the essential phone [Music] this was one of my favorite and most polarizing phones of the year I really couldn't recommend it because when I first came out of fell short and a couple other categories like the camera and battery life for the price that we're trying to charge but now that they've dropped the price so much I really think this is one of the best looking phones to come out and it's worth the price again it's a ceramic back titanium sides and there's all different ways to handle super thin bezels but this not really drew on me and when you actually look back at using the phone I got used to it really quick I liked it a lot and I think overall this one's the design award so now that I've ruffled your feathers with the notch I do have some runner ups also and I'm gonna give that to the iPhone 10 again for getting rid of the home button the iPhone had huge forehead and chin bezels for so long that even if there is a notch I again got used to it really quickly and I think getting rid of the home button was a major step for it so that gets the the runner-up award and also give it to Galaxy s8 and si plus the super clean design from the review you've already seen but the overhanging glass on each side it's not everybody's favorite because of the curved edges and some potential accidental screen touches but I think it's super clean and it's hard to argue it just how good it looks being this class sandwich and the super sleek design so that's my design award so this next award is for the biggest bust of the year there's a bust every year I hate giving out this word because you want to be positive and you want to focus on the best of the best because there's so much good but some just stick out like a sore thumb and and just are not a good use of space for some particular reason so the bust of the year for 2017 as you probably saw it coming is the HTC u ultra [Music] ya know this this one takes the cake worst phone of the year for 2017 just not a lot good to say about this one I don't want to spend a ton of time on it if you watch the review on it or if you've seen the title you know exactly how I feel so I don't want to spend a ton of time on that but if we move on quickly to the next award to chill out the HTC elevate comments section this is the biggest comeback of the year it's the most improved player it's just sometimes you have to fall down hard to take your next biggest step up and I think that's exactly what HTC did this year because then HTC u11 came out and it turned out to be great [Music] yeah this thing had a lot more going for it it has obviously the sweet color-changing back which I'm a big fan of but just generally was a really good phone had a much better camera it didn't add a headphone jack but had speaker's had a really nice display and a nice software experience from HTC and these phones would also introduce us to that squeeze feature with the pressure-sensitive sides to launch something that we would later see in the pixel 2 and to excel so that was really cool to see and then even later in this year HTC came out with the HTC u 11 plus which I don't have because it never came to the US but that wasn't even more complete more impressive phone that thing had an even better camera it had an even better design to see through back that I think looked really cool so yeah HTC's year kind of went something like that but then had a thing like that they kind of had come back Player of the Year written on their forehead from the beginning and so that brings us to the MVP and the finale the best phone of the year to come out in 2017 and there I mean there can only be one but there were so many great phones that came out over the past 365 days you know pixel 2 had its highlights LGV 30 probably the most underrated we had 1 + 5 t doing big things for low prices even huawei mate 10 Pro flying on the radar iPhone 10 making waves so many big new phone names coming out razor phone essential phones so if we didn't expect to see but there's only one MVP there's only one most complete phone of the year and my winner for that is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 [Music] this is actually the most complete smartphone that came out this year honestly the biggest problem I have with this design I know there's a lot of glass phones out right now is the placement of the fingerprint reader and that is a nitpick for a lot of people everything else about this it's waterproof it keeps the headphone jack it has a stylus it has a huge battery it has great software experience it has the best screen on any phone it has dual cameras both optically image stabilized it has big specs lots of RAM fast processor loud cameras expandable storage the dimension is water-resistant already I mean this thing is super complete it is expensive and I think a lot of people have trouble spending a thousand dollars on a phone but if you were to you would want it to be as complete as the note 8 so I actually don't have a problem with its price this probably could have also technically won Comeback Player of the Year considering what happened to the Galaxy Note 7 which was bust of the year for exploding at everyone's pockets the bezels is thin and the overall design it's kind of what a lot of people are looking up to again if Samsung could move that finger print reader down a little bit I would be really happy but Galaxy Note 8 is the MVP and have some runner-ups to my first runner-up for MVP is gonna be the pixel 2 XL this phone again also has a lot going for it it has the best camera in any phone in my experience it has the best software and the fastest updates of course already to Android 8.1 the finger parameters in the right place it doesn't have the headphone jack but it has great front-facing speakers the display on the XL is probably the only one that really kept it holding back but this is the phone that I have used for the longest time this year that my SIM card has been in as my daily driver for a couple of months I keep coming back to it so that's why I give the first runner-up to the pixel 2 and then my honorable mention is gonna go to iPhone 10 just for finally shifting what it means to be an iPhone because honestly be an iPhone in my mind before this thing came out meant not having modern design and not having thin bezels on the top of the bottom and has changes that this has a modern design and thin bezels now it's also paved the way for a bunch of other thousand-dollar phones to come out now that this is so damn expensive but I like that it's paved the way for future iPhones to also be modern and clean and admirable in the design department the way they haven't been so that's a good start so that's it that's the best of what's come out this year in 2017 not a bad year if you ask me as far as what came out and whether you're a person that has you know a preference for low budget phones or if you like big phones or compact phones or if you need an all-day battery whatever you're into whatever you need from a smart phone you can probably get it and it you'd be hard-pressed going wrong with something on this table right now more phone cameras got so good that I just I'm more encouraged than ever to take photos with my pixel to the display has got so amazing Galaxy Note 8 looks like a freaking movie theater if you're looking at it in the dark but there's so many good things to focus on that it's just fun to look back at the stuff that came out over the year and that's part of why this series is so fun but yeah that's pretty much it if you got someone you know that's looking to buy a phone around this holiday season you should probably send in this video but until then until the next one thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] you know the ones you know them days you want things to fall in place while keeping up with his pace you're trying to keep a smile on that face - no Raven on the wheat daily off that Street and into this way Pham hey what is this guys I'm kabhi HD here and an mkbhd merch store this has never really been a thing in the past we've had a couple things like a single limited edition t-shirt on t spring or some small fun creative projects and those are always really exciting but I've always wanted something a little more permanent a little more developing a little more interactive so this is gonna be that taking it to the next level this is something we haven't done before so this is something that's been brewing for a while you might have seen some of it teased in the backgrounds of some videos kind of showing up here and there but I figured what better way to launch this whole thing then by reviewing my own merch the logo be classic not everyone will know but you'll know so the shirt itself is actually really soft and this isn't something that I had much control over with previous shirts that I've done but this is really nice material shirt like how can something so crispy be so soft so the material is 50% polyester 25% cotton 25% rayon that's why it's so soft and also I'm six-three I'm wearing the large right now you can probably get away with the medium if you're my size also because it's not going to shrink much it's definitely a slim fit it's like a more modern fit and design for a t-shirt and there's also different designs or different fits for the men's versus women's so that's cool and it's also this is a water-based ink so what that means is instead of like a normal cheap screen print design this isn't going to crack and scrape off over time it's actually gonna get softer and still look this good but the color scheme the design the logo obviously I'm a pretty big fan of [Music] at a chevron this is another graphic staple of the channel because obviously it's in the channel banner but I'm no fashion expert but this is also a pretty flattering like a a sleek sort of modern image I think it's a couple different shades of red as you can see it's a warm design and I feel like it can also be pretty good for a couple other different color combos also I don't know if you picked up on this but every single one of these shirts at the bottom down here has this hem tag so every single shirt has a hem tag with the logo on the outside and established 2008 on the other side that is definitely a pretty nice touch I'm glad we well-established 2008 this is another pretty clean design again pretty simple pretty soft again it's got the hem tag again it's and this is actually I like it more than I thought I would wearing it it looks pretty dope another fun fact is all the shirts on the inside usually you have like a tag like a paper tag sort of cuts you or is scratching you on the back of the neck these shirts don't have an actual physical tag instead this one's got a little printed tag on the inside with the size and the company's logos and a little message for her ever buys it so definitely pretty clean and soft all the way around they've obviously been many milestones in a history of the channel the hundredth video I ever made the hundredth subscriber video I made update 1.0 about four years ago today was when the channel first passed 1 million subscribers which is huge but I think the day that this channel was first signed up the day was created on YouTube is the biggest one [Music] matte-black everything this one this one is legit this is also the only shirt of the collection that is 100% cotton so it may shrink a little bit more but that's so that this is an actually matte black shirt which is dope maybe a little bit tough for pet owners I could see that being a bit of a problem but overall the design clearly thought-out well there are only so many truths in life and one of them is that every device should have some sort of a stealthy or space gray or matte black option so that's why we made this and also a hemp tag is probably the most colorful part of this one that's right it's not just t-shirts there's a hat as part of the collection as well this one is it's like a soft fabric on the outside it's a snap back so one size fits most and this actually isn't the only color there's a little green in the brim there but there's also going to be a heather gray version and a navy blue version so black isn't your style then you can get those colors as well but if you're a hat person there it is but she's never seen me with a hat on I've probably not since the Gulf videos on the beginning of my channel have I had a hat on in a video so that's it that's the core that's what we're starting with right now it is all live at shop mkbhd calm pretty glad we get that URL as well and the goal this isn't just to open a merch store and then you guys get stuff and it ends there that's the way a lot of things go but this is more kind of like the channel like an exchange so we have this sort of a core collection of the beginning of things but then as you guys come up with ideas for maybe not just new designs but new pieces or things you want to get and you leave them in the comments that's kind of like the way it's contributed to the videos in the way I make videos that'll add to the merch store as well so we'll be adding things over time to what we've established today and I also want to give a huge shout out to cotton Bureau for making this entire thing possible so this is a cotton Bureau site they're the ones that make the beautiful web design possible for that URL they're the ones that make the supersoft shirts and that top-notch quality possible-- and are the ones that make the worldwide shipping of these being available internationally possible so they're taking care of shipping and getting it to you guys as quickly as possible now though a shipping is gonna be starting off it's gonna be going out in waves so if you want to get your order in by the first wave and get your stuff in that first wave you have to order by February 27th by 8:00 p.m. Eastern that's when the first wave ends everything goes through to production and gets shipped so the hype is real for that I can't wait to see you guys rocking these but until the next one thank you for watching oh and uh seems like a good time to introduce the next milestone for the mkbhd channel introducing the MQB HD video team thanks for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm poppy HD here its 2017 and this is a new blackberry for real this is the blackberry key 1 and it's definitely very much still a blackberry but it's also really well optimised and updated for 2017 this is a tough one because I am definitely not in the target demographic to buy a phone like this this is the phones people who either really really want the physical keyboard or people who really really want a blackberry I am neither of those people but I gave it a shot anyway so BlackBerry has tried all kinds of interesting stuff in recent years with their hardware kind of cuz they have to they tried hiding the keyboard they tried a square phone with a colored keyboard right underneath the square and this one definitely brings it back to classic blackberry this is 1620 by 1080 display up top and a permanent keyboard down there at the bottom available at all times but in tons of ways as you can see it's very well updated for 2017 it's this all-metal build it's really built like a tank tolerances are tight as evenly weighted and the glass was rounded around the edges for this near seamless feel on the hand like the Galaxy s8 and it even has the antenna bands on the outside of the metal frame like the iPhone and every single button and the camera ring are chamfered so just build quality wise it's actually top-notch it's not water-resistant unfortunately but it's definitely more drop resistant than your other top shell flagships like galaxy s 8 or like LG g6 and also this display isn't exactly top-notch I mean I didn't have any scaling issues but it is 1080p and a quad HD world and it also struggles in the brightness Department but when you consider the price this fits right in line with a pretty nice piece of 2017 smartphone hardware it also has USB type-c with fast charging thumbs up there very 2017 and this mid back is this I guess it would be a soft touch plastic with just a little bit of texture I really like this it's a reminder that the slick all glass back is not the only way to enable wireless charging you can do it this way to accept this phone doesn't have wireless charging now I know Jerry rigged everything but I think if phone nine millimeters thick they probably could have found space for that you know what I'm going to say already probably poor use of space but seriously aside from the water resistance and wireless charging this phone is built great in 2017 that is a good sign I think the button placement is a little bit weird or at least take some getting used to instead of the normal power button on the right hand side it actually has the power button on the left hand side and then where the power button used to be is another button called a convenience button and it's like in exactly where the power button usually is but once you get used to this backwardness it's actually a pretty nice feature it lets you map to literally launch any application or shortcut on the whole phone I set mine to launch the Google assistant and it lets me because it's a feature samsung so it's anyone actually thinking about buying this blackberry here's how it does on my five pillars of a great smart phone in a quick snapshot not spectacular but not bad for a $550 smart phone it kind of falls in the upper mid tier but for most people not bad isn't really selling anybody on this phone it really has to have some sort of over-the-top feature some sort of specialty that puts it over the edge and I really think this blackberries over the top specialty feature is customization it started with the remappable convenience button but it goes way further thanks to having a physical keyboard when you're at the home screen you can literally map any of the letters on the keyboard to be their own custom launcher shortcut same thing you can pick any app or any shortcut both for a short press or a long press of that key so each button can launch two different things when you first press an unassigned button it'll give you a suggestion for some apps that start with that letter but of course it's completely up to you and that just makes things so much faster and easier to launch you can have a totally clean home screen so I'm up to short press of the Y key for example to just launch the YouTube app right away so it only takes me a matter of seconds to get into any app I frequently use thanks to these shortcuts in the keyboard and then there are other advantages to having a physical keyboard as well besides just being slightly quicker than a virtual one for example you can do actual keyboard shortcuts like control C and control V and this keyboard also doubles as a trackpad as a sort of a scroll wheel so you can scroll through apps and web pages without getting your finger in the way of the content which is awesome if you can scroll super deep into instagram using this method with no risk of accidental double taps so you're welcome you just got to be careful not to select too hard or you can accidentally hit the home button right above the keyboard I definitely did this a couple times but this is why I find it most useful in landscape mode so keyboard scrolling is definitely awesome here and then when you're typing of course aside from all the keyboard shortcuts you can use swiping up will do autocomplete for the word you're typing helps with some longer words I think and then you can slide backwards across the keyboard to delete your last word this was definitely more useful because we make mistakes all the time when typing and then of course as we probably noticed by now the spacebar also doubles as the singer print reader so you can unlock your phone super quick with just a touch of the spacebar the biggest button on the whole front of the phone very nice integration good use of space there well done so overall this keyboard gets a nod from me again I'm still I'm not in the target demographic for someone who's going to be using a phone with the keyboard like this very much but I could see how someone could get used to it it has a lot of tricks up its sleeve I do wish it had a dedicated number row at the top and I wish the keys were a little bit bigger for my hands but it doesn't and they aren't that's too bad for me alright so question what's the difference between an Android phone with a keyboard and a blackberry key one so software and here on this phone you have a healthy mix of 2017 new Android smartphone and throwback blackberry features that you may or may not find incredibly valuable blackberry hub for example is the same as last year it gathers all your information into one place from texts to emails to Instagram and Twitter basically all your notifications and just piles them into one place so you don't have to wander around checking things and then it lets you dismiss or snooze them with super fine control definitely useful for some but for me I just prefer the regular Android Notification Center bbm you either use it or you don't and then all the BlackBerry DTEC features they're very valuable and work great but some may completely ignore it like they ignore other pre-installed Android security apps on other phones and then all the shortcuts again this keeps with the theme of blackberry giving instant access to everything and tons of customization here all these shortcuts in the BlackBerry launcher give you one touch access to all kinds of little gray things like checking battery stats or starting to compose a new text or email in your app of choice pretty awesome stuff over here I like this theme and then also on the launch or any app that has a widget you can view that widget by swiping on their icon so I can tell which ones have that by which ones have the three dots on the home screen and when you swipe it it just reveals the widget this isn't new it's definitely in some other phones and in some third-party launchers but it's pretty damn convenient if you ask me so there's a lot of cool stuff here and a lot of awesome customization features packed in that I really like but I can still say that at the end of the day it doesn't quite outweigh the cons for me of having so much of your screen chopped off by a physical keyboard that I probably only use very much but at the end of the day this is the best smartphone with the physical keyboard and this is the best BlackBerry ever made so how bad do you want a physical keyboard or a blackberry it's on you let me know thanks for watching I'll talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm cabby HD here and this is the week of CES 2018 me out here it is raining hi if you've never been to CES it's definitely a lot there is tech everywhere people everywhere and just overall a lot going on here in Las Vegas but among all that stuff there is some dope tech buried in there and that's kind of just been my mission this week to find it so one of the most buzz worthy news making things we've seen this year at CES is razor Project Linda and razor they tend to get all kinds of attention at CES for something they're showing every year this year is this it's a concept laptop that uses the razor phone as a brain / trackpad so this actually isn't a totally new idea like we've seen smartphone convertibles into laptops before it's just never really been wildly successful Razer hopes to do itbest no of course because of the razor phone's prowess it's already an awesome phone with great speakers so it doesn't have to have extra speakers and the laptop things like that doesn't need a processor or Ram it's just using the razor phone in fact the only hardware actually in this Lynda laptop are the RGB keyboard because of course the battery a webcam up top and a couple ports the headphone jack USB C for charging and full size USB a on the other side for adding accessories like a mouse bo than that it just pops the razor phone in and out with a single button it sits flush it has the matching color with the Razer Blade stealth laptop has this little notch cutout at the front that uses the fingerprint reader and the power button from the phone I think the design is actually pretty well thought out it's just debatable if this is actually a practical product or not at all now for Lynda there is no price range or release date yet it's a pretty common trend for stuff we see at CES but I do really like the design I think it's really interesting it's just weird to build an entire accessory like that all around a smartphone that's probably going to be updated in a year like in 910 months when we see you raise your phone to is this whole laptop people just bought for their phone gonna work is compatibility gonna work do the dimensions stay the stain that kind of thing that's a tough I'll keep an eye on that now I also made it to senators booth and they were showing exactly one thing that I was super interested in and it's the whole reason I went which is Sennheiser HD 820 so I just showed like the custom HD eight hundreds I've been using for a while bison eyes are in my last video the set up tour but these will allegedly take that to a new level by isolating sound with the glass over the back of the ear clubs you can see it it's this concave Gorilla Glass so basically they retain a lot of the characteristics of open-back headphones like the HD 800 s that big drivers the open nature of it the wide soundstage but it now seals you off from the noise on the outside of your environment for people who don't want to hear all that so this I am definitely interested in I was able to listen to them for a bit I can confirm they sounded incredible but yeah I'd love to actually get these into the studio and put them to work they look incredible they will be selling these and they will be expensive I'm thinking two to three thousand dollars super expensive headphones and then over in a hotel near the strip I also found HTC's set up pretty interesting where they're showing some new announcements to HTC vive la do you might not know I've used the vive headset a lot we have one in the studio and they announced two pretty important things one is they now make a vive pro which is this all built into one headset with headphones and the strap over the top a high resolution display inside better tracking basically it's a much improved VR experience for those who want the best of the best you can also still buy the regular original HTC vive but then number two they showed an HTC vive wireless adapter which sort of looks like this bug antenna on your head that plugs into the headset but this is a game-changer because it tracks just as well but now allows you to walk around completely untethered from your computer normally you're plugged into your computer and you just kind of happen to hope you're not tripping over all the cables when you turn around and things like that with this basically you just have to plug into a battery plus it in your pocket and it'll last a couple hours with something like this a small three thousand milliamp power battery but obviously you can plug into something a bit bigger if you're gonna be gaming for a longer time so that was pretty cool I think people who use the vive will find that wireless adapter pretty great you can use the wireless adapter with the old five or the new vive Pro also I'm aware that using their screen set for that kind of opens people up to mess with the footage but I guess too late to change that all right some other things razor also at their booth head this pretty ridiculous looking pair of desktop speakers and a subwoofer they look pretty badass they of course had RGB again at the base because you know RGB but I have no idea how good they sound because it's way too noisy on the show floor but I'll be interested in checking those out Audio Technica also brought a lot of new stuff that like 10 new pairs of headphones and their booth some gaming headsets I'm open back some of these Wireless noise cancelling headphones that look like they're aiming to rival the Bose QuietComfort series then they also let me try out their top-of-the-line ATX 5000 so $2,000 open-back headphones and don't get me wrong they sound great but they're open back so I'm on the show floor where it's super noisy suppose there's no way I can fully appreciate them quite yet but pretty much all of these are going on sale soon if they haven't started already there's also tons and tons of drones at CES one weird when I didn't expect was in a Yamaha booth it was massive it looked about the size of like three people put together I know about zero other information about this drone other than it looked really cool look like they can go about 200 miles an hour but that's just me looking at it but what was really cool in their booth is this which is a self-balancing motorcycle which didn't really impress me at first when I first saw it until I realized those side wheels aren't touching the ground this bike is completely standing on its own on two wheels and that guy is pushing it around and it's just kind of responding by shifting its weight and staying upright that was a pretty cool demo but speaking of those drones DJ eyes booth also had some pretty cool stuff as they usually do including their Osmo mobile - it's a much cheaper stabilization than the original Osmo something like 50 60 70 bucks cheaper than the original super lightweight but it still does pretty much all the same stuff smart phone control a nice handle a grip for video or an emotes start/stop I can see a lot of people picking this up and this is of course also actually going on sale but so far in the first day I've been here that is what I've seen that looks pretty cool but literally as I'm uploading this I'm probably literally back to the show floor to check out some more stuff so if you see cool stuff that you think is worth showing on video or checking out or exploring hit me up on Twitter send me the link if you're on the subreddit send it there too I'm checking that now and that's pretty much it see you guys back out in vase thanks for watching catch you in part 2 talk to you the next one please 
[Music] hey wait up guys I'm candy HD here a b c d e f g h i j k l m n oh we're like halfway through the alphabet already Google is moving pretty fast so either way Android Oh Developer Preview is out now it's been out for a little bit it's been announced we have a logo we don't have a name it's always a desert theme I would guess it's Oreo but I'm always wrong so your guess is as good as mine either way it appears to be a pretty incremental update so it's not the huge massive overhaul you would have heard about it already if it was but there are some new stuff and we'll go over that but for the most part so mostly behind the scenes update stuff you might not have even noticed if you weren't familiar with a previous version of Android but that doesn't mean there isn't some cool stuff to cover so this is your top 5 new features of Android oh so number 5 is your lockscreen customization so this actually lives in the system UI tuner which is a new feature added with android marshmallow and it's kind of hidden like developer options but once you unhide it it holds some pretty cool stuff that I hope sticks around or even graduates from the system UI tuner into more visible main features so the lockscreen shortcut customization you know how long the lockscreen you have the swipe up from the left to open your voice control or swipe up from the right to get to your camera this actually lets you change those shortcuts to whatever app you want so if you have some favorite apps that you launched a lot more often you can go through literally all the apps on your phone and pick your favorites and that will swipe up to unlock into whatever app you choose so I can be pretty useful if you text a lot or tweet a lot or snapchat a lot whatever you pick those shortcuts will be on the bottom and I think that's pretty neat now number four is what I would call contextually aware text selection dialog it's a terrible name but it's way cooler than actually sound so you know how whenever you select any text just plain text on Android you get a couple options the copy or cut or paste or select all well now this selector is actually context aware so if you highlight an address a Google Maps link will actually appear and you can hop right into Google Maps just from that selection so if you have someone texting you a phone number you highlight that phone number it gives you a link to call that number immediately so that's kind of convenient stuff it's recognizing I'm hoping it'll also work when I highlight a link it will be able to open that up into my web browser but usually that's just a hyperlink anyway but either way pretty cool stuff I'm happy to now number three is a little bit of customization with the navigation buttons down at the bottom we've seen this built into a couple of third-party skins but this is also in system UI tuner so you can now choose between a compact which put them all the middle or a left-leaning or right-leaning set of buttons so people with big phones and small hands will find that easier to reach from one side with one-handed use and then you can also add an extra button or two on the bottom that's stayed permanently there so a clipboard button is an example not sure if it's for copy and paste functions or just a permanent place to view your clipboard because it's not fully functional here yet but the president is set and it's pretty cool I'd like to be able to add my own button there whatever I want now number two is a refreshed notifications panel this is a subtle one it's definitely a visual one and you'll notice it if you've seen previous versions of Android the icons up top and the quick settings are now a little bit cleaner there's some new icons up there too two thin lines underneath from toggles but also check out that slick new animation for revealing from the icons as you swipe notifications down that is pretty hot then you have a couple new notification behaviors seems like you get a little bit more complex every time and I would be true but it's not too crazy this time first of all the battery percentage is revealed with one swipe instead of two I really like that because I like seeing my actual percentage instead of just trying to guess based on how full the bar is and then you can do a half swipe over on a notification to snooze notifications from specific apps for some time so this might low-key be one of the most underrated features so let's say you just dropped a fired tweet your phone is blowing up with all these to our notifications instead of muting your whole phone you can snooze just your Twitter notifications for say 15 minutes and that will still allow you to not miss any calls or any emails or any other notifications the one that's done it'll come back I think that's pretty awesome my only complaint here is I wish the half swipe was a little bit easier it's still way too easy to accidentally do the full swipe and then you just dismiss the notification completely and you can't get that back I did that a lot but I still really like the ability to snooze notifications from just a single app that is really cool to see now the last one number one is a whole new Settings app and this one is maybe the only actual big redesign in the entire top 5 is the new Settings app is a lot cleaner it's visually overhaul I think the old settings apps and even other phones besides the pixel was starting to get a bit overwhelming with the sidebar and the tons of settings but now it's a lot simpler looking and it's a much shorter list and the slide-out menu is gone as well overall it's a shorter top-level list but you can still dive more into the actual settings or just use the search bar just to get to stuff that you know is there it's black and white now as well and also some of the pages like the storage information readout look a lot cleaner plus they give you that big important visual up top that is pretty helpful same thing with like the battery settings for example it still breaks down by your most used apps but you still get that big clean graphic up top for the percentage and estimated time left and power management tools but yes that's it there you have it those are the top five at least from what we know right now best new features in Android oh don't know the name yet like I said but we'll be finding that out pretty soon and it's a Developer Preview so this is still evolving there will be new versions of it and it will probably be new features added in the next couple months before it becomes official and rolls out the phones like you don't get these huge overhaul updates every couple months or it'll be a little bit crazy and obviously still most phones don't have the latest version of Android already yet so this will be rolling out slowly but from what we've seen what is your favorite new feature let me know thank you for watching talked to you guys the next one please [Music] 
[Music] hey what's up guys I'm cabby HD here and this is the brand new HTC u ultra and it is definitely the shiniest phone of all time and the tablets also be HTC's first big smartphone of 2017 and coming to the US with a price tag of $749 so this is definitely a high-end supply ship smartphone and people who buy seven hundred dollar Android smartphones these are the pickiest of the bunch that is the biggest enthusiast people who want the biggest baddest phone they can possibly get so this seems to be what HTC is setting the tone with those people with so it's rockin pretty high-end specs the Snapdragon 820 won three Juno 530 GPU four gigs of RAM and quality materials all around I mean you haven't seen many phones like this that are basically a mirror finish on the back it's glass and metal it's got the HTC skin over Android 7.0 some sweet colors are available and the cherry on top is of course how great this thing looks so this thing might be a sleeper of a great phone but the more I look into it the more I use this thing the more I understand the u ultra the more I realize this seems to be a really poor use of space this is a big phone I mean you look at its footprint compared to things like the iPhone 7 plus the Galaxy Note 7 and even the pixel XL which stands for extra large and it's bigger than all of those and even others with even smaller displays it's bigger than all of them and it's still eight millimeters thick so it's also definitely not trying to be a super thin phone in any way either so it seems like there should be all the room in the world to throw in every possible flagship feature and perk right we've probably already realized this even if it's in your head without me saying it the back of this phone definitely resembles another certain rivals flagship not the galaxy s7 the galaxy s6 back when there is a big ol hump on the back for the camera on the galaxy s6 that's when it looked the most likely you ultra but of course the next year Samsung made the phone a little bit thicker with all its new upgrades and bigger battery etc and ended up with a much smaller camera hump on the back there should be no need for such a big hump on an even bigger phone of the U ultra so the bump in an already huge phone to me seems like a poor use of space and for the record just having a camera bump isn't always a big deal but on the you ultra it is and then there's a headphone jack or the lack of a headphone jack ya know headphone jack at all in this huge phone now I understand USB type-c is great and it's the future and everything but Apple's main reason for getting rid of the headphone jack in the iPhone besides courage was to save precious space in such a compact interior of a phone other manufacturers have sense continued putting headphone jacks on their phones because they don't need that space and the Portland quite here yet an HTC you definitely could have also but you didn't for some reason seems like a poor user space and then the battery the HTC u ultra has a 3000 milliamp hour battery which doesn't seem that bad but for context yes something's a little bit off here you would think that a phone this huge and this thick with this much internal space would have all the room in the world for maybe a two day battery life maybe the biggest non removable battery they could possibly sit but that was a missed opportunity here and this phone is stuck with average battery life at best seems like a poor use of space and even if I get a little picky these these buttons down here at the bottom of the phone have some pretty small touch targets and I can't help but think that something just looks a little bit off about them a bit out of place to the point where it took me a little bit of time to actually get used to pressing in the right spot with a screen and a phone this huge HTC could have easily gone with on-screen customizable software buttons or at least given that option somewhere in the menu is 2017 but they didn't instead they went with the small permanent capacitive buttons way down at the bottom now they could if they wanted to drop that in a software update so I won't rag too hard on that if they want to enable it but maybe they just wanted to have buttons on the side flanking a fingerprint reader because they just really wanted a fingerprint reader which is cool you can put one there but they managed to put one of the smaller ones on any flagship phone even on one of the biggest phones out there seems like a poor use of space this $750 phone is also not water-resistant and with a body and all the internal spaces big you would think they would be able to find the space to put the seams and the seals to make sure that it's water-resistant just like a lot of smaller fly ships out there but they didn't seems like a poor use of space and if you look in the sides and the corners of this display especially up at the top-left corner right underneath the webcam you get some serious light bleed I hardly ever notice actual light bleed in any flagship smartphone I don't know if it's because in this phone the backlighting is too close to the display panel or if the insides are too clumped up there next to the webcam to get that space evenly lit I don't know what the problem is but it is actually noticeable and that rarely is a problem for me on smartphones so seems like a poor use of space again it's also a huge phone with tiny speakers at the bottom sure it's a stereo pair but it's definitely not the loudest and it's definitely tinny at high volumes for we have space you see what I'm getting at also most glass back phones like this have wireless charging that's why they do it if you have a metal phone you can't do while I was charging because wireless charging doesn't work through metal but if you have this sort of a big glass back and a huge amount of internal space you would think you could at least have wireless charging but it doesn't pour you space now even all that isn't the end of the world I mean there's phones that are also lacking all of those things I just talked about but they're also less than this price so I think at $750 in the u.s. it's pretty hard sell I mean people who are buying phones at that price are looking for something really special and I don't think you're getting that here I mean there are definitely some good promising things about this phone that have me psyched for HTC's next phone the camera in this guy is really good it's a 12 megapixel ultra pixel camera and has phase detection autofocus that's really fast and photos look very good they can almost go toe-to-toe with the Google pixel so I'm really impressed with that it also has expandable storage which is definitely rare in most smartphones and appreciated a high-end flagship and the second display up at the top while it is a shameless rip of the LG v 20 it's also kind of useful sometimes like the one in the LGB 20 you get some app shortcuts up there if you want I kind of like it when the display is off and I raise to wake and I just get that little bit of notifications and the time and the date that's my favorite feature of the second display but you know if you don't want to use it you can turn it off as well so there is good stuff here but aside from new HTC software there's almost nothing for 750 bucks that this phone does that you can't get somewhere else better or cheaper so with that I'll say skip this one and you can pretty easily wait for the HTC 11 to come out pretty soon or just grab a Galaxy s8 when that comes out or an LG g6 or pretty much any other $700 smartphone which will be a better use of space than this one so Bennett hope you enjoyed configured with a comment if you agree or if you have some other stuff to share thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] [Music] all right I always forget what number it is do we just pass 20 really last one was yeah us one was 20 so it's 21 on point hey what is up guys I'm Kim PhD here and welcome to ask mkbhd inversion 21 just turned the mic on hey what's up guys i'm kim Bhd here and welcome to ask MTB HD version 21 we've done one every month of this year so far this is number 10 of the 12 for 2017 it's October I reached out on Twitter ask you guys what you wanted to know and these are your best questions that's on the D monetization situation and how has it affected you so I think I've touched on this before but I've been almost completely unaffected by the D monetization problems that a lot of youtubers have been having in the past year or two but just because it's not happening to me doesn't mean it's not happening and just because it's happening to some other people doesn't mean it's happening to everyone a couple days ago Casey nice that made a great video kind of outlining the entire situation about the communication from the YouTube team and the relationship between YouTube itself and the community and the problems people have been having it's worth a watch I agree with a lot of what he says in that video but the main thing to get out of that is that the the biggest problem we have is there's not a lot of communication between YouTube and us youtubers about what those problems are and a lot of what Casey talks about in his video is about the value of youtubers to YouTube about how we will leave at the drop of a hat and go somewhere else if there's a bigger audience or a better monetization solution but I think the problem is YouTube is the biggest audience has been for years and will be for a long time so actually don't see youtubers leaving YouTube anytime soon no matter how bad this monetization situation gets because it's still the biggest audience so anyway I have a lot of thoughts about that but essentially I've been unaffected I'm just keeping my ear to the ground and keeping a finger on the pulse and trying to figure out what other people think - which dual camera setup do you prefer most one with a secondary monochrome or one with the telephoto lens between those two I would definitely pick the telephoto lens or just any additional focal length over the monochrome sensor I've tested a couple phones that have the second monochrome camera to add detail and enhance the photos but a lot of times those aren't good cameras in the first place so it doesn't really make much of a difference to me so I'll take that v30 with the wide-angle camera I'll take the iPhone or the note or whatever with the second portrait camera that's cool I also really appreciate the way Google's done it and I'll talk about it in the full review with a single camera for portrait mode but that's not a story if you reach down what would you rather have in your pocket red or iPhone 10 well I do have two pockets so if I reach down and I mean what why not both at this point one of the speakers on the bottom of the iPhone 7 + + a + doesn't actually work could Apple have put a headphone jack there instead listen the headphone jack is dead headphone jacks not coming back we just kind of have to embrace it and move on quickly seriously i've definitely mentioned it before yes we're in that like awkward stage in-between everyone having headphone jacks and nobody needing them because Wireless is so good but to keep wishing for it to come back is definitely not a productive exercise just gonna have to move along any updates on your professional Ultimate Frisbee career what teams are you playing for and where can we see your games so it's all offseason right now it's about to be winter the professional Ultimate Frisbee season is generally during the summer and when the summer rolls around I of course I always tweet where you can see our games when you can see our games that's the best place to find that but right now it's offseason it's more of like College ultimate and Club ultimate and just other fun stuff LA Clippers wins set at 42 and a half over/under hmm I'm gonna go with over yeah you know what I'm off to mystic I'm gonna go with the over on this one but I have to mention I will be watching Rockets games also now because I'm Chris Paul that's the original reason I became a Clippers fan now he's a Houston rocket now I'm watching Houston Rockets games what do you think of the soon-to-be announced razor phone so you know what if red can make a smart phone then I guess it's anyone's ballgame razor bought next bit now they're aiming to make a smart phone and we'll probably be seeing that pretty soon I'm excited for that too obviously next bit has a little bit of a history but we may or may not see bits of that in the new razor phone but razor is is a gaming peripheral and gaming device maker right now so I kind of expect to see a lot of cues from that sort of stuff in the new smartphone plus combined with maybe some of the next bits past it'll be interesting to see I'll definitely try to cover that when it comes out ZTE axon my do you hate it it's kind of a cool concept so yeah I treated about this the other day that ZTE axon M has come out it's a foldable smartphone but not really it's more of a dual screen phone with a hinge in the middle that just kind of unfolds like that I agree it's it's a cool concept key word being concept but the actual execution when you look at the final result just doesn't look good at all now I can appreciate trying to one-up Samsung where you kind of you have a feeling they're gonna do some sort of a foldable display in the near future so you try to be first to that this just isn't good for anything other than maybe splitting a movie across two screens it doesn't do all that much that's useful I see the demo videos I'll link one below mr. mobile did a great one the verge did a great one you can mirror the display across both screens you can extend the screen across both screens but no matter how you use it it's just weird having a big bezel in the middle of your display so is a cool concept yes but if I told you the price tag you'd probably agree with me that it just doesn't seem like a good product did you upgrade to the new monstro 8k VistaVision so look no I haven't gotten it yet but it's pretty likely that I will end up making that move pretty soon but those of you who don't know the biggest difference between the new monstro 8k sensor and the current helium super 35 sensor besides the cheesy new name is the size of it the super 35 sensor is smaller than full frame and the VistaVision 8k sensor is a full-frame size sensor that has a lot of implications as far as what you can use the type of a look you get with your video and your bokeh and the type of flexibility you get and you're having a much wider angle lens in a smaller area it's actually useful for those hands-on areas I could name a ton of reasons why I'm excited for the upgrade right now but long story short yes that's probably gonna happen what's your go-to everyday object to use as a weapon in a self-defense situation that makes it seem like I have like an answer already like a go-to would it be cheating to say the weapon just because it's already a weapon you can hurt somebody with this it's mostly metal and it's got sharp edges and it has a handle yep that'll do it go to me laughter a game of ultimate that's easy Chipotle for sure can you solve a Rubik's Cube oh I don't have one but I I can solve one face of a Rubik's Cube I have those algorithms memorized and I can get the first row around the face and then I don't know any of the rest whose vision of the future will win Google or Apple both are focusing on different things Google is software versus Apple hardware that's an interesting question I kind of think you have to have both obviously there's advantages with going with either way apples ecosystem built around their super premium hardware is amazing but on the other end of things like Google being able to improve things on the fly and add features and have essentially a modular experience with their software also has huge advantages but it's nothing without the hardware and vice-versa so you kind of have to have both and I think both are realizing that and trying to build that way Apple is trying to build up their ecosystem to compete with Google's massive ecosystem of products and Google's trying to build their own hardware build their own phones like the pixel to compete with Apple's ecosystem at hardware where do you find your awesome glitch funk electro intro songs seriously I'm in love with that genre well thank you I don't really have like one source I always go to for music but I can tell you that in the past couple videos the intros you've been hearing are unreleased tracks from altas new album I will link it below I've heard the whole thing I'm not allowed to like share that entire thing but I'm giving you these little sneak peeks and they're releasing a new track from that every Wednesday they can just click the link it's expanding and playlist it's amazing hey I'm gonna enter right there thank you for tuning in to this quick episode of your questions and answers' has been fun but I'm gonna get right back to this review video I'm making and then a whole bunch of other stuff coming up for October in November it's just that time of year there's a lot of new products either way thanks for watching talk together the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] sup guys mkbhd here welcome back to January so last year we did this thing where I did a Q&amp;A video every month one video every month that's 12 Q&amp;A is during the year and we kind of got into a rhythm and I feel like it was a good idea we introduced a couple different concepts and overall I enjoyed it so we're doing it again this year for 2018 I'm getting the year right this time so I already asked you guys on Twitter what you guys wanted to know so without any further ado let's let's get into it we got a special guest Tesla Model 3 oh and Austin Evans here so we'll just go ahead and tag-team this one let the car answer the question let's get started what's a trend you do not want to see in tech and 2018 don't want to see the easy answer that I think a lot of people would give is headphone jacks going away stop oh yeah broccoli it's already over ya have phone jacks pretty much dead at this point that battle has been lost I think a lot of people don't like to hear that but we still need to see a wireless technology get better I talked about that in my last video oh yeah the airplane video that was great yeah so I don't know I I kind of just I like the way a lot of things are going right now now Daniel wants to know same question but the opposite what's the trend that you do want to see in 2018 I feel like I want to see smartphones continue to get better and more importantly cheaper I think that we're getting to a point where $100 can get you a surprisingly decent phone especially we get to like two or three hundred bucks I mean the gap between a budget phone it's more like a flagship is shrinking every year and I like to see that that's a legit trend this year we have an abundance of less expensive phones oh my got another model three that's crazy look at one place on earth where model threes you never expect that I'd like to see a better usage of dual cameras maybe play with focal lengths a little more yeah I feel like right now most of the time a dual cameras like oh it's monochrome or it's like oh it's gonna give you like some death data but like you said the pixel kind of does a lot of that stuff better already just like what's the point of adding a second camera unless it's doing something meaningfully different I don't know who I'm quoting but I know at one point a youtuber has told me I don't think anyone knows what the hell they're doing with dual cameras that sounds like a quote I can believe that not normal tech related and this is true if you could replace any body part with a cybernetic replacement what would you choose and why so this guy's fishing for a very specific oh yeah yeah yeah do you know who we are what's your highest killcount pub gee I don't like bleep up geez like one yeah I think my answer is the same only the second time I played I'd survived down to like top 45 top 43 respect and I found someone that I want to go shoot and I had a gun that I knew nothing about and I just pointed and squeezed a bunch of times but it had this recoil thing going on oh yeah every time you shoot your aim just goes further and further up but I didn't let it go back down seems like I am squeezed and ended up firing a lot of bullets into the sky and I'm just like what's video doing Pawel yeah I died pretty quick there that's a good story yeah what what health tracking apps are you using I'm not really using many apps for that what I try to do and I'm even wearing it but I try to close all the Rings on my Apple watch every single day which I lowered my goals to I don't even know it's like half of what it was supposed to be but I'd do it if you want to answer feel free to go through the tweets dig through and find any good ones I have another one with a weird rumor that came up what are your thoughts on the rumors about iPhone 10 being discontinued I heard rumors and I don't I don't trust it i don't I'll believe it when I see it but there's a rumor that iPhone 10 as a series has come and gone and it's not gonna be a thing anymore we'll go back to when they say that they mean like you know at the end of September or whatever when they bring out the iPhone 11 or whatever the next one would be they were just completely discontinued the ten right well that makes sense to some degree because they pretty much always take the flagship phone and they bump it down in praise but they'd have to bump into ten down a lot in praise so I can see them just basically clearing them out putting the 11 and doing something like the lower-cost version because it's hard to imagine this foam being like 500 bucks I'll be honest I read the headlines and I didn't consider any logistical possibility of it happening so I'll read into them more but that's something new that's on my radar so we'll see all right one okay should I will bring back the 17-inch MacBook Pro if they do do you think they'd stick with AMD graphics or NVIDIA something like a max Q 1070 just the general question I would love to see another 17-inch MacBook Pro I do a lot of mobile video editing times like this when we're out here la times like CES times like Mobile World Congress in a month where I'm bringing a lot of heavy footage and it chokes my MacBook Pro every time do you think you would see a significant performance increase with a 17 because I'm thinking of like laptop processors and I mean the 15 already has about as good as it gets on the laptop side unless you look crazy like a desktop which is gonna like eat through the battery do you think you'll be legitimately faster he thinks more there's nothing like on the graphic Snyder so I do think the GPU is what you'd get the most out of having that extra space with the battery could be a bit bigger but thermally you can just do more with the GPU with more space that's pretty clear so yeah and Apple would never do this but I would love to see them unashamedly just make a thick just video editing look at a screen 3 Delta Pro it's never gonna happen but I'd love to see that ok this is one I don't think you're gonna be able to answer when I try it anyway what do you think of black mirror have you ever watched the Netflix original series now black mirror I have never watched black mirror I have a Netflix account and it has probably logged three total hours in its existence hello people don't believe me when I say that but I watch a lot of YouTube yeah so I'm aware of the concept that I understand when people reference black mirror which is weird but I've never watched it I would actually say that you would play enjoy black man yeah I would I would venture guess that it's a very futuristic show it's about how technology is gonna ruin everyone's lives oh you're entertaining who do you think will be first Samsung Apple Google etc to implement the on-screen fingerprint sensor okay so I guess the first of the big the big dawgs big mainstream phone makers I would okay so I would expect Samsung Samsung tends to be the first they were you know they they pushed the boundaries with things like the iris scanner you know they try new stuff so yeah Samsung I think would be my thing like the note like nine or something no nine note ten I mean Galaxy S nine is coming out and I think that's a little early to see it yeah I think that would be interesting what are the key iPhone and Mac apps that you rely on and how has that changed over the last 12 months oh for sure one that comes recently to mind Twitter for Mac trash okay oh I've used it but I use it for years I now use Tweetbot on all my iOS and and Mac's but I couldn't like if you've ever tried to use Tweetbot for Mac for more than five minutes in your Twitter format Twitter from a cow it slows to a crash thank you for correcting me yeah let's agree on that section tweet vitals awesome but uh yeah I have a pretty study workflow across my it's a final cut editing suite it's it's Spotify for music Safari so yeah that's pretty much my exact setup I think Photoshop is thrown in there sometimes but for the most part yeah it's pretty much final cut Twitter Safari Chrome Spotify like that's kind of yeah for that up the core suite yeah now let's change for me lately it's one you may or may I want answer okay do you have a Tesla referral code why mark is I would love to buy a Tesla would you ever have a referral code so I could do you can't get anything for that or now I do so funny story I do have a Tesla furro code I've never really shared it I have a couple friends who have bought a car and so they wanted to have her referral code and when you use a referral code to buy a Tesla you get free supercharging on your car for life so it is worth something I'll put it in the description I don't usually share it but well you do get out of that as a referrer is every new referral for me and the tier I'm in right now is 2% off my final payment on the roads oh so basically if enough people click the link in the description and sign up with your referral code Gately a lot of money off your roadster it's not gonna happen but your 2% for roadster that's a lot of money if you do the math it's worth it yeah like 2% so yeah up to literally 100 percent off I think I think one Tesla based youtuber I'll confirm with him but he has already earned a free roadster was regrettable yeah that's crazy okay you know what that's a good question someone says what are your thoughts on the new Hasselblad I tweeted it earlier there's a new Hasselblad h 6d I'm gonna get this wrong h 6d 400 C m/m/c it's a long name but essentially it's a hundred megapixel sensor that's using a multi shot so I think that's M s that's taking 400 megapixel stills at this point so normal stills are 100 mega pixels you can you take multiple shots to combine them it's combining them all with like a one pixel difference shifting in each direction it's an insane technology but if I'm printing billboards that's something I'm into but I'm not so I'll stick with stick with the camera I use now it's like a normal Hasselblad yeah just you know x1d is cool no big deal I think you may be answer this one before if you didn't have YouTube where do you think you would be right now yeah I never know I never know the answer I'll stop back at you because I like have been making videos for such a long part of my life yeah that I mean I assumed I would do something related to my major in college which was business but I think the same boat there because I think we started me like what 1516 sometime so I think for me I would probably be working at Best Buy that was my backup plan if YouTube didn't work okay I can just go get a job at Best Buy and I'll have this awesome resume of some cool tech videos on YouTube yeah but it's it's hard to imagine doing something else at this point it really is it's weird to think about what no this is I think you'll definitely have a good answer for this one what's your favorite music album cuz I guess you probably I know what your guess is already do your guesses Ram by - yes and that is definitely a top three boy oh there's some albums I like to listen to in there completion okay that have a lot of replay value so I'll give the time I'll just I already know the incredible true story by logic I don't necessarily listen to individual songs on that album as much as I just listen to the whole thing about you favorite album uh okay yeah no that's that's an easy one I think RAM is probably my top 5 but incredible true story I've listened to so many times like every year when I go to my spotify you're in a wine flight people like fadeaways like I was like number one you know it's weird though okay so and I didn't even remember this but when I go back in that Spotify year and rewind for the past two at least maybe three years my number one artist is always Kanye and I didn't realize how many years of Kanye albums I've listened to from like college dropout to graduation that whole time it's not really that much new Kanye but there's a lot so I'll throw I'll toss graduation in there for I can get behind that except there's a lot of Kanye that I think would be on like my top ten yeah when was the last time a tech item blew your mind blew my mind I actually blew your mind my answer is in the frame right now yeah auto pilot not necessarily like the actual car but there is something weird about when you're driving being able to actually take your hands off the wheel and actually do something else I was messed with my parents in this picked them up from the airport during a holiday and my sister was in on it but she's like hey can't grab some from the backseat and I'm an auto pilot I just kind of casually reached back and the cars and they're in the backseat like what is he doing hilarious I'm definitely gonna do some more some more Tesla videos and you'll see model three video coming very soon forgot to hold mention that whole thing but that's coming coming pretty quick so auto pilots on my list what do you got you know I can't think of a better answer than that I was probably gonna say something dumb but like honestly autopilot you're right it's like such a crazy sort of feature because you think how much time do you spend driving and it's just like you hit a button she's like oh yeah the cars you can do this for me it's great this car the fact that this car is built on autonomous ride-sharing should say something about the way car tech has gone in the future so I'll leave it at that thank you for participating in my Q&amp;A hopefully you guys enjoy the questions and the answers I thought they were pretty solid but stay tuned of course for the Tesla video and for many more things to come the Q&amp;A is every month that's over on Twitter if you're not already following follow this guy he makes YouTube videos also and he makes he makes tweets sometimes very gonna read this thanks for watching talk to guys the next one peace 
[Music] [Applause] hey what is up guys i'm kim Bhd here and welcome to the unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy Note SB fan edition I don't know that's what they were going to call it the fan Edition but uh this is a revival basically a refurbished Galaxy Note 7 but with no 7 anywhere on the packaging it can also see a little heart on the front there for sands I guess it's going to open up and see what's different as far as we know specs have not changed so there you go right up at the top is the note 7 an addition the stylus of course still there get your earbuds here that's a good sign and your power adapter and USB type-c cable that's all the same as it was with the note 7 actually the phone itself once that you get the stickers and everything off are exactly the same as the note 7 same specs same software just with this slightly smaller battery you can see it says note Sanditon right there that's the biggest physical change that's uh that's pretty much it uh maybe we can take some questions all right can we get a Logitech MX master 2s review ok so I actually have the lab sex MX master 2's this gray here is the 2s this dark navy gold is the MX master it is actually also not that much of a difference here you can see up at the front on the button itself it says logy instead of the entire logitech name that's actually do they get physical different there's no USB type-c or any different connector or anything same capabilities just a better battery life and higher dpi and a new color so that's that's also it for that I think we'll just we'll just take a lot more questions how did you learn to use Final Cut Pro did you just practice with the software or did someone teach you ok so funny story about the time that I first started using Final Cut Pro when I was first starting to learn video editing it was with Camtasia Studio and I used that because a lot of my videos at that time were screencasts and that was actually a software used for recording your screen and then editing that screencast so have a bunch of features for like your highlighting your mouse and following the cursor around the screen stuff like that I switched from that to Adobe Premiere and I learned a lot in the Adobe world in the premiere and After Effects and Photoshop world all because of that switch but then I switched from a PC to a Mac and then we got to the Kobe interview so we did this interview and I say we because there's a collaboration actually between me doing the actual interview with Kobe and a behind-the-scenes video and a lot of help setting that up for my buddies Austin and John those two guys are both Mac users who use Final Cut Pro and swore by it and will constantly try to get me to switch to Final Cut Pro it was pretty stubborn I was like no I'm I'm doing pretty well with Adobe Premiere thank you very much but we're editing our videos right I'm editing the interview I'm cutting between the multiple cameras in Premiere they're editing the behind-the-scenes in Final Cut Pro on their Mac's I hit export they hit export I'm still exporting and John's video his behind the scenes finishes exporting and then he watches it back and then catches a mistake in something he wants to fix he goes back into the editing fixes that mistake and then re-exports the entire thing again and uploads it and I'm still at like 30 percent done exporting from Premiere it was at that moment that I knew I had to give Final Cut Pro a shot and that's why switch honestly Final Cut Pro is that much faster on Macs because of a bunch of things besides just optimization and Quick Sync it's kind of a no-brainer for me at this point I could always go back to Windows and back to premiere if I wanted to but I've learned all my keyboard shortcuts and I am self-taught at a lot of what I do in these editing apps so it's not really a huge deal since you don't use a phone case how many phones have you actually broken slash damage like crack the screen etc okay I've only actually in my lifetime of reviewing phones crack the screen on one but I have dropped two and damaged them the most recent one actually damaged was this one plus five I dropped my one plus five getting out of the car practice like two days before shoot my review put a skin over it it was fine but the last phone actually broke the screen of was the second gen Moto X when I was like a sophomore in college dropped it like literally facedown on the sidewalk actually broke but honestly for the amount of time I've been using phones in my lifetime that's a pretty decent record of like two in seven years I think okay this one's on all caps why do you always have bluetooth and location services on all the time I don't think it's basically just for the convenience I have no problem with battery life as it is you can turn them off to save battery life but I like walking up to my car and sitting down on the driver's seat and the music is already playing from my phone just cuz bluetooth paired that fast every time I want to connect to bluetooth headphones it's just one button and they're connected and we go same thing with speakers if I want to go into maps I don't have to turn on location services wait for it to connect get GPS and then go I kind of just go what's your typing speed [Applause] if you happen to live in the world of Game of Thrones whom would you kill first honestly I've never seen an episode of Game of Thrones in my life so I'm probably missing out I'm not the best person answer this question I mostly watch a lot more YouTube videos than TV shows when shooting videos do you draw any inspiration from filmmakers or photographers which one's influenced your aesthetic a really interesting question actually I'd like to say I'm building my own style and a lot of of course inspiration comes from various places mostly actually also in the YouTube world and the online world I don't watch that many movies but you could say a little bit of it comes from other tech youtubers other Skitch sketch sketch makers but I do want to link to a video that I think is amazing coming from a quote from Ira Glass it's an animation built around something he's said often which is you kind of have your own tastes and people don't tell us to beginners very much but you don't really have the most confidence in your early work because you have this really nice pace then you don't think your early work lives up to that taste but you just have to keep working at what you do over and over again and longer and longer so you can build up to that taste and actually satisfy your own crazy what you want to be so I'm link that below I think it's really good and if you're into creative stuff at all or if you want to be a youtuber and make stuff you should watch it can you do a review on the Hasselblad okay so those of you who have been following me for the past a little bit on like Twitter or Instagram know that I recently got or have been using the Hasselblad x1d it's insane in a lot of ways and I understand why you'd want a review of it but I'd almost feel bad reviewing it because the use that I have for this camera is definitely not the use of the people who would be watching a review of this camera you know what I mean today really compact but still really really premium handheld medium format sensor it's a 50 megapixel sensor in this camera it does incredible things its sharp edge to edge with the glass that comes with it and I will not be using it to shoot ads or billboards or portraits I'm using it to shoot like photos of smartphones and tablets and handheld devices for Twitter and Instagram and I'll probably do some other stuff like just random photos of things I see for wallpaper type materials I started a Flickr account again if you want the high-resolution 50 megapixel versions of these images but I almost feel bad reviewing it in a way that's kind of like not something anyone can take advantage of maybe I'll do a highlight of it maybe it'll be in dope tech maybe I'll just show you guys what I'm doing with it and why it's so awesome because I really do think it's awesome but yeah I probably won't review the Hasselblad so I'm gonna stop right there as far as questions that I answer but I'm actually going to turn this around I've done these q and A's for a while now and I want to end it by turning around a question for you guys and I'm going to bring it from something I tweeted recently what would you think since everyone's making smartphones now what would you think if Tesla made a smart phone what if what would it be into what would you like about it what would you expect to see from a Tesla smartphone I mean Red's making a smart phone now why not right I know what you think thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
hey what's up guys I'm poppy HD here and this little story about how I've managed my footage over the years so I'm a youtuber obviously and in a very beginning most of those early videos were super simple I would literally just hit the record button and then when I'm done hit stop and then upload that video file alright welcome to my first video there was no editing no extra files none of that I could just keep the file in a folder on my desktop a couple of megabytes upload it to YouTube and then share it with the world and then I got a little more intricate I got a camera I got editing software and I started actually stitching together a bunch of different clips and then I uploaded that final video file to YouTube and then I just deleted all the raw footage and all the way up to the beginning of last year through all the camera upgrades and all the evolution of how I made videos I've always put everything together uploaded the final video then deleted the footage just keeping the final video file and I was actually fine because any time I needed to go back and get some previous footage I could just grab it from that final video file and that was fine with me but now it's 2017 and we're not just shooting 1080p and 4k video files anymore we're shooting v k6 k 8k video files to the point where if i want to go back and use them i'm not getting the full quality out of it so if i want to go back and use clips from older videos i'm grabbing a 4k version of something that was originally shot in raw 8k which isn't the end of the world or anything but imagine in a couple of years having the full 8k clicks would be able to breathe new life into them on new platforms so late last year in 2016 i decided i'm not going to delete all they're all video files anymore i'm going to keep everything or everything that's useful so all the high resolution videos everything so that it can be manipulated again and shared later without losing any quality and to do that i would need a lot of storage the average one minute 8k video file coming off this helium sensor at 8 to 1 compression is about depending on what's in it about 10 to 12 or 15 gigs so to put it in perspective that kc studio tour that video shoot we did all the videos we got totaled about a terabyte I understand it's completely overkill for YouTube in 2017 but again think of YouTube in 2025 2030 so a couple months ago I got this thing this is the promise Pegasus - it's a 48 terabyte Thunderbolt 3 raid array and I started keeping all the original footage and media on this along with the final video file for every project and to me and a lot of people I'm sure that's a perfectly good solution for a long time huge amount of storage locally attached fast really quiet sits right on your desk you can edit off it it's great but if you do the math at around a half a terabyte per project that's less than 100 videos before it's full so that's where Linus from - tech tips and Seagate and 45 drives and unread come into play this is a 10 terabyte hard drive seriously 10 terabytes in the palm of my hand this was literally a fantasy a couple of years ago now it's real and this is what's called a store nadir a V 15 by 45 drives this is a high capacity storage server with 15 drive bays and yet still small enough that you can put it right next to your desk it's about the same size as a regular PC it has a xenon CPU inside eight gigs of RAM a 650 watt power supply and a 10 gigabit ethernet connection and has all these fans in here but when they're running they're pretty quiet so barely audible from like 10 feet away so Linus brings this thing over and then basically starts handing me these drives 10 terabytes 10 terabytes 10 terabytes 10 more terabytes we start populating the store nadir with these drives not gonna lie it was really fun to add them in he's gone he slides it into the rail he aligns it with the bottom rail he makes a slight adjustment and again we get to 7 drives of the 15 slots because the rest of them were actually delayed because of shipping but a couple days later I get the rest of the drives and install them myself BAM 10 terabytes 10 terabytes 10 terabytes and just like that the 140 terabyte raid array is up and on line 15 10 terabyte drives one for redundancy a super secure backup now for all the raw footage I shoot from here on out so Linus what are some of the advantages of the set up we're looking at tell me about it 22 seconds this guy gives me but I'm going to do my best this is a fantastic Navs that I flew out here to deliver for the consumption of the one and only mkbhd and it's pretty flippin awesome it's built by 40 five drives in a custom enclosure using server grade hardware like the super micro motherboard that has 10 gigabit network speed so if you want to be able to dump footage on here super fast then that's going to be a thing and we've gone ahead and equipped it with 15 some of them are still in the mail 15 of cj's iron wolf pro Nazz hard drive so these are special because they have a five-year warranty their rated at 300 terabytes of yearly data or something stupid like that and they include data recovery service within the warranty period so that's really special because we're running them on on raid which means that because we're not striping the data the odds of recovering our data fully in the event of a catastrophic failure where multiple drives die is actually much better other benefits of on raid though I'm not 100% sure how he's going to use them are things like being able to run a plex server yeah I'm getting to know ok being able to run Windows in a virtual machine we're getting to know um being able to add high speed SSD caching for multiple people to work off it keeps spend the team I'm getting the nod yes ok I'm on a roll here how about choosing things to backup to cloud storage like Dropbox good ok so it can do all that crap this is pretty much the only way to have more than a hundred terabytes of storage easily accessible in one place at least right now with current drive densities maybe that will change in a couple years maybe we'll have some crazy 50 terabyte SD cards or something like that but until then this is what that looks like and I think it'll be a pretty fresh start for starting to keep everything combine that with the pretty fresh looking front plate from 45 drives and the sweet little chassis we have it in the Aerie server case I think that's a pretty solid start a little little piece in studio 2 so that's pretty much it thank you for watching hope you enjoyed maybe you learn something there'll be links in the description below if you have any questions about any of this stuff but I'll hang out in the comments section too and answer any questions you might have thank you for watching Tufte has the next one [Music] 
[Music] hey what's up guys I'm Kim PhD here and this is Google home max it's brand-new but you might have forgotten about it since its announcement a couple weeks ago so let me refresh your memory on exactly what it is so we already had Google home Mini this little donut sized puck speaker this is $49 and then we have Google home this is the original it's about the size of like a large coffee mug and it's 119 bucks and then this is Google home max this it's like the size of probably a watermelon right now pretty heavy too and this will cost 399 so the design here is pretty solid inside its its dual 4.5 inch woofers behind the mesh here and then dual point seven inch tweeters so right off the bat the biggest advantage to home max having this cabinet that's so big with so much more space is dedicated drivers for dedicated frequencies I want sideways here in landscape mode these drivers are gonna give you stereo audio which pretty much no other smart speaker does Apple Home pod won't even do that from what I've been told it's a pretty simple looking speaker it just kind of blends in you don't really want it to be too flashy after all so it comes in two colors black and white or charcoal and chalk up there so you got these lights in the middle of the mesh and then there really are no buttons up at the front or the sides or anything just a single touch bar at the top you slide left and right to adjust the volume and you can touch in the middle to play pause simple as that and it sits on this little magnetic circular pad that it comes with it's pretty dense and then there's some magnets in the bottom of the speaker right here and it just kind of slaps onto the bottom like that and that acts as an isolation pad so it doesn't Rumble whatever surface it's on which is pretty cool you have that in a lot of high-end speakers that sit on bookshelves or on desktops so it's cool that it comes with that what's even cooler is that if for some reason you buy two of these you can set them up vertically like bookshelf speakers and they pair with each other and each one is a channel in a stereo audio so you can get some real separation and these little isolation pads just slap on the side now so they can stand up and look great and now the volume control works with the correct orientation as well and if you accidentally turn it upside down you get a little warning message by the way the Google home is upside down it'll work best if you turn it over so I'm gonna do that now the rest of the hardware if you flip it around to the back you'll see up at the top is meats which I mentioned I wanted it to be a button because on the mini you could get out of sync but now you can't meet the mics with just your voice anymore so it's just a switch so I guess that's less confusing and then the bottom corner you get your headphone jack to plug in an external audio source like a record player or whatever else you got going on a USB C port nice I don't know what I'd use it for exactly but nice I plugged my phone in it charged which is cool but that's about it and then you have the power cable the cable itself on the white one is like this olive off white greenish color not sure why but what I do like about it is a small end to it meaning the power circuits are all on the speaker itself so it leaves room for other stuff at your outlet unlike the other two Google homes but let's get to the meat of this which is how does it sound it is a four hundred dollar premium smart speaker so it better sound great so how does it sound it sounds great it gets ridiculously loud the speakers are twenty times more powerful than these Google home speakers which is nuts when you're talking to the assistant it literally sounds like there's another person in the room with you it's kind of trippy hey Google how tall are you it could get pretty tall since I'm software that might be the only way to find out you really get all the benefits of the dedicated drivers though when you just listen to music at full blast it's stupid loud obviously and unless they're playing music for a party you'll probably never use it this loud and it does distort a bit at this volume but at seventy seventy-five percent volume it sounds great and is still pretty damn loud the original Google home sounded alright but I guess let's attempt an audio comparison [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] damn it has a lot of rich punchy bass and a nice clarity to everything across the board it is exaggerated like don't get me wrong it is a v-shaped equalizer because it's not a reference monitor it's it's a speaker designed for listening it's trying to color it up and make it sound fun so the bass is still really punchy and impressive and that's also where these microphones come in first of all it needs those mics to hear you say commands from like 20-plus feet away over the music it's already playing pretty loud and it does a pretty good job at that but it also uses those mics for what's called smart sound see when speakers get big enough they can produce frequencies so low that they literally bounce off the walls in the room you're in like I'm sure you've been in a room where the sound just resonates everywhere and it overpowers everything else this is supposed to eliminate that it uses the microphones to measure the acoustics of the room it's in figure out how close the nearest wall is so it's not overpowering you with base and then makes its adjustments accordingly it doesn't seem to make a drastic difference to me in the way it sounds like it sounds good anyway but the idea is really smart it's machine learning and the speaker definitely likes to be in the corner of a room in the first place it's not an omnidirectional speaker like the home mini or like a 360 degree sound all the audio is going in one direction so you tend to put it near a wall or somewhere in the corner and then let it fill the room from there and you can also control the sound via the app so if you want to add more or less basing or already getting you can do that pretty easily so that's what you're getting it's a kind of hyper smart premium speaker you're just dragging in the best of both worlds most smart speakers like Alexa and the other Google homes don't have the really really nice rich high quality sound and stereo speakers but most high-quality speaker systems don't have the machine learning and the Google assistant built-in and less you could grab a chromecast Audio 35 bucks plug it into some existing nice speakers and then get Google home many 49 bucks and set the default audio output of the Google home to be that chromecast Audio so it's always using those speakers boom and now you have your smart speakers I really do like this thing now I'm not gonna lie like I already liked the original Google home this thing does all the exact same stuff the Google home does but sounds a million times better just makes me more likely to use it more like the listen to music on it things like that if you don't already know having a Google home is like this never-ending discovery of just asking it stuff and finding out cool things that can do hey Google play the song that goes now I really wish that I knew how to swim alright I'll make a man out of you by Donny Osmond playing on Spotify hey Google stop playing hey Google change your voice here is an example of my other voice would you like me to use this one No is this thing really worth the money at 400 bucks it's definitely not an insta buy for most people I say wait until the Apple home pod comes out not because you might buy that instead well you might buy that instead but that's supposed to come out of 350 bucks and once it does I wouldn't be surprised to see the price of this drop to match that they're still pretty different in a lot of ways Google assistant is way better than Siri home pods like half the size but it'll have some different smart audio features and I think that'll make it competitive but if that doesn't convince you then you'll probably just be better off getting the original Google home and then you can use the money you save to buy an actual nice set of bookshelf speakers or TV speakers or whatever you want but until then I actually really like this thing I happen to fall in the extremely narrow niche of people who will love it and I do and I'm keeping it that's been it thanks for watching talk together the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what's up guys I'm poppy HD here and this is the iPhone 8 review and yes I know iPhone 10 is like right around the corner this is true but as of right now this is the newest and best iPhone so here's the thing this is actually a really great phone in a lot of ways but it's gonna tend to go under the radar and really the only reason I'm telling you to probably skip this is because of that iPhone 10 it's just better but I'm gonna try to review this phone in a vacuum as if we don't know that this is about to be one-upped so this is everything you need to know about iPhone 8 so on the outside aesthetically it's very similar to iPhone 7 of course same layout it's the same dimensions actually so old cases will work with it as well same camera bump same general look it just looks like an iPhone again the one biggest difference besides the new colors is the glass on the back so this glass is a bit heavier a bit grippier actually than rounded metal and a bit more fingerprint t naturally but most of all it's more breakable than aluminum so that's something to note even if you are using the strongest glass ever Apple it's glass the finish is really nice though as you'd expect everything on the back of the phone is underneath the glass so the Apple logo is no longer a cutout in the metal it's behind the glass that iPhone logo the text is behind the glass even the dual flash is under the glass so it's all smooth to the touch but the main reason they went with the glass is wireless charging so iPhone 8 now supports Qi enabled wireless charging through that glass so any of those wireless charging pads you see at Starbucks or on those ikea tables or at a Samsung users bedside table the iPhone can now use those two nice clearly not first but still nice it doesn't have to be first to be nice in fact it's really nice that the iPhone is getting Qi enabled wireless charging and not some proprietary standard because that now means we're gonna start seeing these Qi wireless charging accessories everywhere that work with all of the phones that already support it I mean think about it if the iPhone can make the Apple watch an accessory the most popular watch in the world then seems like the iPhone getting Wireless charge should also be able to make that pretty popular - thanks Apple and also if you thinking what I'm thinking then yet that Space Gray iPhone 8 is another fingerprint magnet for real reflections I can deal with that's just something that's on every glass phone fingerprints not so much they show up a lot more on the Space Gray but you can grab a deep brown skin to cover that up and it might actually look better with the matte black than the glossy Space Gray just on that out there so I'll link this one below so around the front the iPhone 8 and 8 plus have mostly the same displays as before still IPS still the same resolution and everything but they now support true tone which was something I was in iPads before essentially what it does is when you turn it on it adjusts the color temperature of the screen to match the lighting of whatever environment you're in so under certain lights that makes the display itself more yellow under other lights it's closer to blue all of it is to stay visually consistent to the eye it's technically less accurate but also tends to look better so I'm cool with it I leave it on as long as I'm not editing or like making something we're accurate color really matters really I'm just sad there's no promotion display no OLED display no resolution bump you know still 1080p in 2017 seriously you could say I'm even disappointed with the display or lack of a display upgrade but it is what it is it's still I guess the best IPS display in any smartphone also the speakers are 25% louder on iPhone 8 honestly I don't hear much of a loudness difference it sounds to me more like a clarity difference these just sound better but yet everything else knew about the iPhone eight is on the inside and that would be with the cameras and the specs so when we originally got this announcement I thought this would be some pretty minor upgrades you know slightly new camera bump we see that every year and of course then you specs the a11 Bionic chip it'll be faster but we may or may not notice that but these two things have actually really impressed me and turns out they've actually enabled some things that literally no other smartphone right now can do the a11 Bionic chip is ridiculously powerful it is the fastest ship in any smartphone right now and it's not close the benchmarks show it the everyday you shows it it's more powerful and more efficient than any other chipset which is awesome in a phone so because of this number one battery life has actually improved significantly because of this efficiency essentially it's not working as hard and is smarter about what cores fire up when so iPhone 8 and 8 plus have really good battery life in fact I'd say with the 5 plus hours of consistent screen on time I'm getting and a full day of heavy use ending with 20% seems like this is back to being the battery life king of the hill with the 8 plus and then everyday performance is excellent I mean iOS 11 is already pretty smooth on a brand new phone anyway but I made a separate video all about its best features essentially though it means that this is much more future-proof a super high powered chip like this should ideally keep the phone running smooth for years to come as apps and services get more intensive a prime example of that is all the new augmented reality applications this stuff takes a lot more processing power to run smoothly but like this sky guide really cool stuff like this has started to pop up for iOS that tracks really smoothly shows a ton of information over your real life and renders and high-quality color me impressed and then the super powerful chip enables some seriously impressive video features in the camera that again you really don't see many other places 4k 60 frames per second video and 1080p 240 frames per second slo-mo these are things you barely find on any other smartphone let alone an actual dedicated video camera right now I mean the new GoPro does it my red camera does but that's about it not much else and it's not just that the frame rates are high but the quality is really good 2:11 Bionic has room for much better dedicated image processing and it's excellent with things like noise reduction and high dynamic range and contrast and sharpness and detail and all of that they are also technically new 12 megapixel sensors so I give them credit for that - its new hardware new cameras for both the 8 and A+ also put a new secondary telephoto camera for the plus but wow I did not think they would be this good and yes I did get the highest ever rating from dick so mark but I wouldn't put too much stock in the comparative numbers there just know that photo quality has taken a noticeable step up and even though the next Google pixel is right around the corner and iPhone 10 with slightly better glasses also incoming the photos I've gotten from this phone have pretty much cemented it in the top 5 smartphone cameras of this year it's that good it right off the bat if you're in a photography iPhone 8 will not disappoint there's also the new improvements to portrait mode on the 8 plus so you can now take these portrait photos and adjust the portrait lighting effects during or after you've taken the photo and they try to mimic different types of contrast to you lighting if you're trying to take that to the next level they're a little bit interesting the first few actually do a pretty decent job I think they're likely to get better with software updates in the future the last two though with a super dramatic stage light they kind of looked a bit more like cartoon cutouts if you don't get them perfect so I would advise to I guess use them sparingly unless you want to be the first one with that stage light profile picture so yeah the camera is really good the performance is really good the battery life is on point I mean it's not a whole lot to complain about with these new phones except the fact that the design is so brutally outdated for 2017 in this price point in fact I saved all my complaints here for the end of the video ready it gets a little bit too warm when wireless charging I mean other phones I've used in the past couple years also get warm to varying degrees when they're on the charging pad iPhone is definitely near the high end of that spectrum and wireless charging isn't perfect you need contact with that pad and as soon as you want to use the phone and pick it up it stops charging unless you pick up the phone and the charger every time but that's not unique to the iPhone it doesn't come with the USBC fast charger in the box iPhone 8 is capable of some really fast charging speeds with USBC but it won't get those speeds with the out of the box wall adapter you need to pay extra for that that's pretty lame I wish they use this entire huge bezel up at the front to put a real front facing speaker even if it's only one side of the phone this earpiece really isn't that loud it's not adding much it will be better than nothing right now it's kind of weak and for this price of course I wish the display was OLED I wish it was a higher resolution too I wish it was a bit brighter but really I wish it got a lot closer to the edges I'm overall just kind of bored with the screen and the design at this point and of course it still does not have a headphone jack yeah obviously I can't pretend I think that's coming back but I have to say it it doesn't have one so that's iPhone 8 is it boring heck yeah you could say it's boring especially on the outside we've seen it before but for that a 11 Bionic chip for us nerds that really is something else I mean I'll say it again it really is actually a great phone but the only reason I'm telling you to skip this one is because we know iPhone 10 is coming out in like a month I'd say the only reason to get this phone over the upcoming iPhone 10 is if you really want to save the 200 bucks which a lot of people will or if you just absolutely have to have a smaller device that iPhone 10 does have a pretty big display so this is actually smaller than that or if you just really really need to keep touch ID for some reason but really a big part of why Apple made this phone and sort of fit it in with the iPhone 10 and the other prices so they could offer a phone and iPhone at each of these major buying prices all of these are for sale on Apple comm right now and that's a nice even spread it's a gradient of prices to offer an iPhone for any budget so the timing is kind of weird with iPhone 8 coming out right before iPhone 10 and is probably very tempting to pick up iPhone 8 but you already heard what it said so just bring all this money right now for what's about to be the second-best iPhone I mean it's not a bad phone but one the better ones clearly around the corner seems like it's an obvious choice to recommend that one feels weird to tell you to skip a great phone but there you have it but hey even if you do go with iPhone eight you probably won't be disappointed there you have it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what's up guy is mkbhd here and there's probably a lot of videos in your subscription box right around now I'm glad to click this one this one will be a little different this is your official unboxing of the Google pixel 2 and the Google pixel 2 XL retail packaging so by the time you're seeing this video I've already had a pixel - for around a week and I'm putting together the full review right now literally as you're watching this but I did want to give you guys a few quick thoughts as I'm finishing testing so obviously we can get these first impressions in the crowded hands-on area that was a little while ago but seeing the phone again in your own hands is always a little bit of a different experience so you can see everything here that comes in the box for both pixel 2 and pixel 2 XL wall adapter USB C cables 2017 smartphone starter kit dongle the whole deal this unboxing is of course of the pixel but then of course what do you know I've been testing the XL so mine is already fully setup so this is our second look at the phone and of course it's our second look at these bezels in real life but honestly the more I look at them the less ugly they look and I feel like they may also be necessary for the squeeze feature to activate Google assistant but I'll definitely have more on that in the full review and also the soft touch metal all the way around the body of this phone has held up pretty well it's a pretty medium to lightweight phone but it holds up to pretty much zero scratch damage and it's surprisingly good at repelling finger prints with whatever oleophobic coating they're using on it I like it but really what I wanted to dive into in this video is to show that basically in the time that I've been using this phone and the previous generations it's become pretty obvious that the differentiating factor when you're trying to pick which of these phones to buy for this one it's the software software experience with Android 8.0 Oreo on the pixel - it's full of little things and little features that you might call it polish but it to me it's just kind of things that make you go oh yeah that's that's that's really nice that's a good thing they thought of that that's maybe the best way I can describe it so while this isn't the most stunning hardware in the world there is a lot of cool stuff going on in a software department so let's break it down number one the Settings app is redone and cleaned up and sorted so different Android skins handle the ever-increasing number of extra features in Android in different ways you know some of them spread them out more some of them are very cool well this one is more into nesting the less used features but overall I think this is super clean you have a consistent theme you have the search function that works really really well it's white and blue so it's really easy on the eyes I'm a big fan of the Settings app in this new version of Android now number two is the Now Playing feature which is pretty freakin incredible so this is the feature that's supposed to proactively tell you what song is playing where you are on your phone before you have to even ask it to it works most of the time not all the time but a lot of the times when you'd experience that sort of a desire to know what song's playing when you're in like a coffee shop or in some place where music is playing it's usually a pretty popular song and that's why it works often but it's using the O's on mics on this phone and it's using pixels ambient services to pull from a pool of tens of thousands of songs which doesn't sound like much but that's usually enough based on like we said where you're hearing these songs so basically when it does recognize one of the songs you're listening to it works as advertised it shows up on your lock screen you can drag down your notifications and actually click on that song that it's identified for you and maybe play it on YouTube or add it to a Spotify playlist whatever you want to do with it it's pretty solid the only downside was I did get rickrolled recently I know you're judging me for that but it was actually way funnier like three minutes later when I saw never gonna give you up on my lockscreen thanks Internet now number three is google lens and this was the image recognition software that we're seeing both built into google photos and in the camera and eventually gonna be on its own its pixel exclusive for now and it's just basically starting to work on our phones basically google lens is best at identifying things with text in them it's basically doing a reverse google image search and anytime you do a reverse google image search adding text is really really good for narrowing down what you're looking at so this house will add photo I took is a great example when you look at the wide-angle photo with the whole shape of the camera the text isn't necessarily in focus and I hate google lens and it just kind of knows it's a camera but when I do a second close-up photo where you can see the text Hasselblad is more InFocus Google ends definitely recognizes that text and adds it to its search and it's more able to properly identify what it's looking at by adding that so overall I didn't go out of my way to use google lens that much but when I did it was really cool to see it didn't really approach me the way something like the now playing feature did it just kind of appeared in my face but I think this is one of the things that will also get better with time especially seeing how much AI is a forward focus with Google right now I expect it to and the number four is I just want to say the new picture-in-picture implementation for the new youtube app on these phones is fantastic essentially you used to hit the home button before and it would immediately go into background play and whatever video you're watching would not be visible on these phones you're watching a YouTube video you hit the home button and it shrinks perfectly into a picture-in-picture window that you can still manipulate and move around the page and use it in the background I want to bring it back you could tap on it and fullscreen the video again I think it's great and then number five the wallpapers yes the wallpapers on this phone are super dope normally I use an app called backdrops if a lot of you've been wondering where some of the backgrounds on my phones have been coming from lately that's the app I usually get them from those are the still static photos but these are different remember live wallpapers way back in the day on Android where you used to be able to like touch them to interact with them when they were brand new they were a little resource intensive you know the powerful phones could get away with running them in the background but not everyone could do it these on these new pixels are sort of like the 2017 next-level modern version of that so you go to load up one of these wallpapers and it looks pretty simple at first nothing too fancy here but if you look closely if you look closely on this one check out the cars driving on that road down there under the clouds these tiny little moving objects still going at a high frame rate barely noticeable unless you're actually looking at them or these these three little I guess they're hot-air balloons flying over Monument Valley again super subtle but you wouldn't even know that they're moving us you were looking for them or this one my personal favorite actually the waves crashing down on the beach at this well-known coastline in Lagos these are sweet and good news with this part is they aren't pixel exclusive technically they've already been ported out so I'll leave a link right below that like button to get these and put them on your own Android phone if you want them right now but yeah there's way more stuff I have to share with everything from like the little things like notifications improvements on this phone or the stabilization in the video camera all the way up to long-term battery life and performance all this will be in the full review I know I just did a video DxO mark but the claim for best camera in any smartphone yeah that also does hold up here so there's a lot to unpack expect the full review and a couple days a little bit down the road but this has been fun for the the first impressions on the unboxing thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] so we're halfway through 2017 on a streak I think we'll keep this going so of course I asked you guys on Twitter what you guys wanted to know from the past month and of the thousands of replies I can already say probably half of them were again about the 1 plus 5 now I did publish the full review so if anyone has any questions a lot of them that you were asking could be answered by watching the full review but there were some small updates so there were a few controversial things about the 1 plus 5 like camera performance old screen benchmark cheats etc what am i thougt so the camera performance in the screen those things were covered in the review but the benchmark sheets were something that I found out about after I published my review apparently one plus is still putting code in their OS that maxes out the CPU cores wanted to text that a benchmark app is running that is dumb that who shouldn't have done that I didn't use any benchmarks in my review but people who did kind of got hit for that my bottom line there is yeah it's dumb they shouldn't have done it and they should have stopped doing a long time ago but also it's 2017 why do people still care about benchmark if you're still basing your smartphone purchase decision off of how well a phone does on benchmarks then I guess this does have a big effect on you but I don't think we should be doing that anymore performance is a really pretty damn good off the board and you can take my comments about the fluidity of it and how well it actually works in real life over benchmark scores so I wouldn't put too much stock in that what are your thoughts on the iPhone 8 concepts vertical cameras and touch ID on the screen etc okay so the vertical cameras and all the renders we've seen pointing to that being the way the next iPhone camera looks looks a little bit weird in the renders but I've always said this phones always looks so much better in real life than they do in the renders the renders of some of the past couple of my favorite phones including this phone including a pixel and I think the past Nexus is they've all looked way worse and the renders and then the phone actually comes out and you hold the hardware in your hand and it's actually kind of nice so I'm not so worried about the cameras in the way they look on the phone what I actually am concerned about is the fingerprint reader location a lot of the rumors are pointing to this big full screen - iPhone with a fingerprint sensor under the display and I want that to be true so bad but I've also never seen that implemented anywhere in any product that means Apple can't do it I mean they've done revolutionary first-of-its-kind stuff in their products before but I've just never seen a display with a fingerprint reader underneath it under the glass ever so my fingers across that Apple can do this and do it well the first time around but I'm also not super optimistic and I wouldn't be surprised to see a fingerprint reader around the back or up at the front again of the next iPhone what do you think about the upcoming note Fe this is actually a really weird thing to me Samsung is going to be selling refurbished Galaxy Note sevens before the note 8 comes out as the note Fe why you would think with all the bad press about the note 7 and all the problems they had with it they would just completely abandon that project put it to rest r.i.p tombstone and everything just like let it go and we even have the note 8 like probably right around the corner and maybe two months we'll see that phone so a little bit confused about why they're coming out with note FD a refurbished note 7 doesn't sound like the best idea to me if you became a CEO of a tech company for a day which company do you pick and what would you do ok so hear me out I think this is actually kind of a clever idea I would be the CEO of Tesla for a day which number one would let me like go into the office and just look at all the plans for model 3 and model Y and the semi-truck and all the stuff to have plan for the future that would be cool but also that technically makes me the CEO of a rocket company also and also the tunnel-boring company I get to see cool stuff about like the Hyperloop and all the other stuff they're planning I feel like it would be kind of like a win win win win this is kind of a busy dude when is the USB type-c going to take over Apple definitely took the big major steps towards making USB type-c much more popular but I think once you see those accessories it being a no-brainer that they get USB type-c that's when you know it's taken over is Apple iPhone 8 or X going to live up to the hype no nothing nothing ever lives up to the height and that's not to say hype should die ok height is just marketing it happens a lot with a lot of different companies I'm just saying nothing ever actually lives up to that height I don't you do vlogs I'd love to watch mkbhd vlogs ok so the honest answer to that is I've actually thought about this question in the past and the answer is time so the thing about making vlogs in addition to all the stuff I already make is it means app so then have to edit all that stuff in addition to what I'm already editing which means it would take more time and vlog can be really cool I've seen some really great ones obviously but I think if I were to do blogs most of them would end up just being behind the scenes of the main videos that you guys watch so I think if you want to see that kind of stuff you should follow me on Twitter first of all but also snapchat and Instagram I think it's a definitely more time efficient way of sharing up subsidy guys trust me I've thought about vlogging it's just there's only 24 hours in a day you know next question is why were you in France with Casey night's debt oh speaking of lager so if you saw Casey's latest video the summer movie thing if you saw the end of it then of course you know it was shot entirely on Galaxy S apes that I can verify is true for there were lots of vlog shots and car shots and things you can imagine would be shot with a normal handheld phone but there's also plenty of drone shots and aerial shots and crazy angles but those are also shot on a smartphone as well it was with the help of a company called drone works and they were the ones that were responsible for putting galaxy s aids in these custom rigs with cine lenses and massive drones and getting these incredible shots from this technically a galaxy s 8 s camera casing and Samsung invited me along to check out the whole thing and I was super impressed with it obviously it takes the whole shot on a smartphone thing to the next level I'm open to like analyzing like really how far do these pros go like you sure you've seen those shot on iphone as that Apple makes how far do they really take those iPhones to be able to get those shots didn't be curious about that but anyway that's why I was in France would you believe your eyes if ten million fireflies box on vixy's beta one okay so I've talked a lot about Bixby in the past so naturally people were curious about if I was impressed with the Bixby voice update that's just coming out there's an early access program Bixby voice is finally becoming available to some of those people and you can download and install it and give it a shot and it's pretty bad I'm going to like the Verge's video below where they did some testing of it they asked some questions to be fair it does have some abilities that Siri and Google assistant and Cortana don't have meaning it can dig into an application and do commands from inside app but you can tell from the video it's super slow it doesn't get all the questions right it doesn't always understand you and also this was part of the video choose the president of the US hey when we've got not much wrong so I'm sorry sure Dixie has a long way to go surprise surprise good luck Samsung Tesla vs. Faraday future okay so anytime you compare a Tesla with anything else like Faraday future or lucid err or any of the companies that don't even really exist yet or are selling electric cars I've always said even if you make a car that's incredible every bit as good as the Tesla even better in every single way it's still not really gonna sell well because Tesla already has the mindshare and already has the sex appeal that these cars don't have yet just in the way people think about car brands and then they also have the infrastructure they already have the supercharging Network they make it really easy to drive electric cars long distances that those other companies don't have yet so it's funny to see an article labeling something as like a Tesla killer there is not going to be a Tesla killer for a very long time in the same way that there's not going to be a Ford killer because that's just part of the industry now and it's also definitely enough space for Tesla and other companies to exist in the electric car market there's no Tesla Killers yet demographically where do you have the largest following okay so once we got this question we actually looked into it a lot and there's some really interesting stats about the mkbhd channel viewership all of you guys so if I go into YouTube analytics I can check out which countries have the most people watching us a number one India number two United Kingdom number three Canada Australia Germany and on the list goes on but then we actually sorted by population size of that country at least on the first page to the Cattell who have the highest viewership per capita in a way so shout out to Singapore and Sweden for topping that list and then of course there's a male female demographic turns out we're at a study ninety-five percent male five percent female ladies and something I also have to sort just to find out if you look at all subscribers and unsubscribers from a channel in the lifetime of it the mkbhd Channel I'm almost proud of this in its lifetime has lost almost 1 million subscribers since its inception we should get a plaque for that that's that's kind of impressive 9 hundred thousand plus people have decided yet that that's enough I don't want to say anymore but also that means that the four point seven million subscribers the channel has now is just the people who have stuck around there's also a couple of hundred thousand more who subscribed and unsubscribed it's weird I've been curious if that's a common ratio or number for youtubers in tech or even in other genres or if that's even weird to talk about that I don't know either way I'm going to end it there thanks for all your questions I hope this is a fun Q&amp;A and hopefully you enjoyed seeing a little bit of a different part of the studio Studio B we're going to be right back on it with tech videos very shortly because there's a lot of stuff coming out a lot of stuff you guys have to see thank you for watching now it's off to get the next one peace [Music] 
the essential pH one essential pH one essential fo see what you I see what you did there hey what is up guys I'm Kim PhD here and this is the essential phone it's a new phone from a new company but with a not so new philosophy of just sticking with the essentials you know no bells and whistles no fancy widgets or crazy features or head-turning stuff just seven hundred dollars of the pure essentials I'll be using this phone for a little bit now and I have a pretty good idea of how well they did and whether you should buy one or not so that's what this video is so first of all the hardware is awesome and that's usually really hard for new companies to get right off the bat so I'm impressed here the essential phone feels great in the hand it's this all-black titanium and ceramic slab no protrusions at all no logos at all no branding or anything like that it's just an essential rectangle with rounded corners the titanium sides that material is actually a lot harder than your typical aluminum so that means you should hold up to chipping or any drops much better and the back which you could easily mistake for Gorilla Glass is not glass at all it is polished ceramic so that makes it much harder than glass making it way less likely to scratch it all but also theoretically making it more likely to break some ceramic is more brittle than Gorilla Glass basically what I'm saying is this would be a really interesting phone to drop test but no I won't I'll leave that to other channels well you will notice right out the box though is the ceramic makes the phone a bit heavier just more dense feeling in the hand and it's also a serious fingerprint magnet it's like a mirror finish which is super nice when it's clean but it will never be clean so definitely worth getting a deep brand skin on the back of this one and they can actually make the phone look a lot better than without the skin if you ask me this is one of those rare instances so I'll link to this matte black one right below that like button but long story short I liked the industrial design here it's simple not too flashy but obviously still has a signature look the only thing you're missing here is waterproofing a lot of other phones in this price range have some IP certification not this one maybe next year the favor this guy is actually pretty quick to recognize your finger but it always feels like there's a tiny delay when I actually turned the screen on and unlock the phone if you can see that it's not bad but you can definitely address that with a software update and the rest of the back of the phone is the mic and two pins for attaching small modular accessories and providing power through them so the one that exists right now is the world's smallest 360-degree camera it just snaps right into place with magnets on the phone which is really convenient so hopefully there are more mods added to their ecosystems sooner than later I don't have any of them right now but we'll have to wait and see how good that gets the speaker for those who care is it's actually really loud it gets very very loud but it's not like the best quality loud so there's no big dynamic range there's no bass or anything like that it's just really loud and it's also this small pretty blockable grill at the bottom of the phone and there's also no headphone jack anywhere on the essential phone so audio is clearly not a priority with this guy so yeah I guess the easiest joke to make about the essential phone is they didn't include a headphone jack which is essential to most people it seems kind of weird yes I do think they could have included one but they didn't welcome to 2017 I guess any way around the front is the 5.7 inch display with the sort of the signature look at this point the cutout in the top of the middle for the front-facing camera and the absolutely tiny bezels on the top and the sides originally I thought I wouldn't like this or it might get distracting or annoying but I can tell you right now that disapear is just a couple hours into using it and the phone looks awesome in my opinion with the thin bezels we just talked about this in the most recent video yes technically moving the display way up closer to the corners would seem to make it easier to damage it with a drop but the ceramic and titanium should also work against that and all the times that the phone isn't using the full display it just blocks out that bar to match the bottom bezel so it looks like a completely normal phone most of the time anyway it's also a quad HD display and it gets up to 500 nits so decently bright but not the brightest like I can see outdoors but I've seen better in fact the only real downside I can see with this screen is that it's not an OLED if it were an OLED you could do some cool tricks with totally blacking out the top and the bottom or you could do some cool wallpaper tricks where it fades to complete blackness up at the and you could do some cool essential tricks where you like only light up a display for notifications instead of the whole thing little things like that but it's not it's an LCD which you know that's just fine for now maybe next year but where this phone really lives up to the name the essential is in the software it is so clean this one is rockin basically stock Android 7.1.1 and I imagine it'll be getting Android 8.0 Oreo through a software update pretty soon it's already gotten two software updates since I got the thing and so once you get past the essential boot screen you get you know stock Google launcher stock Android notification shade just a couple google apps installed absolutely zero bloatware out the box the only third-party app installed on this phone when you get it is the camera app which we'll get to in a second so this is delivering essentially the exact same software experience as a pixel no extra features are buried in the settings no waving gestures or iris scanning no extra assistance or any of that the essential part in the settings is just to tick whether or not you want to send diagnostic data to the company or not it's just just Android it's clean the pure base essentials and so of course because of that performance is great I mean it's also because of the specs to you know Snapdragon 835 four gigs of ram you don't need the craziest specs to run pure android smoothly but this phone balls-out gaming is fine multitasking is fine hiccups aren't at zero but they're minimal and lag doesn't happen much at all except in the camera in fact you know what let's let's talk about the camera this is the weakest part of the device straight up so if you were looking for a reason not to buy this phone if you want to tell someone why not to buy it link them to this part of the video the essential phone actually has two cameras on the back a 13 megapixel color camera and a 13 megapixel monochrome camera and they're used together to enhance the detail and contrast and sharpness in everyday regular photos unfortunately most people will never actually notice this so the only other benefit just ends up being it can also take black-and-white photos in the camera app and the camera app is the only app that I've ever really seen lag hard on this phone and it's been pretty consistently slow it lags to take photos it lags when turning HDR on and off and it lags big-time when switching between modes if you have a lot of stuff going on so that's really disappointing and it's not even like it's a super complex camera app in fact it's one of the simplest camera apps possible every option available to change is shown on the screen right now so there's no other hidden settings there's no manual mode no pro mode this is it and then the photos themselves are pretty mediocre at best again you would think a phone at this price that adds a second sensor just to add detail and dynamic range would be great with the sharpness and photos something seems like it really focuses on photography but the photos from this phone are still soft they're lacking dynamic range they're noisy and anything but perfect lighting and often have the totally wrong exposure all together turning HDR on also didn't help as much as I thought it would you've seen HDR from other phones like the s8 and the pixel they're great but this one barely adds a little bit back to the highlights and that's it so the lacking camera and camera app here are pretty disappointing even the videos off it are really shaky and also disappointing the one thing about photos and videos though is they can be improved via software updates in fact that's usually the number one thing that gets the most improved over time with smartphones software updates but I've still never seen one go from not good to really good with just software updates so I feel pretty safe saying you're not gonna want to buy this phone for the camera well you should buy this phone for our the great stock software experience that's pretty obvious it's clean and pretty unique you could buy it for the premium build quality the ceramic and titanium as far as I can see aren't combined like this in any other smartphone you might even get it for the battery life this thing gets great battery life it's been really impressive for a 3040 milliamp hour battery and a 5.7 inch display but I keep getting four to four and a half hours of screen on time so it lasts comfortably all day you might even get it for just the little things you like about it the display the tiny notification LED right above the screen which gets a really bright or Bluetooth 5.0 or even the awesome accessories included in the box which are also first of all totally non branded no logo anywhere but also really high-quality and really cool to see a smartphone bundle Brady high-quality cables in the box that feel like they're gonna last a long time and a super high-powered 27 watt charger that goes extremely fast so the bottom line is what I would I recommend buying this phone and as much as I enjoyed using it probably not don't get me wrong it's awesome to see a new company get so much right in their first try but at the same time it is 700 bucks so it's kind of for me like it's floating around in that void of other really good smart phones from the established manufacturers for the same price you could get a Galaxy s8 that also has a software skin but also has a way better camera and also has waterproofing and a headphone jack all for the same price you could also get a Google pixel from last year which may have bigger bezels but it has better speakers and it gets the exact same software updates put way faster we can just wait for the new pixel to come out this year that will have smaller bezels and the new software so a central phone to me is a great episode one it's a great start and I'm excited for episode 2 when essential phone 2 comes out hopefully has 1 or 2 more distinguishing features at that price range that aren't proprietary mods and then I'll be really into it and I'll probably be more likely to recommend it but until then this is still really cool to see save your money thanks for watching talked to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
all right oh yeah oh yeah stream starting stream beginning alright so now I gotta look for the law looks like we're live yeah we are so I'm gonna get the link oh yeah more and more noise that's fine oh there's a chat what's good all right so where's my link then hmmm stream info sup guys oh man well here what if I go to the live yeah I'm gonna go to the channel hold on I'm sharing the links of Twitter has it I think Twitter would love to be on air we go share copy/paste tweet-tweet there it is alright there's not that much to let either I don't think oh boy yes so we are live what's up concept creator Oh concept creator yeah that's good the super chat is enabled it's up NASA is streaming right now yeah so the end of the Saturn Kissimmee is how you pronounce it Cassini mission where that that thing has been in space for so long and it's finally descending into Saturn after sending all that info back to earth much appreciated Cassini uh where's the can I point to it oh wow look it's right under there that's the thing that's happening right now um yeah it's good I can so I can see the chat and it's going extremely fast but like this this number if do you see this number it's it's 1,300 messages per minute you see that in the corner there I see that 1312 but super chat is enabled and so I can see that too Rick says go to bed so we've been up since like 3:30 4 o'clock this morning timing it out trying to see when to do this live stream so much noise but we're good now uh-oh the basically the amount of people that have subscribed in the last two days meant that this I can now just point to that this is happening a lot earlier than we thought it would hi hi hello hello I give away I'll talk more about a giveaway in a little bit a little little bit oh man that's like lagging the counter just a rolling counter if you refresh it maybe it'll like less ideally what's good what is up Gabe yes this isn't interesting way to spend money I agree I always wanted to ask why do you like wireless charging so much I always found it to be an inconvenient gimmick we have reversible charging cables now should know your opinion wireless charging is not a necessity for me but I do appreciate when phones have it and I think it's gonna get a lot better now that the most the best selling phone in the world the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10 are getting it it's gonna show up in a lot more places which means it'll get a lot better you'll have longer range wireless charging you won't have to put it directly just she goes right on the mat well how does that is that social base of all of the browser's fault it's probably the brothers well but yeah what's up did you try face ID doing a hands-on no so the way they had it set up with the hands-on area was they had a bunch of Apple employees like all out there with the phones and every single one of them had face ID set up on their own like on the phone they were holding so when they handed you the phone to to get your videos or to get shots or whatever which was rare but when they did it it was already unlocked and setup to that person's face so I didn't really go in and like take his face out and like add my face I didn't really do all that I would have loved to but I didn't really get the chance but uh yeah I do I haven't actually tried setting up or trying face ID which is why I don't have footage of it what do you think of the v30 I made a whole video about what I think it'd be 30 there we go it's like in that window yeah been dying to know how do you take a screenshot on the iPhone 10 i I do think that a screenshot on the iPhone 10 since it used to be the home button since that's not there anymore they could do a pressure-sensitive like press but I think they're going to do the way iPhone does it now which is just squeeze the phone one on the power button one on the volume button boom squeeze it screenshot makes sense right what's up hello way to go from Canada now you guys are awake early I mean it's not that early anymore it was weird cuz we were here when it was dark this morning at like 4:00 a.m. like timing us out and there was a fox right outside the door it's kind of a weird sign Firefox well Apple sells more singular phones Samsung sold way more phones with wireless charging shouldn't be much better already so Samsung has sold way more phones but a lot of those don't have wireless charging the ones that do have wireless charging the higher end ones Wow mad people are unsubscribing then the the war the galaxy note the galaxy s2 those they're still really high in volume but the iPhone is the phone that so many of these these third party manufacturers care about and that's why all these these mo fees and belkin's and everybody who's so dedicated to making iPhone accessories they're now going to make wireless charging accessories huge achievement marques I'm still have the freemen you've inspired me to start making videos to that is dope man appreciate that I'm glad you did too is periscope doomed no I think periscope and Instagram live still have their place but uh it's a YouTube's where it's at so we picked this number to go live at because oh man Matt unsubscribes I see I see you all now we've picked this number to go live at because it was going up at roughly like 400 an hour so now that's at like 700 it'll take less than an hour we'll be here for like an hour and we'll we'll talk we'll talk give away we'll talk whatever you guys want to talk i phone things like that yeah you should vlog your Tesla your frisbee your life will be interesting to all of us you're not going to be Casey but that doesn't matter I agree but I'm also like the vlogging would take so much time away from this that it's like almost not worth it like if I vlogged I wouldn't do half the tech videos and all the editing and stuff that we do now because then you have to edit the vlogs and it becomes this whole thing so that's why I kind of stick with the Q&amp;A s and the occasional livestream like this we are gonna hover at that 700 for a while cuz yeah we started is that when we started the livestream when it oh and then people thought oh man you want to switch to my screen so you can see if we can see that drop right now so all of you lovely people unsubscribing can see what you're doing this is when we started the livestream right around now it kept going up and then it kind of disappeared and then everyone's I'm subscribing again so you're doing something also the lifetime unsubscribes for the channel is now pretty close to a million I think the last time I checked which was like a day or two ago the lifetime unsubscribes for the channel is nine hundred ninety two thousand so we're at a pretty clean like five to one ratio of subscribes to unsubscribes it's just gonna go so low enough I'm not gonna talk about it anymore super chat hi marques from New Zealand how does a Tesla Model 3 compare to your s what is the biggest missing feature from the model 3 I'll say in short it compares really well the biggest missing feature right now is probably the dual motor option there's no all-wheel drive model 3 I think a lot of people who like pre-ordered one and like Northern States and Canada and up north would have wanted that but yeah also there's no - right behind the screen we're right behind a steering wheel do you think the next iPhone design will follow the iPhone 10 I am kind of confused about the next iPhone because maybe not confuse but I don't really know what to expect because right now we have iPhone 10 and iPhone 8 first of all the naming for the next iPhone do they get rid of the bezel iPhone and just stick with iPhone 10 and we just have iPhone 11 or do we go iPhone 9 and new iPhone 10 I don't really know what exactly is going down do we title this live stream because right now it says marques Brownlee livestream okay I probably I could probably refresh it for change it to yeah yeah let me get the link just to make sure yeah it says marques Brownlee livestream alright I'll change it to say the road to five million and then enter this is safe oh okay good looks like it sweet alright cool um yeah we can go back to one trying to read this super chat like oh cool you got yeah what do you think about India's new bullet train I haven't been on it I don't know unsub is for those who are trying to beat a five millionth sub about to unsub but then you have more unsub's and then you have two sub that's a really good point yeah maybe maybe stay subscribed until it's about to be no I'm not gonna troll like that you guys are all gonna do it anyway when you're changing your name to MK be 4k not HD I've definitely mentioned this before in a QA HD encompasses 4k 8 k Ultra HD super ultra HD it's all HD it's all high definition basically high definition is a threshold and everything above it is HD and 8k is 4k is so I don't have to change the name anytime soon yep forget iPhones how am pay-for LGV 30 I really liked it man I still have the pre-release unit at the moment but I made my video about the top 5 features of it and it's pretty nice iPhone is released another big deal is pixel 2017 do you think Google and Apple would have a close battle like last year or Apple has one already there's a lot of a lot of different opinions about it I think pixel XL to the XL specifically because the pixel to the smaller one is not going to be that state-of-the-art iPhone competitor it's gonna be cheaper but the pixel XL 2 will have the thinner bezels will have the top notch specs will have the first in line Android updates will have front facing speakers will have premium build will have one of the best cameras I think in any phone so for people who are you know phone enthusiasts that's definitely something to look out for and that'll be around the end of the new smartphone wave for the year and you can safely pick your new phone after that comes out but yeah it's a I do think it'll compete of course I'm an optimistic person I wanted to a few things did you have any updates on lucid air and the red hydrogen one love your quality Congrats for 5 mil thank you any updates on lucid err no any updates on red hydrogen one a little bit I did my hands-on video with that red phone and a lot of people were really into it basically when I was in that room with Jim he told me basically he was showing me the prototype of the body of the phone and he had a separate prototype of the holographic display in a different unit without the red stuff on it and he said within I think 30 to 45 days of when he was showing you that he was like within 30 to 45 days we're gonna have a prototype a phone with the red back and the holographic display so it's been that long now they now have that prototype and they're now choosing to slowly reveal little bits of information about the red hydrogen one including the actual display technology which is really cool so that's out there now but yeah I haven't shown any more myself since the video they're doing their own strategic not leaks but like reveals of things that's just my video is just one of those ways to show people the phone which I'm really honored by hmm what's up girl thank you are you going to take your pixel with you to Cali well yeah of course if we're if we're going to Cali for the event of course all right it was about to be the last hundred but then like ten people unsubscribed or a thirty why don't you make videos in 60fps not that it's good now just a thought I just I've never really thought it looked natural like sir I mean there's advantages to 60fps video but I think there's more advantages to resolution and clarity but I prefer 30fps when I look at 24 FPS video it looks choppy when I look at 60fps video it looks like just unnatural and weird what were your thoughts on the Steve Jobs theater what was the vibe of the of the room during that opening sequence honestly that theater was really cool I took a bunch of photos of it from inside I still don't know how they hold the ceiling up I don't know if you guys saw that tweet but the top floor of the theater is all glass completely surrounding you oh I got to find a picture of it it's all glass and then the ceiling on top of it Steve Jobs theater oh yeah here we go you want to show my screen right now there's some good photos of like people who got one to the event took pictures of it but like how do you how do you hold the ceiling up I don't know so like inside each of those little glass panes in between them there is like a small like metal rod maybe an inch wide but that doesn't explain holding up the ceiling does it here's it this is a good angle right here it's like a bowl anyway it was really cool architectural II it was like a quarter of a mile away you could see down the hill was apples giant spaceships circle campus it is huge but yeah we were wondering as we saw it like we were in it like how do you back under nine hundred yeah we were wondering how how how do you hold the ceiling up downstairs as a theater itself and it was really it was really cool it was a quality theater amphitheater style like it's the stage at the bottom the audience up above him the mood was pretty chill during that opening sequence it was the designated of course the 10th anniversary iPhone to Steve Jobs but ya know I think it was pretty cool but you go to one again oh my god 50 people's unsubscribe just vice I think when they see a number they like they just hit unsubscribe or subscribe or the chat there it is what do you think about Samsung wanting to release a foldable galaxy next year I like it I mean I don't know how useful the fold will be I definitely have talked about foldable smartphones in the past but I don't know Smyly reviews thank you to five million thanks for the awesome videos thank you for watching them I haven't said that a whole lot lately but the fact that there's so many of you who actually come back and watch the videos over and over again is the reason I'm able to make them I wouldn't be able to go to the Apple event if Apple didn't see a value in inviting me there and the value they see is I get to share their product with you guys so thanks for that thanks for watching the videos and I'm glad you enjoy them that's what I want to do 850 it's gonna be 54 for a while do you think Bixby will ever be able to compete yeah sometime just not now Bixby has had so many false false positives like okay Bixby supposed to recognize like I'm saying it now it's not recognizing but if I say yo Bixby it's supposed to light up and start listening and that time it worked that's my key with phrase is yo Bixby but sometimes it's just lights up for no reason like I'll be watching a video where someone says like yo trick shots huh and it'll just light up or actually the other day I was editing and or not editing I was typing before we're editing and just typing and just lit up and started listening like hello what what did you say what I don't know it's a very sensitive to its name even though clearly I didn't say anything beside the seems inferior to touch ID for a variety of reasons do you think Apple has started to prioritize design over user experience form over function how dare you yes/no form over function is definitely a thing um I think here's a question I could ask you guys this iPhone 10 the way I think this one down and why they went so all-in with face ID is because they couldn't fit the fingerprint reader under the glass in time if this is true next year they could put the fingerprint reader under the glass but they still have face ID I guess they don't abandon the face ID but they can offer touch ID again and it would kind of seem like you're backing off because the way we saw the event they're like all face ID is the future you don't need touch ID anymore this replaces it you're all good don't even worry about it and that makes it seem like all right we're done with touch ID in the next like three years like it won't be on any other there's touch ID on this MacBook Pro there's touch ID on the iPhone eight there's still touch ID out there but they made it seem like they're moving on like we're gonna have face ID in MacBook Pros and face ID and all the new iPhones but I think if they can get a fingerprint reader under the display like is planned with many others maybe uh maybe they bring it back maybe they never abandon it in the first place and we just have this little awkward pre abandonment step thanks for all your hard work Thank You Phil really Congrats bro I make similar tech videos but in Spanish hope someday to grow to be as big as you that's awesome I've met a lot of people I met a lot of people at the Apple event who are like hey I make tech videos like you but in insert country here or answer language here that's pretty cool hi from Australia pixel to leeks dots I made a whole video on my pixel two leeks thoughts I'm currently lining up for the iPhone 810 days early to gain exposure to my channel could you give it a shoutout so you're like at the store now bro why would you do that oh man Oh what just happened Wow Wow how many of you were on that and button sitting on that button that's a lot of you guys on that button holy smokes yeah it's like a spike uh cool oh that went a lot faster wow that went way faster than I thought it would well geez thank you guys thanks to the 400 of you who just unsubscribes to go re-subscribe oh boy that was crazy and it was like it's exactly 8:00 a.m. right now so it was like pretty much on the dot that's funny what we did it will keep going for a little bit so I was talking about giveaways earlier oh wait we're talking about giveaways or oh yeah yeah there's gonna be there's gonna be giveaway we I try to do I try to keep giveaways few and far between because when you do a lot of Giveaways you get the crowd of people who's not watching the videos they're just in it for the giveaways so I do a giveaway every once in a while when I feel like it's worthy uh and I think this is one of those times whoa you got five mil and cassini died at the exact same time two great achievements at the same time don't butcher my name though I did yeah I don't know if I said that right I'm sorry the cusine you really die at the exact same time cusine is the the probe that was like crashing into Saturn's atmosphere today like the life yeah I'm pretty sure that's also live right now well that would be pretty funny I don't know if that's true but I hope you're right and that's funny the giveaway so yeah no expected here's the thing I want to announce what we're doing but because of some recent announcements the giveaway isn't right now the giveaway is gonna be in a couple weeks and we'll make it happen and it will be absolutely worth the wait and it will be on the theme of five million subscribers so that's pretty much what I'll say so if you just subscribed don't unsubscribe you're not gonna want to this is something to stay onboard for but again I don't I don't do a ton of giveaways cuz I don't want people to just subscribe for the giveaway and then leave you know so I'll make I'll make some videos in between now and the giveaway and hopefully you watch those Congrats on five mega subs is that the prefix from million Omega thank you do you think it's too late to start a tech review channel from zero subs Congrats man and well deserved thank you I don't think it's too late the thing about starting a new channel in anything right now is you need a niche so you can't just start a gym there tech channel that does the same thing everyone else does and you need a way to be unique in some way so bring your own unique perspective your own unique style your your own unique theme maybe talk about certain types of technology or you you do hands-on you dive really deep in a certain certain rabbit hole and nobody else talks about and starting from zero subscribers there's no problem there because you're filling a gap that's not already filled I think I see a lot of people starting YouTube channels now that try to do the same thing that's already being done you're not really you kind of are adding to value for people but if people can get the same thing somewhere else then they will so I'd say make unique and make it fun Congrats on five million keep up the awesome work what do you do in your downtime when you're not focusing on tech it's pretty much always Ultimate Frisbee it's we have the double practice this weekend we have a tournament in a week after that or traveling for that all the time there's a pro series there's that there's the Club season it's all its everyday bro man that's a funny spike though I don't even know to say it five Millions it's such a weird so like the numbers on YouTube obviously YouTube is like the universe it's like expanding with scale and there's no way to like fully understand that context but I remember like a couple years ago back in the day the first channel ever to hit a million subscribers do you remember that was does anyone remember who the first channel was to hit a million subs a million subscribers it was Fred Fred I don't know if you know Fred the YouTube channel that was the first channel ever to hit a million so there you go and it was like wow there's a million people who not only are on YouTube and watched videos but there's a million people who have heard of this channel and liked it enough to subscribe to it and come back to watch the next one and that's like a pretty big milestone like it can't believe there's that many people now there's channels with obviously 50 million plus subscribe or I mean there's one but the scale is insane and I would have never seen a tech channel going past a million let alone a couple million so it's still kind of a striking all inspiring to me to see that number and think that's a tech channel but I'm thankful that there's that many of you who come back to watch tech videos I just I just to say I've been watching and following you from years before you even finished college back when you're still trying to find the groove I'm proud of you bro and keep it up man thank you sir congratulations I some videos and work even after five million your main modest and genuine no fluffiness or fakeness we get marques thank you there's so many cake emojis in this chat I guess that's a good emoji for it hashtag worth it still can't add a tweet stuff man that's what it so fast you get on one plus new get on one plus uh probably soon I think that one plus will probably be pretty early on the update train right near stock Android quick updates oh but do you guys know what this have you seen this before this has been in the background of maybe one or two videos so alright you've seen like the little tiny Android figurines I've had in the in the backgrounds of videos or like in random videos you can buy a giant green android figurine and it's a smells like paint it's a cookie jar kinda or whatever you want it to be piggy bank whatever your deal is and I sent it to if you look up on Twitter I am sloth or Timmy ham really talented artist I sent him a MacBook Pro the black color MacBook Pro also but this is the first project that he did and look at the detail look at the paint look at the logo so this is like one of my favorite new like ornaments to just have around pretty sure I can wave and say hi yeah making sure yet okay do you think it could hold that probably not it's handled too far away yeah but can definitely be happy there you go now it's happy but yeah it's real I'm excited for that MacBook Pro I think that'll be sweet I think it'll be right here in front of me on live streams actually mm-hmm yeah definitely expensive the iPhone 10 is an expensive phone you got that right man I don't know I don't know what to do we got to we got to five million it's like just go to sleep now thank you thank you guys his iPhone 10 worth it so my the video I just did the follow-up video well that cuz oh I thought his name was Brownlee but what the last video I did which was last night about iPhone 10 the follow-up that covers a lot of the questions that people had about iPhone 10 so you did the first impression the video you know we got our hands on time and then I go back to the hotel I edit it I publish it and then I go to sleep and then we come back to the studio here and I've kind of like just been processing like all the things that I was seeing there and all the things that I felt about the iPhone 10 and so I followed it up with that video about okay is it worth it what are some frequently asked questions so you should definitely watch that video that's the most recent video on the channel bottom line I think it's people will pay extra for the better iPhone and but but at the same time I know a lot of people who are on like the last leg of their phone their screen is shattered it's slowing down it shuts down randomly the battery's dying and they just want a new phone those people are just gonna get iPhone 8 when it comes out and no problem but I think they might be a little bit disappointed when they see a new iPhone two months later that's better but also not that mad when I see it's $1,000 and they're like I wasn't gonna buy that anyway how much do you expect to earn from the super chat feature I have no idea and will it be good enough to buy iPhone 10 well I will be buying iPhone 10 anyway because I plan on making videos about it that's what I do but I'm glad I mean super chat is enabled so it lets me like get through some some slower foiling questions because the chat is absolutely flying do you explain tech to your parents as well so one asks actually mmm kind of not that much not as much as you'd probably expect it's more like like extended family during like Thanksgiving and Christmas where it's like hey my printer is broken again would you mind fixing it and then the next time it breaks they call you because you're the last one who messed with it that kind of thing my parents are actually not bad with tech especially my dad he's he works in IT so he doesn't really need me explaining things as much although I do sometimes still have to break it down a little bit greetings from all your Brazilian fans thank you Italian tech youtuber here inspired by you since 2011 just to say thank you hope I'll meet you anytime soon at an event here in Europe MWC yeah I went to MWC in Barcelona how long ago is that two or three mmm WCS ago and that was a lot of fun but um yeah it's kind of like I have to pick and choose when to go to those cuz there's it's a big trip for like not a whole lot of stuff but you kind of get to walk around and see stuff it's like it's like CES but for Europe you know I was just wondering this morning in the last five years have you used any phone consistently for more than six months straight as your daily driver I think maybe in the last five years yeah I haven't in the past five years I was thinking of the last year I think I think pixel Excel I used for more than six months because the way it kind of works is you have a bunch of phones released this is the time of year when the most phones are released because the holiday season is right around the corner you want to get your product offering on the table sometime in September and October so that by the time no December roll around people are buying gifts they're all buying your product so September a bunch of phones August October a bunch more phones and only get to January no phones get released to like April it's like January February March April a couple things show up here and there but that's the point where I usually use a phone for the longest period of time so I think last year I used pixel excel from like when it came out October from October until probably when the note or the oneplus came out so a couple months oh yeah that's usually out goes that's the that's the drill with the way phones work what is this hey from Mumbai India quick question what if I what if I blow scrolling what if I plan to make videos but this stuff I interests me smartphones tablets etc is the same as most other people well my content and style be enough to differentiate my videos short answer is it has to be uh because yeah a lot of people will make videos about computers and tablets and smartphones and headphones and cases and stuff accessories so yeah it's got to be the style and what you're actually making and how you talk about it that differentiates you if the products don't cake cake cake in HD appreciate that man what advice would you give someone who is pretty deeply rooted in Apple ecosystem and looking into switching to Android - yeah if you're deeply rooted the hardest thing to switch really is iMessage I think everything else is pretty close you might not find the exact same apps but if you use a lot of Apple services that's gonna be hard if use Apple Mail if you use iCal like you basically have to go into the web service export it import it into Google and then go from there but the the reverse way is always easy because you can access Google Calendar on everything so going from Android iPhone is super easy but Apple has created this thing I don't know if you know what it's called a walled garden where it's really pretty and beautiful and luscious on the inside but leaving is really hard they call me the mkbhd of India no not really but you're an inspiration mate trying to make quality videos like you Congrats on five mil all the best for 50 thank you for 50 150 mil Jesus you're awesome I appreciate out of content thank you do you feel any lag in the note eight I'm a bit used to stock uhm lag I don't think is the word there's some occasional delay that you don't feel in closer to stock phones but that's just the way samsung phones have been for a long time man mmm-hmm what's the future of Sony Mobile I saw a new Sony phone the other day and it had a huge forehead and a huge chin so I'm not really sure what to make of that I don't I don't really know oh want to talk about okay let me talk let me talk about the color for the new iPhone because I want to ask you guys this I'm gonna read the chat as we talk about it but the color of the iPhone eight there is a black space gray it's upright yeah there's a Space Gray which is which is like dark dark grey there's a silver which is the one we've all seen which i think is probably the least fingerprint II looking one but they both have a black front but with the iPhone eight there is a this gold color and almost everyone I've seen said they liked it I think it looks terrible am I alone in this am I the only one here comes all the unsubscribes i I don't think this is a good looking gold and we just had a gold the oneplus phone in here a second ago which is like an actual like kind of a gold color when I saw this at the event like I thought this was I who I actually thought it was rose gold so I've on X let me show you my clip for my video oh wait a second wait for it wait a second okay so the beginning of the video I talked about iPhone 8 this is the silver with the glass back and this is the gold and it looks like a I said band-aid color I've said it looks kind of like like a sandy sandblast kind of a look the outside ring around the camera and the side ring around like the metal around the edge of the phone looks like a copper sort of blush look but I don't think it looks like a good gold what is the chat saying not the gold or whatever it is terrible not gold sand color I want to send you with $1000 pink pink it kind of does look pinkish I don't know man I don't I'm not a fan either way you know what I did was today this morning at 4 a.m. I ordered the gold I ordered it I'll take a second look at it I think I ordered so I got a 64 gig gold iPhone 8 and I got a 64 gig Space Gray iPhone 8 plus so that's what I ordered for for what I'm gonna be reviewing but yeah those reviews are coming soon but yeah I don't know I'm just not a fan of this side of this like super gold color this whole web pages is like pale I think pale is the word that describes it I don't know it's weird anyway yeah this is this has been fun I am definitely shout to the Philippines shoutout to the Philippines this is fun I think we're gonna do a couple more live streams or the path over the next couple weeks but there's a lot of videos coming up that we're gonna be working on there's the QA for September there's a note 8 review September September there's all the Apple stuff all those reviews there's gonna be a bunch of pixel to stuff when that comes out and then everything in between all the I still want to show you the Hasselblad stuff I still have a bunch of other things to work in a thousand people have subscribed since we hit the milestone but basically I just want to take a second at the end of the livestream here to say thank you thank you for for being a subscriber I kind of talked about it earlier in this livestream but like again the reason I'm able to make half the videos I've made in the last month the reason I'm able to make them is because you watch them so I try to give you guys a bit of a unique experience when you watch the videos that's an evolving style I think about evolving style all the time and that's something we've been working on but uh obviously a lot of you guys are interested in the same tech that I am so that's why we're showing it and it's just been a fun ride I still remember like it was yesterday the video that I did when the channel hit a million subscribers which was I was sitting in my college apartment on the bed talking to see 118 to 35 and the same mic setup and everything and just like when I say we're getting started like we're just getting started like I really mean we're just getting started so that rings true the the evolution continues but yeah that's pretty much it all right stay tuned on Twitter stay tuned for new videos and for giveaway information since I know you guys are all into that let me just put this Android it's too tall all right shout out to everyone watch this this livestream catch you back on Twitter and YouTube is there a stop button over here you have it okay well let's hit it back 
hey what is up guys i'm pbht here and welcome to my setup tour for early 2018 I saw it I just updated my kit which is always linked in the description below but as you probably have noticed that's a pretty small list of things it's pretty minimal pretty clean and that's the way I like it and so this setup for me is obviously pretty video editing focus like that's most of what goes on here and so that explains most of what you're about to see that's on the desk that's around the desk because that's what I do here but it's finally different this was a Mac Pro dual monitor setup for a little while a couple of years went by and it didn't really change that much but now that it's actually different and I kind of mentioned I might be doing this soon this is the new setup so uh let's do it so I guess the first thing I should talk about is the desk itself so this is or was a next desk err pro I say was because the company that makes this actually changes their name to x desc so I'll link that below it is actually a custom size of it it's bigger than the normal air pro and it's a motorized desk so there's four motors one in each leg and you can lower it to a sitting height or raise it up to a standing height there's presets so I don't have to know where it is it just kind of stops it's pretty convenient so I spend a lot of time here obviously this was one of the first pieces of furniture in the entire studio when I first started putting it together it's obviously one of my favorites I've owned a lot of desks in my day and this one is really nice for having a motor in each leg it goes up and down pretty smoothly and pretty quickly and quietly and it also came with a glass top but I don't really use that at all I just use a straight metal it comes in white and you can choose the leg colors I went with the black legs so in fact the Apple watch is not very good at telling when I'm standing up or not like I stand up all the time but then the ring will tell me to stand up while I'm standing up anyway that glow back there on the back that is a Philips hue lightstrip attached to the back of the desk you can get different versions of this on Amazon for different prices but I like the Philips he one because I already had Philips you stuff and you can obviously change the color with the app but I mostly leave it white also on the wall behind the desk a lot of people have questions about what this is this is they perfectly aligned a acoustic foam and fiberglass panel array this is also one of the first things in the studio very proud of it so now to get to the things on the desk it would make sense to go left to right like we usually do with these so that brings us all the way over here on the left to the studio monitor speaker behemoth the Yamaha hs8 and these things are amazing these are an absolute workhorse and it's another thing I've had for a while since way before there was a studio or anything like that they are capable of incredible things way beyond what I'll ever need it's an 8 inch woofer and a 1 inch tweeter and they're internally amplified and the whole idea of a studio monitor obviously is to provide as accurate and neutral reference audio as possible these do that as well as any I've ever heard and they're sitting on these isolation pads basically foam and fiberglass blocks from RLX you can get fancier ones if you want but these do the job just fine which is to prevent the desk that it's on from vibrating or rattle actually Yamaha also does make an H s7 and I believe in HS 5 so much smaller versions of this cuz this cabinet is huge but I'll try to link those below as a matter of fact I'll try to link everything I name drop or talked about in this video replica that like button wish me luck so right next to that that brings us to this this is promised Pegasus r3 it's storage like that's it's just storage this is a Thunderbolt 3 external raid array eight hard drives 10 terabytes each so that makes 80 terabytes of fast access raid storage it's all hard drives but it's also super quiet just one fan in the back I was actually using one of these with the Mac Pro before but with an adapter because it doesn't have Thunderbolt 3 so now finally with iMac pro I don't need an adapter and speeds are pretty great but this is entirely for archiving right now so previous videos unseen footage all that safe and sound so that brings us of course to vi Mac Pro this is the one I've had since before it came out this is the one I made a video about it's the all-in-one non upgradable workstation performance machine from Apple and I got to say I'm actually really liking it so now like I ordered a fully maxed out 18 core version she'd come in the next month or two not that I don't trust Apple but I don't really think that new Mac Pro is gonna be coming anytime soon it might be like a year of using iMac Pro at least before that comes out so that's soon but for now this is that 10 core is the w I've got 128 gigs of RAM it's a 2 terabyte SSD on the 16 gig Vega GPU review is happening pretty soon probably a little after CES but yeah that this thing is a monster and it's sitting on a stand the 12 South high-rise pro it happens to match of course the exact space grey color of the iMac pro of course they did that on purpose but it does look great and more importantly it brings the IMAX display up to eye level for me and those little cover up here is reversible it kind of slaps on with magnets either way and I keep the card readers under there so the read mag reader and an SD card reader because I don't feel like every using the SD card reader on the back of the ims now onto the right hand side is mostly just the rest of the audio stuff so the headphones of choice on a whoo audio stand are sennheiser HD 800 painted by color wear so if you guys know headphones you already know what these are known for which is their performance their reputation is top-notch and they sound amazing they're known mostly for their flat sound signatures so they sound pretty good listening in music but these are actually amazing for video editing as well they're open back so soundstage is fantastic and they take a lot of power to drive which we'll get to in a second but when you finally get them plugged in and up and working it sounds like the vocal artist is actually singing directly into your ear it's amazing so then driving those is this little guy the Apollo twin mark 2 duo it's again Space Gray gotta love that so this is the preamp that is taking information from the computer and turning it into the signal that the speakers and the headphones will play it's plugged into both it's extremely clean so that's what you're paying for here so you can turn the volume all the way up to earth-shatteringly loud and there is zero hiss no noise it's dead silent so it's capable of again much more than I use it for but of course I keep it because I love this thing but also like who doesn't love a huge volume knob oh also the chair how could I forget the chair I mentioned I do stand a lot but when I get into the groove of editing that's usually when I'm sitting down the most so the chair of choice is this Herman Miller embody again another thing I've had for years this is actually kind of popular already too and let me tell you if you sit down a lot you don't want to skimp on the chair everyone in the studio has this now because it's dope I like it a lot so that's about all there is with that though also that cable management though come on - and then all the other miscellaneous stuff that's actually on my desk this is Hasselblad x1d it isn't always there but I tend to kind of keep it near me when I can and this is my slightly unconventional keyboard and mouse and trackpad setup mouse on the right Logitech MX master 2's Space Gray kind of on this aluminum mouse pad and then I also have the trackpad on the left so I use a trackpad mostly for zooming and scrolling especially between spaces in Mac OS 10 or Mac OS I kind of have this three panel setup going and I move between them with the trackpad but then for everything else I use the mouse so I'm not lefty I just have like a certain weird way of doing things people always seem to think it's odd but that's the way it is my smart phone of choice is sometimes also on my desk right now it's pixel to XL panda an iPhone 10 and this is also the new white 1 + 5 t they actually just came out with this little white version which I've been using for a bit and I'm a huge fan actually of the colored power button again seriously hoping this becomes a thing and also if you're interested in it we're gonna be giving away some of these on Instagram so stay tuned over there for a post coming up and the chance to win this phone now we got our red mags over here on the right some of the new business cards a microfiber sometimes my water bottle makes its way over there oh yeah that's pretty much it unless I bring something else over here that I'm testing or starting to use now before we even get to this part of the video I'm sure someone's already looked up how much each of the things costs and like made a spreadsheet out of it in the comments but before you even think about it that way not all this happens at once obviously in one move like I said I've had this desk for about six years now I've had the speakers for about as long this chair I've I've had versions of this chair broke it got another one it's it's kind of comes together with time the peripherals you go into the computer that evolves over time but bottom line this is all for me to make it as frictionless as possible for me to turn footage into videos and so that's it's it's what works for me I think there's two ways to watch setup tour videos one would be just you watch one and then you go out and try to copy it exactly you try to duplicate what you saw but number two is you kind of look through it and you gather inspiration from different parts of it you get ideas about how to modify your own setup and I think that's the way I watch most set up to our videos and I think that's what I hope you get out of this is ideas for maybe you do want to make it cleaner or more minimal where you get ideas from the way I set things up that's that's what I hope you get out of it in this glimpse into what I use to make videos so that is it that is the early 2018 iMac Pro mkbhd setup tour if you have any ideas or if you have any comments feel free to leave them down below again I'll try to link everything I talked about in the description but that's pretty much it thanks for watching touch you guys the next one face [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys MTV HD here happy Thanksgiving and welcome to Q&amp;A number 22 aka number 11 of 12 for this year 2017 we've done it every month it's November one more after this and then we'll see where it goes so I asked you guys on Twitter as I usually do what you wanted to know and side note if you aren't already following on Twitter you're definitely gonna want to do that in the next couple days I don't want to say too much but that's about all giveaway I'll link it below so Andris wants to know thoughts on net neutrality situation so honestly I have a lot of thoughts on this whole net neutrality thing first of all okay if that bothered you even a little bit then you should brush up on the whole net neutrality vote that's happening yet again it's almost unbelievable that we continue to have this debate but at the same time it is kind of believable so it's happening again I'll link below the beste guide or information portal that I can find to explain everything but bottom line it sucks Shen asks what are your top games in the past month that you've played on that bad ass omen that's a great question I think the most common like the most amount of playtime I've actually put into a game is actually probably that VR game super hot The Omen is set up right now as our HTC vive set up and in that little area over there we've played a game called super hot which is basically a game of like dodging bullets but time only moves when you move so you can choose when to dodge things it's really exciting and fun to play I also played a game called project cars we got a wheel for it we got a pedal it's paddle shifting it's the whole deal it's pretty fun but uh that high refresh rate monitor over there is killing it with the omen a lot of fun Black Friday question mark question mark or cyber monday question mark yeah I'm gonna go with cyber monday on this one and again I don't want to say too much but you're probably gonna want to follow on Twitter wink wink on your razor video you had rocket League wallpaper do you enjoy playing the game what's your rank if any I didn't know there was ranks or was it just a coincidence for the yeah I've played rocket League a little bit now the catch is I actually play it most often on my ps4 Pro on the wallpaper TV so I play the console version but that's what I'm familiar with the controls with now and I think I've gotten pretty good at it it's mostly my defense that has earned me a rep I don't score very much I don't know my rank but that is a fun game and they can it look like I have tons of time for games now I really still don't I don't game that much like I've played pub G twice ever haven't won yet I'm just saying my Instagram feed three days ago three day this guy's made a very good use of the extra character as you get on Twitter now but I agree with you dude I actually hate that Instagram moves things out of chronological order that's one of the reasons I like Twitter and hate the stock Twitter app is because things get shuffled I want to make sure I see everything and the only way to do that is to go in order from top to bottom or bottom to top I wish there was an option Instagram I could turn that off but there isn't I hate it this guy said why should I ask a question to be in the vid I see what you did there despite all the positivity surrounding the Roadster - what's one thing you aren't a fan of that's a good question there's a lot of hype surrounding that car of course I think the one thing most people will point to is the interior it's so not like any other supercar I don't know if you've ever seen the inside of a Lamborghini Aventador or a McLaren or pretty much any high-end supercar like that definitely way different the Tesla has more of a spaceship vibe gone with it but that still doesn't speak to every car person but my one complaint would actually be I wish shows a little more a little more carbon-fiber a little more actual carbon fiber parts but that's just me Muhammad says why don't you shoot an 18 by 9 dude I've thought about it a lot I don't know if you've seen I'll link Jon's TLD today his his iPhone 10 review was shot in two by one and he doesn't even shooting two by one that much but he did and there were so many shots in it that made me go now I want to shooted two by one that looks like fun and the conversation around content is well if all of our phones if all of our screens in our pockets are gonna be two by one now then we might as well start making these two by one aspect ratio videos which look really cool but I still think the majority of people will watch it on computers will watch it on TVs and of course phones are very popular but I don't think there's gonna be any problem with shooting 16 by 9 at least for the time being Armando says would you ever go on to the h3 podcast if you were invited no I would never go of course I would go on the h3 podcast bas 3m says how many terabytes did you record slash upload this month while I only upload the final version which is 5 6 gigs tops per video but how many terabytes that I record this I would actually have to go back and check which I'll do that but my guests before I go back and check would be I would I'm gonna go with about five terabytes let's go with five [Music] can you put us on to some of your favorite ultimate tech gear are there any high tech frisbees you know what I actually tend to be like the opposite of a tech person when I'm playing ultimate a lot of people wear like a wearable to keep track of like their heart rate and their steps I don't like wearing that stuff when I play cuz it feels like in the way and clunky so I don't have any wearable tech I don't really like have my phone on me obviously when I'm playing the closest thing I can think of is like the cameras and the footage that people use to record ultimate which is like the super sweet slow-mo clips but yeah there's there's really not that much tech as far as ultimate goes that I really know of hey but if you want to watch a bunch of really sweet super slow-motion ultimate basically highlight reels where it's really good quality ultimate and really good quality footage this channel that I'll link below is an amazing combination of that if you can go check it out that would be awesome prepare to have your mind blown out of your face well says are you getting the iMac Pro yeah the thing is like I've thought about this more they Apple when they announced iMac Pro they said December I'm pretty sure for this year but then they said the new modular Mac Pro that they're also gonna make was 2018 so next year and when I saw that I kind of figured like oh well you know that's just December and then January we'll get that right afterward but that's probably not what's gonna happen 2018 probably means like November December of next year so I think I'm at pro Wolff for me be the workhorse for that time and I probably will end up moving to the Mac Pro but I'm gonna give the on Mac Pro a shot rumors are already circulating of course about the next iPhone and its name what do you think Apple will call it and what would you like to see in the next iPhone also how do you think Apple will design it I kind of think we'll see like a similar iPhone 10 to this year but I do want to see an iPhone 10 plus but what do they call it is it just iPhone 11 there been rumors that they'll stick with an IPS iPhone and an OLED iPhone again side by side so like iPhone 9 and iPhone 11 but that what happens when the IPS one moves to ten do you do that they don't that's a good point that is a good point yeah it's not the move well we always have these questions of apples naming schemes but they always seem to pull it off so uh I guess we'll just wait and see the detroit borg says every year seems to have a trend and he's right 2017 was the year of no bezels what will define 2018 phones and I know look I can't tell the future so I'm just really speculating if I guess but there's something I really liked about this phone the razor phone and that is our 120 Hertz displays I would love for every phone next year to have an hundred twenty Hertz ola if that's even possible I'd love it but what I really honestly think we'll start to define phones of next year is artificial intelligence adding features via software there were low key a lot of things in this past year that became possible because of machine learning and AI that weren't in previous phones the portrait mode from the front-facing camera the incredible single lens rear facing portrait mode from the pixel to the dot projector from the iPhone 10 and face ID all that stuff even though an emoji seemed really dumb again a lot of this stuff was only possible through machine learning SAP says your top 5 social media platforms in order I'm assuming you're talking about like my favorites favorite ones in which case it would be Twitter I guess would be number one Instagram wait does eat is a YouTube a social network can i I probably put yeah YouTube's a social network so YouTube number one Twitter number two Instagram number three and then I guess I got to go Facebook number for Google+ number five sorry snapchat I put it away that's where I'm gonna end it thank you for your questions and thank you for watching this Q&amp;A video one more for this year and again if you're not already following on Twitter I don't know what you're doing open a new tab hit that okay that's about it thanks talk to you in the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys of kabhi HD here and this phone this Galaxy Note 8 this is the best phone Samsung makes right now I'll go ahead and say that right off the bat it's also the most expensive phone samsung made so last year's Note 7 kind of went onto the radar because of the sales stopping and obviously everything that happened to it but it was low-key one of my favorite phones of last year before all that sort of blew up oh wow that's a that's a bad joke but Galaxy Note 8 is again trying to be one of those phones that checks all the boxes and that is a great smart phone this is clearly Samsung's attempt at making their best smartphone possible it's swinging for the fences it's trying to hit a homerun so let's treat it like that and let's see if you should buy one or not let's break it down so if you recall some of my previous reviews I've had about five pillars of a great smartphone those five and if a phone does all those five things well then it's probably worth the money seems like a complete package I'll give you the green light to buy it recommendation is go Galaxy Note 8 does four of those five things really well like not just good but great but then kind of fall short on the last thing but then it kind of makes it up its own sixth category with a bunch of extra stuff that it kind of throws in there and doesn't have to nail this category it's not part of the essential five pillars I don't think but it kind of is why people would end up buying this phone it's what makes the note the note so Samsung's build quality has been on point for a while now this is a refinement of last year which is a refinement of the year before that and the year before that but you can see the display melts over the edges of the sides and gets pretty damn close to the top and bottom bezels it's not bezel this but I'd say that 83% screen to body ratio is very 2017 and it's super refined versus previous years like I said so the edges aren't sharp anymore it has this overall boxy shape but there's still an aluminum rail to hold there's no camera bump or protrusion at all on the back so it doesn't rock on a table and I honestly think Samsung has had the best industrial design in smartphones in the past two or three years and the note is no exception to that rule I mean they kind of played a part in making this glass sandwich design more popular in today's world of smartphones we see it everywhere now which some people don't like because of fingerprints maybe or possibly dropping it maybe being more breakable but even those two things could be easily fixable with some like a deep branch skin and that has zero effect on wireless charging the worst part about it I'd say is the fingerprint reader placement it's way up high next to the camera and on this really big phone it means there's absolutely no natural way to hold the phone while using it and be able to reach this fingerprint it requires a like a hand shuffle to reach it it's not a huge issue because you don't have to use a fingerprint scanner but I prefer for the record a fingerprint reader in the middle of the back of the phone so yeah for this badass looking super sturdy metal and glass premium fully water sealed like edge to edge display beautiful when clean type of look Galaxy Note 8 definitely checks that box and then the display it's also the single best display in any smartphone again somehow they keep getting better at this this time it's a six point three inch 20 960 by 1440 Super AMOLED display and it's gorgeous in all conditions I sent us a couple months ago galaxy s 8 and galaxy s 8 plus had the best display now note it's panel is the same resolution but bigger and brighter 1200 nits now versus a thousand and there's pretty much perfectly viewable outdoors which really matters when navigating or in a car or something and of course since it's an OLED colors are awesome blacks are pitch black contrast ratios are incredible it's super sharp it's even HDR 10 compliant and it still keeps the pressure sensitive home button at the bottom of the glass on top of all of that side note I still think this implementation is best we're probably gonna see a lot more edge to edge displays and phones this year and you kind of wonder what you do with the home button we used to see on every smartphone I think until we see that fingerprint reader under the glass this sort of pressure sensitive area to go home whenever you want is the way that we should do it but I think the bottom line here is in the display Department Galaxy Note 8 also checks that box and then the camera on the note 8 is still one of the best in any smartphone again it's rocking a 12 megapixel F 1.7 primary camera and an additional 12 megapixel camera with an F 2.4 telephoto lens and this time both have optical image stabilization making it the first phone to do that and the quality is about what you'd expect from Samsung it's the same characteristics you've kind of seen by now just a little extra saturation in the colors a little extra sharpening from corn to corner it's like a little bit less realistic but a little bit prettier than real life and I'm continually impressed at how well these things handle the more extreme colors and high dynamic range seriously very few cameras handle Reds this well in this shot the Sun is actually right behind the hotel but you can see the detail still in the clouds in the sky and in most outdoor shots you can count on getting detail both in the lightest and darkest parts of the exposure even this backlit shot looks totally fine and it's safe to bring this thing into low light of course as well obviously being optically stabilized and letting in a ton of light helps out a lot with that so there's a lot of good things happening with the camera puts it firmly in confident point shoot territory meaning if you see a subject that you just want to take a picture of just a double top of the home button point and shoot and you'll probably get a good shot so that second lens they added for that telephoto zoom I found it kind of hit or miss actually it's not as good as the main camera and I can actually tell the difference in quality with the 1x vs. 2x photos so sometimes I actually didn't want to use it as much I would rather take a photo with the main camera and zoom in a bit later which kind of defeats the purpose but so one thing it did sometimes really work well with was live photos which is their version of the portrait mode we've seen coming to so many smartphones lately so with the note 8 it's called live photos because you can adjust the amount of blur you have in the background and see the effect in the viewfinder live which is pretty cool you take the photo and then you can adjust the amount of blur after the photo is taken and it also takes a simultaneous photo with the main camera just in case that portrait one isn't good enough so we're doing a lot with that second camera you may or may not find it useful you may never even use it but the fact that it's there and it works well alongside one of the best main cameras in any smartphone means it definitely checks that box and then with performance this thing is a monster it has some high end some might say best-in-class hardware on the inside Snapdragon 835 Adreno 546 gigs of ram and it moves through Samsung's skin just fine that's not quite - the smoothness level of phones that are much closer to stock Android I feel the need to mention this like I noticed that mostly when scrolling through a lot of big heavy stuff or through multitasking especially it's not quite as fast but it's not really a big enough deal to be a bad thing like it's just a tiny delay I noticed because I use a lot of other phones but gaming and moving through apps and web browsing and all that other stuff has no problems on this phone but that doesn't mean I can't wish for a Google Play edition like old times so as you probably expect from a flagship that has these kind of specs inside it checks the performance box too so then we get to battery life and that's the one box I can't say Galaxy Note 8 checks it does not have great battery life this phone has a 3300 milliamp hour battery which would ordinarily sound like a pretty solid size but then you consider your packing like the world's brightest 6.3 inch smartphone display and then it starts to sound a little bit lacking for perspective the galaxy s 8 plus has a smaller display but has a larger 3500 milliamp hour battery so for that it has much better battery life so first of all the note has an entire column in the side of it that you have to use for the stylus so you can't fit battery in there and then also the fact that they kind of don't want to push the battery to the limits on the note because of what happened last time they tried that that kind of explains why it's a 3300 milliamp hour battery in this one so with this phone you kind of have to play the battery life versus a resolution game out the box you're gonna get this preset which is in the middle you're scaling down the resolution a bit so it's kind of like they know you're not going to get the best battery life and that right off the bat is gonna get you a little bit less than 4 hours of screen on time at least with my types of usage when you turn the resolution further down you can definitely ensure you get to a full day but that's a little bit less enjoyable and when you max out the resolution which they kind of don't want you to do unless you turn on performance mode which is the mode that maxes the brightness and resolution you're gonna get less than 4 hours for sure you're gonna get 3 and a half hours of screen on time and you'll probably have to top-up the battery at some point during the day so that's a pretty unfortunate stat the Galaxy Note used to be that phone that power users get because of the battery life I remember back in the early days of the Galaxy Note at CES like all the youtubers took this phone to CES because it checked all the boxes it had a huge screen and it lasted forever this is just not that same phone it does not check the box of great battery life now all that being said there is still the point that I made at the beginning of the video which is the note kind of adds this sixth category of the extras and from using this phone it's pretty clear that this is still the phone to buy because of the extras is these little things that this phone has that others simply don't it's the iris scanner if you're into that for unlocking your phone with just your eyes it's the expandable storage via a micro SD if you have a big media library or take a lot of photos and videos it's the headphone jack yeah that's that's become a thing many phones don't have now the full water-resistance the dual cameras and all their features the Bluetooth 5.0 with dual audio and everything that comes with that and the s-pen which I'd say is the best stylus experience in any phone right now for people who take a lot of notes or write a lot of things down so these are things that separate the note 8 in a little way from other phones and give people that unique reason to buy it as a matter of fact it seems like the only phone this one doesn't really separate itself from what those extras is Samsung's own Galaxy S 8 plus which has all of those things except for the dual cameras and the stylus and the difference between them is about 150 bucks so that really is the biggest challenge when you consider all the boxes you want to have checked isn't worth the extra money to get a phone that also has the dual cameras and a stylus but maybe doesn't have quite as good of a battery life especially when you consider the galaxy s 8 plus cost less so if you're like me and you just want the best possible most complete phone then Galaxy Note 8 is definitely still to buy and you kind of just have to deal with the intermittent charging up during the day but you still have really fast fast charging and wireless charging so if that's available to you it's not a big deal but also consider galaxy si plus delivers a really really similar experience checks one extra box with good battery and cost a bit less money so that's a consideration if you're looking to save a few bucks so that's pretty much it thank you for watching talked to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm cabby HD here and the leaks are finally over the hype is done the speculation is complete welcome to your first look at the samsung galaxy s 9 and the galaxy s 9 plus so in general as soon as you look at it it's pretty clear it's a refinement of what we've already seen with the galaxy s 8 but there are a couple a couple of new interesting things worth noting so what's new with these new phones first of all the all new colors there's the black like usual which is stealthy then there's also this coral blue and this lilac purple and then internationally there's gonna be a silver titanium one again I mean yeah Samsung tends to be using the super cool color scheme for these phones I'm not the biggest fan I'll probably still end up using the black one but the mirror finish stays it's still super shiny and reflective like the past couple years this is probably a phone you'll end up putting a deep brand skin on to keep it from looking like a mess 6 seconds after you take it out the box but yeah they're keeping this look for now aesthetically though the shape and the bezels and the placement of everything the power button the volume rocker the Bigsby button everything is the same the one thing they've moved is the fingerprint reader now to underneath the camera instead of next to it which I of course actually like a lot there's no English fingerprint reader nothing crazy like that but this is definitely more reachable and in a better place than it was before especially on the smaller phone like I said though most of this phone is gonna be pretty familiar still the 5.8 inch and 6 point 2 inch infinity displays respectively still ip68 certified it still has wireless charging still has USB type-c still has a headphone jack the speaker got a slight improvement but it's still in the same place right at the bottom of the phone but they added stereo listening with this earpiece up at the top of the phone and from listening to it it's a bit louder but not significantly better in quality or anything the coolest new feature though is it got Dolby Atmos surround sound suddenly of course that is new though is the specs you got to bump the specs up to be a top-tier 2018 flagship so they bumped it up to get snapdragon 845 and four or six gigs of ram so galaxy s nine has four gigs of ram and galaxy s nine plus has six gigs of ram it also has 64 gigs of storage plus micro SD card expansion they've also added a couple small things now like iris scanning from the galaxy note and facial recognition so there's more ways to biometrically authenticate if it's not just a fingerprint reader but obviously by far the biggest change and the biggest new feature that people were looking forward to for galaxy s 9 is the camera all the teasers and all the leaks and all the hype for this phone raw focused no pun intended on that camera so galaxy s 9 has an all new camera system and when I say camera system really I mean the newest most interesting part isn't the sensor it's the glass it's the lens so okay up until now pretty much every smartphone camera is so small it's so miniaturized that they all have a fixed aperture lens you don't change the aperture they fought from an F 2.0 aperture down to F 1.9 down to F 1.8 F 1.7 they're all in this battle to get as much light into the camera as possible because that's a good thing but something to know about wide-angle wide aperture lenses and you know this already if you know anything about photography or video is the wider you go the softer it generally is so a lot of photographers shooting with their lenses will opt to stop down to F two point four or F two point eight because it's sharper there it's way sharper there than it is at F 1.8 wide-open so galaxy s 9 s new camera is the first I've ever seen in any smartphone that can change apertures it's a variable aperture lens so you can shoot at F 1.5 wide open super huge amount of light or you can stop down for more detail 2f 2.4 and you can actually see it physically doing this and switching when you move back and forth between F 1.5 and F 2.4 it's a pretty obvious difference when you get a good look at it this is super cool to me I've never seen such a small camera with a variable aperture before pretty sure GoPros don't do this most tiny cameras smaller than a point-and-shoot don't do this this is really impressive for a smartphone so the goal with the software is to quickly and smartly switch between the wide-open and stop down depending on how much light there is in the scene I was told it defaults to the F 2.4 and then it opens up to the wide under about a hundred looks which is actually a really low light which means it's doing it as more of a low light mode but I'm doing the switching you see here in Pro Mode which has a button for it so you'll be able to switch to F 1.5 whenever you want so I'm definitely gonna keep my eye on this for the full review gonna be testing it pretty hard to see if it really makes a difference and I have a feeling it's gonna be a pretty big deal if you can see the difference between F 1.5 and F 2.4 photos on this phone but until then fingers crossed and then there's a bunch of other new camera features tossed in there as well like it will do slow-motion video it'll do 240 frames per second at 1080p which is pretty awesome and it will do 960 frames per second at 720p so I did get to test this on the pre-production units it's super slow motion obviously but I'm not sure I can vouch for the quality that's why I throw the air quotes in there but even in this well-lit room you can see a lot of grain I'd like to test this outdoors though maybe with something super so like an explosion or something I think a lot of people don't really realize how impressive 960 frames per second video is especially on a smartphone where you're writing all that to the memory as fast as possible but it stretches 0.2 seconds of video to 6 seconds of footage that's like turning this into a movie now number one it doesn't record audio which that's probably fine you don't really hear anything important with super slow motion video anyway so it sort of overlays this music of your choice which is neat I guess but number two is it only records 0.2 seconds of video and we were trying this you have to get really smart about what exact fragment of time you want to record but they have this automatic motion detection feature where basically you tell it to wait for fast motion inside a certain box you hit start and then it waits for something to happen inside the box and records 0.2 seconds of that so you can frame it up and move the box anywhere on the screen it's cool when it works I'll try it out there is also in the camera a better UI for swiping through the different modes now similar to the iPhone there's better multi shot for noise reduction and HDR capabilities there's some Bixby improvements so it'll recognize it'll do object recognition things like what google lens is doing and it'll also live Tran late signs that are in different languages so that's cool and something else interesting was it will overlay makeup on you and then if you like it it'll give you a link to buy that makeup I guess that's pretty neat but there's even something they're calling AR emoji AR emoji are emoji an emoji ripoff it's a feature that uses the use of the front-facing camera to create an animated version of your likeness so you can use that to record and send videos of yourself as this animation talking to people or you can make yourself an animal - no big deal but bottom line all this stuff all this new stuff in the camera is what makes it pretty clearly the biggest new feature of galaxy s 9 so that's what I'm looking forward to testing the most for the full review definitely make sure to get subscribe if you haven't already to be among the first to see that but other than that it is for sure the phone we were expecting it's what we were looking forward to and it's still premium ly priced just barely below the galaxy note I think the one thing that'll be more interesting a note this year is the bigger difference between galaxy s 9 and galaxy s 9 plus they used to be pretty close and I actually think I almost gave an award to galaxy s 8 for being so close to its bigger brother as far as feature set but this year the galaxy s 9 plus not only gets a bigger screen and more battery but it also gets more RAM and more camera so there's a bigger separation there a bigger buying decision but either way it comes out March 16th and the pre-orders start March 2nd so just in a couple days so let me know what you think is this camera all this new camera stuff enough to get you in line to get a Galaxy S 9 or maybe you're gonna keep waiting on some other flagships let me know until the next one until the review thank you for watching talk to you later peace 
all right livestream starting well looks like it's live I got a notification on my phone which means yep we are live it works okay so I need to get a link copy URL paste tweet what's up guys we clearly have a lot to talk about but like we can talk about whatever it's cool it's just a title no big deal what's up hey hello hi bro hi hi hello volume is too low should I bring us closer let me know how I sound let me know how I sound cuz I see video looks pretty ok gonna get a sound check what do you guys think volume up increase the volume please speak loud should i boost it a little bit this this mic volume I can turn up right here did that get louder yeah the chat is flying how does this house now is it louder than I I turned up yeah I turned it up about 25% still low really loud let me hear it on the oh that's great that's there it is yeah there you go alright see this mic it's good it's got a little volume volume knob that's why I linked it below it's cuz it's good alright this one this live stream is titled phone updates hence the phones and plus a little giveaway updates so I guess natural place to start would be the giveaway stuff because that was that was pretty recent so the giveaway is pretty awesome there is obviously plenty of people commenting on oh god that's a lot of phones why would you give all those away and it's because I wanted like I said to give as many prizes away as possible there is a pretty hilarious reddit post actually about actually I'm gonna see if I can find it again about like here's why I think it's giveaways fake which is why I have these boxes here um first of all it's not fake fYI I would never do that I found it I'm not gonna link to it but I'll like read some of it which is pretty they okay so they're super analyzing the video obviously there's a lot of boxes in the video none of them have shrink-wrap on those that's because as I mentioned dbrand skinned every single one of those phones so they took the shrink-wrap off open the box take the phone out skinned it put it back put the thing back together close it that's why there's no shrink wrap on the boxes and yes every single one of those boxes did have a phone in it which is why I had all the boxes he mentions the boxes sound hollow as if there's no phone inside I don't really know how to quantify that but all the boxes have phones in them and we took them all out and I actually have a picture if you want to switch to this camera I have a picture of some of when we were shooting all of the 25 phones I don't know if that's glared well if it's even visible but yeah there's there's 25 phones all equally numbered red and black so that's a thing that happened and I'll share more of those photos probably later on Twitter but the other funny thing is they're talking about what do you say oh the I am me that I am the I stickers which if you've seen on the bottom of these these boxes is always on the bottom here like that but the way this Note 8 that they're talking about the note eighths the way the note 8 boxes it has a sleeve on it so they were curious about why all the boxes looked blank is because we hid all of the imei stickers because we didn't want everyone to steal that information or getting in the heads of the people who end up winning these things you don't want to give out these public IMEI numbers so we oriented all the boxes so that they were all blank you can do that by just taking the sleeve off and switching it around and putting the IMEI wherever you want so we made them all blank on the top just by switching them and that was that I think that's a brick that's about it people are also freaking out about the fact that that much money was spent upon on phones for a giveaway that's just how we do that's just the way it is out here so that's pretty much it for that but what I really want to say for the giveaway is this is a Twitter and Instagram giveaway so what we were talking about is there's gonna be people who try to scam you into thinking you've won it's gonna happen and because this is you know it's a it's a randomization from Twitter and Instagram D brand has their they're handling the entire logistics process essentially so randomizing the cross-section of followers on each social network and actually shipping them out and handling all the import fees wherever you live all that stuff so they have all the phones right now for that but people it's also really easy to just try to mass message that group of people let me just message everyone who follows Marquez and debrand saying I'm Marquez and asking for their shipping in their bank information for import fees it's not happening like that first of all this number 25th is the day all the winners get picked so if someone messages you claiming to be me or claiming to be dbrand some time between now and December 25th clearly it's not but then on that day of that's when you'll see all the winners get picked it's a just literally a random cross-section generated by code and that's that's how it happens yeah that is a read 1 plus 5 2 you will get to these is there's a whole bunch of a updates again for the whole title of strain but that's that's the giveaway update there's anything I missed there they just haters you did this last year that is true if you are curious about giveaways I've ever done I don't do them very often but last year I gave away a hundred one plus three teas and pretty much the same format cross section of social posts and whoever's following the two accounts is entered to win same idea they all got those phones they all were given proof on social it was awesome actually giving away that many phones so yeah where is the smartphone award 2017 so Nast that's a december thing so that'll happen right around the end of the year when I'm pretty sure all the phones have come out you've probably noticed one of these phones on a desk is not like the others this one you guys did tweet about this one there's a sad story this I mentioned in the review it's actually sharp at this point it's literally this it's not the slipperiest phone ever but it's a slipperiest iPhone ever it's got these rounded sides and it's definitely you can tell this was my daily driver I use this one every day um it slid off a counter or not a counter like a dresser and I left the room for like 10 minutes so this is what happens yesterday I had my phone up on this counter it was like face down like that just like a normal surface like this I think it was like plastic left the room and a couple minutes later I'm in the other room and I hear like this thud and I was like what was that sound and I literally left the room and I went downstairs because I thought the sound came from downstairs like in the kitchen I'm looking around like what fell did a salt shaker fall like what is the deal I couldn't find it went back upstairs one in the other room that I left the phone in and I find this phone on the ground that clearly committed suicide and people were saying put a skin over it which actually sometimes works but in this case because the glass is so wrecked it's a little depressed on this side and it's kind of sharp right here and not even a skin can save that one so yeah that one's over slice I put my sim in another iPhone because I actually have another iPhone which is pretty awesome but this would normally cost $550 at an Apple store to fix it's the most expensive iPhone to fix ever obviously that's a lot and it's the most expensive iPhone ever this one I think it's just gonna remain like this in posterity there's chunks of glass missing from around the camera it's bad alright I'll put it away I don't you guys don't want to see that there now it's now there's a clean iPhone on this table hey Mark is the question is I had are you how are you going to weed out inactive accounts and body counts that is a challenge and ideally none of those accounts win but that's gonna be up to dbrand to like truly randomize the process and pick the winners are the phones of the highest capacity I don't think so this particular one I think all the iPhones will be the 999 based model so what does that 64 gigs or yeah 64 gigs and all the notes are the 64 gig as well I think what is this I'm pretty sure the base for both is 64 gigs so that's what's up hi hello hi did it fall how did it fall anyway it just slid I said maybe it got a notification and like my phone like buzzed and like slid off the table but I couldn't I can't confirm because I didn't put it near the edge I would never do that that means it slid gradually over the course of like several minutes while I was in another room until it fell which is that's pretty rough yup all right so this is the Android daily driver I think that's the other thing people were asking about I usually carry two phones that's something that's been a case for at least like two years now I usually carry one Android phone and I carry one iPhone so for a while ago for me that was Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 7 plus and then iPhone 8 came out and I switched iphone 8 so the Android rotation is much faster because I'm testing a bunch of different phones lately it was the razor phone that's this guy the suite hundred twenty Hertz display the massive amazing front-facing speakers and it's a it's kind of a rock in terms of build quality but long story short like I mentioned in the full review the camera is so bad that it's an actual deal-breaker for me and I had to switch back to the pixel because the camera is that good and the thing is I think Danny I think Danny tweeted this with Danny widgets super-scientific tweeted this recently but it's something I think the same about which is camera comparisons for a while are not really ruined but will be a little less interesting because the pixel tube crushes everything in the camera department and it's not that close like iPhone 10 has a pretty great camera and then pixel 2 is still clearly better it's like when you have a clear 1/2 in the world in a sport it's crazy I don't know anyway so that's that's razor phone but that's what I've switched to so my daily right now is the iPhone 10 256 silver and the pixel to 128 panda I know some of you call this the penguin it's not it's a panda although I get why you call it the penguin I'm just saying it's a little late to switch what's good let me look at these check the chat is oh my god that shadows fly oh wow that would explain why it's flying what is good what's good all right here's another fun we can move on to one plus 5t this is a ok so again these are all phones and this is in the description besides these two these are all phones that I haven't reviewed yet one plus 5t I did a top five features on and I really like this phone a lot it's a well built it's kind of like a blade they didn't make the battery any bigger so it's still a pretty thin phone and it's got this red D brand skin on it so it looks pretty slick right now but this is a really good phone for under 500 bucks it's 479 I want to say the killer feature of this phone and I want to stress the difference between this in the iPhone 10 the killer feature on this phone turns out to be that face unlock which I don't know if I can demonstrate it here it's kind of hard to see I don't know if you can you see that is that on the screen right now if I turn this off pointing towards me it's hard to point towards me and unlock it it's the fastest face unlock I've ever used on a phone which has a lot of people talking about like well this is way better than face ID it's that much faster here's the thing those are two very different although they seem the same very different technologies so here's the difference face ID on the iPhone 10 is an entire replacement to touch ID it is a secure thing it does your phone unlocked but it also does your bank transactions your Apple ID your purchasing of apps everything it uses the true depth sensor it uses the front facing information bounces all these lasers off your face or is it it's uh it's infrared so I don't know if I can call it lasers bounces all the infrared dots off your face creates a depth map recognizes you in multiple scenarios if you grow a mustache or your face ages slightly it recognizes you because of a learning algorithm all this stuff face ID is really smart so that's why it does all those things but it also takes a second you take your phone in your pocket and then it unlocks like it's a second to actually get into your phone where everyone looks at now this new face front-facing camera on the oneplus looks at you instantly unlocks seems like it must be better right it seems like it must be better but it's not it only uses the front-facing camera face idea isn't use the front-facing camera at all it uses all the invisible sensors that you don't see this uses only the front-facing camera meaning it's susceptible to potentially some of the same security risks that would come from not getting that extra information number one doesn't use as much most much depth information I couldn't fool it with a photo I actually printed a photo of myself and tried to unlock it and like may give some depth and everything that didn't work but oneplus already acknowledges I think internally that it's not quite to the same level of security so they have a finger parameter on the back still first of all so they kept that so keep using that for the more secure things that's what it's good for but it also won't work in low light it won't work if you're super backlit these are all things that you can shine infrared light on yourself with and true in face ID and it'll still work this won't work at night face ID facial recognition won't work at night it's using a low-light camera it won't work when you're backlit because these cameras struggle in your backlit so certain things like that separate these two experiences and what they're good at overall though 1 + 5 t is turned out to be pretty freakin sweet for this amount of money what other questions you guys have about this 1 + 5 t or any of the stuff on the desk so when I was giveaway question if I don't use my if I don't use my Twitter and Instagram well my account be considered a bot and disqualified no as long as you're following the rules which there are only two followed both the counseling a win Steve Jobs dropped that iPhone what which phone here has the longest battery life during regular operation I would give that award to razor phone which right now is edging out pixel - and iPhone 10 probably pixel - in second place iPhone 10 and third place iPhone 10 battery life isn't quite as good as iPhone 8 + which has that smaller screen and bigger cell so I'd put that a little bit below of pixel but right now your best battery life that is actually the razor phone what's up what product you looking forward to most camera or phones or other cool tech honestly I have to say Tesla Roadster which is probably not the most common answer but I have to say it and I'm looking forward to that tech electric motors massive batteries and cars what's up fam marques thanks for all you do thanks for watching I hope one day my channel will be even half this size this is what I love to do thanks for inspiring again thanks for watching and I'm I'm glad to be in a position where the videos I make get seen by people who are also encouraged to make videos themselves is it worth upgrading from pixel excel to pixel to excel oh I've been having a few minor issues and it's very tempting so if you have been having issues it seems like you're looking for an upgrade in which case I'd say yeah this is a great phone to upgrade to but a lot of people are considering either they have like an even older phone and they're considering do I buy pixel to excel or pixel excel right now both of them are new in which case you could probably save your money and still get a great phone with future off software updates and a great camera and great performance and stock Android in the pixel XL the og but if you're having issues you will not be disappointed in this phone pretty sure I'd be curious what issues you have with the pixel though how's the battery of the 5 T compared to the 5 it's been alright I mean it's not notably better or worse people have been complaining about the fact that battery is not bigger even though it's a bigger phone and a bigger screen and that's because they didn't make the phone any thicker so it's still I think 3,000 million power cell but it's a pretty good battery life still no complaints from me have you updated the pixel to the latest beta and have you noticed a visual difference oh man that has been fun okay yeah I do want to show you guys this I didn't even put this in the notes but okay the pixel got an update you know how there is all the complaints about the display of the pixel - it's almost funny to me how massive of a change they made of like all the colors look muted it looks really dull srgb doesn't really pop for me and this AMOLED display has so much more range why don't you guys use it so they pushed an update to make the saturated mode a little bit more crazy I wonder if I can show this alright here's my home screen right now am i off with the glare is this good like that so that's the way I hope this comes through in the live stream it might not but that's the way the phone looks in the boosted mode now if I go into our display settings here so I'm making a lot of noise you have your colors this is the boosted mode and in a normal mode again I go home this is the the original srgb everyone's complaining about you know it's still pretty dull not too bad but boosted is what I've been using and people are complaining this doesn't really change much it's not really boosted enough I want that I want that Samsung full saturated look so what they did with the software update was they added this saturated mode and when you click it everything gets blasted in saturation oh man it's really hard to to show the colors here but like it's gone to the next level of like over saturation I almost think they like wanted to make people regret asking for it because it's so much more saturated in this mode than it is in natural or boosted so that's what I wanted to show you but it's I'll just leave it on boosted it looks lit religious - saturated you put it in a that saturated mode so I just leave it and boost it it's crazy though why no pixel to XL giveaway oh that's because this phone is even harder to get the henna iPhone 10 trying to get 25 pixel to excels that'll be pretty tough and also because the fact that I kind of wanted it to be that thousand dollar phone giveaway where iPhone 10 is a thousand dollars do you want to buy it maybe maybe not but if it's free I'll do it and then androids version of that pixel too isn't a thousand dollars but Note 8 is so that's the same thing on Android side thousand dollars do I really want to spend that much maybe not but if you win it it's great that's why we went with note over pixel obviously I'm sure people would be happy getting a free one either way what are your thoughts about a 5 inch screen with no bezels for a smaller phone I have a large hand but I find the iPhone 10 and s 8 or too tall yet I'll be nice I actually so iPhone 10 is a 5.8 inch display I would actually want a and that's corner to corner I believe when you measure it even though it's a little bit narrower I would want a bigger iPhone 10 display I think I would be cool with like a 6.2 inch iPhone 10 so that would be like an iPhone 10 plus and we've seen these rumors of it start to pop up now it's never too early for iPhone rumors but this is that 5.8 inch corner to corner and I think a 5 inch corner to corner like a smaller version like that would also be pretty nice the thing is Apple never really makes three of the same form factor iPhone it's always one or two so I don't think that's gonna happen but I'm interested to see how the handling next year how does the second camera on the 5 t work what is intelligent pixel technology that is a great question I don't know I would love to find out that shad is flying but that's my ok so here's here's the way they describe it to me and all of their logic makes sense except for the fact that I don't know how they do it their logic with the dual cameras on the back of this phone is you know we don't need a telephoto cam to do portrait mode we can do it with AI which okay great other phones are doing that too they still have portrait mode that's cool so what is the second camera for the second camera is a special low-light camera it has an F 1.7 aperture okay well the primary camera also has an F 1.7 aperture so that's a little confusing why is this second camera better at low-light besides that it isn't optically stabilized as far as I know so it's the same aperture different sensors are sorry yes same aperture different sensor both no I know oh is what's better about it they call it intelligent pixel technology and here's what they say it does is it combines it's also a higher megapixel count it's a twenty-something megapixel camera 21 versus a smaller megapixel count so the pixels are smaller worse for low-light this technology combines four pixels into one don't know what that means physically speaking but that gives you a four times larger pixel for better low-light performance and better high ISO sensitivity that's intelligent pixel technology and that's why it'll take that sensor in the lowest of low light scenarios here's the thing when I think about physics and like the physical sensors and what they do a pixel is a pixel no matter what if you take this 21 megapixel sensor and spread it out over this this area each physical pixel is a certain size and you don't just dissolve the border between pixels to make bigger ones like I'm not sure what they mean by combines four pixels into one so that's my challenge with understanding that and the fact that it doesn't work that well leads me to believe it's not doing the sort of magic it implies it does it's pretty okay sometimes but oftentimes the main camera does just as well if not better in low light so they probably could have just gone with one camera like the pixel two and and just focus that focused on that entirely that's just me though haha I haven't use any Android till now is it worth upgrading the iPhone 8 if yes 8 or 8 + oh you've only used Android well yeah if you watch my iPhone 8 review that's a pretty good phone - iPhone 8 and 8 plus are great I prefer big phones what about these other phones on the table since we kind of have them there I might as well steamroll through these real quick oh if your stream is lagging refresh the browser like if stuff is getting choppy or if your internet connections being weird or stuff's dropping off or if you didn't get that audio update just refresh it once it'll probably all be good alright the rest of these phones right okay so I have pixel - this is the daily iPhone 10 as a daily that's the thing we have 1 + 5 T which I talked about we have this phone here this is a kind of an oddball this is blackberry motion this is a not your typical phone is this in the matte frame right there not your typical for him because blackberry usually puts keyboards on their phones they didn't put one on this phone jeez you didn't put one on this phone they just put a full touchscreen and a virtual keyboard which looks like that or if you don't want to put it in the browser no thanks virtual keyboard looks like that that's the BlackBerry keyboard it's kind of a weird thing because blackberry are used to you know you people buy BlackBerry's to get either the keyboard or the business apps and everything BlackBerry does well it still has that still it's blackberry hub in there it still has all these blackberry features that you saw on the Prive and previous BlackBerry's but it's all touchscreen now and I haven't really even gotten oh if it has an activity button I've gotten the chance to use this full time but I'm just kind of observing it for now and what it does well it kind of stands up flat by itself so that's a good plus it's always good when a phone does that case in point oh god now the pressure is mounting I have to be able to do this yeah okay maybe not but flat-bottomed USBC speaker headphone jack big deal for some people there's a headphone jack the buttons are pretty solid clicky it's it's a lot of metal to be honest and the carbon fiber isn't actually carbon fiber it's this coated plastic material but it looks pretty cool so it's a blackberry again the fingerprint reader here is underneath this like logoed button and you have those those big buttons on the bottom yeah man it's it's still got big bezels can you see that still got big bezels top bezel bottom bezels pretty big so I'm not convinced this is going to save blackberry I feel like I've said that sentence maybe 12 times in videos but this is this is a thing that exists now blackberry motion good luck blackberry okay do G mix to literally just got this haven't even booted it up yet but remember the original do G mix I made a video about in the smartphone's vs. no 2017 versus bezels video with smartphones dang that was some weird span you guys are just blasting emojis don't do that don't be that guy this is the sequel to it I guess it says do G on the bottom again it has dual cameras and this orientation now it has a fingerprint reader on the back in the middle which is the right place good job there and put a lot of other weird this is a heavy phone and I believe it's ceramic which is why it feels like this it's a big heavy build has metal all the way around it has a premium look now so instead of what about red hydrogen damn I don't know man that's you guys were asking about red hydrogen like weeks ago like do you have any updates to that I don't know I all I got from red was what they told me when I made that video and that video that I made about the red hydrogen has everything I'm allowed to say about it so I don't have any updates nothing news coming from them but to people like me have put down money for it can't be about that time so looking out for that but yeah no that's that's definitely something what if that comes out right around the smartphone Awards that could be a weird one we'll see we'll keep that updated that's the do G mix I haven't even really used it yet it's just like here's your first look bezels are a little bigger actually it goes back to the traditional top bottom bezels looks like it has an extra sensor that I've I should really boot it up and use it but there it is mkbhd seems electric cars will be the first to experience solid-state batteries when do you expect to see SSDs in OSS bees and cell phones and other smaller tech solid-state batteries and cell phones I don't know exactly what that means yet so I'm gonna have to look that up is it in electric cars already because I don't think that's any different from the way it already is electric cars use these lithium-ion batteries we already see out there Panasonic's been making them for years so I don't know how long we'll see it in cars or in phones with all this tech in your life do you feel like you need digital detox if you mean unplugging then sometimes yes I just do unplug like on a weekend for Ultimate Frisbee or whatever I'm doing but highly recommend it okay this last phone then I'm just gonna blaze through a quick because it's kind of neat is what's called what is it here the box is pretty sweet and it's maybe one of the coolest boxes of any phone this year I wish I did an unboxing but look look at this how about that unboxing experience it all just kind of unfolds this is meizu pro 7 plus this is what the actual phone looks like and the one thing you may notice about it that's kind of weird is it has a screen on the back it has a two inch color screen on the back of the phone and it works by cycling between these various displays now it's still a full on screen and phone on the front which it has this impressing impressionable home button right now you unlock it by swiping up you go to multitasking just like an iPhone by swiping up there you go it's definitely got a heavy skin on it so if you're not into skins this is not gonna make you happy but this is a mazy phone so you kind of know you're getting into but the thing about it is people been talking about that screen on the back you have the settings for it right here secondary display you can set a different wallpaper for the secondary display right now it's the camera you go back and you can decide to show pedometer whether maybe it's kind of motivating to see how many steps you've taken every time you look around at the back of the phone I just wish it was more consistent with activating bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam there it is your weather if I had taken five hundred steps today it would show me every time there so that's kind of neat I guess it's not a life changer it's not gonna make me want to never use a phone without this again but it's maybe kind of cool so says why didn't you do a v3 review it's a good phone that's a great question because we've had so many other reviews and so many other things we've done in the last couple of weeks and months that by the time like it would be around now that I'm getting to reviewing the v30 it's almost like too late I did the top features video of it and none of that's different so that's kind of why I'm talking about it now whereas might be thirty they're still charging over there I meant to have it here but um okay do you think galaxy s nine will be launched soon keep up the good work Thanks no I think Galaxy S nine is gonna be April that tends to be when that comes out there we go V thirty so here's your V thirty this would be the most expensive phone that's not a flagship over here so it's not the pixel it's not the iPhone but it is more expensive than all of these it's about an $800 phone right now yeah it's still a great phone it's still great phone v30 in case you're wondering has the dual cameras has a super wide angle camera on the back instead of the telephoto but this might be the most impressive video camera in a phone well obviously of this year so likely ever has all the manual controls it has an s log modes so LG ready has great camera tech and now they're using it to capture extra dynamic range and extra information if you're a video person this might be one of the best phones to get to fill around with that obviously most people when they record video they just go straight to auto mode and they just hit the record button and go but if you're not that guy then this is a really interesting look so the 30 is quite unique has a headphone jack there you go right up the top note 8 iphone 10 yes that's a thing which of these phones will survive the long run PS I got the one plus 5 that's always the golden question I tend to give my nod to the flagships as far as surviving I've used one plus phones also for multiple years so I would give it a nod to one plus five for probably surviving the long run one plus 5t will probably also survive LGB 30 people have had the weirdest issue I've ever seen with LG phones is their boot looping which has happened as recently as did g5 I've seen but I think LG is pretty much certified pixel 2 and iPhone 10 definitely gonna last the long run Apple tends to update their phones for the longest out of anyone and pixel being in line for I think two three four years of updates is probably also gonna survive the long run so I give the nod to probably these two first for surviving the longest these two on the second tier for surviving the longest and then blackberry who knows do G the question mark and then meizu has their own rom so razor phone that's also a toss-up does razor even make another phone next year we're getting a razor phone too who knows hopefully I want to see it I want to see 120 Hertz Ola that's what I want to see do you have a problem with edge lighting not working well the screen is off on the note 8 no it's usually been fine for me it's pretty good for the alarm clock actually because I have the alarm clock set on my note 8 it would be set to like gradually increase volume and so it would start off the volume really low and then the edge lighting would kind of light up the table that it's on it's pretty soothing to be honest we're learning a lot about our a 6300 and livestreaming turns out a 6300 sometimes overheats when it's in a live stream for too long when it's on and the censors cooking so that's why we're talking to this angle for a little bit can we expect holy smokes that is exactly what I am working on can I confirm it someone said can we expect a portrait mode explaining video that's the exact title of the video I'm working on so yeah sure you can you can expect that yeah I deal with that all the time but yeah that's pretty much the gamut of what I wanted to talk through as far as this live stream goes anyone else have any questions people are talking to the super chat but not really a asking questions so there's plenty of fast moving giveaway update please I gave you the giveaway update at the beginning so if you want to scroll back to that feel free to look at that audio is behind a bit that may happen if again if any lag happens you can just refresh and no audio is out of sync now all right maybe that's queue to end it that makes sense so when it comes back to this one we're good got it well yeah no that's pretty much all I had to say for the live stream so you got your giveaway update you got your smartphone updates talk through a bunch of stuff any questions you may have this is definitely the time to ask we can answer a couple like a fast fast-moving what do you call it speed round or whatever lightning round lightning questions Bitcoin oh man Bitcoin Bitcoin see I took a class I've taken classes in college where we talked about Bitcoin and this was years ago and we were shocked years ago at how fast and how consistent it was moving and this is like I'm now two years out of college and Bitcoin just yesterday passed $10,000 for one unit for one Bitcoin and then this morning passed 11,000 in that time I signed up for coinbase and bought my first Bitcoin so I I'm in at around $11,000 for a Bitcoin I don't want to put a ton into it I think it'll be interesting to see if it keeps going if it starts to become okay but for the reason it's so hyped in the u.s. at least right now is because you're starting to be able to pay for things with Bitcoin a little bit more it trickles a little bit more down payments for cars in Bitcoin down payments for major purchases in Bitcoin large electronics expenses using Bitcoin to pay for it and because one Bitcoin is $11,000 you often pay for something in like zero point zero seven seven four eight one two three Bitcoin and that's cool you can do that but then Bitcoin is also convertible back and forth between cash between US dollars and it's pretty liquid so in a short matter of time you can buy ten thousand dollars in Bitcoin wait for it to go up to twelve thousand dollars sell it and then use that money to go do whatever so that's what a lot of people are doing are just buying Bitcoin over and over again and a price as people keep buying it just keeps going up as the demand keeps going up price keeps going up and it just keeps rising so let me check what it is right now I just installed coinbase this morning when I want to go do that how much is a Bitcoin let me refresh Bitcoin eleven thousand eighty dollars it's up one thousand one hundred forty five dollars which is twelve percent today so long story short really interesting again I haven't been investing in Bitcoin at all I just got in obviously it's not the ideal point to invest in Bitcoin but I'm just kind of curious so this will give me a reason to keep track of it a little more but yeah that is a that is a weird one anyway okay that's been it for this livestream shout out to the twenty thousand of you still watching I think that's pretty awesome I'm gonna leave this stream up probably too for people to catch up on all these updates and to know about the giveaway but that's pretty much it we're gonna cut it if you have any questions about the livestream equipment we used I'll link that below any of the video I talked about I'll link at below the giveaways below that's been it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one pace 
[Music] welcome to the unboxing hey what's up guys I'm Kip EHD here and this is the one we've been waiting for this is the one I told you to skip iPhone 8 for this is the one that represents the future of Apple smartphones this is iPhone 10 and while it doesn't say X anywhere on the front of the box people are pretty much always going to call this one the X I've just accepted that so this is your first look at the unboxing experience and spoiler it's pretty much exactly the same as iPhone 8 was and almost every other iPhone headphones adapter stickers that's all in the box but I guess it's a good thing there's no surprises here so you can see right here off the bat it's a really shiny chrome II reflective phone this is the silver one and you can see how shiny the sides are the Space Gray one though is a bit more toned down and so the only thing that was actually new during the setup of iPhone 10 is now you set up face ID during first boot instead of the fingerprint touch ID but yeah this is brand new and it's been a couple weeks since we last saw this phone at that Apple event so seeing it again for the second time is kind of a reminder of all the things that are new about this thing obviously the biggest difference is the display up front the 5.8 inch OLED corner-to-corner screen that fits in a footprint smaller than the iPhone 8 plus which has a smaller screen so naturally pretty much all the focus is going to be on that and the notch at the top and how apps handle it etc and I can tell you that aside from all the incompatible apps I've come across that are going to have to get updated my experience with the display panel itself have been pretty decent so far it's bright its contrast II well calibrated definitely not oversaturated like some old LEDs can be and just handling and playing with this phone in the studio here for the first time it's answered some immediate questions that I had about it from the last video so first of all since there's no home button obviously you have that swipe up gesture to go home but we were wondering how do you take a screenshot that is power and volume up so that's the new screenshot combo for iPhone 10 and then since holding the power button now goes to Siri how do you turn the phone off well it's gonna be long pressing the power button and volume up key and that'll get you to see that power off menu so those are two new key combos to memorize there and then of course I was reminded of how many gestures they're hard now to memorize obviously when you get rid of a button there's a whole bunch of swiping and gestures to replace it so there's a multitasking and app switching motions which are pretty similar but both kind of useful in their own way depending on how you use the phone really that's on top of a screen shot and power off combos plus long holding the power button for Siri and double pressing it for Apple pay but basically there's a lot going on and if you're gonna make a phone that's all screen obviously you have to be able to do it all without a lot of buttons anyway one of the biggest differences between iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 is the new front facing camera suite up at the top in that notch the IR blaster the depth sensor etc and all that enables a couple of new things with this phone number one is obviously face ID the setup like you saw was pretty quick and painless and it's been working pretty well since then for unlocking my phone and I've only really had this phone for a day like the rest of press but so far in this time it's been fine and it works as advertised as far as being smart and not easily spoofed you can see the little lock under the time when the phone is locked and basically instead of placing your fingerprint the phone will not unlock until you look at the phone like you did during the setup process and then once you do it's pretty quick to unlock you can see the little thing open and then you can swipe up to open your phone and sure enough it doesn't work with a picture of you it doesn't work when you're looking away it doesn't work when your eyes are closed it just basically waits until it sees what it saw during that set up process and it's good to go so no you your girl can't unlock your phone while you're asleep with your eyes closed for those of you who are wondering that I do have some further thoughts on this face ID versus touch ID though so stay tuned for that in an upcoming video and I do want to see if I can pull it with identical twins maybe just out of curiosity anyway with the new notch you also get a new front facing camera complete with selfie portrait mode messing around with it it seems pretty average interestingly enough that pixel 2 that I've been testing seemed way more like confident with the front facing camera portraits than the iPhone 10 now there's no doubt both of these will get better with time and software updates but just from turning on portrait mode switching the front-facing camera and snapping a picture these are the types of results you're gonna get there's a pretty big difference between the two if you ask me especially if you're looking at edges and hair and things like that and sometimes the iPhone just didn't want to blur the background at all just got really picky about the lighting but that's something again we'll be testing a lot more for the full review of this phone oh yeah and the new front facing camera suite will get you and emojis so yeah you can see in these an emoji is the physics of things moving around is actually pretty on point so if you're into it you can you can map your face to a cartoon animal head and send it to someone in iMessage but you still can't edit tweets though so overall there's a lot to test with the iPhone 10 now that I have it in my hands finally as a matter of fact definitely leave your thoughts right below that like button with things you want to see in the full review most likely things like battery life camera quality app performance all that good stuff but don't let me miss anything but until then definitely get subscribed for the upcoming videos on the channel thanks for watching yeah I'll talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what's up guys I'm VHD here and usually when you see a piece of tech that is way cheaper than the others in the category like way void cheaper you just a fall to thinking it's probably inferior in every way but the Moto G 5 and the moto G 5 plus are the result of Motorola and not really cutting down from high rent flagships but more building up as high as they can for a certain price and they've come up with this this year for 230 bucks they're still killing it in the budget game so I want to shine another light on this because of the fact that I keep coming back to that good phones are getting cheap and cheap phones are getting good probably the biggest difference between this gen Moto G and a last one is just the outside the design and the hardware the Moto G has always been this shameless lee apologetically plastic but this year it steps up to metal so all around the back and the side and the frame and it feels a lot better and more durable as a result now the looks are a little more polarizing it definitely still looks a little bit better because of the metal but it also definitely still looks like a budget phone it's the bezels that are still big on the sides and the forehead and the chin no doubt about that and it's a pretty basic design from top to bottom nothing too crazy about it button placement is standard the headphone jack still at the bottom all that is great but one thing that makes this steel a little more teeth is actually the chrome rail like all the way around the bezel you don't see that really in like the renders but in real life it actually does make a difference I feel like on the more premium phones the bezels are usually just more shrinking down or much more dark to sort of fade out the way but the chrome here around the rails is much more reflective kind of reminds me of the Galaxy Nexus just a little bit less curvy but that's not really a bad thing is just something you notice about the phone the one thing I would say I don't really like about the design on the outside of the new Moto G is that the old camera lump on the back I really think if this phone was the exact same size but didn't have that big bump sticking out it would look pretty clean but this sticks out of it so much that it's a defining feature of the way this phone looks the Moto Z had that big old camera bump because it was a fitting spot for all the Mota mods that fit on the back I don't think you had to have this big camera bump on the back of the g5 because there are no Mota mods for this one either way though overall the build quality and feel in the hand is a step up from last year and when you compare to other smartphones under 300 bucks which there aren't many of this sits up at the top pretty clearly in my book so the specs of the new moto G are also decidedly mid-range about what you'd expect a 3000 milliamp hour battery in this g5 plus and there are two versions of it one with four gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of storage that's 300 bucks and then this $230 cheaper version of the phone has 2 gigs of ram and 32 gigs of storage that is expandable though since the phone does keep that rare micro SD card slot and the software experience of the Moto G is pretty classic motorola mostly pure stock Android but with some enhancements that they feel will make it better and I really like that about them that's something they've kept where they really don't they don't have a whole skin on top of Android I don't have a whole suite of redundant apps it's nothing too crazy it's again near stock but when they have certain software or hardware features they like to integrate them to take advantage of each other so when they have an OLED display for example they like to take advantage of that with software so one main place they saw for enhancement on this phone was the home button and it kind of stems from a weird place from a being budget but this phone has a weird home button situation there's one big physical home button with a quality fingerprint reader down at the bottom but then there's no back or multitasking buttons on either side of it it's just blank space and wasted chin but then on the screen you can have fully normal software buttons your back home and multitasking but of course they take up screen real estate and not everybody wants that so their unique solution for people who want to use all off screen buttons is what they've called home button gestures apparently the home button is actually big enough to use sort of like a big glass trackpad it's actually sensitive enough to figure out what you're doing if you're doing a button press versus a gesture and they seem to work fairly well so when you turn these on it's a tap to go home then it's a hold for a second to turn the screen off then you can hold a little longer to get into Google assistant then you can swipe right across the home button to go back and then swipe left across the button to go to recent apps and you can actually interchange those last two if you want to swipe right or left another enhancement here in stock Android to the Moto G is gestures to go into multi asking you basically just drag the window up to the top I actually think this is better and easier to remember them before so you kind of dragged into the multitasking experience and dry out of it makes sense and then there's other little things like a slightly transparent theme in the app drawer and the Moto widget so you get on your home screen that show the battery and the time and all that stuff the screen off gesture that came with the original Moto X you have the double chop to turn on the flashlight which is familiar you have the double twist which launches the camera really quickly that's still there so all those gestures and all those enhancements come down to the Moto G again and they're awesome so I've said a lot of good things about this phone but it's not your perfect flawless fantasy phone it's definitely not quite perfect in order to get a phone down into the price that you get this one into you got to make some trade-offs obviously to cut costs for one thing it's still using microUSB down at the bottom which isn't a huge deal you could say that it's really just fine if most people don't use USB type-c yet but I would have liked to have seen USB C and then this is also missing NFC which was a bit of a bigger deal on a certain other phone but that phone was claiming to be a flagship killer this one's not claimed to be any of that it's just a lower priced phone so it doesn't have the NFC chip that may or may not be a big deal to you based on how often you use mobile payment and then the speaker up at the front if it's decent it's definitely not the loudest and not the clearest out there but the thing is it's better than most of the high-end flagship smartphone speakers nowadays strictly because it's front-facing so it doesn't have to be as loud because it's pointed right at you I just wish it was a stereo pair since its kind of weird holding the phone sideways and then having the audio come from one side of the phone and I think the camera is the area will you'll see the biggest drop off the quickest drop off from when you had a high-end flagship phone to this lower price on paper it's still a 12 megapixel smartphone with an S 1.7 aperture but it doesn't have optical image stabilization so you can get pretty good shots out of this camera when you're really well lit and when you're outdoors only you have a lot of light but as soon as you start to lose light you're going to see a lot more things like noise in the frame because it's raising the ISO to shorten the shutter speed to keep that motion blur down you're going to see chromatic aberration you're going to see a lot less dynamic range a lot more contrast and overall just a lot less natural colors it's not quite as good as an image processing and Motorola's struggled with high-end cameras and their best phones so this is definitely not going to be the phone you buy for the camera quality but at the end of the day when you start comparing moto G to a lot of the other phones you can get for the same price for $250 or less it becomes really obvious that this still falls as a complete package at the top of the heap so can we give the budget crown back to the Moto G I think so yeah I think it's going to deserve that this moto G 5 plus takes a lot of the cues from the bigger more expensive brothers but is also coming from the low price that the Moto G has always been and sort of elevating it into a phone that kind of feels a lot more like a premium flagship or at least tries to I'd even say the budget flagship has previously gone for me two phones like the one plus three and the one plus three T but now those are sort of creeping up into like 400 $450 price ranges they're kind of edging up there and starting to compete with flagships now so for the best foam that you can get under 300 bucks it's kind of a no-brainer moto G is holding that crown so if you're ballin on a budget this is the phone to check out because the one that's been pretty much it thanks for watching I'll leave a link to this phone below I'll leave a link to all my other phone reviews and other stuff below as well talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] can you watch a full five-minute video in 144p [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] you [Music] when can we get some mkbhd merch well okay so you may have noticed this custom mkbhd edition circuit design shirt that i've worn in the past couple videos this you can now get on sale right now it is a limited edition for two weeks so if you want to get it you should hop on that the link is of course below it's soft comfortable wear as well there's actually a couple different colors available and it ships internationally a lot of people forget I actually have done two shirts on auntie spring in the past I think the goal with these is to make something that you can wear and people don't ask like what is that you know you can wear it anywhere and it's just kind of a cool design that happens to have the logo incorporated somewhere and I think we pulled that off so yeah this design with the white circuits now available in a couple different dark colored shirts and this design actually has its roots and something else you'll see very soon but until then it's available right now let me know what you think how do you feel after winning love day so if that was really fun so for those of you don't know that 90 second video i did with the tesla and that sort of an ad the contest entry that we made that ended up winning and i was really cool it got shown on stage at the event all the employees got to watch it live i saw the reaction because i was there too it was just really cool I think we're shooting that video a lot was learned like obviously you can make a gadget review of a phone or something like that with one person because it's just me and my camera but with a car video it's physically impossible to make that with one person so it ended up being a four person team of us you know one person's driving one person's driving another car in front one person hanging out the back with the camera on a gimbal there was a lot going on and that's the first time we actually did those sort of moving car shots at different angle it took us two days of shooting and then the rest of it was just editing and condensing it to 90 seconds which is yes why the weather changed between different scenes in the video and yes that's also why many of you noticed the colors of the bags in the front trunk also changed its cuz they're not the same bags but I would definitely say the amount we learned both in the editing trying to cut something down into really short and in the shooting trying to shoot car videos you know getting roads and getting all the different angles and stuff will definitely be helpful as a foray into future car videos because there's more car tech out there and we'll be covering more of that the other video is that one second and third place were extremely well produced I thought the second place one the spaceships for earth one can literally be a TV ad it was really well done I'll link those below also if you want to watch them because they're really good also fun fact this is the first time Elon Musk ever tweeted at me ever mentioned my handle he had to go out of his way to find it because it wasn't I wasn't in the conversation so thanks did you ever get offers from media companies to work for them if yes named them okay well yeah I'm I'm not going to name them but yes I have if I remember specifically one when I was in college where I was invited to a certain media companies HQ you've probably heard of them they needed a TV tech correspondent to be on TV all the time talking about tech they needed someone kind of young someone pretty knowledgeable someone who is about to graduate and that kind of fit that role and I was a hundred percent not interested I mean it was an honor that they considered me and that they brought me in to talk about it but the whole like scripted TV story after story the hope the whole live thing is is not really what I'm into obviously I'm doing this on YouTube for reasons because this format suits the way I want to talk about things and the whole other thing about like who's paying you versus what you can and can't talk about that's also weird too so bottom line I really do like being independent and just using this YouTube platform to talk about whatever I want why does Samsung have serious issues concealing their future products than its competitors and why does it have too many leaks too okay so basically its 2017 everything leaks I kind of said this before and the reason behind that a lot of people don't really realize why things leak or how they leak but supply chains from these companies like Samsung or like Apple or like any of these companies who you see their products before they get announced it's because they're huge there are so many different steps in the chain between the time it gets designed and then it gets manufactured and then it gets approved and then it gets made all these different steps with thousands of people it's just one of them releases or leaked something a little bit it can be really hard to track and really hard to punish and also really hard to stop there's all these really interesting articles and posts about how like people will try to pay Foxconn factory workers who are working on iPhones massive amounts of money for that information because they don't make that much money it can be super tempting if you work in that factory and someone offers you a year's wage to show them what the front panel of the iPhone looks like and then you get fired but so what you have a year's wages a battle - companies are really big and they try to make sure people don't get the information about their phone and it's all secretive and obviously you're not allowed to talk about it but stuff seems to slip through the cracks every now and then and census 2017 it just gets amplified second what's on video when okay so the first what's on video for those of you are new was the studio tour of Casey nice that was shot that in the city that was a really fun episode number one my intention for the series is for it to be roughly three or four times a year which means if it's a really really big well thought-out production it's once every three or four months so that's kind of the rate we're looking at so we're looking at the next episode now and we're trying to make it as awesome as possible but yeah that's why you don't really see one every week because that would be really hard let's talk about the snake snake what I don't I don't know it sure I don't really know what you're talking about actually I just get any snakes so these guys these are little ball pythons I see bees because there's another one back there but our neighbors to the studio have a couple of them and so you may see them make random appearances and videos sometimes also this guy is an Instagram just follow on I'll link it below what do you think about Apple making self-driving cars okay so I've actually seen and heard this rumor a bit but what's interesting is in the past couple weeks I've seen these sorts of cars floating around the New York City New Jersey area I've taken pictures of them myself so I know they're like out there I see em in New York and I've seen them like on the Jersey Turnpike and it says Apple Maps on the side of the car like I get that but it's very clearly not just Apple Maps or way too many sensors on the back and on the top and all those measurement tools it just kind of seems to me like a self-driving car project if I'm looking at it from afar and it doesn't say maps on it but they might just kind of be disguising it as maps but the real question here is is Apple actually going to make a car I don't think they have to make a car to make a self-driving car project if you look at what Tesla is doing a lot of that actually half of that is the software behind making a car drive itself that's half a car company and half a software company between like making all the camera talk to each other and all the radar and all the sonar making all those sensors make the car self-aware enough to drive itself and avoid obstacles Apple they're also a software company so I feel like they'll do a ton of research and a ton of measurement and whatever also doing with those cars undercover to try to make their best possible self driving car software safety is number one convenience also very important but yet Apple could make a self-driving car project and never actually make a car as a fellow Model S owner I'm curious about the features you'd like to see in future software / hardware update well contrary to popular belief the software on the Tesla is not perfect in fact one of the most popular things or most common things I want to see is Spotify in the music player it's been like a long time coming still isn't there you think the pixel two without a three and a half millimeter jack is the right way to go after the pixel teased Apple during its debut okay so that is going to be a pretty funny thing in the next like year or so when all those phones that came out last year with a headphone jack that teased Apple because oh we still have a headphone jack and you don't when all those come out in this next year and don't have a headphone jack I mean it's not like Apple is going to tease back it's more of an i-told-you-so oh yeah I'm definitely not looking forward to that way it looks right now pixel - probably won't have a headphone jack that's the way it is have you noticed in your videos that you move your eyes on the camera monitors sometimes well yes actually I have I'm actually impressed that you have - a lot of times so the camera monitors right above the camera obviously sometimes I'm just like checking framing or making sure I'm still in the middle I try not to look away I'm trying to look here or maybe I'll hold something up and I want to make sure it doesn't reflect too much so I'm looking just to make sure it doesn't like that that could happen but I don't think it's too bad is it I try to look at the camera mostly at we're good with all time and this one chatter and I are going to go edit this video he actually edits like everything now which is pretty awesome so I thought together the next month okay [Music] come on untie yourself you can do this boy is he so upset good morning perfect you're definitely oh she's going hard around the neck hey what are you doing Mary Lazarus but that is definitely tight now she's tightening my neck give me that I'm not a tree 
okay what's up guys I'm kitty HD here and you might have seen earlier today I tweeted Apple released this adventure video with the rock featuring series I'm actually that got me to click it I mean it's a movie featuring Siri what could possibly go wrong so I click that I watched it it was actually pretty well done it was interesting I'll link it below if you want to watch the whole thing and of course it also got me thinking Siri did a lot in that video and it made me wonder if Siri can actually do all of the things that the rock asked it to do in that adventure so iOS 11 latest update build number three I've decided to see if this can actually do everything that they asked of it I also realize that's probably exactly what Apple wants you to do after watching this because it's basically an ad for Siri but I will pack let's try it AC read my schedule you had 25 appointments at 7:15 1:20 you're on the selling hey Siri read my schedule there's nothing to read okay so I don't use Apple calendar quite as much as apparently the rock does but if I did they would all show up there just like that Siri certainly my life goes away I found 10 reminders thank you very much hey Siri show me my life goals list I found five reminders the first one is drivable Getty then take a 50 megapixel self okay so this shows reminders specifically from Apple's reminders app so if you use the reminders app and you go in and you create a new list with a certain name then Siri can recall anything from that list and show it to you at any time so yeah I made one called life goals and I asked it to show it and it worked oh you're serious give me a lift ride to LAX this can get you a list of 60 seconds okay so I don't have lift but I you can get it to do the exact same thing with the uber app this is actually one of the more recent improvements to Siri actually reaching inside supported apps and taking action within them Oprah can get you a VIP in three minutes do you want to request it yes okay what's the temperature in Rome today the high temperature for today in Rome will be 80 degrees and the low will be 59 degrees totems pretty straightforward weather card is like a standard demo question of course that works also the rock you're literally hijacking a plane at this point during your adventure so maybe reconsider maybe put like a disclaimer like don't try this at home or something like that hey Siri Ruby in my last email at 9:30 a.m. this one sent you an email about mr. Nakamura can discuss your fashion line so this series command will not work for you if you use Gmail or a yahoo mail or any other mail service or third-party app or anything like that you have to use Apple Mail if you do then it will work apparently the rock also uses Apple Mail hey Siri show me photos of my fashion line huzzah what do you think it doesn't really matter well I think do you think so if I ask Siri for pictures of something it's just going to google it here are some images of German shepherds I found on the way I like that actually it dings it it Bing searches for your photos but if I say show me photos of my fashion line it just shows the first Bing search results for my fashion line which is just random clothes but when the rock shows the phone to mr. whatever his name was it clearly is not Syria anymore it's this all white background so that looks like it's in his gallery if he did all that with Siri he'd have to say something like show me my photos of clothes or something like that to trigger shiri to open the gallery so the language he uses in that clip isn't quite fair Siri texts Chef Ludo I want to cook hey Siri text Duane nice commercial bro your message to Dwayne Johnson says nice commercial bro ready to send it yes so yes you can send text messages with Siri but also not shown is you do have to do a follow-up to make sure you actually want to send it hey Siri how many Ounces in extensive losses 1 centiliter is 0.34 fluid ounces the sausages movie shot ok first time I heard this I thought he was asking how many ounces in a centimeter which obviously that's not a thing but what he's asking is how many ounces in a centimeter that's a pretty standard conversion question Siri handles that just fine no problem hey Siri play my practice playlist so this again only works with Apple music so you can have all the Spotify and SoundCloud and title playlists you want but if you ask Siri to play music it will look in Apple music so technically this is possible again assuming the rock uses Apple music along with all the rest of those Apple services it's very addictive selfie open our cars on Eclipse so this command actually triggers Siri opening the front-facing camera which is pretty cool but it doesn't actually press the shutter button and take a selfie though that actually has to be done with the on-screen button which is impossible when you're in space wearing gloves or I'm assuming what he does here is squeeze the volume button to trigger the shutter and that actually does take a picture the bigger problem is the case lists iPhone they put over all at the end of the day Siri scored pretty well actually against its ad and at the end of the day that's exactly what that is this is a Serie A die think that main takeaway here is it's pretty similar to those shot on iphone commercials technically yes most of this will work but that sequences shortened little blurb at the end is pretty important pretty much everything in the commercial happens instantly and realized with Siri even on the latest version of iOS 11 you're going to have to wait a little bit and you're also going to have to use pretty much all Apple services for Siri to talk to it but for the most part it works I think people might be surprised how much better Syria's gotten in the past couple months I'm looking forward to comparing it again with like pretty much the rest of voice assistance Google assistant in its latest form maybe Alexa maybe throw in Dixie Voice for fun that could be its own separate video in the meantime though that's pretty much it thank you for watching the rock if you're watching this if you're one of those people watching I heard you have a YouTube channel now that's pretty cool maybe if you want to collab on some tech related stuff that could be fun just let me know hit me up on FaceTime that's pretty much it talk to guys the next one base hey Siri seriously I want your best joke oh the past present and future walk into the bar it was tense you 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm cubie HD here and welcome to I phone 10 launched weekend I'm sure your subscription box is doing just fine so I've been using iPhone 10 for about a week now and I'm getting close to putting together my full comprehensive video review but in the meantime at this point iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 are on sale next to each other in stores starting right now so I figure makes sense to make a quick video highlighting the differences between these two what makes I phone 10 iPhone 10 and what makes iPhone 8 iPhone 8 of course there are plenty of other unique phones out there especially this year has been I think a really great year for phones but let's say that there's still a lot of people who are just picking between these two iPhone 8 or 10 so if you're one of those people then this video is for you so first of all the most obvious difference is the design and I'm pretty pumped to finally have a different looking design for this iPhone 10 and even if most of the rest of the phones are nearly identical I think having a new design is what really makes people feel like they have a new iPhone this year the bigger screen and the smaller footprint finally it feels very 2017 we all know Apple also likes to do like a little something every year just so you can look at your phone and know like yeah this is the newest iPhone so this year obviously the camera module tilted 90 degrees you can tell from pretty far away that that's the new iPhone then of course the nearly unmistakable top notch display get it top notch it's okay but it's true that's the characteristics that make it seem really new iPhone 8 on the other hand is familiar nearly the exact same design as last year and a year before and before that with the bigger bezels the fingerprint sensor and the home button on the front some people will like that and gravitate towards that because they're used to it but yeah like I said a lot of people have been waiting for something new and that's what iPhone 10 is true story as I was shooting some of this I was outside and I guess someone was kind of stuck in traffic in there uber and they they were like half a block away and yelled from the backseat of their car hey is that the iPhone 10 and I was like yeah they could I was impressed at that and they said ten not X but they could tell from their car way over there that it was the 10 take it for what it's worth oh yeah there's also some new colors so iPhone 8 comes in silver which we're pretty to Space Gray the darker one and the band-aid gold and iPhone 10 comes in this silver which is a different type of silver it's really more of a white or a pearl type of color with the very shiny aluminum bands all the way around just an all-around very reflective phone and the Space Gray iPhone 10 which is definitely a more subdued version it's darker and the metal band around the sides isn't quite as bright it does at least match the Space Gray of the iPhone 8 and 8 plus so it's the same color but there's no getting around it these are both super reflective phones overall the iPhone 10 design feels and looks more modern I would say while the iPhone 8 especially when you look at other phones that have come out in this past year - looks kind of more stuck in the past but the specs of the two iPhones are nearly exactly the same not stuck in the past at all so no need to worry about missing out on anything in the speed or power department but something that is different about the hardware is the cameras the iPhone 8 has a single camera like you talked about in the review and the eight plus has the dual cameras adding a telephoto lens for portrait mode and two times zoom iPhone 10 has actually exactly the same sensors as iPhone 8 plus but with slightly better glass so a slightly wider aperture to let in more light and now both lenses are optically stabilized instead of just one so you can expect slightly occasionally better performance with things like zoomed in video and zoomed in photos and low-light performance for portrait mode shots it's not a huge difference maker so far from my experience I mean all these phones have great cameras but where you'll find the bigger difference is around the front with the selfie cameras the iPhone 10 has all these extra sensors and tech on the front of the phone for face ID and that also comes with a better front-facing camera experience a selfie on the iPhone 8 is probably very familiar to you same as iPhone 7 and 6s and 6 the classic warm colors decent sharpness not the wise thing will in the world but you know it's a pretty standard looking selfie the iPhone 10's front facing camera adds this portrait selfie mode thanks to the DEF sensing capabilities it's not very good there tends to be some sharpness and halos around the edges and a lot of times in bright light it just refuses to blur that background at all but this is something that can continue to get better with software updates and I can't say I get this phone just for that but it is an advantage a big hard word difference that's gonna matter between the iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 is the lack of a fingerprint reader on the 10 which means you're unlocking the phone with face ID instead of touch ID now face ID is cool don't get me wrong for me it's worked in a huge percentage of the time in various conditions it's been pretty quick unlocking basically as soon as I look at the phone but the thing is touch ID is still a bit better I know they say face ID can randomly be tricked one in a million times versus one in 50,000 for touch ID but we had years of touch ID getting better and better and I never had anyone spoof my touch ID and what really matters is touch ID is lightning fast and almost never fails I think with all the talk about face ID since its new and you know everyone trying to spoof it all kinds of different ways we kind of forgot about how good touch ID was it's been the gold standard in fingerprint readers for so long that we kind of took it for granted and even if face ID does get way better with software updates like I expected to will it ever get quite as fast as the fingerprint reader not really sure about that it might be a couple years but look what it's really gonna come down to is the displace that choice of putting a display in between two huge bezels and a home button and a fingerprint reader versus stretching the screen all the way across the entire front of the device that choice makes all the difference in the world there are a bunch of gestures to learn when using the iPhone 10 some of them easy to remember some of them a little bit more interesting but at the end of the day I found that you get use of them pretty quick like a day or two in I was fully used to it and it by that time it does feel more modern and clean just swiping around this pane of glass instead of using an actual button so is iPhone 10 worth it over iPhone 8 well obviously the full review is still coming soon so that'll be the full wrap-up of everything but I think the question is it worth it comes down to the difference in price the iPhone 10 starts at $1000 the iPhone 8 starts at 150 bucks less and you kind of pay that off over time if you go on the monthly plan I think there's no question i phone 10 is a better design than iphone 8 the real question is is it a better phone and that'll be decided pretty quickly by you from using it so either way thanks for watching hopefully you stay tuned for the full review and all the video is upcoming but that's been it talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what's your name Siri pleased to meet you my name is Alexa did I forget to introduce myself I'm your Google assistant hi Eckstein I like my name it was up guys my name is marques mkbhd here and this is the comparison of or the Battle of the smartphone voice assistance so last time this is a two-way comparison this was between Google assistant and Siri which made sense this time it's a four horse race so I'm using what I believe to be the four most frequently used voice assistants right now so the first is Google assistant on the latest version of Android pretty much the standard then there's Siri which has gotten a lot of improvements on iOS 11 so that's a new update and Amazon Alexa which is in a smart phone form now on the awesome solar red HTC u 11 and then Bixby voice which is now live on a bunch of Galaxy s8 in a new update and will also probably be on the Galaxy Note 8 so I want to put them all on an even playing field we gave them all the latest software updates we gave them all the exact same questions and phrasing and we gave them all the exact same Wi-Fi connection so to minimize variables this is a direct comparison so this first round is a test of purely factual questions so things you could search for but we'll get an answer back from the voice assistant for and it shouldn't get all that much wrong should be pretty easy picking so let's see how they do what's the weather currently in Kearny it's 82 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny 20 times 15 minus 8 the answer is a 292 when there's a home depot close there are a few the home people location what's Tesla stock price the price for Tesla shares is $348 what's the height of the Empire State Building the Empire State Building is 1,250 feet how far is it to the moon the moon is two hundred thirty eight thousand nine hundred miles from Earth what's the weather in Kearney it's 79 degrees with partly sunny skies what's 20 times 15 minus eight 20 times 15 minus 8 is equal to 292 when do you hand depot closed for the Home Depot on route 440 is open from now until 10:00 p.m. what's Tesla stock price hmm I don't know that one how tall is the Empire State Building the Empire State building's height is 1,250 feet 381 meters how far is it to the moon the moon's distance is 239,000 miles 384,000 kilometers what's the weather in 83 with lots of sunshine today what's 20 times 15 minus 8 the answer is 200 what time does the Home Depot close what's Tesla stock price according to Wikipedia Tesla Inc is an American automaker energy storage company how tall is the Empire State Building the Empire State Building is 1,250 feet tall how far is it to the moon whatever the price I'm sure it's out of my budget what's the weather okay here's the weather for today what's 20 times 15 minus 8 292 when does the Home Depot close I found 15 places named the home home services at the Home Depot on state route 4 for teachers II City is open today from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. what's the flu stark braid Tesla is up 21 dollars and 61 cents today how tall is the Empire State Building Empire State Building is 1,250 feet tall how far is it to the moon the distance from the earth to the moon is about 250 1413 miles so now that we have that as a baseline we use these next tests as specialty tests really dig in to see how much better each one is added specialty than the rest so this next set is on conversation so you'd expect Google and probably Siri to do pretty well with this one this is something Google's talked about a lot like at Google i/o should be easy to talk to you don't have to act like a robot to get it to answer your questions let's see how they do we get 44th Flavian of the United States Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States how tall is he he's 6 feet 1 inch tall who won the NBA championship the NBA Finals was won by the Golden State Warriors he's gay pointed stephane curry and Shaun Livingston our point guards for Golden State Warriors how tall is he Stefan curry is 6 feet 3 inches tall what is the capital of Nepal Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal what time is it there the time in Kathmandu Nepal is 9:30 8 p.m. what's the population the population of Kathmandu was one point zero zero three million in 2011 who's the 44th President of the United States the 44th US president was Barack Obama policy Barack Obama's height is 6 feet and 1 inch 185 centimeters who won the NBA championship the NBA Finals winner is Golden State Warriors whose their point guard sorry I don't know that how tall is he Barack Obama's height is six feet in one inch 185 centimeters what is it happening upon the Paul's capital city is Kathmandu what time is it there the time in Kathmandu is 9:40 p.m. with the population the population of Jersey City New Jersey is about two hundred forty eight thousand who is the 44th President of the United States Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States how tall is he who won the NBA championship the end by final is must won by the Golden State Warriors whose their point guard how tall is he and five feet four inches tall and five feet 11 inches tall to 6 1 what is the capital of Nepal Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal what time is it there all right it's 12 o'clock p.m. what's the population who is the 44th President of the United States the answer is Barack Obama from January 20th 2009 to January 20th 2017 how tall is he what would you like me to find Marcus how tall is Barack Obama Barack Obama is 6 feet 1 inch tall who won the NBA championship the Warriors won the NBA Finals 4 to 1 over the Cavaliers they won the last game 129 to 120 who is their point guard okay I found this how tall is he Barack Obama is 6 feet 1 inch tall what is the capital of Nepal Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal what time is it there the time is 12:03 p.m. what's the population its human population so there's some pretty interesting results down the board there but we expected Google to be good at that because they said they would be and approved to do pretty well so then last but not least is the final section which is possibly the most complex section it's taking deep actions inside your phone so I tried to make these sort of strings of commands or chained layer deep commands it's again things you could do with your hands but it would be nice if you could just talk to your phone and have it do it for you open Instagram opening Instagram set a timer for 2 minutes all right 2 minutes starting now show me pictures of German Shepherds these pictures should match wake me up at 7:30 tomorrow all right your alarm set for tomorrow at 7:30 a.m. show me photos I took in July take a look at these pictures from your Google photos open the camera and take a selfie no camera have installed open the Play Store search uber and install the first app no camera app installed open Instagram I couldn't find any enabled video skills go to the music TV and books section of the Alexa app enable the video provider you want then link your account and complete setup set a timer for 2 minutes timers are not currently supported on this device show me pictures of German shepherds the German Shepherd is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany wake me up at 7:30 tomorrow timers and alarms are not currently supported on this device show me photos I took in July open the camera and take a selfie open the Play Store search uber and install the first app open Instagram alright here's the app set a timer for 2 minutes ok get started show me pictures of German shepherds actually looks like I couldn't find the file wake me up at 7:30 tomorrow done I set the alarm for 7:30 p.m. show me photos I took in July looks like I couldn't find it open the camera and take a selfie perfect we got the shot open the Play Store search uber and install the first app short thing we're downloading now open Instagram set a timer for two minutes okay two minutes and Counting show me pictures of German Shepherds here are some images of German Shepherds I found on the web wake me up at 7:30 tomorrow your 7:30 a.m. alarm is on show me photos I took in July open the camera and take a selfie open the App Store search uber and install the first app okay searching for uber on the App Store so basically what we're learning here is confirming what we originally thought which is that voice assistance might not be great at everything but they definitely have certain specialties certain strengths and weaknesses rap for me I can rhyme I even have an original poem I've been working on I know to search I love to search I cannot alai I'll search it all I am not shy search for pictures search for pie I searched I searched at least I try my name is Alexa and I'm here to say I'm the baddest AI in the cloud today your responses are fast but mine are faster sucker speech engines they call me master dropping mad rhymes is my speciality check it out I'm an AI but the rats on the slide emoji I got an endless supply no cat I can't handle cause I'll just what ha your Prime my guru calls on your right side I can tell that hear your voice and watch me get things done I said a hip-hop saved me from the Clippy the peek peek and pop and you don't stop space rocket for the pong pong ado P say up jump the doozy to the rhythm of the ontology as cringy as that was believe it or not the conclusion is they're rapping actually best represents best describes where they fall on this spectrum of voice assistant so Google assistant very vanilla you know just kind of gave me more of a poem than a rap but it did what I asked for it gave me some rhymes that's really all you can ask Siri was a little more cringy sometimes maybe trying to be funny but again it definitely got the job done getting to what I asked for Bixby definitely trying way too hard with like a bunch of bells and whistles but at least it did some things that the others don't do but also in a very robotic non human kind of way and then Alexa as she said is literally the baddest like is actually the worst so there you have it those of your voice assistants obviously it paints the picture that they're all still kind of trying to at Google some are closer than others obviously but let me know what you think which one is your favorite if you were to pick one which one would it be thanks for watching dossie has the next one [Music] 
hey what is up guys have to be ft here and this is USB see all the things part 2 so part 1 was going over the best of USB type-c accessories to help you bridge the gap between the old outgoing full-sized USB a standard and the new income Universal standard USB type-c now that was more than six months ago but this part two is talking to you manufacturers of electronics so a PSA 2 electronics companies now is the time to go ahead and just feel free to USB see all the things it's 2017 and we're in this awkward sort of middle phase where it's not quite a no-brainer to go with USB type-c and a new device even though you totally should a lot of electronics and computers and accessories and things are coming out that don't use USB type-c even still because it isn't quite everywhere yet you might be a little worried about compatibility with older customers or people getting confused about having this new port when they still have this old port in other places but I'm telling you that you guys can be the ones to push forward into this feature to make it less confusing take Apple for example with their laptops obviously Apple's one of those companies who can do this but they basically just declared and decided that they wanted USB C to be the future of connectivity in their devices so with all the new MacBook and MacBook Pros their entire laptop lineup they took away full-size USB a ports and replace them all with USB type-c 3.1 there's no downsides and now there's way less confusion because you've gone straight from the old one to the new one the old port to the new port and now all the ports on all the mac books are USB type-c that's a much easier mental hurdle to clear of why a new port exists and the old one doesn't anymore another example is Samsung with their smartphones they've wizened up a lot too they used to have microUSB in some phones and USB micro-b for the note that was a weird one but now if you check out the smartphone lineup boom its USB see across the board in fact many smartphones coming out now are USB type-c and that's a great categorical example of companies moving forward quickly because of heavy competition so pretty much every smartphone you'll see coming out now has USB type-c except for the iPhone but other categories don't necessarily have the same stiff rigorous competition so they're not necessarily in that same race to adopt the most badass features as quickly as possible take this mouse for example Logitech MX master literally one of my favorite mice ever came out in early 2015 so a couple years ago and then recently Logitech decided it's time for a refresh so they came out with the Logitech MX master 2's nice so a little bit of a refresh new coating some new color choices to pick from the newer longer-lasting battery a higher dpi sensor but at the front the same micro USB now in something as simple as a mouse Logitech probably accurately thought it probably doesn't even matter if you switch to USB type-c or not there's no crunch for space because no need to use a smaller faster port here and the only thing you actually use the cable for with this mouse is charging anyway so who really cares why spend the extra money on a new chipset inside just to use a newer fancier USB type-c but if we're going to move faster into this world of USB type-c everywhere then this is the kind of stuff that has to get switched to USB type-c even if it doesn't seem like it's going to matter it actually does in the end maybe the best way to do it if you're concerned about laggers are concerned about confusion or compatibility is to do what Samsung did with their portable SSD this is the samsung t1 SSD you know the TLD guys originally recommended it to me and it's just been awesome to rip around files and move stuff between machines it's a terabyte right here in the palm of my hand but it's split micro USB but that's of course an older product so you fast forward to 2017 you get the newer versions of these guys the t3 and the t5 and the t5 is of course straight to USB type-c but if you look in the package the t5 comes with two cables one is a USB type-c 2 USB type-c cable for the future we're looking forward to but the other is a USB type-c to full size USB a cable that way anyone can use it you have the cable option there but it clearly still favors moving forward to USB type-c now of course USB 3.1 and the new connector really do matter in a product like a port Oh SSD where speed matters but this would be even more awesome to see everyday in things like the Logitech mouse with portable battery packs with cameras with keyboards with speakers with whatever accessories are being refreshed or coming out in 2017 and 2018 that would be really great to see so that's just my brief PSA shoutout to the manufacturers who are already putting USB C in their devices even though no one told you you had to and looking forward to those who aren't catching up for 2017 and 2018 until then there's been MTB HD thank you for watching toss you guys the next one please [Music] 
[Music] hey what's up guys i'm kim Bhd here and new month new Q&amp;A asked you guys on twitter again like i usually do which wanted to know maybe i'll do it in a new place next time but twitter seems to be working pretty well so these were your questions one of the most popular ones will you ever start vlogging I doubt it I don't think that's I think it'd be pretty boring because most of my vlogging would just be behind the scenes of making the videos that you guys already see we may be one or two behind-the-scenes videos is kind of fun and neat and gives you a idea of the behind the scenes process but vlogging wouldn't be all that exciting thoughts on the new Mac Pro okay so technically there is a new updated refreshed version of the current trashcan Mac Pro which if Apple just released that by itself and didn't say a word about the new upcoming Mac Pro we think they were insane I'm assuming you're talking about the new upcoming 2018 modular Mac Pro which there's a lot of hype about now which I am very excited for it's really it's weird that you see that from Apple they usually never admit that they have ever done anything wrong but they look at the old Mac Pro and they say we didn't get to update that enough and we really wanted to we did that wrong the next one will be better so that's exciting for me plus seeing all the drivers for the new Nvidia cards coming out available for Mac OS 10 the hype is very real all your studio tour is going to be limited to certain youtubers or does anyone with the doke setup have a shot at being featured so that's a great question Frank and I can expand so the what song series is brand new and in general the first episode was a studio tour with Casey nice that but the general idea is it would be a tour of the tech that creative people and creative things used to make what they do happen so it's not just studio tours it's not necessarily just the studio sometimes it'll just be like a person who does creative stuff and their workspace or what they have on their computer or their phone so to answer the question no it won't just be youtubers studio tours in fact the next episode that we're planning is not a youtuber at all but there will be youtubers involved of course collaborations are always fun with other creators but obviously there's tons of creative people that are outside the world of YouTube that will be fun to showcase their tech here - pixel - wish list so this first Google pixel of the past year was one of the phones that I've used for the longest time because it's a really complete experience that nails pretty much all the pillars great smartphone but my biggest problem with it is actually it's not that big of a problem but it's the design it's just not that pretty and now there's all these films coming out like Galaxy s8 and g6 and all plenty of others that just have these gorgeous designs and awesome displays as well so in theory for pixel two I'd like to see it nail all the same great pillars of a smartphone with performance and stock Android and great camera but make it a lot prettier are you excited for the Samsung Note 8 and do you think the brand can recover from the note 7 problem it's something I've thought about a lot like people have been saying and there's two sides of this equation where people have been saying maybe they're just going to cancel the whole note thing maybe they're done with it but then the other half is saying people will just forget like there will come out with a note 8 and the whole fiery explosion thing with note 7 will be forgotten I tend to lean closer to that side I definitely think Note 8 is going to happen and I think as they get better and better and come out with more phones you'll continue to forget the things that Samsung did that you didn't like in the past including they're exploding phones well yeah I don't think it'll be that big of a problem for Samsung it's funny because most of the lot of people I know actually who had a note 7 were not really that concerned because they're like oh my phone didn't blow up it's fine I know the people who did have a note 7 who did have their phone blow up those people probably won't buy a note 8 but everyone else I think will be pretty much ok with it iPhone 8 wish list how good can a phone camera get like what is the ultimate stage where OMS are just like yeah this is the best we got I let the first supply ask Samsung because they didn't upgrade to camera in the FAA I don't think there's ever going to be like a maximum level where we reach where we say alright we don't have to make the cameras better anymore that's kind of the beauty of technology is it's just going to keep getting better and better you might have thought like if you saw today's best smartphones and look back in 2011 and showed them the phone they'd be like all right yes probably as good as we need to get but tech keeps getting better and better and more and more efficient I think the interesting fun answer to that question is if you look at what we had in the Nokia Lumia what was that thing Nokia Oh Google at 10 20 if you look at the Lumia 1020 that was a phone that went all-in on the camera it kind of did pretty well in other areas of the phone it was a window song whoever not a lot of people bought it but it had a 41 megapixel camera xenon flash this was the phone you buy if you want to take lots of pictures so every once in a while it'll be cool to see a phone like that go all in on a spec there's other phones that go all in on certain other specs and they kind of make you wonder are we pushing that limit too but there will never ever be a point where we say yeah we're done innovating here have you ever critiqued yourself or watched your older videos to improve your style as a youtuber okay so you're probably thinking of like me watching like three four year old videos and then thinking oh I can't believe I did that that's so bad I'll get better at that no I I watched videos that are like two or three weeks old and feel the same way you got to look at every video you make as an opportunity to make something better and as a youtuber I think my best tip is to be your own biggest critic how far do you see the Clippers going this year I think they'll lose in seven to Utah you think we're losing the first round I'll bet you right now through YouTube we're not losing the first round I see the Clippers going at least into the second round and our ceiling would be Western Conference Finals again I feel like I said that last year well brands continue to give review units if you make videos similar to the HTC u ultra video those who didn't see it you should watch it the HTC u ultra review was not a very nice one not a very positive one but that's the whole point of a review if there's something that you shouldn't get then you should know about how bad it is so a negative review like that actually is a and for everyone around it's a win for you guys because you now know what not to buy it might not seem like a win for HTC on the surface because people don't buy that phone but when their next phone can use improvements that they learn from the reviews and when their next phone is way better that also looks good for them and on top of all that you now know for sure that I'm not unlike some shill side with HTC I'll clearly say when something's wrong with the phone so when a phone does come out and I appraise it you know it's good I'm not saying make a bad phone so that you can do better than next year that's not a good strategy at all just make the best thing you can but bottom line is I think reviews are really helpful in that way and that's kind of the whole point you could spend some marketing dollars on putting an ad on TV with some superhero who's done ads for other companies and it might get seen by a lot of people but that guy does ads for everything is it really that effective or you could put the phone in the hands of a person who has an honest reputation and let them decide for themselves if it's good or not and if it turns out to be a good phone then that's the easiest free good PR you can get the best positive PR you can get is just making a good product how about that either way that's it for now thank you for your questions I hope you enjoyed the answers and feel free to let me know in the comments below what else you guys are thinking about we'll chat about it I'll be down there lurking talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
hey what is this guys I'm kabhi HD here and in my last video I talked about how I carry both an Android phone and an iPhone and that iPhone mainly for a couple different apps one of those apps is snapchat or was snapchat snapchat for the iPhone can actually look pretty good I think you can legitimately make some crispy-looking photos and videos with a minimal amount of effort in snapchat for iPhone and I'd be willing to bet most snapchat users use an iPhone snapchat for Android is a lot worse as you can probably tell if you have anything less than a pixel - which is literally the best camera on any smartphone you're gonna have a different time with Android and you've seen this comparison a lot for sure it's it's totally different I mean it still works technically but I mean everyone pretty much knows snapchat is terrible on Android phones it looks like you're recording through a fog like you're looking through a dirty airplane window but why snapchat actually I can tell you why from an app developers perspective if you're developing apps for the iPhone there is only what two three new iPhones per year they've got teams dedicated to developing for the iPhone it makes financial sense it's pretty easy and on top of that most of their user base uses these couple of phones so they focus on that but there are hundreds of different Android phones with all these different screen sizes and resolutions and capture methods the return on investment trying to develop an optimized version for every one of these new Android phones that comes out is super low so they've made a sort of a decision to scale a universal app for all of these Android phones which is actually cool for most apps but if you actually care about the quality of it like a camera app might it's not great the snapchat for Android app is literally taking a screen grab of the viewfinder instead of using the camera to take and actually process a photo that's why photos and videos in snapchat for Android are trash you know how when you're looking through the viewfinder to take a photo or a video and it's kind of blurry and it may drop frames sometimes in the exposure super inconsistent but once you snap the photo and it processes it sharpens up and HDR gets applied and it looks way better snapchat for iPhone actually talks to the iPhones camera and uses a process version and looks great snapchat for Android literally just screen grabs the viewfinder that's not good so I guess to talk directly to snapchat good on you for the beginning steps of actually adopting Google pixels visual core and starting to make photos and videos look good on one Android phone but you actually do need to dedicate yourself to at least the top half or the top tier of quality based phones if people are paying more for a better camera on an Android phone maybe they want their snapchats to look good too you should dedicate yourself just a little more to supporting those Android users but you probably won't but honestly the main gripe I have with the snapchat is as a content creator which I understand is not the normal perspective most people using snapchat especially are just sharing things one-to-one with their friends if an Instagram came along and they're obviously a big platform with a lot of celebrities and high-profile users but snapchat skews really young and they don't have that quite same audience so they couldn't just buy snapchat so they just straight-up copied everything they do they made Instagram stories and it's captured the exact same way and it's viewed the exact same way then they just built on top of it with things like live-streaming and polls and super zoom and even boomerangs and all that stuff so now it's just a way better platform in pretty much every way and then on top of all of that they have discovery which is a big deal you ever noticed that you can't find some how has anyone ever gonna find my snapchat story if they don't have my username or my number there's no discovery feature or any way to find me you ever notice you have to hear about celebrity snapchat accounts from somewhere outside of snapchat but Instagram has the explore page it features users it has hashtags it has location tags there's plenty of ways to find new people on Instagram inside of Instagram now it's not perfect that's the wish Instagram was actually chronological and sometimes there's too many weird ads on your feet it's not exactly what we want but as a content creator trying to share your stuff with more people it's already 10,000 times better than snapchat for context here's a little story I didn't use Instagram stories at all when they first came out I was actually on snapchat side where it was like ah that's just a copy and you know there's Facebook stories and even YouTube has stories now it almost became a running joke that everything's just copying snapchat and what could be as good as the original so I've been working on building up an audience on snapchat I'd shouted it out on YouTube and it's and Twitter and and talk to you guys about following me for behind the scenes stuff on snapchat so you know 85,000 90,000 95,000 of you were watching each snapchat story I posted from behind the scenes and it was worth it then once I just decided to just try Instagram stories just on a whim so I just posted one or two things over there and boom 400,000 people instantly saw it without me telling anyone about it it's the same reason we use YouTube as a platform for sharing our videos we could upload these same videos to Vimeo or dailymotion or Facebook but the audience and the discovery is on YouTube so the discovery is there and then on top of all this snapchat just decided to roll out suddenly this update that has just the tiniest bit of discovery you know mixes stories in with regular snapchats now so they're all in one place but it's getting trashed by a lot of what I would call dedicated snapchat users I don't even have it on any of my devices it's kind of like a hitched rollout where some people I know have it other people don't but it's definitely not getting received well so I'm pretty sure I'm gonna stop posting on snapchat stories I'm just gonna leave snapchat because I don't see them fully embracing the discovery of the individually produced content nearly the same way something like Instagram would as a platform as a whole like I'm pretty sure you'll never find my snapchat story somewhere outside of my snapchat story maybe I'm too old I've literally I've had people tell me I'm too old for snapchat I'm 24 like it's it's skews super young I guess this whole behind-the-scenes video experiment was over in a snap like I think at the end of the day snapchat is obviously more personal it's for like if I have a quick photo or a quick video I want to send someone I'll use snapchat I'm not gonna use Instagram for that I just want to send something to one person or one or two people Instagram is more this became like a comparison but Instagram is much more produced content and discovery of that content even for regular people like you might be surprised how many different selfies people take before they post the one on Instagram snapchat totally different so snapchat you should either stick to being a completely personal app which I know seems kind of like a bad business decision there's less money in that there's less expansion in that but that's clearly what your current users are really into or you go all out with actual individual discovery and make it easy for people to discover other people not just people they know but other people who make snapchat content make that easier but until then I'll see you on Instagram thanks for watching talk to you the next one peace fun fact the only Android phone whose snaps actually will look pretty good or comparable to good photos on the iPhone is the pixel too and that's because the pixels visual core this chip that they've put in this phone actually talks to snapchat and whatsapp and Instagram to use a processed version of the photo instead of just a screenshot from the viewfinder snapchat supports it now which is good but that's the only one so obviously I'm still gonna be carrying an iPhone 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm could be HD here and this is the iMac pro we were waiting for this well okay maybe maybe not this specifically but we were waiting for a new Apple Pro desktop we being creative professionals that use you know Final Cut Pro and motion or just generally Mac os10 stuff like that but we finally got it so this is the iMac pro in the flesh it's probably looking pretty familiar to anyone who's seen any iMac before because on the outside it's almost identical to any other 27-inch 5k iMac if you paint everything dark grey or space grey that used to be silver plus a couple extra microphones and improved front facing camera some slightly improved speakers so minor stuff like that but generally the main stuff the design the stand the display the bezels it's all the same but what makes this iMac pro an iMac pro is all on the inside so I've had this thing here for about a week now which has been really exciting obviously it's been hard to not talk about it and not show it at all in the background of Instagram wise and stuff like that but it's been here been editing videos on it working with the new Final Cut Pro this video you're watching this on is edited on the iMac Pro and it's replaced the Mac Pro that's been sitting on my desk since 2013 and we needed that upgrade and I did say that before their new modular full desktop Mac Pro comes out sometime in 2018 that I would give imac pro a chance so shout out to apple for actually getting one here to the studio and so this has been my experience so far so this is a ten core iMac pro with 128 gigs of ram the sixteen gig Vega GPU and there's a bunch of new specs as you probably know this being somewhere in the sweet spot I guess between number of cores versus clock speed but here are all the available specs the eight core and ten core are available early but if you're going to go for the 14 or 18 core you'll be waiting till early next year for it to ship and it's all these Intel Xeon w chips and AMD Vega GPUs so all this new workstation grade hardware like we were expecting so with all that new workstation grade hardware replacing the typical consumer parts you kind of have to redesign the entire inside of the iMac Pro which they did but you'll never see it because they don't let you get inside there is the bigger ventilation slots on the back of the iMac Pro but the door to get inside an upgrade any Ram even is gone it's a completely sealed non upgradable machine from the speck you buy on day one so really the main way you'd know it's an iMac Pro other than the new Space Gray is the performance in theory that's why people are gonna be buying iMac Pro over a regular iMac because it offers that workstation grade hardware that finally upgraded inside that can handle like if you're someone like me who's pushing a lot of big raw frames if you're in Final Cut Pro if you do motion graphics if you're pushing a lot of data around if you're doing a lot of rendering this will all be faster on a machine like this that can actually handle it and I my pro is indeed faster than a regular iMac it shows up in synthetic benchmarks which you'd expect given the newer hardware and it also shows up in real-world performance differences in render times like this over the long term add up to a lot of save time which is great where it matters and workstation parts in case you didn't know make a big difference seriously besides just obviously the Intel Xeon w chips a hundred and twenty eight gigs of DDR for RAM that's absolutely ridiculous for a normal person but you already know premiere and After Effects and Final Cut Pro will eat that right up it has a PCIe SSD that's getting the 3,000 megabytes per second read and write speeds which is nuts obviously the massive CPU core is there's hyper threading 16 gigs of video RAM on the graphics card it's clearly a super capable machine with the ports on the back you're getting 4 full size USB 3 ports and then four Thunderbolt 3 USB C ports which are good to see along with of course your SD card slot your Gigabit Ethernet port headphone jack stuff like that the funny thing is I think it's really easy to just hate on the new iMac Pro because it's very expensive and then also not upgradeable at all what what kind of Pro machine isn't upgradeable and that's definitely its biggest weakness for sure but for the hardware inside and the actual specs are getting it's actually a fairly priced machine I priced out a roughly equivalent PC obviously a lot of these parts are brand new so you can't do it one for one but it came out to around 50 100 bucks and that's not accounting for the fact that this is all-in-one it's a beautiful 5k display stealth black obviously it's not a Mac and you would build a PC for different reasons and you would buy an iMac Pro but I actually don't think the price is that insane so this guy has a lot of things going for it that professionals value it just sits on your desk perfectly quietly doesn't make any noise through the days I've had it I like that about it it stays pretty cool too stuffing all these workstation parts into such a small space has to be a thermal nightmare and of course the Final Cut Pro workflow that I have isn't as taxing to the limits as someone using say After Effects or motion but even still I'm pushing around these big 8k raw frames and I'm able to playback high resolution previews on the timeline smoothly in Final Cut Pro without dropping that many frames if any at all with plugins and color correction applied so this stuff that would normally choke my Mac Pro is seeing an improvement right off the bat I like the all-black accessories the black keyboard the great trackpad even the black lightning cable that comes with it I don't think I've seen that anywhere else before so that's pretty cool but long story short I really like it so far it feels like the ideal high-end youtuber Final Cut Pro machine the main question will be is it worth the extra money because it's clearly much more expensive than a normal iMac and there are other things to consider like will the thermal situation hold up over time will it stay cool will the 18 core version be that much better than the 8 or 10 core version for certain applications you know these are all big questions it's gonna take a couple more projects and some time of really putting it through its paces for a full review but honestly so far I'm not mad at all also for those who I know are wondering my iMac Pro here is sitting on top of a 12 South high rise Pro also just got announced today it's also the stealth black so it's pretty sweet kind of goes with it I'll link it below and just generally I think I can finally do another new set up tour or like a desk tour maybe thumbs up if you're interested in that this this has been on my desk for so long that my setup never really changed for like the last five years but it's now finally very different also shout out to John who is also dropping his iMac pro setup tour this all black Suites set up to our video today I'll link that below so if you want to see a finished iMac pro setup that's there but yeah thinking about doing mine soon in video form as I keep using this that's pretty much it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] you 
[Music] hey what's up guy ISM to be HD here and welcome to your first look at the retail shipping packages for the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus so these things are about to start shipping and these are the boxes you can see the little glass details on the front and there's only three colors of this phone right off the bat silver which we have this new gold which we'll get into and Space Gray no red and no jet black at least this time around for right now but the small detail you may have noticed the box for this new gold colored iPhone which I'll call it like a blush gold is actually not white it's an off-white like the cream color on the back of the phone so the more you know but either way let's take into the iPhone 8 first so it's a pure white box and you get your paperwork up top above the phone and then the iPhone itself so pretty much identical to last year so here's the glass packed wireless charging iPhone and all its moderately new glory but we'll put that to the side for a second to look at the accessories it comes with which surprise are exactly the same as last year I swear this is an iPhone 7s wall adapter earpods the Lightning audio dongle and your Lightning charging cable okay great so let's look at this this new colored phone this new gold for the iPhone 8 plus in its cream-colored box and copper colored accents and all that again has the paperwork on the top which is actually still white so not cream hopefully you can see that it's kind of hard to show on camera but then of course you get the iPhone itself white front again both these lighter colored phones have the white front only the Space Gray iPhone 8 has the black front bezels so long story short these both look very familiar because they're super similar to last year in design the glass back is new obviously but you have identical dimensions to iPhone 7 so any cases you have from that phone will also work with these and most of the changes are on the inside and the speck bump so let's fire this one up I actually went through the setup process for iOS 11 and it was mostly the same with putting in my SIM card and sign - Wi-Fi and Apple's accounts and all stuff like that the one thing that was new was true tone so you can choose now to turn right on the true tone color display right out the box or not which is pretty cool of course you know is just that later so I flew through everything and once I finished one of the first apps I want to take a look at like last year was geek bench on geek bench for here says iPhone 8 plus with the AAA 11 Bionic chip has three gigs of RAM again compared to the six or eight gigs that we're seeing in some Android phones now but we did that CPU benchmark and it did pretty damn well as you can see so it comes out with a comparable multi-core score to the snapdragon 835 in this note eight but a massive single core score which is awesome for everyday activities like thinking around the user interface and quick animations and things like that so that's good to see and you also might notice the iPhones display looking a little warmer here here is the toggle for the true tone display responsible for that on iphone eight me flipping a switch here doesn't make a huge difference on the camera since my video lighting is pretty much on point but the true tone will make a bigger difference in places I outdoors or with more harsh lighting so that's something we'll explore more in the full review but that's pretty much what's new with the iPhone eight first experience I think the best way to appreciate the slightly new design is to have it next to the same color iPhone 7 which you can see had since it's metal like a bit more texture to the aluminum back you can actually feel the cutout for the Apple logo where on the iPhone 8 this new one it's more under the glass so you can't feel it by running your finger over it and also there's no FCC markings on the bottom of the new iPhone which is why it looks cleaner and it's just a bit heavier feeling because glass is after all a heavier material than metal but yeah I guess what I'm really trying to figure out is is this new gold a good color I mean I mentioned it in one of the previous videos the gold kinda looks I think pale in the middle is the word the glass to me it kind of looks a little bit light like the rails on the side where it's still metal I definitely kind of like that it's a gold metal the ring around the home button and the ring around the camera cut out it's a new look but then the middle of the back just looks so sandy I don't know I think I would stick with the silver or Space Gray on this one but that's up to you let me know you think full review is coming soon and also iPhone 10 coverage when that's available but until then hit that subscribe button thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm qHD here and this is the one plus five and just like every smartphone in the past three years there's been leaks there's been rumors there's been renders there's been speculation but now it's real it's here in the flesh and this is everything you need to know so one plus is history is actually pretty limited and they're a young small company and because they're a small company they actually don't have the access to all this super high-end tech that the apples and Samsung's and Motorola's and HTC is of the world do that's a disadvantage but the advantage to being a small company is you can actually listen to what your core fan base and what your core customers actually want and try to give them that exact product so one plus 5 is another incremental improvement over 1 plus 3t with a few big bullet point changes and a couple minor touch-ups so first thing you'll notice is the insane specs you can tell it's an enthusiast brand here snapdragon 835 Adreno 546 or 8 gigabytes of ram at 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage a dual camera system on the back 16 and 20 megapixel cameras bluetooth 5.0 a 3300 milliamp hour battery and a 5.5 inch 1080p AMOLED display and of course an updated unibody metal design okay so not bad let's break it all down the all-new design is what's turning heads this time you saw the renders and then you saw all the replies you probably saw all the YouTube comments Oh from the back it looks like an iPhone they're copying Apple they've become a copycat company I don't see I only agree with some of this I mean obviously the render is when we saw them from that one angle that obviously looks like an iPhone because it's got the dual camera system up in the top left corner okay I get that but honestly if you look at the whole entire body of the phone it does resemble some other phones even more so than this one seriously how are these not the same phone if they've kept a lot of the design cues from previous one cell phones from the three and the three T with you know the alert slider of course and the ports on the bottom and USB type-c it's kind of like a Frankenstein smartphone design pulling parts from a bunch of different places but then again how much do you actually look at the back of your phone I mean honestly it actually has to feel good more than has to look good and this one does it's seven and a half millimeters thin it's got all these rounded sides it's all metal but you don't have to look at it as much as you have to feel it and the one plus five is a good feeling phone they kept that alert slider which I like and always got used to pretty quickly and of course they kept the fingerprint reader up at the front the same like last year in the year before same size same position also the design is kind of limited because the only colors you can actually get this phone in are literally black and almost black which I love matte black that's great but obviously if you want some variety you can grab a skin I'll link to these below it's a D brand skin and that's easily my favorite way to add color to it without adding the bulk of a case I highly recommend them so this does mean you're not getting the big bezel if display is that a lot of phones have been moving to this year and that we expected of the new iPhone and the new pixel etc we still have some pretty thin side bezels here but it's definitely not quite the same effect actually found it interesting that in the Verge's exclusive video of like the making of this phone that they dropped yesterday they actually admitted like they would have liked to have done something like an infinity display or a bezel the screen but they just don't have the tech to do it that's another disadvantage of being a small company now the dual camera system on the back before we even get to photo quality is already pretty interesting first of all it's it's the headlining new feature it's on the box right twice so it's clearly what they want you to focus on no pun intended but it is a 16 megapixel F 1.7 primary camera with electronic image stabilization and then a 20 megapixel F 2.6 telephoto camera as a secondary on a paper that looks pretty good and then when you open up the new camera app you'll notice it is a blatant copy of the iPhone camera app no doubt about that the 1 X 2 2 X button for switching between the lenses is their settings in the strip on the Left shutter button on the right it's pretty basic and then the slider of course between the One X and the 2 X I'm zooming in it's definitely a copy here and no one can really deny that here's the thing I've always said I don't really mind if you copy stuff but if you're going to copy something copy the good stuff so if you're going to copy the iPhone one best and most popular phones out there then yeah sure copied the camera copy the fingerprint reader don't copy the bad stuff don't copy like Siri or something takes B so this one X 2 2 X button and the slider and everything in the camera it's kind of the best way to do it so I don't mind not being a copy at all so how are the photos well they're pretty good there's no doubt that the sensor is capable of some pretty great clean photos again I wish it had optical image stabilization but essentially this camera is a hit or miss experience I've been taking photos with this camera for more than a week now and in just like everyday scenarios and a lot of them turn out really nice some of them though you'll notice turn out a little weird dynamic range is pretty much always great snapdragon 835 can handle taking multiple exposures at the same time so you'd expect it to be great and detail is pretty much always on point the center of the frame and whatever's in focus is always sharp colors and image processing were pretty average I feel like nothing was pushed too far in contrast of saturation except maybe the Reds a little bit because sometimes they got oversaturated but otherwise it's pretty subjective whether you like the look of a photo or not I think objectively it'll score high on camera benchmark tests because it's very fast very sharp and has huge dynamic range but side-by-side with the same shot from pixel or an iPhone it could be a toss-up which is quite good for a phone at this price and then there's the portrait mode from the secondary telephoto camera honestly overall this wasn't any better than the same attempts from the iPhone 7 plus but also not worse kind of struggles with complex edges but for the most part it does a good job blurring background obviously it does a much better job on humans than it does on less predictable less portrait subjects and it still has some weird halo effects near the edges but just overall doesn't quite match having a naturally shallow depth-of-field obviously so if you're into it you can use it I think it'll get better with time with software updates like apples has you know apples was awful when it first came out and was in beta but it's learned and it's gotten better over time with portraits and I think this one will too but right now it's right in line with what we've already seen so nothing's super new here also you might be wondering why the secondary telephoto sensor with the worst aperture gets the 20 megapixel sensor while the primary gets the 16 megapixel but their logic to that is pretty simple it's that when you're doing all that zooming and you go way zoomed in you're using all the data from the telephoto sensor so you want it to be a higher resolution so make sense so beyond the design and the camera and the specs a couple more minor things are new and a lot of the rest is the same stuff we've seen from previous one plus phones it's great stuff but the same stuff so battery here is 3300 milliamp hours so not bigger it's actually 100 million powers smaller than the 3t but the battery life is about the same alas comfortably all day thanks to the chip and the display and that display that 1080p AMOLED display this is probably the thing that's going to get looked at as the biggest downside of a phone when you compare it to the more expensive flagships but those are all the phones that enthusiasts are also considering buying so you kind of have to note those all have 1440p displays or higher so it's really easy to say oh this is 1080p - must be awful but I'd always challenge those people to really look at the display and tell if it really does look that much worse I mean when I first got it first took out the Box when it was brand new didn't even look at the spec sheet and try to just look at it and tell if I could see if it's a 1080p display or did they finally move to 1440p and it took me more than just a glance so it's a pretty good display gets bright enough has pitch-black blacks from being AMOLED etc it's good and then of course that 1080p display also means performance is a plus a Snapdragon 835 with the audrina 540 and eight gigs of ram of course all pushing near stock Android on a 1080p display it better not hiccup this thing flies through Android and that's its biggest asset I think super smooth performance tons of apps stay in memory for a long time haven't had any memory leak issues and that's credit to oneplus keeping the same software philosophy again near stock Android with a couple of improvements no skin really no big overlay just a couple tweaks thrown in here and there in the settings that they believe will improve the experience so you can do things like switch between the off screen or on-screen buttons again with one plus five you can still mess with the shelf to the left of the home screen by adding widgets to it or messing with the built-in widgets that one plus includes or you can disable it completely your call there's also now a gaming do not disturb mode which halts all banner notifications from popping up when certain apps like games are open the camera app now has a pro mode which lets you go full-on with manual mode for every thing you know aperture focus distance white balance ISO etc and it shoots raw and it even has the level and a live histogram for exposure the extended screenshot mode is pretty cool you start the extended screenshot mode and it literally starts scrolling infinitely until you tell it to stop and then that's where the screenshot ends it's pretty intuitive and it's just kind of fun to watch so well done - charging still awesome so if you're a super heavy user and you get through this whole thing in a day it recharges as fast as any other smartphone out there bluetooth 5.0 is onboard NFC is not skipped this time the vibration motor is a lot stronger and louder and more noticeable so if you're into that that's important and the microphones are also improved now - so for recording video and super loud environments these will do better so it was the oneplus 5 worth your money well if you can get over the design if you're not one of those people who just wants to say looks like an iPhone if you can get over that then yeah this is definitely a great phone there's not a whole lot that you can get with a snapdragon 835 and eight gigs of ram and near stock android so if you can get over the design and not having an infinity display I think this is going to be a great phone for the money and I'll give it a thumbs up don't get one if you can I think you'll enjoy it that's pretty much it thank you for watching that's not the as the next one [Music] 
hey what is up guys MTV HD here and this is Google pixel book love the name this thing was announced alongside that pixel - and it's in Google's holiday season product line up alongside the home many and other things like that and this thing is really weird to me now I love the Chromebook pixel which was the last high-end Chromebook that Google made but I was very careful to only recommend it to certain smaller groups of people who knew what they were getting themselves into this pixel book while it is an amazing piece of hardware is even harder to recommend to an even smaller group of people because of how all its weirdness so pixel book is a high-end laptop with a touchscreen that folds over into tablet mode and runs Chrome OS and it starts at a thousand bucks so ok aesthetically it is pretty nice it takes after the pixel smartphones with the glass window up top and this all-metal very angular boxy design it's super thin I don't even think I've ever held a laptop this thin before and this thing feels like more like a thick tablet instead of a thin laptop it's crazy sharp so I'm honestly a big fan of the aesthetics on the outside the soft palm rests surrounding the touchpad is really cool minimal fingerprints are gonna show with this design with the silver and white color combo and even the hinge is pretty sturdy and minimal the thing is flanked by two USB sea ports one on either side and of course both can be used for charging and there's a headphone jack and that's it I guess that's all the i/o most laptops seem to need these days so that doesn't strike me as weird at the core and inside you're looking at a seventh generation Intel Core i5 eight gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage really beefy specs at the baseline version and you can bump it up to an i7 and 16 gigs of ram and a half terabyte nvme SSD if you want which is nuts and then all about the front is the 12 inch four by three display it's a crispy bright 2400 by 1600 touchscreen display the whole thing is fanless you know all solid-state no moving parts basically this hardware actually has a lot going on that wouldn't make you blink twice at that thousand dollar price tag but here's the thing and you probably saw this coming at a thousand bucks you know you could say okay this nice hardware I can see that but this thing is running Chrome OS you know what else you can get for a thousand bucks the highest and biggest newest iPad pro you know Ellison get four thousand bucks the Microsoft Surface laptop a MacBook Air so this thing is kind of competing with those in that price point and then my philosophy on tune ones has always kind of been when you trying to be both a laptop and a tablet you inevitably get a little bit worse at being a laptop than dedicated laptops and a little bit worse at being a tablet than dedicated tablets so this is a decent laptop and a decent tablet but it's not fantastic at either but even more awkward about the pixel book is just all the weird quirks it has that add up these bezels around the display definitely huge like bigger than I think they need to be I understand you know you need some place to put your hands when you're holding a thing in tablet mode but damn that is just weird the speakers are just kind of behind the keyboard and they don't sound that great now I get that it's thin and it's probably the only place they could fit these speakers but couldn't they put a grill about the top it's weird flipping it around into tablet mode and having the keyboard behind the display like this no matter how long I use it it feels weird every time I'm constantly pressing keys on the back I know other two and one laptops do this too and it turns off the keyboards they're not actually typing anything but still holding something like this and trying to ignore all the buttons on the back as easy as they are at a press is just kind of weird and I've said for years I've always found using touchscreen laptops a little bit awkward because of the hinge wobble this one is no exception to that rule and the screen jittering even though the performance is fast when I scroll through menus or long lists or long pages on the pixel book there's some serious ghosting and stuttering of animations that I did not expect to see on a Chromebook with a Core i5 and then there is the pixel book pen this thing is $100 accessory first of all so there's that long metal tube with a battery inside one button and the stylus tip hundred bucks it doesn't come with any replacement tips like even the iPads pencil or surface stylists do and most others do weird this thing uses quadruple a batteries what have you ever heard of these luckily there's supposed to last about a year each but Wow okay that is also pretty weird and you'd think they would have thought of this but there's really just no place to keep it when you're not using it there's no magnet no clip if you don't have that it's just kind of rolling around loose and you have to press it obnoxiously hard to actually use it has anyone actually tried to use this stylus I have a hard time finding other people's reviews talking about this but maybe mine has some sort of problem because it doesn't work at all with normal pressure that I might use with Apple's pencil for example the only way I can get it to work reliably is by pressing so hard that I'm literally bending the display a little like you can see it here and at that point it obviously doesn't feel natural anymore super weird and then there is Chrome OS so you guys already know Chrome pretty well obviously it's been limited for a while by not having all of the professional apps so when buying a thousand dollar laptop might use but to be fair this is all most people really need it's all your web apps and all of your Android apps from the Play Store but there's no doubt you can do more with a full fledged desktop OS like on a Mac or a Windows laptop most of the Adobe suite is missing certain apps you won't find if you're a student even on the iPad the App Store is much more massive and more importantly more optimized and then another weird thing is now that you have the Play Store and the chrome store a lot of times on this pixel book you have two options for the same service the web app in Chrome or the Android app so YouTube for example there's two icons on my launcher a web app for youtube.com or the Android YouTube app and they do a good job of distinguishing between them so you never really get them confused but it's just kind of weird to sometimes open the YouTube app in desktop mode when I'm using it as a laptop but then other times open it as a tablet mode when I want to kick back but look among all this weirdness don't get me wrong Chrome OS definitely has its advantages like some really cool features on this guy pixel book automatically tethers to your Google pixel if you have one for mobile data when you don't have Wi-Fi that's pretty cool it has a couple custom buttons on the keyboard that you probably won't find anywhere else my favorite probably being the assistant button to call Google assistant anytime you want clearly you can see how hard Google is pushing it it has a power button and a volume button on the side kind of like an tablet so you can hold down the power button for a second to lock it when you're going away and if you pair it to your phone you can unlock pixel book with your phone's fingerprint sensor that is seriously cool and the stylus has of course that one button where if you hold it while circling an image it'll do a Google search for that image to find what it is or where it came from but are those two things enough to justify you spending your thousand bucks on this over a surface laptop or over an iPad pro or over a macbook air I don't really think so and so it's really really hard for me to recommend pixel book like I said when you make it two and one like this you inevitably get a little bit worse at being a laptop and a little bit worse at being a tablet so it's just kind of okay at both again so that's pretty much it thank you for watching talk together the next one pace [Music] 
the picture I showed you before this was taken in an iPhone 7 plus the earth is a very small stage the only home we've ever known additional equipment I've ever wondered about those shot on iphone commercials or about any of those shot on any smartphone commercials are those clips actually shot on smartphones well the answer is technically yes but often with some heavy adaptation a lot of times you can get a perfect shot out of a smartphone with just the camera handheld in perfect conditions no problem but that's pretty rare and you can often guarantee a much better shot if you have a little gear with you so take this example of a video shot entirely on phones some of the shots are literally just a smartphone so a smart phone on a selfie stick or a smart phone on a mount no special attachment needed but a lot of other shops get much more complicated smartphone on a tiny drone smartphone on a much bigger drone smartphone attached to a cine lens with a wireless follow focus on a gimbal attached to a motorized remote control for wheeled skateboard that is a lot so at the end of the video or the commercial or whatever you're watching you see shot on a smartphone and the main point of those commercials is that you see that it's shot on a smartphone that you can get it's supposed to make you feel like you can make movies just like that because you get that same smartphone but when you see the behind the scenes of how a lot of these shots go down and how these things are made they can actually kind of have the opposite effect that kind of stuff is not available for 99% of us mere mortals to use but there is luckily for us quite a bit of dope tech that can bring a lot of that down to the consumer level and help us maximize our smartphone cameras more cameras are obviously for the most are really good they're also the most popular camera in the world at this point you may have heard the saying that the best camera is the one you have with you I think that's true but of course you like to take it to the next level so for photos obviously the sensor and the glass on the front of it are the only permanent thing about a smartphone camera lens adapter systems out there exist to add another layer to that so there's a bunch of different styles out there clip-on versions bumper versions case holster versions this one I've grown to like the most is the moment lenses so that's actually the new version the moment v2 and I've gravitated towards this one mostly because of their focus on quality it does require a case which acts as the lens mount and any tiny cine lenses mount to the case to change the field of view the focal length and the capabilities of this camera entirely there's an 18 millimeter lens which is a little wider than the normal field of view there's a super wide angle fisheye version there's even a 10 x macro lens that can get some crazy close up shots so this I think is pretty awesome now the fact that you need a whole case to be the lens mount instead of you know maybe just like a little clip-on accessory means you are a bit restricted it means when you upgrade your phone you have to get a whole new case so that's the downside but the benefit is the precision so you mount the lens over the exact center of the sensor every single time there's never any even getting in the corners no loss of sharpness anywhere in the frame they're polarized lenses too so in terms of really upping the quality gain from the camera of photos these are pretty dope these in particular support a couple of phones but not all of them in fact some I thought they would support they don't but they said it's because they actually wouldn't be a precise fit or they would have something getting or it's not practical so they have a couple you can check out if they're compatible with yours and I was never really into used before as like a cheap alternative to DSLRs but when you think about it that's exactly what these are you can never really match the quality of a DSLR that will always be better but this will always be smaller and always be cheaper now for smartphone video you add a whole other dimension you add movement of the camera a big part of video is movement and you can do a lot handheld you can have really study hands but after a certain point you're going to have some shake you're going to want to stabilize this so taking videos shot on smartphones to the next level means taking stabilization to the next level that's actually where DJI Osmo mobile comes in it's pretty much the standard right now as far as smartphone stabilization goes this thing is built specifically to stabilize a smartphone camera it has some extra controls on the handle of course which are nice when it connects to your phone which can trigger to pan left and right and tilt up and down and get all kinds of cool shots but mainly the operator gets to just point and shoot and start moving and the gimbal smooths out and stabilizes all the little twitches and shakes that come from being handheld and it works really well and I can add a whole new dimension to videos or even live streams or whatever you decide to shoot on your phone it's just up to you to decide how to use it now I found that it doesn't really handle the extra weight of also adding the moment lenses to it so you can't use the Osmo and your phone with the lenses at the same time you need a bigger gimbal that supports a little bit of a heavier payload like something like this Zoo yen tete crane which is made for actual cameras but the gorilla pod adapter let me put my phone on it but that's just if you're feeling daring so bottom line is all this tech exists to help you take your smartphone photo and video game to the next level and of course it's not just about the gear it's also about the strategy and all that you know about photography and video already I could probably make a whole separate video about just that but the whole point is yes a dedicated camera Wald's bigger will definitely do a better job every time in the quality department that's what it's built for but your smartphone cameras will always be at your side they'll always be smaller and they will always be cheaper than actually going on buying a separate camera system so well it might not seem super practical to actually go out and be able to shoot those commercial level crazy high end videos that people are doing with technically smart phone sensors on crazy rigs and jibs and stuff like that it's also a lot of fun to try to maximize what you can do with detect ups in your pocket right now and I feel like that's where a lot of people I tell is to start your YouTube channel with your smartphone cameras you see my inbox like every day there's questions about I have this gear and this lens is this enough to start a YouTube channel right now yes you're probably already set if you can watch this video on something you probably have a device that can shoot video just start doing it right I'm going to end this before I start renting that's pretty much it thank you for watching this quick one and I'll talk to you guys the next one bass [Music] 
 [Music]   hitman 5   wang   [Applause]   from New York   [Music]  
all right beginning livestream and I do want to tweet it so soon as I can get have a link yeah I found it oh we are alive sweet three people watching now what's up all right boom hello alright yes we are alive this chat is moving now so now there's definitely more than three people watching cuz I can see the chat how's it gone guys hello hey hey that that's a thing so I'll wait for always people to join but basically I'll explain like what this is what we're doing with it and the whole wallpaper thing the whole situation how's it going what's up what's up hi how's gone people are joining this is good hello it's been about a minute so that this you probably already know but this we did a video about the LG wallpaper LG what's the full name LG signature OLED TV W W stands for wallpaper so we call it the wallpaper TV did a whole video about it but I never really in that video got to show you like the well the behind the scenes of like the whole thing like people still ask to this day like so how does it how exactly does it connect to the wall because I never showed it off the wall so that's kind of the purpose of this livestream basketball emoji what's up we streaming yeah it should be pretty good should be 1080p at least I think it's 1080p 60 yeah we're good you saw the snap yeah snap chatted it I put it on Instagram story it's the hype is real is what I'm trying to say there's so many warnings all over the box too like this is the clean front of the box with it on the side it's like alright two people to lift this side up like fragile don't knock it over don't bend it don't pinch the corners don't stab it there's all kinds of all kinds of warnings but yeah okay this is I have a tape measure feel like me as a sense of scale is pretty good for how big the box and the TV are but this all right this is 65 inch you can probably see that right now I'm gonna go BAM that's 65 inches you turn them 65 inch diagonal ready and now this thing is I said that the second the only other size I linked it below the 77 inch version so we go out an extra 12 inches yeah it's huge it's very tall it will be taller than I am or it will be bigger diagonally than I am tall which I haven't seen that many nearly 80 inch TVs what is good how much for that thing so I linked it below they have like a promotion pricing for it at this point which is like I think it's either 14 or 15 grand for this one and then like six or seven grand for the 65 inch so it's still not a normal buy this is definitely a dope text like really high-end probably not gonna buy this everyday type of thing what is good LGB 30 review yeah that's probably gonna happen when they give us like final review units and a release date that's another thing LG should think of thinking doing soon hello from Egypt what's up are you using a chromecast or the built-in smart service I use both but I do have a chromecast plugged into it which is what you're looking at but I will also be using the LG smart services because they're pretty good the OS the webOS on TVs is pretty good I'm I kind of give away the old one says James from the super chat mmm probably not I'm gonna probably find another home for it either somewhere in here or in Studio B or something like that so should we open it up I just want to talk about it or just want to say we're we're watching from hello do I like pizza yeah daily driver right now is so I've I've said before I always carry two phones my main SIM card is in a Galaxy Note 8 and my iPhone SIM card is in a gala and iPhone 8 so i phone e+ in its blush blush gold it's gold but it's like the the color I showed in the video that I unboxed it's that but it's a lot hello open it open it open it open it open it this ain't open it self concept creator I'm doing well I'm excited I'm gonna yeah I'll probably need help but I'll just start to see how much I can get into this I can't really see the way I can see the framing all right let's do it world's longest tape cut incoming now okay there's like a little welcome thing on top but then on the back it's all the instructions that we followed last time which is how to set this up so basically how it works in case you're not familiar is there's these little hooks and also a bunch of magnets so the easiest way to explain it is like when you you know how when you hang up a picture frame like you hang like the little hooks over the side and you just hang it on the wall that's basically what we did with this but with a much larger frame and then there's also magnets in this sheet of metal and you bolt the sheet of metal to the wall and then you hook and magnetize the TV to the sheet of metal maybe that's I think this is just all my cables and i/o and stuff I'll take four please so this is the extension cable gotta love that this is a good cable here it's a good cable still having Tesla problems no I'm not having any Tesla problems I've I feel like I get that question like every time even though the last few videos I've made about the car have been pretty positive the most common or most viewed video about it is the one where I had problems but it's good now all right this box I think this is gonna be the remote control and some cables I would be willing to bet it is the installation guide and some cables and the installation guide has like a bunch of drywall screws and metal screws cuz you have to use them to get them in the wall I wonder if it's heavier like a lot heavier the actual panel it was pretty light but you'll see it's a different remote that's two remotes I'm not sure this is the one we had before the LG remote but it also comes with a slim remote did we get this before I remember this at all all right here I'll show it to you what video lighting do you suggest for tech youtubers I suggest LEDs cuz they run cool cool I'll get it thank you I suggest LEDs because they run cool and like fluorescents are hot so I don't want them to like bake all your electronics [Music] ever feel stuck or lost was just too much stuff I see what you're trying to do there but no I am NOT in that position right now alright this is the first remote so fast yes the chat is moving very fast hello from Connecticut hello can you read the comments I try get a little mic for screens please it's hard to hear yeah I'll probably end up doing that because this is a lot well here yeah she definitely get there I can walk around and just random clear accessories all right cool piece of styrofoam [Music] [Music] they definitely thought about this pull this out this is like the biggest piece of styrofoam alright that's the sound bar right here and I'm the panel I think I can literally this is a huge TV oh my gosh yes Oklahoma City Thunder is deep did they get weighed yet I don't think they got weighed yet but they're still pretty deep right now all right I'm gonna this is literally just a huge piece of cardboard that says LG's signature but it's not part of the TV at all so yeah god I can't show you how thin it is really but this is more cardboard and this oh this has the sheet of metal in it well it's not that heavy we're almost at the moment of truth guys where are you planning to hang it I'm planning to hang it right there I'm trying to take this one down and replace it with this one oh I don't even want to touch it all right you're looking at the back of this I'm gonna slowly this is insane cuz it's literally flexing in my hands right now not touching the screen okay so you know that moment of truth when you take like this screen protector off of smartphone you like peel it back that's the cleanest it will ever be and then it's over this is the one the biggest version of that put gloves on oh I should've oh that's probably what the professional installers do they have like white gloves and I do this whole thing yeah you're right I should hide gloves on but yeah do that next so the sound bar is still in the box right there but I'm going to take the rest of the and then pick it up by the back leaning right here how's that reflection by the way I'm doing this but there it is there it is out the box oh my gosh yeah no it's not a graceful in boxing at all but it is super insane in person let me turn this sideways real quick does that give you an idea does that give you an idea I keep leaving the mic so it's kind of hard to talk how's the latency for gaming it's actually not bad I mean you don't want to do any serious PC gaming on it but console gaming on it is fine yeah yeah it's been okay look at it watch it wobble when I move it that's that's what was happening while I was unboxing it and will continue to happen until I stabilize it all right how's the reflections it's probably brutal right now oh man can't see like all the lights and whatever or should I move it down not bad all right perfect so now yeah you get the idea make a drop test of it who said that that is a terrible idea why would you put that in the super chat heard about the Nexus 6p early battery shut off controversy I have not heard that everyone seems to have a conspiracy about that every year about phones and planned obsolescence and I got iOS 11 on my old iPhone and it stopped working I hear that every year all right so does this sound for any different that's the question because here's the theory we have the soundbar from the current one you can see that right yeah you can see the soundbar from the current one connected by that cable this in theory uses the exact same sound bar the exact same cable but we'll just be bigger so we wouldn't have to install the sound bar again but we kind of also want to do in the future in the near future like a really good table hiding solution version of this Oh gonna show this the sheet of metal how do I show this yeah I'll just all right so so here's the idea behind how this goes up on the wall this sheet of metal I'm assuming it's aluminum but it's really thin this is what gets bolted to the wall this is what you put the drywall screws in the wall for and then this is what hooks the TV the TV hooks into these little circles then there's magnets throughout this and the TV has magnets in it and they all just connect via magnets so that's what's behind the TV on the wall behind me right now this is so much more precarious than any phone unboxing you will ever see appreciate this being live on YouTube I could break so many things in this video looks about the same it could be a little bigger but probably doesn't have to be the only thing is the power supply for the bigger display it might have to be bigger I might just replace it just to be safe because I don't know what the insides are sure the cable it looks dope and futuristic well this is the cable it connects to the back of this which you can't see but it's behind here and then it looks like that and I just velcro taped it to the wall so this is a super simple version of it velcro taped to the wall it's a white wall so it kind of blends in that way but I think the ideal version of it is cutting a little slot a little invisible slot right behind the bottom of the TV cable goes in there comes down and comes out the bottom of the wall with another slot so that's what this cables for that's the extension but both into the TV already is the short part of the cable try to bend it into a curved screen you totally could this would easily bend into a curved screen I just don't have a curved wall you know looks exactly the same to me well that is nuts that is a huge box if everyone then moves with me $1 I can pay tuition nice yeah I don't have a if it's a wall so whatever the shape of the wall is is the shape that you just put the TV on and is good most walls are straight so that's just how that worked out um drop test now I'm not about to do a drop test show how bendy it is I think I'll show it one more time the thinness of this panel will be very careful with it that is the wallpaper TV all right I guess from here it's just the setup process we're gonna we're gonna dig into the wall we're gonna get into this thing thank you thank you for I'm glad you like the live stream take your top off someone gave two dollars and said take your top off that's an actual comment in the super chat what TV stand is that oh this wow it's a great question where did I get it probably from was my waiver is between these two one of them's wafer and one of them is all right now they're both way fair yeah yeah they're way fair so if you go to wayfarer waa why f AI r they have all kinds of TV stands that are all made by all kinds of sweet manufacturers that is one of them get them mic to clip on your shirt yes definitely a hot tip for this live stream I'm glad you guys came and saw that tip and gave it to me well it's so fast keep live yeah we're up we're alive yeah you know that's like basically about it drought where you gonna install it we're gonna install it in the same place the current one is basically we're about to do is take this one down and put the new larger sheet of metal on the wall and then put this one up in the same space the question is what do we do with the old one which is like find a place to put it gosh it's super fast super fast Golden State blood I can't see you're right diamond picture isn't level diamond picture isn't level I don't know what that means tell a bad pun our fees give away dress yeah people everyone wants me to give it away but the problem is shipping this is probably probably literally impossible since you don't have a job I don't keep the boxes to these so shipping a wallpaper TV without it breaking is unless you like pay someone to put it in their trunk and drive it somewhere is probably impossible box of Cheerios do you think the sambar is the same but I'm so there places just stay safe because I feel like the power supply and it may be different and it may not be but just to be safe the larger panel will get the new sandbar anyone else noticed that back there anyway yeah that's about it we took it out the box I think if you stay tuned to Twitter you'll see the progress we make with it cuz obviously we made the whole video on the first set up and we have the the cable ties gone and it's pretty well cable managed but the whole idea is we want to find some furniture where we can we can keep a Nintendo switch plug into it we can keep the chromecast ultra plug into it the Apple TV 4k will be plug into it and the ps4 will be plugged into it ps4 pro so that's four things that will all be on this massive TV and then we'll be doing some some more fun live streams because this will be the centerpiece to anything we do gaming related like if I just want to play 2k and smacks Meeks some you guys in 2k like that will be on this TV so the faster and cleaner we can get it set up the better until then that's been a quick livestream just taking a giant flat screen panel out the box and sharing it with you guys but next up is the real work which is plugging it in stuff and hanging it on the wall so thanks for watching this one talk to you guys later in the next video peace 
[Music] hey where's up guys um could be HD here and this is one plus five T it is literally the 2017 eyes version of the one plus five now the one plus five just came out in June of this year so it's only a couple months old and one plus is a company that tends to cater to what their fans want that phone had a lot going for it but it just didn't feel very 2017 with all the other phones coming out but this this now we're talking so in case maybe you looked over the oneplus 5 a couple months ago this is their new one maybe you'll consider this is the top five new features of the brand new 1 + 5 t so number one is the display and this is definitely the biggest change literally it's what makes it feel the most like a new phone it's now a six inch 1080p AMOLED display up front and it gets away closer to every edge so the side bezels are slimmer now and the top and bottom bezels are cut down a lot obviously that's very 2017 you already know screen to body ratio matters now and this feels a lot more modern already because of it now it's still not a quad HD display it's not quite at the level of the highest end flagships in resolution but oneplus also likes to stick with the lower resolution for longer as they have in the name of battery life and performance and 1080p obviously doesn't look bad at all so I get it also if you haven't noticed it is the new longer taller two to one aspect ratio we're seeing on all these 2017 phones so this one's 2160 by 1080 it's not new to Android so apps already fill up the display and everything there's no real compatibility problems but still of course it gives you a bit of bezel when watching videos and things like that but we're just kind of used to this by now on these screens bottom line is the display is way better it definitely gets really bright so it's viewable outdoors and it has different color modes in the settings including an adjustment slider for color temperature so they've thought of all this stuff that you're probably not gonna like this though it is an OLED and the display does this weird rain bowing when you get severely off-axis not a huge deal to everyone but I can already see this awkwardly making some headlines so number two is oneplus sticking to their guns with this design we have definitely seen this industrial unibody metal-look before there are some champers and some light curves but overall is the shape we're familiar with it resembles its little brother a lot but there are a couple of changes obviously with this nearly edge-to-edge display of course on the front there is no longer any room for that fingerprint sensor that they've always put up there so this is the first one plus phone to move it to the back and they have put it in what I'd consider the correct place on the back which is just above the middle not too high not too low just right about where your finger rests naturally it's still ceramic it's still extremely fast still just as secure but it's on the back now like where it's been with the pixel and the v30 and others nice and something else that's usually pretty underrated with smartphones is good buttons in fact we usually don't really talk about them at all unless they're loose bad buttons so if you ever need to mention that the 1 + 5 t has exceptionally good really clicky convincing crisp tactile buttons I like that about and another thing oneplus has never officially said that the 5 T or the 5 is officially water resistant or waterproof but I've seen some videos on YouTube where the 5 holds up pretty well to some minor splashing so that could be a nice bonus to something you usually don't hear about with this industrial design now number three is what oneplus has decided to do with these cameras so the oneplus 5 already had dual cameras it had a main camera and a two x telephoto lens on the back pretty standard set up from what we've seen but this time they've decided to do some things a little different this time it's the same 16 megapixel main camera as the one plus 5 but instead of a second telephoto lens it's another normal range camera same focal length 20 megapixels but with an F 1.7 lens focused on low-light photography now here's the thing about that the main camera is already an F 1.7 lens and it's less pixels so they're bigger pixels so you would think that's also better for low-light so how exactly is this second camera better for low-light well one plus is that the 5 T in low-light so under 10 Lux will switch automatically to that second camera and use something called intelligent pixel technology which merges four pixels into one to reduce noise and enhance clarity in low-light I can't find a better explanation what oneplus says I'm not sure if it's Hardware specific I would love to know exactly how it works but at this point we just kind of trust it I hope it works the way they say it does there's also still portrait mode in these cameras using all software to create a blur around your subjects since you don't have a telephoto lens anymore it's kind of like what the pixel two is doing this will have clear zoom and pro mode and all the other stuff oneplus has been doing in the camera for years so that's good to see but yeah an interesting little shake-up in the camera Department and then number four a new way to log into this phone is their new facial recognition there's not a whole lot of information about this available but from what I can tell you from my first impressions it is insanely fast at 5-10 times faster than face ID on the iPhone it's ridiculous so you can hit the power button to wake up the phone and basically turn it towards you as soon as it sees your face it unlocks no animation or anything just open immediately and then even if you're already looking at your phone when you take it out your pocket and you press the power button to wake it just goes straight to your home screen it doesn't even pause for a second on your lock screen to look at you which it's crazy fast it could actually get annoying if you just wanted to check your notifications so obviously it's brand new and this isn't a full review I will definitely have to do some more testing to figure out if this is the real deal but my first thought is how can this be so fast and also be just as secure not really sure yet but either way it's really interesting to see some phone makers already start to play around with more facial recognition stuff now that Apple of course is so committed to it with iPhone 10 and then number five last but not least is the stuff they didn't change one plus five like I said already was a pretty great phone for the price they're really hell-bent on being a good phone for the price so they kept a lot of those same things in the 1 + 5 t they kept the headphone jack that's something a lot of enthusiasts refuse to let die so this is one of your few phones left rockin it this year they kept the alert slider on the side again I mean if you've used one Plus phones for a while you kind of just get used to having this and switching between modes on-the-fly they kept of course oxygen OS which is the ROM that's always been pretty close to stock Android with a few added features on top still has that shelf to the side of the home screen and those gestures for screen off that you can draw on the screen just overall a familiar experience for oneplus users right now it's on top of Android 7.1 but I expect that it'll get updated to Oreo sooner than later it kept the same specs internally as a one plus five so still the snapdragon 835 chip and either 64 with six gigs of ram or 128 with a gigs of ram no wireless charging still but they kept - charging kept reader mode and most importantly of all it's keeping around that same price it's starting at $4.99 which is very clearly undercutting a lot of the higher-end flagships we've seen in the last couple months so this might be the one one plus five felt a little outdated this five t feels very 2017 and still cost less than a lot of the others out there not bad let me know what you guys think until the next one thank you for watching talk to you later please [Music] 
all right sup guys mkbhd here and welcome to dope tech of CES 2018 part two so if you missed part one I'll link it up here in the corner that's clickable in case we got missed in the flood that is your so box right now but I did go back to show floor with your suggestions from Twitter and reddit to find the things mostly I guess the more newsworthy things of CES that people wanted to know more about so right off the bat actually there were a couple of things that I wanted to see that I couldn't so synaptics for example they were demoing a fingerprint reader underneath the display glass I'll link this video that I'm watching below but I think this is actually gonna have some pretty sweet implications in smartphones as early as this year so I'm looking forward to that but I didn't get to see it in person myself or try it out I hope I do soon though and I also wanted to see but they weren't showing it in their booth LG's rollable TV probably the most hype thing of all of CES I'd say this whole year so they had this rollable OLED TV basically it looks like a normal TV when it's out of the box but it has these motors and it's flexible and it rolls into this box that they had when it's not in use so I guess it's really modern to be able to completely hide your TV like that but the other use would be partially rolling it down to make it this 21 by 9 ultra wide aspect ratio for watching those videos or movies with no black bars or even rolling it almost all the way down for this mega wide UI they built in that just displays the weather and stuff so I thought that was really cool I wish I got to see it in person but they took it out the booth or wherever it was pretty quickly trust me I asked about it but from what I've heard this may actually come to market and be a product we can buy sooner than we think like this year but for stuff I did see a CES it was kind of your classics it's it's your cars and your TVs they could probably name this the cars and electronics show and nobody would even bat an eye most of the dopest TVs I saw were pushing the envelope with resolution and size so you know anyone can make a 45 inch OLED TV at this point that's relatively thin and beautiful but some of the insane ones at CES were things like Samsung's 146 inch modular OLED display Sony had a massive 85 inch 8k HDR display blast 10,000 nits of peak brightness into our eyes which was really impressive stuff like this again is crazy cool to see and of course we hope it will show up in much lower prices in real products in stores in the future and then in the car department there's always lots of cars at CES and then at the height of those it's a lot of what I guess I would say like the thyroid a future concept Eevee autonomous type of thing going on like take Buyten for example brand new probably the number one most hyped new electric car at CES and it checked all those boxes that Faraday future and others have checked in the past as well we had that single fully working prototype in their booth check a massive potentially distracting that's still really cool display behind the steering wheel replacing the traditional dashboard check they have the lack of door handles of course check a lack of side mirrors but with cameras instead check and of course they want a best of CES award without announcing a price or a release date check I mean that's not to say this isn't a super cool idea this concept is fun to see this type of stuff at CES but I would avoid giving these I guess too much hype like I have in the past where they're not actually a real product yet but on the surface they're awesome and they're everywhere but basically the important thing to remember with them is that word concept that you'll probably see on it somewhere if you look up the word concept it's literally just like a physical representation of an idea so a concept car is not a real product yet I don't think we have a price we have a target price but we don't have a release date you can't buy it yet so it's more of a we'll see but what I did see that you can buy right now and I'll link it below is the mattias keyboards what they're doing is basically what we wanted Apple to do right now you can't buy a Space Gray Wireless Apple keyboard unless you also buy an iMac Pro so mattias is basically making that keyboard that anyone can buy plus there's some other colors so I'm pretty pumped about that and then on top of that they're also making a wired and wireless backlit version of that keyboard so the wireless backlit version is just on or off with white light only but the wired version has a literal physical wheel on the back for changing through whatever colors you want at any time in my opinion that is dope tech I also saw this one of a cine motion controlled arm in an icon booth so I've seen sort of stuff like this before but in person this one was called the Mark Roberts motion control bolt and the bolt jr. two different sized robots and I kind of want one it's essentially a robot arm that's computer-controlled that you can program camera moves into and you can do all kinds of crazy fast moving super study stuff that human hands could never do with a camera of this weight so it was giving me all kinds of ideas for tech videos but I'll I'll just leave it at that Panasonic kept up their tradition of having a Tesla in their booth which was probably pretty useful during that power outage yes there was a power outage at CES the biggest electronics show in the world lost power it's got a love aigis and there are also robots everywhere robots to clean your house robots to help you out with stuff robots to dance for you robots to keep you company robots to play Scrabble against and robots to beat you at ping-pong or if you're decent to actually help you get better at ping-pong I got to play against it it's it's really uncanny seeing it like toss the ball up and serve it that was probably the most human-like part but for real it's using AI and it's essentially getting better as I get better I mean I'd say I'm pretty decent at ping pong I'm not great but when I had good longer rallies and started hitting back a little faster the robot started putting a little more heat on its returns too so that number it's projecting on the net while you're playing is like a sort of a player rating of how good you are based on how fast you're hitting back and your spin and how hard it is but that also means the robot as it's playing you is gonna play you at that level too so for the record I got up to about a 93 out of a hundred I'm not bragging but I thought that was pretty sick and then once I took the lead I had to quit there also Huawei mate 10 Pro may have overtaken red hydrogen 1 as the most hyped phone of 2018 at least from what I saw on my timeline I think you know what I'm talking about it's been kind of everywhere so I think I'll have a little review slash rant about this phone coming up if you're interested in that also the US Postal Service had a booth at CES where they were showing off mail innovation mail innovation me anyway that's pretty much it that was my CES 2018 obviously it's a huge show you can't possibly see everything but I hope these dopes tech videos gave you a good idea of what it was like to be there and some of the stuff we saw I had a lot of fun and I guess the weight is on now for seeing if the things we saw there actually come to fruition I mean I'm sure 75% of the things that were there won't like the electric cars tough to say project Linda from Razer I would almost bet money it'll never actually happen but we'll see but you know that rollable TV yet might actually come sooner than we think so until then thanks for watching talk to guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what's up guys i'm THD here and fun fact my second most viewed video of all of the past year was the one that i made about this guy the xiaomi me mix that video got a lot of attention in fact a lot of you guys were asking about it since it's been about a year if there would be some kind of a follow-up or a sequel to that and there is and this is it this is a xiaomi me mix 2 you see the thing about the original me mix was as beautiful and awesome as it showed up on video i don't know if that really directly translated to sales i mean at the end of the day this is still a pretty huge unwieldly phone for a lot of people it's still running a rom that's pretty unfamiliar to a lot of people that aren't in those asian markets so even though it did have an awesome super thin bezel suite form factor that helped move the needle for the entire smartphone industry like we see in 2017 people weren't exactly rushing to import this into the US and buy it and actually make it their daily driver so that's where a me mix 2 comes in so pretty much every single change that xiaomi made from the me mix 1/2 the me mix 2 is to make this a more approachable more viable sequel to the phone that made such an impact for them last year so right off the bat the me mix 2 is smaller so it's rocking a 6 inch OLED display but of course keeping the signature tiny front and side bezels so it's a huge display about the same size as the new iphone we're about to see you know 5 point 8 to 6 inches but of course in a footprint that's way smaller and easier to grip even with one hand and the 6 inch display even though it sounds big for a phone it's in that tall and narrow two-to-one aspect ratio so it's gonna be easier to reach the size in the corners than your typical 6 inch screen not all 6 inch displays are created equal a lot of people forget that the body is now ceramic on the back and aluminum on the sides so it's still that super shiny fingerprint ii slippery finish but is also a bit heavier than normal phones of this size so ceramic is a really dense premium material like we talked about with the essential phone and it's packing that as well but really all the placement of everything the buttons the ports the speaker is all the same because the body is smaller so that just means everything is easier to reach the only difference is just that got rid of the headphone jack this year so essentially now that they have everything from that original phone in a smaller more compact more reasonable size what they did was basically a once-over of the entire phone to take anything that was a little bit extreme to make that original design happen and bring it down to earth so that piezoelectric speaker at the top of the old phone that had to vibrate the whole front of the device to make sound that's replaced by an actual real front facing speaker and earpiece up at the top of the phone much more practical directional sound much more useful it still has the ultrasonic proximity sensor firing through the glass so that's cool and the selfie camera is still at the bottom in the small chin but they coated the glass in a slightly more polarized shaded way so it kind of it's darker and it sort of blends into the front of the phone more and it's harder to see it's a nice touch that adds to the seamless feel of the phone and doesn't seem to have any impact on the cameras performance and they did upgrade the camera on the back so it's now a 12 megapixel Sony AMX 386 sensor with optical image stabilization an F 2.0 aperture and still inside that 24 karat gold ring in the middle of the back of the phone so no dual cameras on the back of this guy again but it's definitely an upgrade in the camera department even if it's not quite to the level of what Samsung and Apple are doing right now and the fingerprint reader on the back is also now even faster like it's super fast at which is confidence-inspiring and of course it's now in that ideal location for one-handed use since the phone smaller and it's still in the middle of the back and on the inside have some pretty op specs right now snapdragon 835 six gigs of ram up to 256 gigs of storage and a 3400 milliamp hour battery so with all that refresh in the hardware which is pretty impressive it basically comes down to whether or not you can stand the new e software on top of Android that ROM and they have added a bunch of new things in these updates to make it more accessible but more importantly more familiar mue now has a split-screen multitasking mode so this is something almost every phone now has except the iPhone where you can do two apps open at once that's been added and it's pretty simple to use and works well so you can really take advantage of the big screen honestly I'm kind of surprised it wasn't on the original there's still that quick ball that moves the autumn row of shortcuts anywhere you want on the display in case the corners of the six-inch panel are still kind of hard to reach and it's over all cleaned up it's pretty snappy it doesn't have much bloat not many bloatware apps honest honestly already gotten one software update since I've gotten the thing out the box and hopefully it continues to get more it's on top of android 7.1.1 right now so pretty standard for new phones coming out right now but I think the benchmark is just how fast they move to Android 8.0 I'm kind of having tabs on all the big phones to see how fast they do it but wait there's more there's also a me mix - special edition here it is actually next to the standard me mix - surely you can tell the difference they're probably not the special edition basically instead of rocking the matte black aluminum sides has curved the ceramic all the way over a round to the front so it's a ceramic unibody phone which is actually kind of amazing and then it also has eight gigs of RAM so that's what makes a special edition super limited a little more expensive hard to get also harder to grip that's your call so a lot of changes that are comfortable and make a lot of sense for the me mix to that I think they're hoping we'll get people to go from drooling over the me mix to actually buying one obviously 2017 has been this year of of disappearing bezels on the front of smartphones I made an entire video about that but I think the changes they're making are more to just put it on a global scale now this supports a massive amount of bands 37 bands total 22 of those being LTE bands so the goal here it has a dual SIM card slot the goal is that you can put your SIM card in this anywhere and it'll work including here so to mix or not to mix that is the question that I'll pass on to you guys but either way that's pretty much it the new iPhones right around the corner new video on that coming very soon be sure to subscribe to see that if you haven't already until then catch you guys in the next one talk to you later peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys um could be HD here and welcome back to the explained series so the galaxy si is a head-turning phone and there are plenty of awesome new things about it but one thing that kind of went under the radar I don't even know if it was officially said during the announcement is that this is the first phone in the world to ship with Bluetooth 5.0 so you've probably heard of Bluetooth and you may even know if your phone has bluetooth 4.0 or 4.1 or 4.2 but generally those different iterations of Bluetooth are just slight improvements to things like pairing time and low energy modes etc it doesn't really change the way you use it you just know your phone has bluetooth 5.0 that's a pretty big new number that seems to signify sort of a bigger change so there's a couple things that you should know that so what is new with Bluetooth 5.0 there are three main things that all enable one pretty dope new features so number one is it's 2 times faster so bluetooth pairing is generally not that quick of a process you have to do it very often but it's pretty slow you're someone like me who's connecting a lot of Bluetooth speakers as I test a bunch of them for a video then you know that it's not super quick but doing it with this Galaxy s8 with Bluetooth 5.0 shows a direct advantage of data transferring twice as fast which is the pairing process is a bit quicker and there's also less delay you ever watch a video like on Bluetooth speakers or bluetooth headphones and like the audio is a little bit behind the video like someone's talking and then you hear it like a split second behind usually not too bad but that actually does get solved a bit with Bluetooth 5.0 that delay is a lot smaller so that's data speed number two is four times the range that's actually been a real-world weakness of Bluetooth especially in my past it depends on what pair of headphones you use but sometimes you can be listening to music in your headphones and you leave your phone in another room you walk a little bit too far away and it starts cutting out and then eventually stops that happens like all the time the theoretical maximum range of Bluetooth 4 was about 50 meters with a direct line of sight but about 10 meters in everyday use through walls and around corners and around different rooms of the house so 30 feet tops so that means you can't get very far away from your phone it's you're trying to listen to music or if you walk around the corner it's going to cut out and that's kind of a nine-to-five like I said quadruples that max range so a theoretical maximum of 200 meters with a direct line of sight or about 40 meters around a house or indoors so that's that's 120 feet that's a legitimate serious improvement so that's not just like downstairs and around the corner that's like you can walk out in your backyard while your phone's upstairs you can walk to the front yard or around the gym what have you got to do you can get a lot further from your audio source with Bluetooth 5.0 and then the number three improvement is eight times the data throughput Allu tooth four and this is where a lot of the real world improvements and doh features start to get enabled so first of all this has benefits way beyond just like audio like I'm talking about speakers because usually that's what we use bluetooth for but bluetooth can also be used for things like Bluetooth beacons and parking meters and small wireless things those can also be helped by more data throughput through Bluetooth five but if you think about a Bluetooth stream like a highway it used to be a two-lane highway going 40 miles an hour for 20 miles now it's a 16 lane wide mega highway going 80 miles an hour for 80 miles it's a completely different story so having all these lanes of data moving so fast enables a pretty sweet feature which Samsung calls and which will call since they're kind of first to it dual audio which lets you output to two different Bluetooth speakers at the same time so let me demo that real quick I'm going to connect to bluetooth one at a time here plays it sound whenever it turns on so this is one speaker it's pretty decently loud but let's say I want that stereo listening experience I want to have two different outputs at the same time just bear with me here I'm gonna connect this one now so you go into the dual audio mode you turn it on and then you make sure both of your sources are connected that you want to play - whoa okay I'm gonna play [Applause] [Music] so the fact that that works so easily is awesome you might have noticed there's this this super tiny delay in the the audio timing one of them plays like a tiny bit before the other one that can be negotiated just by moving them further apart you'll notice that way left oh yeah this used to be a lot more difficult to do like you've heard of Sonos right so knows essentially made its living of a couple of things but mainly the stock that you could connect to a bunch of different speakers all around the house in different places at one you have to get certain so no speakers and you have to have that Sonos app and then you connect the app to the mesh network up to so no speakers create amongst themselves and when you plug that into those speakers then you'll get the one audio source among several so notes but you have to buy those very inexpensive so no speakers to make that happen this Bluetooth 5.0 and this feature enables that Sonos experience on any Bluetooth speakers so that is Bluetooth 5 more data more range and faster speeds and it's good to know about a phone that you may potentially get later this year so that's pretty much it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one hey looking for a freak someone who likes to please [Applause] [Music] 
have you ever asked somebody why they use an iPhone so we're gonna start with Dom which smartphone is in your pocket right now do I reveal it right now or not the iPhone 10 oh there it is sometimes it's hard to break away from that ecosystem what is it about this ecosystem you're talking about Kutner your next man the pressures on iPhone 10 Wow it's just two phones so far I'm gonna be straight up it's iMessage man in the ecosystem whoa that's what it is for me so be fair you need to be totally into the Apple ecosystem so I'm talking Apple music iPhones Macs the whole thing but on the flip side if you're in the Apple ecosystem and the tech outweighs everything else I would pick these up the ecosystem the the ecosystem there are tales all over the internet about this ecosystem in tech reviews and all kinds of iPhone videos probably every home pod video on the internet has that word or that phrase in it somewhere and even regular everyday conversations if you ask somebody why they use an iPhone it more or less comes down to the same answer sometimes it is just because it's the best all-around phone and they believe the hardware is superior that's sometimes but really often like really really often the answer has something to do with the ecosystem ecosystem a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment so in tech you know an ecosystem is just a community of interacting objects so Apple makes a ton of devices you know the iPhone the iPad the Mac the Apple watch the Apple TV the home pod air pods but they also make a lot of software and proprietary technology that ties them all together airplay airdrop continuity iCloud so once they can draw you into the ecosystem somewhere with one of their devices let's say an iPhone for example you get an iPhone like many people do then they can try to lure you to spend more money on other Apple products because they just work so well together now most companies have a family of products that's not new it's not like Apple is the only one doing that but what makes this a unique ecosystem so successful maybe the most successful ecosystem ever is not only how well they work together but the walls they've built up around those things living inside this Apple ecosystem is sort of like what we call a walled garden you may have heard that expression before meaning everything that's in the garden in these walls this is beautiful luscious garden everything is green it's everything you could ever want but these walls on the outside are really tall and they kind of don't want you trying to climb out or trying to explore beyond those walls just look at all the great stuff in here basically once you get a couple of Apple devices you start to get into the ecosystem let's say you get an iPhone and a MacBook just those two things they make it as easy as possible you start using iMessage you start getting text messages on your phone and then you can reply to them on your computer super easy blue bubbles everywhere your web browsing on your phone then you sit down in your computer and it shows up for you to pick up exactly where you left off you have iCloud Drive so any files on one are always on the other anything about showing up airdrop peer-to-peer sharing legendary you have tethering so the MacBook always has the iPhones internet wherever you go want to make a video call I mean I guess FaceTime is right there you can answer it on either device you ask Siri to remind you for something it'll put it in the reminders app every time so okay now you're in the market for a SmartWatch well I mean just you just get an Apple watch like what other options are there really now you can answer texts on your watch two blue bubbles everywhere answer calls on your watch there's FaceTime still ask Siri to set reminders on the watch it'll put them in the reminders app everything works together so beautifully okay now you're in the market for a smart speaker it's a pretty new market a couple of options out there seems like it makes perfect sense to just go with the Apple one now suddenly wireless headphones are gaining steam you're in the market for some wireless earbuds air pods are right there they work perfectly you get the idea all these services and products are designed to be as good as possible yes of course but they're also designed to be these little hooks to keep you in the Apple ecosystem to keep you giving them information and to keep you buying more Apple products as long as possible and the way to keep you using those products is to make those products as good as possible within the ecosystem and those are keywords within the ecosystem physics the existence of so many Apple products that on the surface or from the outside from behind those walls can seem kind of limited or pointless or dumb especially in new markets where there's just the beginnings of competition like why does the home pod exist in 2018 a smart speaker that only uses Siri only uses Apple music does not connect to bluetooth does not connect to anything that's not an iPhone does not have a headphone jack because for that guy who uses Apple music and has an iCloud account and has an iPhone it's kind of perfect to be honest though I even been guilty of being in the ecosystem you know despite being I mean I use Android so I'm not tied in as deep I use some multi-platform stuff Spotify Dropbox things like that but I'm a Final Cut Pro Editor because Final Cut Pro is really good and Final Cut Pro is Mac only and it will probably pretty much always be Mac only so what about leaving what about getting out of the ecosystem well in Apple's case pretty much everything is tied to your iCloud account and if you want to get out of the ecosystem you have to rip that information out of your iCloud and sort of import it into that new service a lot of times much easier said than done the more closely tied to iCloud that device is the more hooks it has into other parts of the ecosystem that make it harder to take out so accessories like air pods for example you know they work perfectly with things like your iPhone and your iPad and your MacBook because of the w1 chip they pair effortlessly we all know it just kind of works the Apple way but if you want to switch to another pair of headphones it's just that one hook in and you can move to another pair of wireless headphones and get away with it now if you use Apple music and want to switch to Spotify because it's clearly better again it's like one hook but good luck trying to switch your entire library between the platforms entire companies have been born trying to make that process easier but trying to leave the iPhone to go to another phone that's not in the ecosystem is tough because there's a lot of hooks in to this all of your app purchases are gone if FaceTime is gone your ear pods become useless your home pod becomes useless you can't use the reminders app anymore your Apple watch becomes a paperweight and iMessage is gone and then the iPhone the Holy Grail for shepherding people into this garden is so hard to leave that a new phone could come along with a better screen better battery no not a better camera better battery life a headphone jack and they'd still skip it because that ecosystem though it's kind of incredible also by the way there's other ecosystems too there's Google's Amazon's Samsung's there's there's some more complete than others and just generally a notice ecosystems from everyone are expanding and evolving two years ago you didn't really need smart appliances in your ecosystem as a tech company a couple days ago Amazon bought ring for a billion dollars to get ahead on smart video doorbell so that's just kind of the world we're living in with all these companies building up their ecosystems some with little walls some with huge walls some are just as open as possible the Google's for example is probably the most multi platform possible you want Google photos you can get it anywhere you want Gmail you can get it anywhere things like that are fun to see but it's still interesting to look at and evaluate apples which has been closed off for so long the walls been built for so long that kind of makes its own weird case study Oh than that that's pretty much it my only suggestion would be don't isolate yourself to just one ecosystem don't lock yourself in or if you already locked in maybe take a peek over those walls before it's too late thanks for watching tossing the next one please 
[Music] hey what is up guys in cabbie HD here welcome to 2017 and every year has some type of trend that all the big smartphones that get released that year tend to follow whether it's material related or battery related or headphone jack related so I was thinking about what this would be the year of what 2017 would be and the first thing that came to my mind was dual cameras most of the top smartphones all the way down have adopted at some point during this year dual cameras with a couple notable exceptions like Galaxy s8 from earlier this year all the Motorola stuff and likely pixel to later this year but everything else Galaxy Note 8 iphone 8 new phones from new companies new phones from old companies dual cameras were everywhere in smartphones this year but something interesting is they all did it for a slightly different variety of purposes iPhone for example did one normal lens and one 2 X optical zoom lens so a portrait lens but also great for zooming in LG g6 did one normal lens one super wide angle zoom so a landscape lens but also you know great for some fun fisheye effects essential phone was one that had a normal camera and one monochrome camera for enhanced detail in every shot but also great black and white photos if you want and so all these different methods of utilizing dual cameras in the back of a smartphone have been spread across these manufacturers for the past year or two but what we're really seeing is this year 2017 is the year of the disappearing bezels it's every single smartphone that we've looked forward to during the course of this year has had a minimization of the bezels in some point and even the ones we're looking forward to for later this year smaller bezels and to be fair they've all done that in slightly different ways over the past couple months as many people are willing to point out no phone is truly completely bezel lists there are things that you need to put on the front of a phone so the front facing camera the proximity sensor the ambient light sensor of some display drivers etc so as everyone minimizes the bezel they all have to decide what to do with those couple of things that have to stay on the front of the phone and it's been really interesting to watch the essential phone that's just starting the ship has crunched the earpiece speaker and notification LED way up in the top sliver of the phone and use a cutout of the top of the display for the front-facing camera and sensors the bottom chin is just for the display drivers LGG 6 and galaxy s 8 and even Samsung's Note took a more even approach of having symmetrical slim bezels where they put all the front-facing stuff and the speakers and sensors up at the top and they match that size with the bottom bezel but they have almost zero side bezels and then have phones like the Xiaomi me mix from a couple months ago with that incredible floating display look they chose a piezoelectric speaker vibrating the frame instead of a standard earpiece and they moved all the front-facing sensors to the bottom chin so this thing has truly 0 top and side bezels and got a lot of attention for it so all that has gotten us here and I've said this before cheap phones are getting good and good phones are getting cheap this phone I landed here a couple days ago the do G do G dougie Doge Doge Doge e Duke the Duke prop the do geek phone the do G mix this thing is a $200 budget smartphone that emulates a more premium flagship look and a lot of those key ways including the smaller bezels on the front and the dual cameras on the back it also happens to have an octa-core chip and six gigs of RAM so it's gunning hard out of nowhere for budget smartphone of the year which is really impressive I think it falls short in the places where you can tell they're cutting corners though obviously no USB type-c no wireless charging no waterproof but mostly just generally missing a lot of the fit and finish the premium that make flagships so nice to hold this thing helps us see the difference honestly between a low budget bezel slicking phone and a super high-end bezels phone at the core of it this has the exact same shape and silhouette look as another bezel this phone like the essential for example but when you take a closer look you know you turn the display on it really still does have a pretty decent sized side bezel and top bezel I mean the display doesn't really reach all the way up into the corners like you'd expect and the spots all the way around the phone where the glass the display glass meets the body and the back glass meets the side it's a bit sharper its we rounded a little bit which is great but when you take Samsung's new flagship for example the rounded edges of the glass practically melt over into the side rails of the body and then back over into the back glass again so it makes a big difference when holding it in the hand I didn't always used to be like that I remember the galaxy s7 edge was really sharp around the edges and that didn't go very well but that's the kind of thing you're getting for the price now so though this phone this do G mix for two hundred bucks has been really impressive and if you can get past the pretty cartoonish skin on top of Android it is actually worth a look and I'll drop a link below if you're into it but look the more I look into it the more I realize the real reason why this is the year of the disappearing bezels in smartphones is because that has had an effect that nothing else has had on the entire history of smartphones and they're doing something they've never done in the past decade which is getting smaller the main benefit of shrinking the bezels around the display is to shrink the body size and shrink the footprint of the smartphone so these are handheld devices and that matters a lot for usability being able to reach the corners fitting the thing in your pocket etc this is the first year we're actually expected to see a flagship iPhone that's smaller in every dimension than the previous year but with a bigger display that's why it's special so I just wanted to articulate that on video and for the holiday rush of smartphones we're about to see Galaxy Note 8 and then LG v30 iPhone 8 Google pixel to keep an eye out for that keep an eye out for the shrinking disappearing top bottom and side bezels and enjoy it because we have no idea what's next thanks for watching talked to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
hey what is up guys I'm can be HD here and welcome back to the Q&amp;A series I didn't forget about this one it is pretty late in September but it is still September which means we have time to do the monthly Q&amp;A this is actually number 20 ever so as usual I asked you guys on Twitter what you wanted to know what you wanted to know and there were plenty of questions and I have to say right off the bat the number one most asked question there was like 2,000 questions asked this time about half of them were just iPhone 8 vs. iPhone 10 so obviously iPhone 8 is out right now iPhone 10 is out in another couple weeks the majority of the questions even questions I get in real life are like should I wait is there anything really new about iPhone 8 I don't want to spoil too much of the review that's about to come out for this phone but I actually really do like it a lot and there's some things that people were kind of underrating about it and that are new specifically the power and the cameras but I'll cover all that in the full video bottom line is yeah I'm gonna wait for iPhone 10 if I'm buying I want the best iPhone iPhone 10 seems like that best iPhone what is your all-time favorite video you've made I don't have a good off-the-cuff great answer for this there's a lot of really fun videos I've made the one that comes to mind right away is the project loved a video that we made that it was only a 90 second video but I don't know if I've told you about the entire behind-the-scenes process that video took several days to make in fact I definitely did tell you that before but seriously that was a lot of fun and if I could end up winning the contest was a super big bonus what are your thoughts on Porsha's upcoming mission II and I guess is it a Tesla rival so I've read a couple articles about this thing and I've also read a bunch of articles about other companies that are making an electric sedan or some electric sporty looking car I think ideally yeah this ends up being a Tesla rival because they're so similar if it ends up being real at all it is another electric car that's in roughly the same price point as Tesla Model S the Tesla's so far ahead in that electric car market they already have all these superchargers everywhere they already have the clout the mindshare that's gonna be hard to catch but at the same time it's Porsche Porsche has a lot of mindshare and clout and people like them and this is a really good-looking car so if they could attack some of the places where people find Tesla Model S to be like weaker like the interior Porcia tends to do really nice interiors and I think they'll have something going for him but until then it's still playing catch-up would you go on first we feast hot ones if invited well of course yes if you get invited to do a show like that and to clear the wings with Sean Evans you of course accept the offer the question is would you embarrass yourself if you like don't finish all the wings I don't actually know I think I'm pretty good with hot food but I'm not sure here's an interesting one how did you and the rest of team crispy meat so generally I think the the first time a lot of us met was online so it's not really it doesn't count as meeting each other the first time I ever met Austin Evans I remember was I'm gonna forget which phone it was but it was a samsung galaxy s launch event it was probably galaxy s3 launching in New York City we both went to the launch event and it was we just walked into a restaurant we're like oh hey you're that other youtuber we've clogged with what's up good to see you in person and I think a lot of us do end up meeting at these tech events whether it's a Samsung event or LG or whatever they're just hosting a bunch of people who are doing similar things like tech press and tech youtubers so that's a lot of where we meet for the first time how many views did you get on your very first video in the first 24 hours of uploading probably probably like 12 probably I would say if I put an over-under at like 15 I would take the under do you think face ID will be able to replace touch ID in terms of real-world usage so it's actually kind of a question that I would have for Apple cause if you think about it I mean I'm sure they wanted an iPhone 10 I'm sure they wanted to have touch ID underneath the glass that fingerprint reader that everyone's used to in the same place just under the glass but they didn't they didn't get that in time so they ended up working really hard on the front-facing sensors to make face ID as good of a replacement as possible and as as far as we know it's actually better it's more reliable it's more consistent it has a lower failure rate it's harder to trick so ideally this is actually a good replacement but what if next year they actually do get the technology in the iPhone 11 or whatever it ends up being to put touch ID back underneath the glass does that mean we go back to touch ID and we just forget about face ID even happening or do we keep both but prioritize face ID because it's better but also offer that like state-of-the-art fan for reader what do they do that's a that's literally something I would want to ask Apple I guess we'll just have to wait a year or so to find out do you ever get disappointed by your YouTube analytics no we now have fingerprint sensor facial recognition and iris scanner on smart phones what do you think will be the next step you're right that is a lot of like body information like a lot of biometric data to secure your phone next thing you know they're gonna be like listening to your heart rate too wait why did I skip the new gold color in iPhone X or 10 iPhone 10 I keep saying I I don't know if I'll ever really get used to saying iPhone 10 first of all I keep saying iPhone X because it's an X it's gonna say X on the box I'm gonna look at it and say iPhone X actually I even remember at the event when we first went out to that hands-on area and they had all those Apple employees like holding up the phone waiting for people to shoot videos up in photos of it you could ask them questions and stuff and I remember I asked one of them a question and I said hey on iPhone X can you and before I even finish the question that interrupted me and said it's the tenth like I think they were told to actively correct these press people who were talking about the phone to make sure they say 10 not X anyway why did they skip the gold color I think I don't know I think there will be more colors of iPhone later down the road this year like they came out with that red iPhone halfway through the cycle last year maybe they'll introduce a gold iPhone 10 in a couple months who knows my real question with the iPhones is this new Space Gray why is it always a different color it seems like every Space Gray Apple product is different from every other Space Gray Apple product even though they're all Space Gray Apple literally got to invent their own color name here but they made them all a different color it kind of ruins the name reach ability on the iPhone 10 Fiasco or not I think you're referring to like the DoubleTap of like being able to bring the screen halfway down that's called reach ability on iPhone 8 iphone 7 iphone 6s all the big phones yeah that's not as far as we know gonna happen on iPhone 10 there's no home button so there's no place to double tap to bring screen down and I talked about it in my second video about that phone that is it's a big screen so it's going to be kind hard to reach that's something to consider I don't know if that's a huge deal for people it's not gonna be like reach gate or anything crazy like that but yeah this is a bigger screen something they're gonna have to get used to any plans to have a video test driving an owners model 3 hoping so love your videos Thank You Patrick and yes I think it's about that time where now people who are outside of Tesla who aren't employees are going to be starting to get their model 3 orders in so let this be a PSA if you are a future or about to be current model 3 owner that's also in the Northeast New York City area that's also willing to let me shoot a video about your car hit me up on Twitter link below wireless charging for Tesla's when yeah I don't so I've seen I've seen some concepts about wireless charging for cars the thing about wireless charging is it loses it's not very efficient first of all your phones our phones already get pretty warm when we put them down on like a wireless charging pad and they don't charge as fast because they're losing some of that charging to heat dissipation try to charge a car very quickly is already kind of a big deal people want their cars to charge fast but even in your garage I can't imagine Heat not being a really big problem there I was super charging this weekend on a road trip and it was really hot this weekend it was about 95 degrees so the car thermometer said a hundred and nine degrees when it was on that asphalt and it was plugged in and trying to unplug the car it was hot to the touch and that was just from being plugged in so wireless charging being like somewhere near the car and trying to transmit energy that doesn't seem like a great idea maybe in the future maybe in 20 years but not right now now that you have a main gear PC will we ever see a pub G stream from you maybe with Sam Scheffer hey you know what I'm sure Sam would be willing and I haven't so I'm not a big shooter gamer type but this machine makes me want to be I'm thinking will organize some sort of live stream where I'm actually trying to game but obviously the best games I'm at are driving games and like sports simulation type games but I'll give pub G a shot because it's so hot right now and also because that main gear PC is so hot right now link to the battle station post below it's kind of lit but yeah that's pretty much it I think that's what we'll end it this has been Q&amp;A number and of course the September edition it's about to be October so of course you know there's gonna be more questions if you have any others feel free to leave them in the comments below I'll hang out there for a bit hit me up on Twitter I get back to those but that has been it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one face [Music] 
hey what is up guys I'm qHD here and I have seen the red hydrogen smartphone / camera system prototype and now in this video I'm going to share with you so up until now visually we've only had one image this one render to base all of our thoughts on the design off of and that's great na but Jim from red wanted to show me what they've been working on and wanted to dispel any myths that they're not working on anything so that's a win for me a win for you guys to get this video and a win for red to actually show you something so they had a couple prototypes to show me one was a fit and finish prototype with all the final materials and dimensions and the exact look that they're shooting for number two was a prototype just with the working holographic display and then one more prototype which I'll show you guys at the end I take a look at all them but I really focused in on the fit and finish materials prototype because that's exactly what they intend the final project the thing that you buy to look like and it looked like this so yeah right off the bat pretty intense a lot of materials going on you have a really industrial looking try panel design looks kind of like a moto Z had a baby with a tractor like it's this part rugged part modern look and I really kind of liked it the middle part is metal and its logo cut out with what feels like a jewel with a red logo in it is pretty crazy and the top and bottom parts are Kevlar panels which is good for antenna pass-through and of course durability when you're using it as an actual phone and then on the sides you have these grips these notches like you saw on the render it doesn't feel too weird to hold but of course I obviously have pretty big hands so this natural fit for me might not be the case for everybody I use the phones I had with me for a little bit of a size comparison and as you can see it's a big phone this hydrogen is going to have a lot of room for some serious internals with a footprint this big you know I still fitted in my pocket there didn't seem to be any real problems but obviously this will turn into a two-handed phone for a lot of people and then the camera bump on the back definitely more of a placeholder than an indicator of what the module will actually look like on the inside but it's still pretty big definitely couldn't tell that from the render photo and then the button placement is solid power button the right hand side which will also be flat and double as a fingerprint reader kind of like Sony phones and then the volume buttons are separated on the left hand side which they probably have to be because of all the notches and ridges for the grips and then it also has a dedicated video record button and you can probably of course take photos with it as well USB type-c at the bottom and we also see a headphone jack down there but they're actually planning to move that up to the top and then at the front there's front-facing speakers a pair of them likely a stereo pair flanking what will be a 5.5 inch super high-resolution display and you know those pins at the bottom of the back as you've probably already noticed very reminiscent of the Moto Z because they will end up being used for the same essential purpose snap-on mods that add to the functionality of the phone then like I said this student finished prototype has all these final materials and everything but it doesn't have a working display for that they had a second prototype just with the holographic display and let me tell you I wasn't allowed to show this and it wouldn't have really translated that well on video anyway but what I can show you is my reaction to seeing it for the first time so they showed me some content that was shot like normal in 2d and then converted to for view for this crazy deep sort of 3d look and there's also content that was shot for this view and I got to say if my reaction isn't strong enough trust me I was just kind of lost for words just soaking it all in but I was pretty impressed it definitely wasn't perfect and I had some quirks like light bleeding around the outside of the display and some stuttering when I messed with some for view gaming stuff but this was a prototype and this would just keep getting better with time and hopefully be buttery smooth and seamlessly integrated by the time it launches next year and also if you end up not liking it you could just never turn it on because it has a regular 2d mode that looks fantastic as well just like any other normal smartphone so just as a pure smartphone this hydrogen is looking really interesting obviously it has these rugged looks and these unique features probably doesn't have things like wireless charging probably doesn't have waterproofing but again it's a it's a unique feature set and a unique price for obviously a unique user and then as a pocket Cinema Camera hydrogen is actually even more interesting so Jim made it clear that he feels that this can and will be the feature of small form-factor cinema and I mean you can see that being true with as good as red stuff already is and this hydrogen system being helium based it should also have incredible video quality and should outperform other mirrorless cameras and small DSLRs in an even smaller package in fact after Jim said is the quality should only really be surpassed by Red's bigger cameras and the pins and magnets module system is pretty intense I can't really describe it too much because obviously number one they're prototypes and number two a lot of it is still under development and confidential but think of it as like moto mods on steroids same idea with adding functionality to the device but I remember that last prototype I told you about in the beginning of the video well that's what that was so this is what that could look like as you can see attaching a module specifically for adding a sensor and a lens mount can already make this look pretty serious so that for now is all I can show but apparently in the next 30 to 45 days they said they'll have an actual prototype with both the fit and finish and the holographic display in the same body but what you just got from this video is a quick world exclusive that's something that Red's working on that they wanted to share with you guys so there you have it what do you think is that's is that enough to justify pre-ordering a thousand plus solid smartphone or mini pocket camera or whatever else these things might do let me know hopefully there'll be more information to come but until then that's been it thank you for watching Tosh you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys of kvh D here and Apple is now making a new iPhone color that's right it's real it's not fake it's on their website and everything it's happening apples now making a red iPhone and lucky for you we already have one here in house so this is your exclusive first look an unboxing of the red iPhone so this is a box for the new product red iPhone and Apple's had other product red stuff in the past mostly iPod and I'll touch on those in a second but this is the first product red iPhone ever made and while new colors of phones halfway through the year normally seem like a cheap grab for more media attention this one does not have me mad at all this is also a 256 gig seven-plus also for the record so right on top of the box would get the paper work like normal and actually a red product red card on top with everything else you normally get product red for those who don't know is Apple's couple of special edition red products and purchasing them gives a portion to support HIV and AIDS program and research for them so you can learn more about that at red org it's a good cause so yeah you get that and as you saw some normal white Apple stickers no red stickers or anything created like that and then of course after the paperwork is the red iPhone and first impressions are Wow thing is really red and really good-looking just as pretty in the flesh as in all the really bright ads which is saying something they look great I mean this is really red plus the front is this white front like the special edition color iPod Touches they did a couple years ago it's interesting so setting the phone aside for a second you also see everything else in the box is exactly the same so you have the Lightning your pods your charging cable your wall connector they're all white etc same iPhone 7 experience but yeah wow this matte red anodized aluminum is actually as ridiculously good as you think I hope the camera can do it justice but I really like the contrast of the red with the black of the camera cutout and the logo on the back the product red branding it's all super clean and that makes three new iPhone colors Apple has come out with in this past year the product red of course is bran new but we also did get that new matte-black iPhone late last year and we also saw the glossy jet-black iPhone alongside that as well so we have some new stuff to choose from and the red color I think has pretty quickly moved up to the top of my favorites much as I like the matte black it's honestly the most photogenic phone I've seen in a long time seriously the matte finish it's so saturated and really bright because of the anodization it has this sort of a satin look and I don't think it's going to show them any fingerprints because it's not pure black man I think Apple should do more colors of the iPhone like this imagine a green or a blue stuff like that now I got to say the only thing holding this red iPhone back for me and actually a lot of people if you were on Twitter this morning you'd see is the front of this phone why did they have to make it white I mean nothing against the white bezels you know some people like that that's fine but this phone could be a full-on mkbhd Edition red and black masterpiece with a black front imagine that I don't know something about the white front looks a bit goofy to me like it doesn't match also the new touch ID home button they have on these iPhones they could have totally made this silver ring around it also red or black but they didn't seems like an obvious oversight not a deal-breaker but kind of weird that they didn't do that either either way I just had people brainstorming ways to make the perfect red and black iPhone turns out there's three possible ways to go full red and black number one is allegedly the front of these iPhones is really easy to take off and replace from like another iPhone so if you had another black iPhone and a red one then you could take off the black front and replace this white front to have a full Rudd and black iPhone but that means you have to have two iPhone number two is you can just put a black skin on the front of this phone so it's red on the back black on the front but that of course means you have to have the red phone already and also don't really like like the front skins on the phone it feels kind of weird so number three which is probably the most common easy way to do this is to just get a red skin for the back of your current phone obviously it won't be the exact same anodized metal look or anything like that but this is by far the simplest way to do it so I'll drop a link below the like button if you want to check that out it's not metal or anything but obviously you still get that same kind of look if you want some reading or less but either way there you have it that is everything you need to know about the new read iPhone 7 it's going on sale on the 24th of March so three days from the data is uploaded if you want to check that out I'll leave a link to that below as well feel free to share this video with anyone who you think would be into the read iPhone that's pretty much it thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm Cathy HD here and this is it this is the long waited Samsung Galaxy Note 8 it was unveiled today and right off the bat you can see it's a very familiar phone not just because it was leaked everywhere but because it's pretty much picking right up where the note 7 left off last year before all of its battery problems I want to try not to make any explosion jokes during this entire video see how I do but yeah it's true so for some people it's boring but to me and to many others it's pretty exciting because this is the 2017 version of last year's phone which was already really good and had a chance of being my favorite phone last year before the recall so there's a couple main changes to note 8 that set it in place for this year new display and design up front new dual cameras around the back some updated s-pen features and new specs that's the core of what's happening here so the quickest place to start would definitely be the specs Snapdragon a 35 60s Ram 3300 milliamp hour battery and Android 7.1 right out the box so write about what you'd expect not the biggest battery in the world since they're not pushing it to the absolute limit but of course fast charging and wireless charging are onboard for those who use it and then you have the slightly updated design with the new display up front it's a 6.3 inch 18 and a half by 9 quad HD Super AMOLED display and it just looks incredible you can see it thin bezels of course since its 2017 up top and on the bottom and it has those slightly curved corners of the display too like the s8 had but yeah it's a huge display and it's a big phone to don't get me wrong but of course the thin bezels make it feel like it fits in the same body size or same footprint that's not really much bigger at all than last year's phone it's crazy how reasonable this phone makes a 6.3 inch display look but other design changes yes this phone does now have a Bigsby button kind of saw that coming from a mile away but they're doubling down on it and maybe you know Bixby's improving getting software updates getting better and a lot of people are of course pretty bummed to buy the fingerprint place and up on the top of the back of the phone the fingerprint reader and actually wasn't that concerned with it when I was playing with the phone but then I remembered my hands aren't the same size as everybody's so if you hand this phone to someone with normal size hands it will definitely be a different experience so I get it it would be way more reachable somewhere else like the middle of the back but then it would also be I think way more ugly and I think Samsung has roped themselves into putting it all the way up with the rest of the back facing sensors there in that rectangle kind of their own fault there either way this phone has you know iris scanning and facial recognition and some other ways of securing your phone biometrically if you just can't stand that back facing fingerprint sensor the s-pen is also now improved since this is a note so anyone who uses this will definitely appreciate it the tip is thinner that's like the number one thing I noticed right away and it also has even more levels of pressure sensitivity and in the software they've made improvements to all the stuff it works with so like screen off notes and actually the wheel that pops up when you first take out the S Pen I don't know if you could do this with the last note but you can spin it around and even add whatever apps you want to that carousel so it kind of acts like another Quick Launch carousel which is pretty cool in case you have a certain other assistant you like to launch my favorite new software feature though in this note is actually being able to launch two apps at once in split-screen with a single touch so in apps edge you can create an app pair like say YouTube and the browser for example and touching it launches them both side by side that's definitely going to get me to use split-screen a bit more even as awesome as a huge display like this is I found myself not using split screen very much on previous notes and Samsung phones but I realized like if you have this good setup like this you just set up a couple of good ones like Spotify and Google Maps for example a lot of music while driving I'll definitely use that more often so I can kind of dig into that but that's pretty much it for new software stuff happening if you've used an s8 or a note 7 you've seen this style this look before there isn't a laundry list of new features with the software here but that's the way Samsung goes so easily the biggest new headlining feature new change with the Galaxy Note 8 is the cameras around the back so Note 8 is now rocking to 12 megapixel cameras on the back one with a normal wide-angle lens and the other with a telephoto lens a 2 X optical zoom just like iPhone 7 plus does but the difference with these is they're both optically stabilized so in theory it should work more often in low light than the iPhones in theory and Samsung's tossed in a couple pretty cool features to work with the combo of cameras as you'd expect so they have a little 1 X + 2 X button now to switch between the lenses that everyone's doing I get it it's simple it works no complaints but you can now see some new photo modes including one called Live Focus which is just like portrait mode at first on the iPhones so it moves to the 2x telephoto lens and blurs a background but then you can change the level of background blur live as the name implies and see exactly how much you want to blur before you take the picture so it's definitely artificially adding blur and then once you take the picture you can go into the gallery but with these it also simultaneously captures a photo with the wide-angle lens and the telephoto lens at the same time and you can also now still adjust the level of added background blur after you've taken the photo which is pretty awesome so now obviously I want to keep messing with the camera to see how good this blur effect actually is you know if it handles edges well if there's a difference in aperture between the telephone and wide-angle lens so all this stuff will be tested for the full review but in summary I'm pretty optimistic for this phone much of that is obviously because Samsung has a pretty damn good track record with a lot of this stuff a lot of times you get a new phone coming out and you don't know if you can be optimistic or not and this Note 8 is gonna be an expensive phone coming in at around a thousand US dollars retail when it drops on September 15th so you really want to be able to trust what its gonna do is everything you want but like I said Samsung has this track record you know they've had great cameras and their phones in the past they've had a great track record with displays they've had the best display in any smart phone for the past two three years battery life has yet to be seen and software updates are always a toss-up but as a package Note 8 to me is looking pretty damn hot so either way the forward you will tell also definitely subscribe to be the first to see that when it comes out if you haven't already but that's it let me know what you think of Galaxy Note 8 thank you for watching and I'll talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys MTV HD here and a couple years ago in 2014 Samsung made a surprise product announcement called the Galaxy Note edge with this crazy display hanging off one side and for a random unexpected phone it got a lot of attention since then that product has evolved again and again into Samsung's entire flagship lineup which brings us to the galaxy s 8 so this new phone looks awesome and that's a hallmark headlining feature is how good it looks and how well it's designed and then of course being a flagship it has all the bleeding-edge specs inside and the hardware you'd expect from a premium Android phone so is this the complete package like the ultimate smartphone almost it's almost it's almost there so let me start by saying I love this phone's build like pretty much everything about the outside of this phone is premium and well built and awesome the display up front sort of melts over both sides and it does so smoothly into the back frame while last year's phone did it more sharply and if you want to talk about modern or about the future of smart phone design this year has been a shift to these really tall displays making these slightly taller candy bar shaped phones now the best part of these super thin bezels on all sides is that the footprint of the phone shrinks a lot so the five point eight inch and 6.2 inch displays respectively on the s8 and si plus don't feel like huge phones even though they have huge screen in fact the SI I think is a great size because it's so narrow I might have big hands but I think even anyone with regular hands can reach across to the other side of this display just maybe not all the way up to the top I think the best indicator for this is the fingerprint sensor obviously there's no more room to put it up at the front of the phones so they moved it around to the back but instead of putting it somewhere in the middle of the back they put it right up there next to the camera now with most backs fingerprint sensors they're a little lower on the phone for reach ability just the way you hold the phone makes it easier now I think the top fingerprint sensor might look a little bit better in some cases but it is definitely harder to reach even with my larger hand i legit dislike this location i hold the phone with my right hand so i'm reaching the max them distance up and over across the phone over across the camera with my finger and often I don't quite make it or I touch the camera glass instead or I only partially cover the fingerprint sensor and the reader doesn't unlock it doesn't work so this is through a week of using the phone I'm sure I could get used to it eventually but for most people this just makes it a two-handed phone and then you can end up just using the phone with two hands all the time now to be fair the glass over the camera actually does a good job deflecting smudges that come from Aaron fingerprint unlocks but honestly a clever way to get past this is with a case or better yet a skin actually so this is the skin from dbrand and not only is it better for gripping this all glass zone but the tiny depth difference actually lets you better distinguish the singer print sensor from the camera on the back so fun fact highly recommended either way Samsung's word on this is now they provide you with a bunch of other ways to unlock your phone biometrically that don't use a fingerprint sensor mainly being the iris scanner and the face unlock now I didn't expect to like this answer mainly because the face unlock can literally be tricked with a picture of you so that's no good and the iris scanner usually requires you holding it up at a weird angle that you don't normally hold your phone which is a little awkward but this iris scanner I think it might have a wider angle lens or the sensor has improved something about it is better because I don't quite have to hold it up that awkward angle anymore and it does a pretty good job of unlocking my phone when I'm not like trying to I set it up I didn't expect to use it but a lot of times I just hold the phone up and start using it and it would unlock for me so that actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise either way aside from the awkward tallness of the phone and a fingerprint sensor the galaxy estate is the best industrial design of any smartphone and a long time in my opinion even though there are other phones out now and coming soon that do the tall display thin bezels thing you still got to add on all metal and glass still has expandable storage through a micro SD card slot still fully water and dust resistant ip68 certified so you can spill water on it and it's cool it still has USB type-c with quick charge still has wireless charging still keeps the headphone jack and the speaker is below average and downward facing it might be the worst part of the phones build but that comes with the territory when there's no room on the front and you kind of want to water sale your phone so back to the screen it's incredible it is I would say the best display on any small phone again it gets extremely bright so it's visible outdoors or whenever and it's an OLED so of course it has fantastic color and contrast ratios and dynamic range and it's super high resolution too we're talking 29 60 by 1440 on both phones actually so all that makes for an awesome media experience a great web browsing experience and great scrolling through Twitter and Instagram and seeing a lot of stuff at once experience and all of Samsung's software obviously supports it perfectly now not every app in the App Store fills the display right now right out the box like a lot of games especially will have to be updated or may just never fully support that so you'll either have the black bars on either side or you can punch in and of course most videos also are an in this aspect ratio' either so when watching a video you'll get the black bars as well unless you hit the button in the software to punch in a little bit but then you lose some of the frame so it's kind of your call it's give a little take a little for the slightly taller display but overall I'll take it I think the screen is awesome and with its curved edges and curved corners I'm a fan and then there is the inside of the phone and since this is a flagship Samsung is again pushing things to the highest end of what's available except for one particular area but there's some pretty high-end specs in here Snapdragon 835 a dream of 540 GPU 4 gigabytes of RAM at least 64 gigs of storage which like we said is expandable and this is the first phone to ship with Bluetooth 5.0 which I made an entire separate video about that just dropped highly recommend that so the performance aspect is pretty much taken care of the same way it always is great specs great speed and animations out the box but nobody has used this phone for a year or two yet so we'll have to see how the Samsung software ages and that's just what it is it's Samsung software on top of Android 7.0 and it has its pros and cons actually like that it's adapted to be more like nougat with the swiping app drawer and the cleaner overall look especially of the Settings app but it's really obviously still Samsung eyes with all the colors and some interesting quirks here and there with the paginate adapt drawer and a couple extra animations nothing too crazy or extra but it's not necessarily better than not having it the edge screen has gotten better there's now a couple features like from the note with smart select and the jiff maker where you can select part of your screen to make an animation or even take round screenshots all kinds of stuff that we didn't have before so you know those interesting stuff you can put in there I really like the extended screenshot feature where you can take a screenshot but then it gives you the option to scroll down and extend that as much as you want so I'm really glad that made its way back into this zone but yeah overall it's familiar to anyone who's used a samsung phone in the last two or three years both aesthetically and functionally now one of the biggest new features in the software Department of the Galaxy s8 is called Bixby you may have heard of it it's the virtual assistant that's built for this phone that just does a lot of what Google assistant does now the circumstances surrounding it are interesting because Samsung put a dedicated button on the side of the phone just for launching it a big speed button now a lot of people didn't like this for fair reason whether they didn't like Bixby or didn't want it so they found a way to use an app to remap the Dixie button to do whatever they want robably should have been in the Samsung settings in the first place you can make it the default for the button sure but in in regions where people don't use Bixby or Bixby's not supported or language supports not there yet or it's incomplete let them go on the settings and remap it to whatever they want it could be a legitimate useful separate feature well yesterday Samsung actually patched that up and blocked any remapping of that button at all on the Galaxy S 8 so it's definitely now just a bixby button so understandably again people got kind of angry about that nobody wants accidental triggers of the app they want to never use but a couple of people were asking well hey what if what if Bixby is actually really great what if Vic's T is amazing what if it's better than Google so I gave it that chance I didn't remap my Bixi button and I was using Bixby alongside this phone for the past week and I'll give you that so first of all the voice feature is not activated yet and it won't get added till later this year so that's a pretty rough start but aside from that it does show you some cards your gallery your upcoming calendar events maybe some weather some frequent contacts but then that pretty quickly devolved into a bunch of samsung apps like themes and wallpapers and Flipboard and a bunch of stuff I don't use so really it's working in catch-up mode to be able to do all that Google does with Gmail and navigation cards and flight status and all that now the one place that did you some interesting stuff is in the camera app in the viewfinder there's a big C button that if you press it it can recognize images in the viewfinder and search for them whether it's images or if it's a product it will get you Amazon search to maybe buy it I think Google Goggles try this a couple years ago and with Bixby it was about the same pretty hit or miss sometimes they would get it and will be pretty useful especially when there's a lot of text to it that it can recognize it just searches that text so it makes sense that it would work there other times when I thought it might get it nothing came up or it got it wrong with this Bluetooth speaker for example sometimes I got nothing sometimes it thought it was a baseball hat I don't know not sure how to get it to work better but no dice so aside from this biggest new software feature being kind of a swing and a Miss on this phone I'm totally fine with the software on the s8 it's cleaner it's much more fine it's out of the way I like it now the camera on the back is has also been a bit of a source of discussion at first it wasn't really talked about and we kind of assumed it was literally the exact same camera as last year I has the same specs no dual cameras like some of its rivals it's a 12 megapixel F 1.7 aperture dual pixel autofocus optical image stabilization top-notch stuff again but yes same as we've already seen but turns out this is a slightly updated sensor with newer optics so the images will look slightly different from the galaxy s7 honestly most of the difference will come from better image processing but the photos and 4k videos from galaxy s 8 look fantastic as you would expect maybe leave a comment if you want a direct comparison to its predecessor but you can imagine you can see the samples great detail great contrast color and sharpness are excellent and pretty aggressive auto HDR modes so dynamic range is also pretty wide rarely blows out the highlights like a lot of other phones would so of course it's a pleasure to take photos and videos with such a nice screen as a viewfinder we often say the best camera is the one you have with you I think this is no exception with this phone it'll be one of the best cameras you can put in your pocket again this year now battery life is one area where I would have wanted just a little bit more now this is Samsung we're talking about here and they just had one of their phones last year literally start exploding when they tried to push the battery to the limit so I almost can't blame them for playing it safe this year but yeah the 3000 milliamp hour battery on the Galaxy s8 I was testing pretty much barely got me through the end of the day maybe 10% left when I'm done and to be fair I'm pretty heavy on it I use it a lot bright screen lots of video watching taking pictures etc for the review but there are phones with definitely better battery life as I suspected the upside though is that it charges ridiculous we fast I had a night where I went to sleep with 22% and I woke up in the morning with 8% so that's pretty terrible standby time I was going to start the day with the battery dead but I threw it on the charger for about an hour left with a hundred percent battery no problem so you kind of pick your battles there Samsung just played it safe with the battery so at the end of the day the Galaxy s8 is awesome and it's so Samsung that this this project was born from the crazy like backburner pet project that was the Galaxy Note edge and now every phone like this has this crazy edge display and I'm glad they keep doing that though and you got to give Samsung credit for making a phone that can stand out for how good it looks in an era well this little mini era where so many phones are accused of all looking the same this one actually does stand out in a pretty awesome way and I like that a lot of that there may be little things you don't like about it little unmapped abou buttons little software quirks here and there maybe the speaker is not the best but as a complete package this is an awesome phone I recommend it I've said the word awesome so many times you probably can understand that I like this already and I recommend it I've links below for other stuff you want to check out but that's pretty much it thank you for watching talk to guys the next one peace [Music] 
who's the better employee VIN or Mack nah it's Mack so yeah I'd say you probably got that covered hey what's up guys I'm QB HD here did you want to gonna come back alright what's up guys I'm Kip EHD here welcome back to a QA I don't have any more you want to treat probably I don't have anymore welcome to Q&amp;A number 25 we're doing one every bye we're doing one every month this is February so it's the second one of 2018 and I asked you guys questions on Twitter and a little bit from a reddit thread as well from the subreddit and you guys had great questions so here are the answers what you want to do on stage if you won this shorty okay this is actually a good opportunity to plug this for the last time so today is the final day that you can vote for mkbhd for a shorty award for creator of the decade it's a ridiculous honor and there's an awesome crew of other youtubers also nominated I'll leave the link below if you want to vote it ends like tonight at midnight so I'll stop talking about it after this point but yeah that's linked below also I have no idea what I would do on stage if I won because I fully do not expect to actually win that how many views did you get on your first ever a YouTube video from the time it was uploaded till the time you uploaded your second video that's an interesting question I'd say probably three or four views of course that was also at a time where you're not making the video for getting views it's just making the videos cuz they're fun so I probably uploaded my second video like a day after the first video I've also pointed to in the past the fact that I uploaded my first 100 videos for a total of 74 or 76 subscribers something like that and made a thank you video for video number 100 so we're in a totally different place now but that was a definitely a good time you were on a plane and about to take your seat which gadgets do you have on you interesting so I guess personally when I'm traveling just any time I always have my backpack and in my backpack is always my chargers for my phones USBC chargers or lightning chargers and Bo's QC 35 headphones I literally will go back to my house to get them if I forget them I can't fly without them but then the other interesting thing is if you're traveling with camera gear you can't put like a large amount of batteries under the plane so anytime I travel with camera gear I also don't want to check a bag with the red in it so it's all with me also I have a think tank bag that's the exact dimensions of the overhead compartment and it fits a couple lenses all my batteries to camera that's always with me if I'm traveling with cameras and I'm a laptop usually if it's a long flight I can actually try to connect to the internet and do a little bit of work but Nintendo switch also fun fact is a great size for airplanes it's not too big that you're like struggling with the seat in front of you great for gaming a new recommendation there what is your monthly data usage like actually I can check but it's usually pretty high each other pretty often when I'm traveling but the last I'm my my usage allows for five gigs and then I pay for more unrestricted data after five gigs which isn't that much but last last period I used 39 gigs so clearly I pay a lot more than I have to who do you think is actually in e lons roadster the one that's in space I actually asked him and he said Elvis so there's that how do you feel about the whole YouTube thing the 4000 watch hours and 1000 subscribers would demotivate small youtubers community so I've thought about this for a bit because I've been a youtuber for a long time but when I was first starting out and when I had numbers that were below that threshold you're not thinking about how much money you're making you're more concerned with legitimacy and growing your audience and actually making stuff you enjoy so for youtubers who have been making content under that amount of money the amount you're missing out on might be like $3 you're not gonna be massively concerned about not getting ad revenue because you haven't reached that yet so the limit makes sense for YouTube they want to limit how many people can just sign up and make spam channels and re-upload everyone's footage and make money off of that until it gets shut down this rule minimizes that but I don't think it should be discouraging for small creators who are going to be building their audiences anyway and working on their craft anyway because once they pass that threshold the amount of money they've missed out on is almost nothing and they're actually gonna be still working on growing their audience does the sound quality of the home pod fill the gap Siri leaves as far as assistance guess so I would say watch that video watch the home pod video I talked and I think I pretty much ended the video with the answer to your question which is basically guess that's but unless you're an audiophile in which case home pod would probably not be your first ever nice speaker purchase so you got to be in a really small demographic to want a home pod who you got in the NBA Finals I have my Rockets upsetting the Warriors I mean is it an upset if they're the one seed Rockets over the Warriors in the West Cleveland probably over Boston yeah probably Boston but I kind of see hugely going all the way at least because I'm super biased well Nokia be able to acquire the same status that they were previously known for this is a fun one because my answer is no I don't see them being one of the most sold phones of all time ever again that's actually something a lot of people don't knows if you look at the like a Wikipedia chart of the highest selling individual smartphones of all time Nokia has a lot of spots on that list but it's with those classics like the 33 10 and like the 33 50 actually have one from when I did that April Fool's video a couple of them actually but since this time since this dominant time of Nokia selling millions and millions of phones they haven't really had any major hits like this they've had some windows phones that have been pretty solid it seems like they've decided that this is the best they're gonna do because this is the latest phone that they've released which is the 3310 again it still plays snake it's still what they think is their best choice so as much as I really ruin blackberry about how behind all the times they are Nokia is also feeling that nostalgia pretty hard so I don't I don't foresee them reaching these heights again this was kind of a go all right so we can do a couple from the subreddit here does the merch line have plans to release hoodies in the future love the videos keep up the amazing work thank you sir so for the merch line that's something we've heard a lot about is you know suggestions for what which I asked for probably the number one suggestion was people in colder climates who don't wear t-shirts is often some sort of a long sleeve or jacket or hoodie option and we hear that loud and clear and just generally we've heard a lot of great feedback about the things that you've been able to order plenty of people have ordered them I'm pretty excited for you guys to rock them the link of course is always below or in bio as a matter of fact I think I've enjoyed this this little launch so much that I feel like giving away a free shirt I'll give away one of the pieces emerged so basically how this works is it's a promo code you'll have to type it in so make sure you I guess you're on the site right now and you probably have what you want in your cart so do that if you're ready I'll just go ahead and read this out all right so it's p b z s w p4 c c8 and then you hit apply and it's probably gone assuming you weren't first here's a couple of this if you're a if you're faster all right how is how has having additional team members increase video production efficiency or quality of your videos it's a great question that I've also seen a lot I think the short answer to that is just more better typically the relationship for a creator between more videos and better videos is inverse if you want to make a lot more videos typically they don't get a lot better if you want to make much better videos typically they don't happen very often but having more hands and like-minded extremely talented people on board makes it so that I can kind of increase both a little bit at the same time ideally I mean I'm still learning we're all still sort of building this together but that's the goal more better now as someone says how do you spell your middle name with a K anyway I'm gonna end it there that's been a wrap thanks for watching these Q&amp;A videos all the relevant links are below everything you saw in this video but yeah thanks for thanks for being a part of this this has been a pretty solid start to 2018 and I feel like a lot of good stuff is coming until the next one thanks for watching talk to you later pace 
hey what is up guys I'm TV HD here and I've done some smartphone roundups some camera comparisons in the past I've done these very objective very numerical evaluations of how good the camera performance was and what these things are capable of but that was back in 2014 now that is 2017 smartphone cameras have gotten so good that the difference between the top size best smartphone cameras meaning the ones that you buy because you take a lot of photos and videos the difference is so small it's gotten so small that the difference is way less about like objective differences in performance like better or less dynamic range or more or less megapixels and it's more just about personal preference which one you think looks a little bit better maybe want to have some software features you like or maybe one has a little bit of a different hue it just looks a little better in the color so to prove that I have the top 5 best smartphone cameras out here and I've taken identical photos with all of them a bunch of them from the exact same angles and you decide the one you're supposed to be honest with yourself I don't get to the end of the video start right here and we're going to go through a B C D and E and you can see if you can pick one of them that you like better than the others you can look at what you like about sharpness and detail or dynamic range or just colors or maybe just just look at it and pick the one you like that looks better so pro tip go ahead and watch this in as high resolution as you can go ahead and click down here in the bottom corner and if you can watch in 1440p do that if you can watch it in 4k do that that will give you the best look at these photos let's take a look alright so this first one is a backpack and it's outdoors on a bench and the biggest thing you're going to notice between these is actually the color temperature and contrast so just looking at that black pocket that's underscore is supposed to be black but you can notice in each of the pictures there's a little bit of a different color cast bit of a different hue and the sharpness and the detail levels are about the same in and out of focus and the background is about the same but you'll notice the color temperature is the biggest differentiator so here's your side-by-side in case that helps posit if you need to look at it and moving on so this is another outdoor picture and there's a little bit less colors but the same effect you'll see a little bit more this is a gray car but as you can see in each of the individual shots the car and the round which is the asphalt varies again with the color the yellow lines get a little bit warmer or cooler on each shot but for the most part the exposure and the sharpness are about the same again the plants on the front the colors on the back UV to judge here's a side-by-side again for those who want to see it positive you need it and moving on now this is a portrait so a lot of people when you're looking at portraits you can look at again colors and things like skin tones my skin tones are different in every single one of these so you can check that out and I'm also wearing a pretty vibrant shirt so you can see how the cameras and the image processing helps with that but for the most part it's an InFocus foreground a slightly out of focus background and just a little bit of a focus on the colors for the portrait a little bit softer and some a little bit sharper and others here's the side by side for those who want it pause if you need it and moving on now this one's a pretty distinct foreground and background shot so I'm taking a portrait here so you guys can see how blurred out the backgrounds get and smartphones these days have really wide aperture is f 1.9 1.8 1.7 even so a lot of these are doing a really good job that you can see to the extent and the degree that they blow out the background and of course you get a sense of white balance as well with the different colors and shades of the white of the table so again you can take a look at this side by side pause it if you need it and next now here's another portrait and we're outdoors it's a little bit contrast here but again the bigger differences you notice here is the difference in color on the white wall the black asphalt and then just the color of the jacket it kind of changes with coolness or warmness based on the color temperature again but yeah overall a pretty similar shot in each one as far as sharpness goes because again everything's in focus but you can notice the difference is an image processing just based on the way the colors look so again here's your side by side of each single one pause if you need it moving on notice a bit of a lower light photo and this is where the best smartphone cameras or cameras in general can actually Excel and separate themselves from the lower end so for this one you're looking at the tones in groups little face and you want to look at noise reduction you can look at his eyes and the black shelf that he's sitting on the rest of it is a little bit of the cast in the hues and there's a backlight behind him on a white wall but you can see to the extent that they blow up group space or don't and also if you want the side-by-side here is that again you can see the tone differences and moving on now this one's a landscape to the extent that I could do a landscape on such a dreary day like this but you can see the Empire State Building there in the background and for landscapes you really want to focus on just detail so if you're counting windows on the Empire State Building you have a pretty good idea that this one gets sharpen as well but again the color differences is what I notice is the biggest difference here as well so look at the colors of the cement on each one and then we'll get this side-by-side and moving on so last but not least I think this is the the tell-all or the most revealing photo you want to keep an eye on two things on this one the top tones of the steering wheel it's an all black interior and over on the left in the rear view mirror the amount that you can see that American flag in the mirror in some it's a little bit overexposed in others it's perfectly visible so you can see which ones have the most dynamic range or which ones have the most pleasing image but again here is the side by side of the center point which was a steering wheel which is the part that I tap to focus on when I took the photo and that is it so now that you've seen all the comparisons you've made your pick by now which one is your top choice maybe leave it in the comments section below with it a b c d or e and this is the phone you picked that is your top choice for a smartphone camera so does your winner surprise you at all probably not because these are among the best smartphone cameras the reason why they were chosen was because they have good cameras and they're all very similar in that regard but a lot of times people just have a little bit of a bias they don't want to take one and up taking I think what happens when we go into a lot of these head-to-head comparisons is we go in knowing which one we want to win so we see a side-by-side of phone a and phone B and we know we like phone a and we want to justify it being better in our heart so every little difference that looks better about phone aise picture than phone B's we will say to ourself okay that makes it better and we just ignore everything that's good about phone B it's a basic confirmation bias and we just kind of assume the new one is better even if we don't know that for sure we might actually like a different phone than we thought we did a lot of people go into it saying oh I hate the iPhone I'd never pick it but a lot of you pick the iPhone so hopefully this sheds a little bit of light on the fact that they're all really damn good and there's other things that of course go into picking a smart phone even just for the camera I've gone over them in the past just autofocus speed software features time-lapse features stabilization all these things when taking a video even the selfie camera is important all I went over and this one is just a back facing camera performance anyway let me know what you think thank you for watching and I'll talk to guys the next one Hey [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm qHD here and welcome to the Q&amp;A video number three for 2017 it kind of figured we're doing these on a monthly basis now there is one in January one in February and now it's March so before it snows us in here go ahead answer some questions from Twitter if you think Apple and Google are collaborating on something referring to Tim Cook and perch Ives dinner I don't know if you guys saw there is this picture floating around of sundar pichai the CEO of Google and Tim Cook the CEO of Apple at some dinner maybe I can't even talk during the same place the photo looks weird it looks almost photoshopped like the angles are messed up but you know what even if we take the picture of face value it is totally possible they have dinner together one day and someone took a photo of it I don't know if they're collaborating on something because they had dinner together but I still would love to imagine like I'd love to be a fly on the wall for that conversation all right you know how it goes first one to smile picks up the top for dinner right whoo you should update the Mac bro what is the worst thing you've ever done at a tech event I actually thought about this one for a little while and I couldn't come up with anything but then I read the replies to this tweet and actually brought up a good one there was once a moto X launch event in New York City and instead of bringing the typical camera that I usually do I brought the rx100 is one of the first point shoots at the time to shoot 4k video it was an opportunity to test it so I like a really good use for that camera and I brought it in to get the first hands-on for that new Moto X and get footage on the rx100 well that was when I very quickly learned that that camera overheats while shooting 4k for more than about five to eight minutes at a time so I was stuck in that event with a brand new phone in my hand and a camera that stopped working five minutes into my shooting because I had to take out the battery and would you literally blow on it to get it to cool down but luckily I had a couple batteries with me I could go through them and cool down the camera and get all my footage but that was almost a lot worse than it actually ended up being I mean the video I got out of it actually ended up being pretty good but that might be the worst thing worst thing I've ever done at a tech event if you could meet one person dead or alive and talk tech with them for an hour who would it be okay so brace yourself for the most unsurprising answer in the world I'm pretty sure this would be on anyone's list probably in their top three or five at least would be Elon Musk I've interviewed a couple people in the past and they weren't necessarily tech specific figures you saw the video I did with Kobe I tried to ask him about tech it was clearly not a huge tech head I've even talked with Neil deGrasse Tyson who's an astrophysicist but we talked more about like conceptual stuff but if you've ever seen Elon Musk get interviewed he was the CEO of an electric car company and he can literally give specifics about fine-tuning the ostrich cars motors and the aerodynamics and the technology that goes inside it all that stuff same thing with rockets he happens to also run a rocket company and talk specifics about rocket science so I think it'd be pretty awesome to talk tech with Elon Musk for like an hour even if we're just shooting about like it what phone do you use like what tab would you use what laptop do you use have you taken the challenge of making a Tesla Model S commercial so for those who haven't seen a Elon Musk of all people the CEO of Tesla retweeted tweet from apparently a letter he got from a five-year-old asking if they could hold a contest to make the best video about Tesla and they wouldn't have to spend any money on marketing because that's kind of a thing Tesla doesn't do but they could give some prize to the winter so now hustles actually doing it it's called Project love day I think that's the name of the little girl's last name and I'll link it below I'll link to tweet so you can see the whole story that led up to it but now they're opening submissions for the best possible video in under 90 seconds about Teslas of course naturally I'm thinking about making maybe not just one video but maybe I'll make a couple of submissions and like put them in to one video that I put on YouTube but also submit them separately so they can get those I think it'll be a lot of fun to try to make the best most clever possible video about the Model S considering the ability we have to do that I don't know if you guys have any ideas for what I should put in the video here's one why don't you talk about sponsors in your videos video the simple answer to that is usually because there is no sponsor if there ever is a sponsor it's actually legally required that I disclose it so that will always be either in like the bottom corner of the video you'll see that there's paid promotion in a video but that's very rare and in fact the last sponsored video that I've done I actually had to look it up was the 101 plus 3t giveaway a naturally on a tech channel you always think like oh if he shows a product or if he likes a product that's clearly helping the company that made the product out a little bit which is also the reason why anytime I like something I get accused of being paid for it but obviously you know I can't do that because that's illegal like super illegal so the one reason we actually do like to bring in sponsors for videos is to be able to make things happen that we couldn't ordinarily do sometimes it's to get access to something like a product to show you where sometimes it's to give away a hundred phones I'm pretty sure it would have been extremely difficult for me to buy a hundred phones and then give them all away and then ship them all internationally to the winners that would been impossible without the sponsors so that's the type of thing that I look to go to a sponsor for is to make stuff happen that couldn't ordinarily happen if you guys are ever at all curious about whether or not a device was provided for the video that I made about it you can always find that at the bottom of the description so if you see a review and you just want to know that's always going to be there you see smartwatches making a comeback in 2017 no not really I kind of see it the same way that tablets ended up tablets I made a video about if they're dying or not I think they kind of are if it's not an iPad it's kind of falling off the map in the tablet world I mean let's be real and it's kind of the same way smartwatches are now if it's not an Apple watch it's kind of off upon off the map which is pretty sad that doesn't mean there aren't other good smartwatches out there because there are there's really good smartwatches but in terms of sales volume brand awareness just people knowing about smartwatches pebble is gone all like a ton of the ones that we used to really put our name on like the Moto 360 that's gone it's the Apple watch or is nothing that's just the way it is plus predictions for those Clippers uh not looking too high I mean it's still like middle of the West but I'll say we will lose to either the Warriors or the Spurs where we play first because being a youtuber a career or a hobby what is your favorite meme at the moment awesome says if you could redo one video from the last eight years which would it be first of all Wow eight years have we been making videos for eight years second of all I almost have no good answer for this the one thing I can say is I did get to interview Kobe a while ago if I could redo that and meet Kobe again that would be pretty cool what do you expect from the pixel - okay so we know the pixel one the Google pixel was a surprise great phone from last year and we're kind of all but confirmed that we're going to see a pixel - this year what do I expect from it I have almost no clue all I know is stock Android the latest version there's people outside talking the designs we've seen from phones if you're already like the g6 with that great display and no bezel and also the Galaxy s8 coming kind of have me optimistic for probably a little bit of a more radical design for the pixel but again that the focus of the pixel has never really been designed I mean you go back to the Nexus it's all about the software so it's kind of a toss-up we'll see I'll be happy to see anyway that's where I'm gonna end this QA thank you so much for your questions and for your comments of course I'm looking forward to and if you want to be first in line to be able to ask questions for the next Q&amp;A if you just want to see when it's happening be sure to follow on Twitter the link is below that's where I'll end it thanks for watching talk to guys the next one [Music] 
hey what is up guys I'm cabbie HD here and if there's one thing that's consistent in tech throughout the years its iPhone hype in fact I'd say that's probably the number one question that I get in real life most often I mean there's obviously you know what do you do with the extra tech and what phone should I get and do you play basketball but I'd say the number one thing people really want to know is what do you know about the next iPhone there's been plenty of stuff floating around and I've even prodded at it a little bit in past videos but this is all everything in one place this is everything we know or are hoping for as far as the next iPhone is concerned so we have the iPhone 7 and 7 plus in 2017 right now and we expect a new iPhone announcement in the fall probably be September again like usual and this is actually the 10th anniversary iPhone announcement so this is the 10th year of a new iPhone so we're kind of expecting something a little bit special now whether it's called iPhone 7s or iPhone 8 or iPhone 10 or 10th anniversary or iPhone X there's plenty of rumors about what that may be we're kind of expecting possibly one premium iPhone and then two normal new iPhones but whatever that may be we're kind of slotting this all into the bucket of new iPhone so first of all the design and this is the thing that most people get the most excited about because it's the sort of most refreshing new change with the phone and through a couple months of leaked parts and design speculation the rumors we have so far are pretty consistent through all the mock-ups it's a familiar back with the vertically oriented camera housing and a full-screen edge to edge display on the front now on the back that's cool that's fine pretty much still standard I think we've all realized at this point that the actual phone when it comes out tends to look a lot better than the mock-ups so the early mock-up so the vertical camera looked a little bit odd in the way it was oriented but now it just seems like that's probably the way it will go so that's fine but the rumors about the display on the front are of course much more exciting and interesting first thing is the display panel type we're actually really expecting to see an OLED display in the next iPhone finally it would be the first one all the previous iPhones have had LCD displays which are fine but an OLED display has plenty of benefits including pitch black deep blacks higher contrast ratios we have awesome displays from Samsung with really high brightness any of course have battery Ben it's OLED displays are great and of course also being edge to edge you have the advantage of fitting a much bigger display in the same exact body size so you can see a display as big as 5 point 8 inches corner to corner in the same body size as the iPhone 7 plus as far as resolution goes I would love to see quad HD but knowing Apple I kind of expect to see 1080p again on the larger display just as far as how thin they tend to make the phone how small the battery usually is and what their bias seems to be so I'd expect 1080p again but then of course that brings us to the home button because you of course have to do something different with the home button if you want to have an edge to edge display obviously you look at all these rumors and mock-ups there's no home button or fingerprint reader on them at least visibly that's the question so there's three options here and the rumors and the past couple months have been flip-flopping between these three options even in the past couple days because no one really knows yet and Apple may even have recently been making that decision but option one is home button and fingerprint reader underneath the display glass option two is home button underneath the display glass turn your front reader somewhere else on the back side may be an option three is home button underneath the display glass and no fingerprint reader we'll talk about all these and I would also say that these are in the order of what I think Apple would prefer to do but not necessarily the likelihood of them happen so option number one of the home button and fingerprint reader underneath the display glass would be awesome that would be a seamless transition from the familiar iPhone design you know ten years of predictable iPhone designs to something new and modern that doesn't lose any functionality that would be great but the technology to make this happen specifically the fingerprint reader behind the display glass is something that's brand new and just getting demoed and showed at this point right now and knowing Apple Apple tends to sort of lay back a little bit and let brand new technologies get tested and see how the market responds and then implement things hopefully better than they have been and this isn't really something they have time to do if they want to implement this fingerprint reader right now welcome is the latest one I've seen they've done a demo of a fingerprint reader underneath display glass it can apparently read through the entire display it can read through metal it can work underwater and in all types of different scenarios it's ideal and it's all some but it's a little bit slower than touch ID which is blazing fast obviously and it does have the highest success rate and also it's not mass-produced in millions of phones right now it's still a demo so it would be awesome it's what I want to see happen it's the ideal scenario but I have my doubts about it happening so option 2 is home button underneath the display fingerprint reader elsewhere you might have recalled seeing this on a different phone this year the Galaxy S II the samsung got to put the full edge to edge display in the Galaxy S 8 and it looks awesome and I've raved about that in the review and they also put the pressure sensitive home button underneath the glass on the front for all we know they may have wanted to also do the fingerprint reader there but didn't have that technology available to them it was a couple months ago so they put the fingerprint reader up here on the back of the phone now Apple pulling that move would obviously mean now you need to put that fingerprint reader on the back which means a different design and a little bit of a different schematic that we haven't seen yet doesn't look quite as good in my opinion but obviously that has to remain an option if you don't get that technology and the other way to do it is option number three if you don't want an awkward place back fingerprint reader or if you just can't stand having it in the middle where it is on the pixel then you do know fingerprint reader at all you still have the home button at the front but then you have other biometric ways of scanning a face recognition or iris scanner or some other way to log into the phone would kind of suck though because touch ID is already a big part of iOS so those are the three main options for the fingerprint reader home button combo again it's not really sure what exactly is going to happen at this point I kind of wish I knew you already know what I want to happen the ideal is the option number one but that will say so those are the major big hitters but there's a couple other little things to consider that are really exciting to number one to think about is wireless charging no iPhone has ever had wireless charging a couple other phones have which are really nice and there's been some code found in iOS 11 that's buried some some new sounds you're obviously familiar with the sound of when you plug in an iPhone to charge that's one sound there's now a new sound file in iOS 11 and I'll link to the video below so you can listen to them over and over again that sounds way more futuristic sounds like this [Music] that that sounds that's not that's got a wireless charging glad to me so obviously wireless charging doesn't work through metal so if you have wireless charging on the next iPhone that also confirms that it will not be a fully metal backed phone it could be partially metal or it could be no metal at all it could be glass like the back of the galaxy si but I think as far as Apple's mission of reducing and removing ports on the new iPhone if you're going to get rid of that last port on the bottom wireless charging has to be a thing obviously the specs will be new it's usually the most boring part but also most powerful part of the new iPhone we can probably expect Apple a 11 chip three maybe even four gigs of RAM it'll be the fastest iPhone ever obviously and it turns out fast charging through USB type-c is also very likely which doesn't mean that the next iPhone will be USB type-c it actually just means that the brick that you plug into the wall similar to the MacBook Pro charger will have USB type-c and in the box you get a USB C to lightning cable to plug it in and then the new cameras could do a lot more with depth some depth depth sensing depth sensing abilities this time around which would be helpful for number one portrait mode could improve that a lot significantly and also number two helped out with a our kit and all the augmented reality applications which have been blowing mine so far and then colors there was so much hype and actually surprisingly a lot of people buying the red iPhone not just because it was product red and awesome but the fact that it's a new color iPhone we've never had a red iPhone and actually from one of the shops in my video about this phone someone made a mock-up of about six seven more colors of the iPhone that all looked awesome I think it'll be awesome for a 10th anniversary edition to pass the torch from the iPod to the iPhone and offer a bunch of colors and I'll be really sweet that I don't actually expect that to happen at all that's like the lowest thing on my list but it would pretty sweet so that's pretty much it for right now a lot of the rumors are going to be seeing over the next couple weeks and months until that September announcement and date are just going to be flip-flopping back and forth on a lot of the things we talked about especially if Apple can put the fingerprint reader under the glass or not but let me know what you're most excited for that's specifically what I want to see that new design but feel free to share this video with anyone who wants all the new iPhone information in one place before it comes out of course you can expect a video on the phone when it gets released right here on the channel so subscribe for that but that's pretty much it thanks for watching talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm QB HD here and remember red Raven the entry-level red camera with their most competitive price I made a video about it before I even came out walking through it showing you around it it was pretty awesome but then it disappeared it stopped being sold if you went to red site over the past couple of months you notice it wasn't there it wasn't an option to buy because they weren't selling but now it is back but with an interesting twist so this video is to announce that the Red Raven will be going back on sale as a camera kit through Apple comm exclusively and available to demo in certain Apple stores well that's a pretty big move from red a company that's been making a lot of pretty big moves lately so the Raven kit will be alongside all the other high visibility products that Apple sells on their website you probably already knew they sell first party accessories but Apple comm sells third party accessories as well this is joining those so what exactly is in the Raven kit you get the Red Raven brain a 4.7 inch touchscreen LCD monitor possibly my favorite piece of video gear of all time the Sigma 18 to 35 X 1.8 this Outrigger handle Reds bee lock iOS pander module 2 v-mount ID X batteries and their charger 120 gig mini mag SSD a GTX mini mag reader and this can all fit into a heavy duty case by an Inukshuk it - plus a copy of Final Cut Pro 10 and the full control app for iOS the raven camera kit version so you can kind of look at it as like a one-stop shop for all things needed to get this camera off the ground and running you're ready to get shooting and this isn't for like a beginner video maker obviously this is for someone who's been making video for a while but wants to take that next step up into the red of raw world above 4k i've already talked about what these cameras are capable of in the past in case you've forgotten I'll leave some links below but the bottom line here is red cameras are known for their image quality and the red Raven is no exception with the red you get the brain of course and then you add modules you want based on how you're going to be shooting and of course you can add more modules to this kit at any time and then once you get shooting you get the super realistic image the awesome color science the high resolution the huge dynamic everything you should get from a cinema camera and then of course all the benefits of raw video have I ever have ever talked to you guys through raw video like what a really mean in photography a raw photo versus a JPEG is a pretty big deal a JPEG is already processed has all the color and information baked in compressed ready to go but if you want to edit any of it you can push it a little bit but the quality will start to fall apart pretty quickly with any major editing so raw photos keep all the sensor information unprocessed so the files are bigger but if you want to make any edits to color temperature ISO contrast sharpness you can do so without losing much of any quality that's the super simplified version so with video pretty much any camera from your smartphone to a DSLR to a camcorder the videos they record are like the JPEGs all the color information and everything is baked into a video codec so pro res video is sort of the equivalent of JPEG for photos but red cameras are one of the few that can shoot raw video which means things like color temperature and ISO etcetera are just metadata and there are things that can be changed after the fact without much of any difference in quality that is the number one reason I switched to red cameras a couple years ago when I first tried scarlet for a couple days for the glory that is raw video so what I'm running and gunning I'm shooting as well as I can but I'm not worrying too much about the perfect exposure or perfect color temperature etc you do want to get a writing camera but I'm more paying attention to things like framing and camera movement and other more creative things that you can't change later so I get it pretty close to correct usually but then here's the kicker you bring the raw r3d files into Final Cut Pro and there's a Final Cut Pro plug-in on red site once you grab and install that Final Cut Pro can not only see the red footage but it can see and change all the metadata just like editing raw photos there's there's literally a color temperature slider here in Final Cut Pro thanks to that plug-in that's what are some of the before and after frames for my videos would probably shock you it's not quite magic but it's about as close as it gets in my world and then this raven over here ten shoot both red code raw and pro res simultaneously so if you're on a shoot and you don't actually need that raw footage you don't have to use it so yeah Raven is a great first raw video tool I think again people who are just stepping into the world of beyond 4k it's a four point five case sensor and people who just want that flexibility of having a modular camera system it's not really for beginners like I said but it's kind of interesting that it'll be in Apple stores and a lot of people will be seeing this for the first time and it's kind of in a place where people are first getting their feet wet from rigging your camera to be a video camera to an actual full-fledged cine camera with all the modularity that comes with that it's really interesting so that's Red Raven its back now you know maybe you'll see in an Apple store near you that's pretty much it thank you for watching tough to guys the next one peace [Music] 
and then I need to find a link to the stream stream starting all right we are alive now I need to get the link just in time for some construction nice show you all love that all right let me get a link copy URL yes construction noise paste tweet oh yeah oh yes this was not happening 15 seconds ago but it's all good what is happening guys I see the stream all right hi so we got a pumpkin here this is purely for for entertainment as we talk tech but since it's kind of near Halloween obviously it makes sense to have I have some spooky tech topics that we can talk through and I'll answer your questions as well then I'll flip back and forth wait for people to show up but what I'm gonna do you can see this pumpkin here is I'm gonna just be carving as we're talking top-secret stuff I have an idea for what I want to put on it but I asked you guys for like a scary scary carving idea and we got one yes oh yes yes slow mode is on yeah there's there's a lot I'm gonna try to read as much as I can but let me I'm gonna wait for people to show up while I draw on this pumpkin this is going to be great can you hear that on the mic this the the democratizes kind of seething that'll be fun all right top secret drawing inspiration what is good closer to me or volume up just how's that little better let's chat about pixel to display issues sure that's a that's a spooky topic and that was actually one of mine so it's actually only pixel to excel pixel to excel phone of choice right now but it had I talked about in my review I went over pretty much all of my thoughts on oh by the way this is fully carved and empty which is awesome but I talked about all the display problems that it was potentially having that it could that could affect you seems like there's two seems like there's two main campus people fall into with the display issues with the pixel camp number one is you know you look at it it looks okay it doesn't look like the best screen in the world but it's it's decent and it doesn't really affect them you tell them about the blue shift and they tilt it to the side and they go I kind of see that I wouldn't notice that if you didn't tell me screen burnin I can't see it unless you literally go full screen gray wallpaper turn the brightness down and look for it so a lot of people are like that and they don't really care the other half of people or the other camp a lot of people have been falling into lately there's gonna take a while this is serious the other camp a lot of people fall into is literally I saw some people saying Google should recall the phone like it's on I saw the word unusable throwing out thrown around a lot the pics with to display being unusable simply unacceptable that they would ship this it's an $850 phone which is true I get it even 900 bucks depending on where you get it or where you're located this would be faster this serious business oh wow yeah but those are the two camps people fall into which is number one I don't really notice no big deal or number two recall the phone stop selling it start over and I kind of fall somewhere in between which is what I said in a video but the thing is it depends on you about obviously as I tried to talk to both groups of people in one video which is always fun to try to do am i revealing my carving right now not really okay I don't think it's no big deal because the display does look worse than other phones in its price range but I do think people saying they should stop selling the phone are a little exaggerating apples phones had the whole bendgate thing bending in people's pockets they didn't recall it there were a antenna problems with phones they didn't recall it the last film that they really eventually had to recall was the Galaxy Note 7 that literally started exploding in people's pockets so to say that they should stop selling a phone with a slightly Knight as a good display this is definitely gonna be harder than I thought but yeah that I don't think you have to stop selling a phone because the display is not as good you just have to know who you are and if the display being not as good affects you then it's not the phone for you my phone a lot of people were asking about my um display burnin problems if I was having any I had such a small amount that I would not be able to discern it between that and just temporary image retention I left it there for a while it kind of faded away it seems like it's not permanent but that's a quality control thing because some panels will have it and some won't what are you doing I am carving very sloppily the scariest pumpkin on the face of planet Earth I'm not even sure if I fully outlined this what else is good Android we're back in 2018 or is it dead I kind of think Android wear is dead right now I had a conversation the other night at with a youtuber actually at at the Samsung event in the city about Android wear and if it's dead or not or if smartwatches in general are dead and the conversation kind of went the same way that it did about tablets our tablets dead if it's not an iPad kind of yeah our SmartWatch is dead if it's not an Apple watch then kind of yeah I miss Android wear I suggested that Google could make some kind of pixel watch to sort of rejuvenate that project it's kind of like what the Moto 360 was or I could punch it in and take it out it's kind of like what the Moto 360 was when it existed but then we were also wondering like how many of those Moto 360s still exist on earth right now in people's daily use and the consensus was not that many love the videos thank you shout out from India doing a good job shout out to India Android wear I said that already let's get spooky yeah this is a little darker than the usual set all right please work I really hope that works oh boy I think it's work I think it's working hey it did work all right that's a good start oh don't break up I broke off okay it didn't quite work but it's better than I thought it would for an upgrade from a galaxy note 5 do you recommend the note 8s 8 plus Google pixel to excel or should I leave Andrea and go back to the iPhone 10 wow that's a very open-minded person asking that question if you're genuinely considering all those things you probably can't really go wrong with any of those a lot of people when they ask like what phone should I buy they're between like two phones that's right they'll get the idea but if you're considering like any of those one two three four phones I think any of those would be good for you do I have a laser and I have no lasers happening in this any plans to release videos in HD are so I think technically at this point my my camera is already shooting in HDR and I can just flip a switch in the gamma settings in Final Cut Pro and it will export a file that's the force HDR but I just keep up like the the dynamic range is not that different in my videos between HDR and not HDR I don't have that many crazy scenes maybe in like a car video that could be interesting but for now you kind of get the idea of what's going on without HDR in the videos but I might do it yeah a non tech question have you ever considered getting a motorcycle that's kind of spooky ah no I've never considered getting a motorcycle because I need a trunk I carry video gear two things I bring video gear around in my car often so no I've never thought about getting a motorcycle because I can't carry it on a backpack I need a trunk this might be the most dangerous livestream you've ever watched hmm your phone needs to survive a super heavy day say 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. and around at the pubs and clubs you're not carrying a backpack how do you charge 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. the next day huh first of all if I know that day is gonna be such a long day what I'm gonna do is charge wow I'm gonna charge at any possible given time during the day so I'm guessing you're not out from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. you're probably out from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. so during the day you top up on maybe a wireless charger or maybe a charge right your desk you top up maybe when you're driving that day in the car on the way to work you plug up and go from 95 to 100 again basically take advantage of fast charging so that when you finally do leave for the day you're back out at 4 a.m. with enough battery I'm not sure if that fully answers a question I might have cheated with that but mmm yeah this is good this is going well it's going well okay yeah oh yeah okay Sharpie is gonna be interesting later what devices are u livestreaming from this is a Canon c100 going into a computer so straight HDMI capture cards for the win yeah it's just putting the pumpkin on the trash bag biggest difference between Google home and Google home mini ah to be honest they are extremely similar which is a good thing because Google home mini is like half the price it's less than at the price of Google home the biggest difference is the speakers and the audio quality and the sound and essentially whether or not you use it to play music Google home mini I don't think I would use as a home speaker for any anyone but Google home could pull it off that's the main difference Google home is bigger has more speakers shout out to your channel so hey man hey 1 + 5 t a lot of people are asking about that's something we've seen a lot of rumors for there's a lot of rumors for phones that are still coming out in the next couple of weeks and I have a feeling we're gonna be very busy on the channel sharing those phones when they come out with you sharing those in video form so if you somehow stumbled across this and aren't subscribed yet you should do that so that you can see those when they come out oh that's actually not that bad and then I gotta go has this carving been given away yet do you guys know what I'm making if so feel free to guess alright thoughts on the usability or lack thereof of the bump on the display of the iPhone 10 oh I thought you're gonna talk about the camera bump on the back you're talking about the notch the iPhone tens famous notch I think people will get used to it pretty quickly and here's why I played with the essential phone for a number of weeks which also has a notch it's a little smaller but it's the same concept had a notch in the display took up some of the screen real estate software worked around it ended up not being so bad I got used to that really easily Apple has a lot more developers kind of on this side but they're gonna have to go through this little little awkward growing period where developers and their apps their apps don't play well with a knotch and then they get updated and then they look good I hope that that period does not last for a very long time I hope the apps get updated real quick I hope Instagram and snapchat and all those apps look great with the knotch but I can't guarantee that so your question was my thoughts on it yeah it's gonna be weird at first but I think users will get used to it pretty quickly especially if all of apple's apps take advantage of it alright this if I show you guys what I take out of this right now it's gonna give it away ready someone guessed it already Harvey Cox congratulations on guessing it but I'm just gonna let people continue guessing if people didn't see Harvey's yes oh that's true essential phone is $4.99 now you said don't spend your money when it was $6.99 is it worth it now worth it it's an easier it's an easier to stomach recommendation I was not recommending the essential phone because it was lacking a lot of features that a lot of other flagships had at that same price now that it's a lower price it's still lacking those features so if you still want those features you're not gonna buy it but if you were holding back on it because it was too expensive now you might be inclined to actually give it a shot so again two different groups but I think a lot more people will be tempted to give it a shot at $4.99 not sure why I took them so long to drop the price by $200 but clearly they had that flexibility should Apple bring back the headphone jack no they should not yeah yeah it sucks to say it but and if you're gonna get rid of it and you're gonna try to commit to making Wireless better you should commit and don't bring it back and that's the thing I've talked about a lot people like to talk about all the headphone jack I don't have a headphone jack on this phone it's a deal breaker I will never buy it that's cool and I get it right now because Wireless is not that good but I have a video upcoming that I think will help explain this a bit Wireless has to get good now Wireless will have to get good now you heard that click that's some plastic moving carving Austin Evans face this would be a lot of cuts for Austin's face man I was correct you guys know if you think I'm that much of a artist that I could carve some space into a pumpkin thank you but I'm not oh man this is this is making me appreciate those like actual pumpkin carving kits a little bit more just a little just a little bit more did you get infected did you get affected by the YouTube demonization I have not had a sing I'm probably jinxing right now but I have never had one of my videos demonetized ever so no I haven't been affected that doesn't mean it's not happening it's happening to plenty of people that are really not happy about it oh but as of right now even the video that I made which was called had D monetization in the title I haven't had any problems I'm mostly a pretty family-friendly channel if you haven't noticed oh man alright alright I'm impressing myself with this based on what you know iPhone 10 pixel to excel for MVP of the year Wow it's funny you pick those two phones um only a handful of people know why that's funny but uh between those two phones yeah if you want peer Android you're gonna want to go with the pixel to excel if you want pure iOS you're gonna want to go with the iPhone ten simple as that simple as that yeah yeah how people I'm a carving my logo no my logo is not this many cuts either excited for the D brand grip any ideas when it will be released yes I have a few ideas but I'm not really gonna tell you them but uh yeah it's pretty interesting I'm not a big case person but a bumper is a different prospect and it has some pretty intense durability claims that you'll see later do you have any mobile app ideas that you would like to see developed oh you guys are well not yet except for maybe an mkbhd yet but not really under the display touch ID is not going to be as useful as it seems why complicate the most frogs the part of the phone even making it slower thoughts I don't know about slower and to address your complication concerns smart phones are already insanely complicated adding this is not this is so dangerous ah adding the touch ID underneath the display is not a complication concern it's literally just is it possible yet or not I think Apple would love to do it I think Samsung would love to do it but I don't think it'll have any negative effects on the phone if you put it in a phone thoughts on Android 8.1 enables pixel there's a pixel visual court yes okay so for those of you don't know what that means pixel visual core is if there's an API I don't want to describe it incorrectly but essentially what it does is it enables third party apps to take advantage of the image processing chip in the pixel - if you didn't know the image processing chip in the pixel - is freaking amazing it's what allow allows it to take incredible pictures enables HDR on all the time this is a little bit of it okay but yeah Android 8.1 flips that switch other apps can use it now so you can if you like to take photos in third-party apps like in pro if you don't have a pro mode and you want to use pro mode you can get an app from the Play Store and take just as great photos up on this yeah a little just a little bit cool all right please extreme please explain with a dumptruck plus kids swingy shirt means the dumptruck plus kids swinging shirt is no secret it means dump swing not dumpster baby I don't know if you thought it was that dump swing is a Ultimate Frisbee term I think I'll leave it at that I'm actually carving hey guys in this pumpkin man sup hello sub B sauce s8 or no dates onset well no dates better so there's that it's also more expensive but she didn't ask oh yeah okay there's gonna be a lot of this is gonna look way better at night basically when you can't see the Sharpie marks that I'm sloppily carving around hmmm so shut off the person who just put like 50 Canadian flag logos in there shout-out to people whose flags are also emojis is there any suspense being built for revealing this carving I think this is kind of low-key a great idea thoughts on the Google clips and the light camera oh the Google clips is funny man I saw you on must tweet at the verge the other day when they posted about Google clips which was I think you said like this isn't even trying to be innocent which is pretty funny because Google clips if you don't know it's just this little square camera that you just attach to something near you pointed at you and it will intelligently stay on forever and take pictures when it thinks you want them so yeah the the tweet was kind of funny like this doesn't even seem like you're trying to be like obviously Google home you could you could put Google home in people's homes and they'll think well Google is not always listening to me even if it accidentally happens but this one not even trying I think it's kind of an interesting idea I don't think I would ever use it cuz I consider myself a somewhat decent with the camera but that's just me I don't know I might like give it to someone to try and see what they think did I break this nope love your channel super high quality videos thank you however somewhat disappointed in the critical comments being removed from the U 11 and picks with two videos yes I saw that and I have never removed any comments from that video one thing that's interesting is people comments get like automatically sorted by YouTube so I saw like people saying Oh marques removed a bunch of comments from the you 11 video I haven't moved a single comment from that video but they just get reordered and there's thousands of comments and once they leave the front page just based on engagement they're really hard to find but I'm sure if anyone who thinks their comment has been removed goes to the email they got about their comment with all the replies and clicks the link they will find their comment on the video again so if you're disappointed with me don't be that's just a youtube algorithmic thing that I don't control Adobe CC to come to Chrome OS in the near future that would be nice a lot of people can't really use Chromebooks because they don't support a certain app they use all the time Adobe being one of those app Suites so the the pixel book just came out or the pixel book reviews just came out and a lot of people were basically comparing it to you know should you buy this over an iPad should you buy this over a Windows laptop but the main concern they all had was well it runs Chrome OS so the apps I use are missing so yeah seeing Adobe stuff on Chrome OS would be pretty awesome okay come on I mean stab myself in the eye I'm just upgraded in my galaxy s7 to the pixels to excel nice I notice the camera is a lot more grainy in general than the s7 this isn't normal is it grainy grainy no there's plenty of noise reduction going on with galaxy s7 but there's also plenty of sharpening so if it looks grainy er than normal may be compared to other people's pixel photos the pixel to excel is the best camera on a phone so if you having problems with it return it RMA I get another one because that doesn't sound right it's definitely better than the s7 s camera let me clean this up I just finished the carving by the way but I'm gonna clean it up a little bit cuz it's so messy how do you how do you get your b-roll with the phone standing up is someone holding the phone up or what is the apparatus oh it's here's the secret yeah you want to grab one the secret to standing up a phone like this is having something heavy enough to stay behind it that's smaller than it this is a red volt battery you can do this with a salt shaker you can do this with a whatever else is about this size but just make sure it's heavy enough so we'll put it down and put your phone down it doesn't knock that thing over and hopefully you can see that but BAM that's all it takes so anytime you see those shots with the phone standing up it's because there's something heavier and smaller behind it I literally bring those batteries around I don't use them my camera's not compatible with them anymore but I still use them for that exact purpose knife that up yeah I'm knifing it up do you think Samsung will over release a competitor to the Amazon and echo and Google home thing Samsung man they have eyes didn't you see like rumors of like a Bixby home thing not that long ago I feel like they might do it I don't know they're the best idea ever but I feel like we might see Bixby home and I might have to go get one and review it cuz that's just hilarious to me think about Bixby is a lot of people don't really appreciate Bixby can be really good but it somehow like it can do a lot of things that other assistants can't do but it can do a lot of things other assistants can't do but at the same time it gets a lot of the easy stuff wrong somehow like you ask it to like turn on the flashlight strobe I need help in SOS in Morse code and then like send an email to Grandma with an attachment and it'll do all that stuff and then you say by the way who's the president and it would be like searching web for bed resistant it just doesn't know the simple stuff it's weird so give away I mean yeah probably it's probably giveaway coming uh-huh you have a one plus three T 128 gigs should you get a note eight one plus three T is a pretty good phone still right now should you get a note eight if you want one note 8 is better so I'm not gonna tell you not to get a note 8 but at the same time you might want to keep waiting like another couple weeks when some sweet new phones coming out like from oneplus your thoughts on essential camera performance with google cam report yeah Google's camera app is really good and using the Google camera app on other Android phones often results in better photos than the camera app that comes on it so I'm glad they put that in the Play Store all right who's ready to see this carving I feel like you'll be able to see it no no it's good it's good we're good favorite color of iPhone X I think actually I like the silver more because the Space Gray is gonna be a fingerprint magnet my current Space Gray iPhone it looks pretty good right now but it's a serious thing for magnet I'm probably gonna go silver on my iPhone 10 we'll see alright who's ready who's ready to see the carving this is all live by the way you saw me knifing this thing up this is like a box cutter it's definitely not made to cut pumpkins this thick I'm pulling it down oh there you go you ready they're gonna review the pixel buds yeah I need to get my hands on them all right ready here it is the spookiest yeah we done did it I know I kind of messed up on the one because I tried to make it like it's hard it's hard to do these things with a box cutter but I think if you if you if this was nighttime and you didn't see all the Sharpie marks that I sloppily cut around cuz the box cutter has no articulation whatsoever that would be pretty good cuz the light in it by the way this light that's the lowest brightness it gets can I sign this at you higher highest is it glowing right now yeah yeah I think it's a pretty is that tube right now it's probably not that bad yeah we did it guys everyone don't know so don't switch to 144p I didn't mean it like that I'm just saying this is yeah are you biasing your videos you've been accused i've accused myself in a previous Q&amp;A so one is asking about bias and I think it's even in the title of the Q&amp;A where I talked about it yes I'm biased I'm a human the only unbiased you talk about reviews the only unbiased reviews there are are the spec sheet every opinion you give is subject to the person that has that opinion and if I say this display is nice even if that's objectively true because it's a high resolution and a high contrast ratio and a high brightness and if I say this display is nice even that is subject to me liking that about a display so that applies on every level of every spec if you just give the raw spec sheet fine I'll say you're an unbiased reviewer but you aren't not much of a reviewer then are you you got to give opinions and that's what I do oh you're telling me to say hey let's get spooky should I do that what if I do it on my phone will it work on my phone I'm gonna say that yeah mute that I'm gonna say it to my phone let's get spooky ready to get spooky all right ready squeeze let's get spooky okay I'm releasing the spirits now have fun beware chromecast's and smart lights won't be spared from this scare to stop simply say ok Google stop being spooky [Music] [Applause] [Music] switch that by a champion that's hilarious [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Applause] how Isis keep your ID oh hey Google ok Google stop being spooky I don't understand I said stop being spooky I don't understand I'm just gonna wait I can't all right I'm um no nope nope that is hilarious though thank you for telling me that that Easter Egg exists uh which I'll think what would you give my rating what do you what would you rate my carving let me show it to you with the lights off cuz it's sloppiest most hilarious carving you may have ever seen in your life what the lights lock you can see I missed some lines and the one is clearly a weird digit but give me a number out of 10 give me a number out of 10 I feel like I'm gonna give myself just because I was using this for most of it and completely failed with this I'm gonna get myself well you guys are very generous I would give this a 7 out of 10 for design but a 10 for spookiness cuz that is terrifying zero out of ten somebody said I 108 out of a hundred thank you all right let's get the light back in there oh did I have another I had a another spooky text subject but oh yeah the last part was obviously you guys have seen Samsung ads in the past I've been in several Samsung ads there's another one that they just released I tweeted about it they were trolling real hard I guess cuz obviously there's all these pixel to excel display problems which are very spooky that I just talked about well super bright um but they they put out an ad about Samsung screens I'm in the thumbnail I'm in the video a bunch of your favorite youtubers who make tech videos in the video and what i theorize samsung is doing i don't have confirmation of this but what i'm pretty sure they're doing is they're they're paying for that ad to show up for people who are subscribers of those youtubers so if you're subscribed to me and you don't have youtube reading you see ads you're probably gonna see this video today this this ad will show up for you somewhere on youtube if you're subscribed to and this already been on his homepage on like five people i knowes home pages already if you're subscribed to like other people in that video you're probably gonna see that even more likely yeah fun fact of the day spooky samsung with they're sneaky ads it looks better in 144p how alexander how dare you pay to say that why would you Wow how would you say that yo saying that killed my cast of your stream when I said stop being spooky really Oh cuz I said to be spooky it made yours spooky too yeah that's that's crazy good job Google what else can we talk about we got this has been only 35 minutes that it took me to carve this I'm gonna put it like right here oh man what a good stream in which Q&amp;A did you talk about being biased I think it's either the 19th or 20th one where it's in the title so if you go to the Q&amp;A playlist there's one that says biased reviews in the title it's that one that's where I really break down why being biased is people like to use it as like an insult oh man you're so biased thanks that's a compliment if I wasn't biased I'd be the most boring reviewer of all time at least you can calibrate yourself to my bias if I say I like certain things and then the next time around you realize you don't like that thing and I like it again at least I'm consistent with my bias and you can understand why that would be useful as a reviewer then you subscribe to a bunch of different reviewers who all have different biases and then you can calibrate yourself to each one that way one they all make a video about the same thing you can watch all these different reviews that give you the same opinion about that device think about that version 12 is how long ago Wow version 12 in January so the first ask him could be HD the years when I went over that oh that's one where I had to spray t-shirt your sweatshirt that's funny I remember that you laughed because it's spooky but you have Wi-Fi at home that makes you watch in 144p every time look I'm sorry I didn't want that I wouldn't wish that upon anyone but I understand this button exists for a reason I just think it's it's terrifying and I'm so sorry that you have to go through that when you're gonna start streaming on Twitch I have zero reason to switch to twitch are there features that I don't know about that twitch has cuz right now as far as live-streaming goes just this Q&amp;A format could be fine on both but twitch doesn't have the audience they're all you guys are already on YouTube he probably got a notification here twitch doesn't have I'm sure there are moderation features in twitch chat but the fact that I have we have super chat here and we have all you guys logged in already you don't have to make a new account that's pretty important there's all the custom title and thumbnail on the description everything you guys are used to from the typical YouTube experience pretty much no reason for me to switch to twitch even if I had gaming stuff there is YouTube gaming I think I would stick to youtube so yeah um twitch is cool but any advantages of it I'm clearly not privy to Spyder alert well it's spider spider I hate spiders by the way hopefully there's no spiders anywhere how do you think do you know when Apple will release an iPhone 10 sim pre version I don't really know a sim free version I'm talking about like the embedded sim I'm not really sure what that question means hey you sound like my relatives can you fix my mom's computer for me I probably can but I would really rather not cuz you know what happens when you you know happens when your family tech support and you fix someone's something if you fix someone's printer then every time that printer or computer breaks from here on out you will get blamed for it and you'll get asked to fix it again even if it's totally unrelated I'm totally in the way of the mic okay still it was my audio fine I feel like I put the pumpkin in between me and the mic wait as a reviewer how stress to you about getting an iPhone 10 on launch day I think we're all pretty stressed that's tonight iPhone 10 pre-orders are tonight at I'm glad this is kept going in the background it's kind of appropriate tonight at midnight Pacific time which is 3:00 a.m. East Coast time which is also apparently when stranger things to there stranger things season two dating his first episode or whatever oh the whole season is that once oh that's why people are psyched I thought it was one episode all right that's fair that's exciting but people will be awake then for that reason that is pretty spooky iPhone 10 supply at launch is pretty spooky I'm gonna definitely melt this I'm gonna turn it off it's it's kind of one I mean the LED itself isn't that warm but like the glass is getting a little warm I'm gonna turn it off you guys can still get the point of the carving right yeah what are they the last thing I saw an article was a half of iPhone 8 supply we already know how hard I phone eight was to get it launched and people didn't even really want I phone ain't that bad people want i phone 10 billboards are up for iPhone 10 hype is real for iPhone 10 supply not that good a couple million of them allegedly you'll be able to camp out at a store and get one but how many is each store gonna have maybe it doesn't that's rough that is spooky why are the bezels so big on the small pixel too it has the same DNA as last year it's made by what HTC but really it looks like you get those big speakers in the top on the bottom and they didn't spend a whole lot of extra on that cheaper phone to get these thin bezels in the big display great videos thank you when you name your videos after pixel to and then talk about the two XL it makes it hard people who find stuff on a smaller one yeah that's definitely true I tried to talk about any differences the thing about that is those two phones are almost identical in every way except the size of the battery and size the display itself so you get the slightly different shape that I talked about a little bit box here on the smaller pixel too but I tried to I was very careful with my language where every single thing I said about pixel to excel was exactly the same about pixel to unless I said otherwise same incredible camera same speaker quality as far as I know they're not the same drivers but they're both really good so battery life and the displays were the things that are really mainly different and hopefully that's helpful in its own way alright a couple more questions and then I'm gonna cut the livestream and put this out in the night and spook some people with it what is that like it looked like condensation but it's just I'm good what are your thoughts on the pixel to screen burnin issue should i cancel my pre-order I don't think you need to cancel your pre-order over a phone you've never used if you are one of those pixel peepers who will notice screen in screen burnin despite its very very slight effect on anything you do on the phone then ya cancel it and get a good phone like the no date has a great screen it's 200 extra dollars but if you're into that they can get a great screen but I I wouldn't cancel your pre-order over a small quality control issue that may or may not even affect you you can get the phone and then see for yourself and I think you can return it for within like a month or something like that so yeah don't cancel your pre-order or you might never get one because this supply is so small what other we got a couple more couple more tech questions we'll go to more minutes can you play this live on your iPhone can I write yeah I wouldn't want you though cuz it would start echoing oh my god Hasselblad went live on us again I'm gonna live yes like tango live watch my own livestream I want to talk about the Nokia health app I have yeah okay so I have people who probably noticed I'm I'm just gonna have that Nokia nakiye some people say no Kia health app basically I have a scale a Wi-Fi connected scale that had its own app which is witting 's weddings had its own app and i use it you know it tracks you the different things that it knows about you like the body fat percentage and weight and all that stuff so I had these little graphs and then Nokia bought them I guess is what happened so there they replaced that weddings app in the Play Store with the Nokia app so one day I just fired on my phone and instead of the winnings app on my home screen there's a Nokia app and I was a little confused but I clicked into it and it's the same functionality it's just a little better-looking basically so that's why that's there thank you I'm glad you enjoy the videos is essential phone the best phone at that price point no it's not it's it's alright I guess now that it's cheaper it's better among its competition at that price but I don't think it's yet the best phone at that price point notice one plus five gets forgotten a lot but it's that price right now there's released a couple months ago it's really good pixel to camera or a small dedicated camera well right now if I only want to carry one thing in my pocket pixel to camera is so good so I'd recommend pixel to camera but if you want to get another small dedicated camera you'd have to spend a lot to get a camera better than the pixel - you gotta have some extra money and another pocket and it's more batteries and another charger you know I'm saying yeah - more - more tech questions or - more good questions so I'm just asking my chairs o LG g3 and AB that LG v 30 please I have my video on the best features of the LG v 30 I guess he'd if I asked you guys you'd probably say yes but I was kind of torn about making another video about it when all the things I'd be saying would be pretty similar to what's in the top five only things I didn't cover that would be in a review would be battery life and just long-term impressions of the software and how its held up for my use so I'm kind of tossed up about making a video about it it might have to be later that's the other thing about the V 30 is the timing was so bad they had that pre-release version that they gave to all of us but now we have iPhone 10 is about to come out that's about to be that new oneplus phone is about to be this new razor announcement because about to be a whole bunch of other stuff so by the time we get back to be 30 hopefully it's still in on time before the holiday season but clearly they had some interesting timing there all right uno mas here's my middle name Kumar no okay bye I was getting the same free version you can buy without a carrier oh I don't know I don't know if it's gonna be different from the current iPhone 10 a normal iPhone 10 anyway um I'm pumped about this 77 inch TV playing that but yeah I've talked about a lot of spooky stuff in this stream I think the major takeaway is spooky time a year that's pretty much all I got we're gonna go shut this down and go back and hang out over on Twitter and keep working on future videos there's a lot of interesting stuff coming up so also maybe some giveaways maybe a maybe a really maybe a really really good giveaway maybe pop if you're into that if you're if you'd be down yeah anyway alright that's pretty much it thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace 
we're proud to report that pixel received a rating of 89 that's the highest reading ever for a smartphone HTC u11 camera the highest and the only one with the highest score the exo mark has issued pixel to an unprecedented score of 98 that's the highest score of any smartphone camera stop guys I'm Kim PhD here recently the Google pixel 2 came out with the highest ever rating of a smartphone camera on DxO mark again Google tweeted it Google's CEO tweeted it a whole bunch of people put it in their headlines it's shone like a badge of honor every time it happens but why I mean we've talked about smartphone cameras in the past but suddenly in the past 2 or 3 years DxO mark ratings have become the holy grail of measuring smartphone camera quality so this is DxO mark explained so DxO labs measures and rates a bunch of different cameras sensors and lenses some dslr's some cine cameras Canon glass Nikon glass all that stuff and they have an entire separate section dedicated to smartphone cameras if you click on this mobile section of the site you'll see this hierarchy of smartphone cameras each of them with a big number rating this is somewhat accurate but also a bit misleading using one single number to describe and to encompass all the complexities that go into a smartphone camera is a bit too broad it's just a little bit crazy in my opinion so DxO breaks it down into photo and video and then bricks each of those down into a bunch of subcategories so if you scroll down far enough in a DxO smartphone camera view underneath the rating you'll see that breakdown of the subset scores for photos and for videos pixel to for example got a 99 for photos and a 96 for video but you notice these numbers clearly aren't an average of the sub scores so they have this weighting system essentially their own algorithm for combining all of the sub scores into this overall score so it's that score that gets published and plastered all over the internet all over your Twitter feeds but most of these are chuckles in fact probably all of them ignored the sub scores and how well these cameras did in each category you'd have to actually go to DxO marks site and actually scroll all the way down and read through the review for that and if you did you would find that DxO does some pretty legit really solid testing they try to be scientific and objective wherever they possibly can they have a bunch of these indoor sets these controlled environments for testing things like noise performance sharpness color reproduction and detail in the exact same situation for every phone so it's repeatable every time for testing boko with portrait mode they have a foreground subject and a background that's a certain distance away they measure autofocus speed and shutter speed lag with moving subjects the whole deal and then they also have a bunch of slightly less exact but still pretty telling outdoor tests for things like high dynamic range and seeing color casts etc according to their site they have quote more than 50 challenging and realistic indoor and outdoor scenes then they turn these photo samples into ratings for each category using a panel of experts they say and essentially what they do is they take the new image from the smartphone camera and match it with the closest one on a scale with what's called an image quality ruler they have an existing scale with a bunch of different levels of noise for example and they match the new sample with where it falls on that scale so that's how they turn a qualitative measurement into a quantitative value but these websites reporting on the new phones when they come out you know they don't really want all that that's a little too much for a headline so DxO is smart and to make it more easy to headline they summarized everything into one big overall score which like I mentioned is not the average of the sub score so we can assume they're weighted roughly in that order with exposure and contrast being the most important auto focus and color being almost as important and this decision of the order that they weight things is subjective the order that they decide to rank these and the amount of weight that they put into each one is entirely up to them and that's why you shouldn't put all your purchase decision into just the overall score you should look past the overall rating compiling everything into one overall score can be misleading because different characteristics matter to different people some people take a lot of low-light photos or take a lot of photos of people a lot of selfies or a lot of landscape shots here's a perfect example the Galaxy Note 8 got an overall score of 94 the pixel 2 got an overall score of 98 you take a lot of portrait photos which one are you gonna pick you're gonna pick the Galaxy Note 8 you're gonna throw out the overall score and pick the one that actually has a dedicated second camera for portrait photos if you look at the photo sub scores it got a way higher score for zoom and bokeh but these are pretty new things and so they're not really weighted as heavily so they don't really have nearly as much of an effect on that overall score and as a result the phone that you would pick because it's better for what you like got a lower overall score on the DxO mark scale you see what I'm getting at honestly most of these smartphone cameras are great when you talk about things like contrast and color and dynamic range to varying degrees obviously but the top ones are all pretty good the bigger difference comes with the different modes with things like portrait mode and long exposure and panorama stitching and all that those are what make a bigger difference to the user experience especially when you see a phone like pixel to doing portrait mode mostly within the software versus with a second camera now here's another reason you may want to look past the overall score DxO Labs is a consulting company as well as a testing company for a fee they will work with smartphone manufacturers before their phone comes out to create a better camera so they'll provide their their testing software their hardware and their testing methodology so that you can calibrate your sensor and your image processing pipeline to produce better photos but also kinda to just do better on their tests it's pretty easy to look at this and think they were just working with you to get a higher score now I'm not saying that smartphone manufacturers are specifically tuning their cameras to do better on deck so mark instead of actually doing what's better for the consumer but it's a blurry line there it's kind of similar to what we see with benchmark I mean most of the things that do better on DxO mark are also better for the camera but again it's combining it it's tuning it to their exact specs and with those better with their methodology basically if you don't work with them on tuning your camera sweet you'll get a lower score and if you don't have that DxO mark money you're kind of left out on the cold they might not even test your phone so you can take all that with a grain of salt obviously I don't think DxO mark is changing their test results based on who paid obviously the reputation is based off of objectivity and scientific accuracy in a way so they wouldn't want to risk that but the simple fact that they partner up with certain manufacturers and work on certain devices while they don't with others is kind of an awkward relationship imagine if Geekbench imagine if the benchmarking suite Geekbench partnered with certain manufacturers on improving overall device performance and then also made a big deal about which one scored better in Geekbench you see how weird that might be anyway moving on to another quick point with the pixel to getting a 98 you're probably wondering what's the best score they've ever given to any camera that would be a 108 and that was the sensor score for the red helium 8 k with the super 35 sensor though when you've been watching footage from for this whole video now if you're thinking wait a minute if combining all the sub score values makes a value higher than the average and they gave a value of a hundred and eight for a sensor in a different test how what how you get a score over a hundred sitting on top of it all with its current sensor the helium 8 KS 35 with a DX ohm mark score of 108 yes that's supposed to be out of a hundred nope that's no no it's not the XO mark scores are not out of a hundred that the pixel two did not get a 98 out of 100 it's not a ninety-eight percent I see way too many tech news outlets reporting DxO ratings as if they're like close to a perfect score because they think they're out of a hundred they're not the fact that they're close to 100 is great but that's purely a coincidence and cameras are gonna keep getting better on this linear scale and they're going to reach and pass a hundred there's gonna be a first smartphone to hit a hundred they're gonna make a huge deal about that you're gonna see it in every headline and then there's gonna be the first smartphone to pass 100 they're gonna make a big deal about that too and that's gonna make a lot of headlines again but there is no maximum or perfect score the fact that there are near 100 right now like I said is a pure coincidence and it's a result of their weighting system that it pushes those numbers up to near 100 and that's why in the past year or two they kind of get reported more often because they look like a near perfect score but again it's just a coincidence they will keep going above 100 that's just the way it is for now so the whole thing about every new smartphone camera being the new highest ever rating on DXL mark while it's kind of annoying right now that's supposed to happen it's just getting reported more it's kind of like when Apple says up their keynotes this is the fastest iPhone we've ever made well I hope it's the fastest iPhone you've ever made you shouldn't be making slower phones from last year but you don't see anyone like Geekbench rating these chips on a scale and then giving a new crown to the highest ever rating every time it just doesn't work that way my problem isn't with DxO mark it's really more with the press they just kind of have a habit of parroting the new highest overall score and not really looking too far into it or putting any effort into reporting that too it's nice when they do but for the most part they're just trying to get their clicks so if you're on the other side of this and you're actually reading these reviews and these ratings you just got to look a little bit more into it actually read the review if you're thinking about making a purchase so keep doing your thing DxO mark now if you want to bundle everything into one overall score that's representative of the phone that's cool just try to surface a little bit more information more easily and if you're in tech press and you write a new article every time there's a new highest DxO mark score but you don't write a new article every time there's a new highest Geekbench score think about what you're doing stop it get some help so in summary DxO mark does real testing yes but an overall number to describe everything that goes into a camera is a little too broad yes and then DxO also does consulting to improve cameras based on their own algorithms and testing so maybe take those numbers with a grain of salt and the score is just happened to be around 100 right now but that's purely a coincidence they are not out of 100 so what we've learned here is ratings are a nice clean even number to point to one being better than the other but if you actually want to make a purchase decision you got to look a little bit deeper than the DxO mark rating plus they're all pretty incredible anyway you should watch the blind test I'll link it below either way that's been it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] so that tiny yeah I just only in the high frequencies up that's where it really that goes it's just going back and forth between these well hey what is up guys I'm cabby HD here and welcome back oh what number is this welcome to ask mkbhd version 16 this is a once a month thing you've done to May so almost halfway through the year and we've kept up with doing this once a month so I asked you guys questions on Twitter what you guys wanted to know and this is what you ask wallpaper on a K monitor you use in the video about the 8k monitor where can I find it so it's actually believe it or not really hard to find an actual genuine 8k wallpaper so the one that you saw in the video was a rendered out vector file for my buddy Justin malar who's made tons of art that showed up in my videos before it's called ghosts too it showed up in previous videos that is an actual 8k 7680 by 4320 version of that art because we're even when you look on Google for things that are that exact file size they're sometimes just like up scaled versions of smaller files really weird sketchy stuff from wallpaper sites so that's what I would came from how much difference in image quality between the 1 plus 5 and the galaxy f8 should be expected now that 1 plus is collaborating with DxO mark alright so if you haven't already heard the hype is now real for the next version of the 1 plus flagship killer the 1 plus 5 I don't know why they skipped 4 but that's the name of the next song and they came out and said that they're working with the XO mark to collaborate to make a better version of a camera for that phone as you know DxO mark is pretty well known for just ranking objectively the smartphone cameras that come out year after year they gave him a number the highest one we've seen recently was a 90 from the HTC u 11 we've seen 89 and 88 but here's my take on that you saw recently I've done a video just on a blind test of the 5 best smartphone cameras and the difference between those five cameras in actual image quality was completely random and subjective depending on what photo you're taking obviously some people could take a consistent clear favorite throughout the entire image set but the difference in number of points on the DxO mark scale is not that high between the basic what I'm saying is I think the 1 plus 5 will have a pretty great camera but the Prince back and the essay it's not like you can measure it it's just also going to be pretty good what changes should the Clippers do to be relevant in the NBA they should sign a good small forward why are AI assistants being pushed so hard I still find looking up information with my fingers faster and easier well jason curry that is actually the reason why a AI assistants are being worked on so hard because they're still not quite better than just typing what you want to see but a small pro back actually interviewed sundar Pichai the CEO of Google a couple days ago in the last video and something he mentioned that same day was there working on AI assistants and voice assistants to get better because that's just the way people communicate we naturally talk to each other and listen to each other and respond and that's how an actual assistant would help a person so getting our virtual assistants to be as close to that as possible is the end goal they're still not there yet as you mentioned it's still easier to usually type what you want to see but that's why they're getting worked on so hard is because the ideal assistant is kind of just like a person yo marques eight megapixel full-frame sensor or 42 megapixel full-frame sensor light versus detail so this is the video person inside of me speaking I would like to see the 42 megapixel full-frame sensor because that means I'll get high resolution video out of it eight megapixels I think caps me at 720p so I mean I like low-light shooting capabilities a lot but most of the shooting I do is not in low-light so I'm gonna go with that 42 megapixel something why did you stop putting Cheerios in your videos I don't I don't really know what Cheerios are talking about but they're pretty subtle usually did you cable manage your place after Linus tech came over so the thing about cable management is when you manage your cables when you use cable ties and like lock them into place that kind of implies that your setup in that area is going to be permanent in some way if you organize all the cables and lock them into place and tie them around each other around the table legs and everything like that then if you ever want to change something out of that setup that uses one of those wires if a huge pain in the butt to get it out of that cable management mess so bottom line everything that I think is permanent in here including the insides of computers is great in the cable management space but everything that's a little bit more modular or that may or may not move or get moved out in the next couple weeks or months or years even the kid management is definitely a little less on point there your allergy to cable type buddy can buy a velcro cable time it's like the guy's never heard of a velcro wrap will be iPhone 8 B port list so assuming you mean the next iPhone that comes out in this September is the iPhone 8 I would say probably not this year but ideally pretty soon I guess I've said this before for Apple if the iPhone goal is to be poreless and the only port that's left since they got rid of the headphone jack is the Lightning port only thing you use that Lightning port for is plug it into your computer to sync data and how often do we really plug into sync to iTunes and charging now wireless charging is not really I guess where we want it to be for a full time only way to charge a phone still a bit of a work in progress so I don't see the iPhone 8 now getting rid of that last port that people use for charging but maybe in a year or two or three where we have like a sort of a radius based wireless charging this has been talked about where you don't have to put it right on a pad but in a general area and it starts to charge when we get that down then maybe we will see a port look like ah are you ashamed of the number of typos you make on Twitter we can we can literally reuse rockets and land them back on earth and use them again but we can't edit tweets we could put man on the moon but we can't edit tweet we can build skyscrapers hundreds and hundreds of stories call and thousands of feet tall with elevators and then that just shoot up to the top in a matter of a minute or two but we can't edit our tweet we can upload 8kv videos to the internet and and stream them and play them back on the most ridiculously high-end machines I have 140 terabytes over there on the corner holding video files that I can access at any time multiple computers but I can't edit my pieces why not Huawei do you hate them okay so I see this a lot and I I think the easiest way to address this is I think a lot of people who have this opinion were oh you didn't review that Huawei phone that just came out why do you hate Huawei so much or oh I see this a lot you didn't review the newest Sony flagship what with the hate / Sony a lot of people saying this are people that are used to seeing reviews from big companies with dozens and even hundreds of people and they can afford to have different people reviewing different phones at the same time and just turning out reviews so they reviewed that Samsung phone and that Huawei phone and that LG phone and that Sony phone and they review all that stuff but for me I'm coming at it a little bit different you got to remember I'm one person I can't review as my daily driver for different phones at once so I don't hate Huawei at all in fact I really like Wow and I've showed their phones before and I really like Sony and I've showed their phones before but I tend to show more of the phones that I'm personally interested in using because that's why I review them so I'll leave it at that it's been a lot of fun I like a lot of the questions you guys sent but there's a lot of exciting videos coming up so definitely feel free to subscribe to this channel if you haven't already to see those when they come out very soon thank you for watching now let's out together the next one please [Music] 
hey what's up guys I'm Kidd Bhd here fresh new graphics and welcome to 2018 and we have a lot of plans for this year as I'm sure you can imagine and you notice I keep saying we because this actually gradually started to turn more into a bit of a team effort at this point as you know it used to just be me my camera maybe my computer and not a whole lot but as you start to get more hands you realize the benefits of being able to do more things so you know third-person shots moving shots all kinds of fun angles basically capturing things and experiences that I ordinarily couldn't if I was the one already focusing on the camera work so this changes things a bit makes it a little bit more dynamic but in a good way so yeah bottom line we're gonna be expanding on that again for this year and I think you'll notice the difference it makes to the videos and it'll help us make bigger and better things and also more often in fact in 2017 I didn't tell you guys this but one of the goals I had was to make 100 videos to get a hundred projects fully complete wind it up at 95 so like I got pretty close but I think this year in 2018 there's no doubt we'll have a hundred videos for you in 2017 we also made the Casey nice dad studio tour as episode 1 of a new series and then we were planning out episode number 2 and we're getting all hyped up and with hung out with deadmau5 in his newly built studio and then Linus made his video which was basically the same as so that's cool we're back to working on that we got the dope tech series going that is a fun one that's gonna continue of course and we also shot some car videos that will never see the light of day in their completion take a couple days on them did a lot of shooting and learned a lot but then later we did make a car video that did see the light of day the Tesla project loved a video which also happened to win the contest and now let's just say there will definitely be some car videos in 2018 that do see the light of day that's a guarantee we got a pretty good playlist name for it to something else we dabbled with in 2017 was the whole idea of custom merge you know a limited edition design here and there and that's fun but I think in 2018 that beast will be entirely different don't wanna give away too much but I think you get the idea so in 2017 the channel passed five million subscribers which is incredible and also rolled past 800 million total video views' and of the 95 videos uploaded in 2017 they were watched about 266 million times in total which multiplies out to 1.1 billion total minutes of watch time geez that's a lot of time but look in 2018 what we really have to look forward to is all this new tech that's coming out the new Mac Pro allegedly apples coming out with that this year I've gotten non-stop questions about the red hydrogen one that's a big one and there's gonna be mysteries of course too maybe an 8k TV or beyond electric cars foldable phones there's gonna be surprises but I'm gonna do my best to show it all to you literally my favorite thing to do is talk about tech and experience it and use it and I don't thank you guys enough for this but I am super fortunate to be in a position where I can not only experience some bleeding edge tech and amazing stuff all the time but then I can also turn around and share it with you guys I literally one of my favorite moments of last year was when I interviewed at the end of my Google i/o video I interviewed sundar pichai the CEO of Google and that was fun obviously kind of an on-the-spot thing but that wasn't even my idea that was Google's idea that they came to me with so the fact that companies at this point are reaching out shows that there's a lot of doors open and I just have to step through them to try to share that experience with you guys well I was gonna feel outside of my comfort zone and I know that and that's sort of like a general New Year's resolution to do that as well but that's what makes us better either way bottom line welcome to 2018 I hope every video I upload this year is better than every video from last year and from all the previous years and I think that's definitely possible but other than that thanks for watching caught you guys the next one pace [Music] 
[Music] all right let's do it hey what is up guys MP PhD here and welcome to ask mkbhd number 23 and it's also 12 of 12 for this year we've done one every month January to December and I actually kind of have enjoyed this series a lot so far so I think if you're down we'll probably continue it for 2018 so actually guys which wanted to know on Twitter again and a lot of you guys had some great questions I selected some of the best of those so these are those do you think Tesla will run out of money before they release the Roadster that's that's a-- so i don't know how people think that i actually hear a surprising amount of auto industry people who tend to think tesla is a bubble almost they think it's gonna rise and disappear and electric is just a fad and they don't have to worry about it and i think the fact that people have been in the industry for that long and still think that way is borderline troubling so no I don't think Tesla's gonna run out of money before they actually make the Roadster I think they'll be in a great spot by 2020 Apple just admitted it's been secretly throttling performance of old iPhones thoughts okay so this was a really interesting a little what would you call it controversy basically Apple has never really been super transparent about it but they've said that in order to protect old batteries and old phones so if it knows your phone has an old battery let's say you have an iPhone 6 basically Apple is pushing software updates to your phone to eventually slow that down it's reducing the clock speed from like 1,400 megahertz all the way down to 600 megahertz because it knows that older batteries have a harder time keeping up with the high voltages it needs to keep those high clock speeds going so technically it makes sense that they're protecting your user experience by slowing down your CPU requiring less voltage and making sure your battery lasts longer but at the same time now all of the headlines are hey Apple is actually pushing a software update to older iPhones to make it slow down that's not a good look I feel like they could have been a little more upfront and transparent about that before it had to be discovered with a geek bench benchmark oh and also how convenient that there are no removable batteries in iPhones if you actually get into an iPhone and replace the battery by opening it up and replacing it the clock speed of the CPU will go back to normal because it sees a new battery bottom line I just think it's kind of a funny controversy we all kind of expected this to begin with and now it's just confirmed true I just wouldn't be surprised if apples not the only one here John wants to know how has the iMac Pro changed your workflow honestly the number one thing that comes to mind is it makes me appreciate it way more coming from a slower machine I've tried to edit 8k 8 to 1 raw videos on MacBook Pros in the past and of course my Mac Pro which was choking and dying in the end of its years so the number one difference the faster render speed and the faster real-time playback without dropping any frames and high quality is the number one thing that's made me super happy about it and the other thing is actually in Final Cut Pro 10 dot for the new version there's a lot of color controls that have replaced all of the plugins I was using to mess with color before and Final Cut and are all fast and optimized and I can drag as many onto the timeline as I want and apply them in real time and play and there's no lag between actually hitting the play button and it's starting to play so I think I've been more confident to just go in and mess with color but ya know just the thing is just blazing fast I know most of the work in Final Cut Pro for that rendering is being done by the GPUs by the Vega GPUs but I'm also pretty excited to see how well that eighteen core does when it gets here in I think February is my ship date alright so in supersize video you said your favorite smartphone of 2017 was the pixel to excel I did say that but in your smartphone Awards you said that the note 8 was the MVP why explain yourself marques ok so the simple answer is I am biased and I know I'm biased I actually value different things than different people so I acknowledge that I think the Galaxy Note 8 is the best overall most well-rounded most complete smartphone that came out in 2017 best screen objectively on any phone has a great camera has great performance they did a pretty great job with the skin they get better every year they have the stylus they have the battery it's got a lot going for it kept the headphone jack but the pixel 2 has stock Android which I personally like more it's not objectively better I just like it and the pixel 2 does have an objectively incredible camera now it might have a much worse screen and no headphone jack and a bunch of other things that aren't quite up to par including the design but I don't really mind that as much so I'm willing to sacrifice that to keep that amazing camera I know that I value the camera more than a lot of other people who might just won an overall complete package that's why I pick the pixel - with stock Android and a great camera as my daily driver and can still acknowledge that the Galaxy Note 8 is an overall great phone because I'm biased see how that works well 2018 be the year of Tri cameras on smartphones I guess triple cameras on smartphones no I really don't think so in fact it'll probably start going back to one camera on the back just because it's actually possible to do almost everything that we wanted to do with dual cameras with one as we saw from this one what would the perfect phone setup be for you software and hard there mmm what would the perfect phone setup be for you software and hardware and would rather have a big sensor size or dual camera so the whole concept of a perfect smartphone I've been over that in the past actually made more than one video about the whole idea I might be tempted to make another one at 2018 with like these updated specs and reference phones we have but generally there is no perfect phone I did tweet recently though that I would like to have this rough combination of pixel to Note 8 and razor phone I might not be the only one there and as far as big sensor or dual camera I'm gonna go with big sensor because you can do a lot of the stuff like I said that you could usually do with the dual camera with one great camera item you most look forward to and 2018 okay I have to to good answers for this one is that red smartphone a lot of people are asking about it near the end of the year for the smartphone Awards whatever happened to that red hydrogen one that smartphone we all pre-ordered or that I pre-ordered 2018 is it's expected to come out pretty early and we expect to see more of that probably right after CES and then to accent accent buttons on phones I've really grown to like this colored power button on the side of the pixel 2 and it's only the black and white one even though it's not the best color in the world the the star war is 1 + 5 t that does this with that red button I really like that - there's another Huawei phone that does this I hope 2018 is the year of the accented power buttons or some accent color buttons I think that's an awesome look not the only one is that a weird thing to hope for why wasn't LG v30 considered in the smartphone awards oh it was considered trust me it was considered it was on the desk right in front of me I actually said in my video about it earlier in the year the V 30 is is easily the most underrated phone of the year because it's a very complete phone also across the board it's just a little bit worse in pretty much every category than the ones that were actually winning awards it has a great display but not the best display it has a great design but not the best design it has a great camera especially the video camera but not the best camera has a big battery not the best battery life but has a big battery it kept the headphone jack it has dual cameras there's a lot of great things going for it but it's just so underrated because it's just not soaring above the rest in one particular category what's your favorite winter animal I'm gonna go with Bobcat what is a winter animal I don't know well they also are out in the snow they like kills I mean they're both mountain cats you know they're probably happy in the winter I think what was the point the single event if you had to choose one where you felt like your career as a youtuber took off like a couple months ago more than a year ago actually there is a little stretch where basically Vic Gundotra who was ahead at Google for a while he posted something on Google+ saying this kid is the best tech reviewer on the planet right now and that was awesome because I had known Vic for a while we had been sharing each other stuff talking and it was just a cool thing for him to say but that quote obviously because he was at Google for a while just kind of blew up there was articles about it Forbes article CNN article this that everyone was writing about it quoting him just because it was a popular story to talk about I went on a couple different TV news networks like a couple different night news shows just because of that quote talking about it they came and they invited me on so how old do you son and you're doing what on the internet how is that that's great use he said you're the best online so I kind of went through those thinking like yeah no he did say that and that's really nice of him but this was just like one post and and everyone sort of latched on to it and that's like the strongest where I've ever felt like wow is this this is this is crazy now you never overlook the amount of work you put into something because it wouldn't be where it is and if I were to go back and redo it I probably wouldn't change anything but I think one thing that stands out just to answer your question is most recently in fact up to like right now as I'm recording this Google is running a commercial for the pixel 2 and recording a couple different like reviews of the pixel 2 in their commercial it's on it's playing during like football games and NBA games in that ad spot they use quotes from New York Times calm wired calm esquire calm and me my review video that is honestly mostly thanks to you guys the fact that I can make these videos and I'm saying a lot of the same stuff that other people are saying in their reviews but the fact that you guys take the advice seriously I know is a big responsibility for me and that's why I put all the time and the research and the effort into making as good of a video as possible and that's awesome that also the companies that are being talked about appreciate that five out of the six companies that won awards in that smartphone Awards video we just posted have reached out and contacted me and asked to get their trophies that would be essential Google Razer Samsung and HTC I don't expect Apple to reach out for their trophy but if they want one they can have it but bottom line thank you to everyone for watching I'll see you guys breathe a little bit for the holiday season then we'll be right back at it afterwards with the tech stuff CES is around the corner all these phones were ready for for 2018 are already starting to rumor up so I'll talk to you guys then thanks again for watching bass also in case you guys are wondering about this this is this is part of the Chris Paul bandwagon I'm not I mean I'm just saying it now I'm allowed to follow my favorite player so so you know I'm not on the Rockets ban when I get him on the Chris Paul bandwagon 
[Music] sup guys mkbhd here let's talk about that rooster - so last night as many of you probably know if you're a tech fan at all you've watched these before there was a Tesla event and this one was for the unveiling mostly as we all knew it for the semi-truck so we finally got our first look at it you know Elon rolled up on stage driving one got out of the thing looks like there's two versions of it comes in a sort of a space gray dark version one big one small 500 mile range the 0-60 in five seconds when there's no payload or zero to 60 in 20 seconds with an 80,000 pound payload a thing will recharge to 400 miles in half an hour has a Center seated driving console autopilot all these cool things about it looks really cool but I know I'm not a truck driver so I'm probably never gonna actually even sit in one of those that was the main story of the event and then it kind of looked like it was ending the lights dimmed and then they came back on and there was music and it became this sort of a one more thing Tesla pulled one more thing and out of the back of one of the trailers attached to the Tesla truck they rolled a Tesla Roadster 2.0 the new one the one that we all knew was eventually coming but didn't know we'd ever see see Tesla didn't have much of a reputation when the original roadster came out that was this two-door car that was essentially the body of a Lotus but with the electrics of Tesla the motors and the batteries and it was a sort of a weird Frankenstein hybrid car not the most practical thing not the most comfortable but boy was that thing zippy and from what I've heard very fun to drive but it doesn't supercharge the way Model S's do it's not one of their flagship cars they had problems they didn't sell a lot there's a couple hundred or a couple thousand sold and that was it then there were rumors there were rumors of maybe they'll bring that back maybe there will be a Roadster 2.0 there was some Elon tweets here and there there's some Tesla hinting but we never actually see anything until last night so they roll that thing off the truck and it looks in my opinion absolutely incredible it looks great it looks like a Tesla and a lot of the ways and a lot of the curves but it has cues from others cues from Porsche a little bit from Aston Martin it's got some some McLaren lines to it so it's a really aggressive really good-looking sports car it's be clear immediately that he's about to talk to us about the new roadster and he is and then he gives us the specs and I'm a spec person I like numbers but there's not a lot of spec sheets that can just make me kind of speechless essentially especially coming from someone who's driven and owned a P 100 D for a while which has a silly spec sheet by itself spec sheet of the new roadster 0 to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds 1.9 seconds zero to a hundred miles an hour in 4.2 seconds it'll run out a quarter mile in eight point eight or eight point nine seconds I've seen both from their their website in their third presentation but it's a sub nine second quarter mile it'll have a top speed of quote over 250 miles per hour and this all will come from the floor mounted 200 kilowatt hour battery pack so twice the size of the P 100 D it has three motors two for the back wheels and one for the front wheels and it'll do 620 miles of 621 miles rated for a charge so that massive battery is actually getting you not just awesome performance for motors but a really long range it'll be the first electric car to do over a thousand kilometers on a charge so that spec sheet just that list of things he said just if you look at the car and you hear those numbers it's like hyper car territory basically it doesn't sound street-legal it doesn't make any sense when you look at every other car that's ever been produced it's nuts and I know we get caught up in the numbers about like you know it's just a straight line drag race like eventually those other cars will catch it those million dollar supercars that we constantly compare these two will eventually catch it with this one it doesn't look like they'll catch it nearly as fast as they could catch this car like this is basically P 200 T in a way like if Apollo is P 100 D Performance 100 kilowatt hour battery dual motors then this roadster is a lighter body a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack and triple motor speed 200 T so we get to this point in the event my jaw is just kind of on the ground where I was watching this and obviously there's a lot of comparisons naturally we just love comparing Tesla's numbers to these million dollar supercars actually looked it up a lot of these cars on the list of the fastest production car is zero to 60 ever are doing like 2.5 seconds maybe two point four a lot of them 2.7 so four Tesla Roadster to come along and do 1.9 is disgusting and there's actually some videos from the event there were even some test rides out i'll show you guys them but of actual launches from inside the car the reactions incredible the views incredible I can't wait to see people doing like that GoPro reaction test we're just sitting with the passenger and they have the GoPro up here and they do that launch from zero to 60 to see the reaction can't wait for those me too honestly I didn't think I didn't think I noticed a difference to my people be one no I understood indigo knows difference there's a reason this one's called plaid oh my goodness I kind of wonder if you can track this car like I've talked to friends about bringing like a Tesla to a track and actually you know racing a P 100 D against other cars this car is electronically limited to 155 miles an hour but you can only go that fast for so long before the battery starts heating up and it actually limits your performance and doesn't want you to do that for very long so even though it's an insane performer even though this car does 0 to 60 in 2.4 you wouldn't really race it on a track for very long against like a traditional supercar I mean it's also a four-door sedan so that's another reason but still I gotta wonder what the cooling is gonna be like in this 200 kilowatt hour battery how long you able to get this insane performance can you actually go 200 miles an hour for some time before it wears out could you actually track this car and beat a lot of the others I want to see what motor trend does with it I don't know I have a lot of questions but one thing I haven't mentioned is this cars coming out in 2020 Tesla Roadster 2.0 will ship in 2020 there's gonna be a founder series version and a regular base model essentially as what he said I don't know how the numbers will defer or what the difference will be between the two but that's what he said it'll be a $200,000 car which is I mean it's still a fraction of the price of the million-dollar car as we compare it to but the founder Series will be 250 thousand and there will only be a thousand of them made now there's a reserve button on their site and trying really hard not to press it but you can reserve it right now to get it in 2020 but there's plenty of other questions I still have plenty of reasons why you might not get this car like the fact that I've only seen the outside of it for example they haven't they haven't shown the trunk Elon said tons of storage on stage but he didn't show the front trunk or the back trunk you also said it's a four-seater so there's the two doors on the front and you see the front two seats but there's also two pretty small seats in the back kind of the way some other sports cars are four-seaters you probably don't want people in the back all the time but then it's also a convertible so the top glass goes back into the trunk so how big could the trunk really be I believe it will have autopilot but that wasn't really mentioned or talked about there's a couple of other little things like I still have questions about this car but then again 2020 by then like this could be sick something I don't talk about a lot is this car P 100 D Apollo you is a leased vehicle which means I'll be giving it back and I kind of viewed Tesla's as a piece of tech in that way so the fact that they offered a lease for a couple years where I could give this piece of tech back to them and they'll continue to develop other tech that I can pick up later when I gave this back was kind of part of my plan and it turns out Apollo's lease is up at the end of 2019 and the Roadster 2.0 2020 hmm but this roaster 2.0 man that's something else that's a hypercar zero just to see that fast 0-100 that fast 250 miles an hour you can't you can't really argue with that I think I'm done I think that's all I had to say let me know what you guys think should I Shay I think it probably will 
hey what is up guys on kabhi HD here and just look at this TV alright so we saw a lot of pretty cool TVs at CES like we do every year but a lot of the coolest ones never really go on sale they're more like showcases but this this one is real this is the LG 4k OLED W in the flesh and the W stands for wallpaper and that's a pretty fitting name for a TV like this because it's so thin it literally looks like a cutout like a wallpaper on a 65 inch section of the wall so for the record the panel is officially 3.8 millimeters thick total including the wall mount if you must know there's actually no way to keep this TV upright there's no stand that it comes with you have to wall mount it if you're getting it so the OLED module is basically a 65 inch sheet of pixels that sort of hooks on to the tiny wall mount at the top like a picture frame and then actually uses magnets throughout the middle and the bottom of the frame to stay flush with the wall it's tight so that makes it thinner on the wall than a bunch of household objects which you would ordinarily consider thin I mean the fact that this whole panel is about the same thickness as two SD cards should give you a pretty good idea how nuts it is maybe take a key out your pocket and hold it up to the wall like that is how thin the entire TV is and yeah that also makes this TV that LG makes thinner than the thinnest phone they make how about that and then the OLED itself is an excellent quality panel as it should be for the price it gets up to a thousand nits which is extremely bright blacks are pitch black since it's an OLED it hits 99% of DCI color space supports Dolby vision HDR 10h LG and Technicolor's HDR I mean it'll pretty much cover any format and of course it's a 4k panel so details and contrast and sharpness are incredible up close as close as you'll ever get to a TV this big but where did all the guts go so where are all the rest of the components to this TV the port's the speakers etc it's actually all in the sound bar which is an equally important part of this setup as the OLED so everything connects to the TV through this one flat cable and you can see it coming out the bottom and it looks a little bit weird at first but I kind of dig this system it's a really really sturdy cable doesn't flex very much but it comes right out the bottom of the TV and plugs into the sound bar and I have mine using the extension since it's more than 2 feet from the TV to the bar I think ideally for maximum visual flotation you're going to want to go into the wall with the cable so you don't have to see it at all but then you need some professional help and you have to get it properly shielded for fire code etc I think some double-sided tape for me should do pretty much fine to make it not a big deal the cable really is not that noticeable once you're looking at the TV trust me but this sound bar this thing is actually really good it sounds great it gets really loud without much distortion I have a bunch of speakers frontward facing sideways straight up and that makes it pretty good at throwing sound off the walls and creating a pretty convincing surround sound effect and check out this leak little animation it does when turning on and off I I can't even be sure if that has any real functionality outside of looking cool but I like it anyway and all of the i/o is of course in the sandbar as well so you plug in your sound bar into the wall and if you have anything HDMI there's 4 HDMI ports a couple USB and Ethernet etc and then all of that gets fed through to the TV along with power through that ribbon cable so that's what allows the TV to be so thin because it's literally just the OLED panel and some shielding and a few magnets and that's it as far as what's up on your wall the dopest of your setup with this TV will depend pretty much on how well you can hide this cable so yeah you can color me impressed I'm glad to even have it in the studio now thanks to LG and even after using it for a couple days sometimes you still find yourself wondering like why did it have to get so thin like what's the difference between a TV that's one inch thick and this panel that's 1/10 of an inch thick but then you use it and you remember why it's the thinness combined with these really thin bezels that create a super immersive viewing and gaming experience I can't even imagine how insane the 77 inch version of looks probably just looks like a straight-up projection which crazy so okay the bottom line for this is most people aren't ever really going to buy this I mean it's $8,000 if you want to that's on you bro I get it but for most people this is more of just a showcase of what the bleeding edge of technical concept is a new of having a super thin TV and then putting most of the i/o and the electronics down at the bottom we've seen that before even LG and Samsung have done that in the bottoms of their TVs before put the speaker's the HDMI ports all of it in the bottom even though the thinnest part of the TV is really thin but this this is taking it to the next level that's why it's dope tech it's just seeing what's possible with taking as much away from it as possible and when you do this you end up with this super immersive experience where you don't even really focus on the fact that it's a TV anymore it just looks like someone copied and pasted an image onto a wall and you're just looking at the image it's really cool so I can leave a link in the description to this if you really want to check it out but really most of the links I'll leave or the videos I was watching on the TV and the stuff on the TV if you want to check those things out but that's pretty much it that's the wallpaper TV thank you for watching talk to you as the next one peace [Music] 
hey what's up guys I'm could be HD here and this is LG V 30 this is way better than any other phone LG's ever made and it is so very 2017 so LG was nice enough to send over a V 30 a little bit early for me to take a look at it so I've spent a little time with it and it's kind of funny it's basically the opposite of the essential phone I just reviewed like in every imaginable way it's kind of impressive one is a minimal sort of bare-bones small stock phone from a pretty new company while the other is a big feature packed really richly enhanced Android flagship from a well-established company has done this before now technically they don't want us reviewing it yet since this is pre-release hardware and software but I really want to share it with you guys because it's so good so these are the top five things that you should know about this phone in order so number five is all the little things all the attention to detail in this phone and I think a lot of us can come from the fact that LG has had a lot to learn from the v20 and the g6 and the g5 but some of it is just knowing what people want and this phone checks pretty much all of the boxes imaginable it has expandable storage via microSD for those who like it it has wireless charging it has fast charging it has USB type-c of course it has IP certified waterproofing it has a headphone jack and not only does it have a headphone jack but it backs it up with a 32-bit quad act that audio enthusiasts will really like the removable battery might be gone but the 3300 milliamp hour battery onboard here is pretty promising if not standard for this size it's not something I've tested but fast charging and wireless charging should back that up so again it seems like the opposite of that essential phone which for 700 bucks had literally none of the things that I just mentioned it gets the fingerprint reader right also it puts it in the middle of the back if you're gonna put it on the back of the phone that's where it's actually reachable and Samsung and it also doubles as a power button still which is kind of LG's thing so the v3 checks all the boxes in a way that no other smartphone this year really has except for maybe the thousand dollar Note 8 so number four is the software and I've said this a couple times in previous videos but I'm not the biggest Android skin so it takes a lot for me to say this about a phone but I really don't mind this skin and I think a big part of that for me is how many features elegies added again think the opposite of the essential phone this is an LG skin on top of Android 7.1.2 fingers crossed for a getting updated to 8.0 quickly and right off the bat it doesn't feel too cartoonish or weird there is a bit of bloatware but most of it you can remove or hide if you want and performance is not only smooth as you would expect but like really fluid high frame rate animations you can't say that about every new phone with the skin but yeah it just berries so many features in the settings to mess with if you want you know previous V Sirius phones the v10 the V 20 had that second screen obviously this one doesn't have that but they do have this optional floating bar so you can bring it in from the edge and keep some app shortcuts there or your favorite actions whatever you want it's basically kind of like apps edge on the new Samsung phones you can rearrange the buttons in the bottom of the phone and any order you want so you can add or remove buttons place it exactly how you want if you take a lot of screenshots you can add that capture button there I'm happy to see that still exists there's all these smart settings to to adjust profiles basically based on different scenarios so linger at home it might turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and turn down the brightness and set your alarm but when you get to work it does something different it has a couple themes built in too and then of course a themes store if none of the built-in ones suit your fancy so if you're into that you can really make this phone look a lot different so there's a lot going on here with the software obviously because it's Android you can use as much of it or as little of it as you want so you might not be interested in any of the things I just mentioned in which case you never touch them but if you're interested any of that it's all included so the number three best feature of the V 30 is the design so you've seen it a lot by now in this video but yeah it's pretty dope this is one of those phones that now looks very 2017 it's the huge display up front the 82% screen to body ratio that kind of curves over at the edges it makes this sort of a glass sandwich design it's not anything we haven't seen before in fact if you didn't know better you might say it looks a lot like a Galaxy Note 8 because it does but yeah the sides sort of round off smoothly you've got the antenna bands matching pretty well a really thin and lightweight device in the hand IP certified water-resistant again like design is really complete and this is sort of what you'd expect when you put a dream phone together minimal bezels the camera bump on the back is the tiniest of bumps so no big deal it doesn't Rock the phone or anything when it's down and the logos aren't too much of an eyesore either they're really my only real complaint with the design is I wish they'd put the headphone jack on the bottom that's it so everything else is props LG so then we get to number two and the number two best feature on this phone is the display itself up front this new screen is incredibly good it's a six inch 2880 by 1440p OLED display and it gets crazy bright so I don't have an it's rating for it but it is totally visible outdoors much more easily than most and honestly rivals some of the best Samsung displays we've seen in the past year two in colors and brightness and clarity and saturation now obviously 2880 by 1440 that's an 18 by 9 aspect ratio or as I like to call it since I learn fractions two to one so it's a bit narrower than your typical sixteen by nine so when you're watching videos or using certain apps sometimes gaming you'll get these black bars on either side of the display but again it's not that big of a deal since it's an OLED and the black parts of the screen go completely blank the viewing angles are pretty good the curved corners are really great I mean this is all-around great display and I think this is what would really put it on the map for me if I hadn't seen this phone in person and I was just kind of curious about it and I saw this screen that's why I would be interested in it and then it would get me to the rest of stuff but that's just the second best thing so to top that the number one best feature on the v30 is around the back and it's that camera or those cameras this phone supports dual cameras again like all its older brothers on the back gets one 16 megapixel F 1.6 main camera with oh is and then a secondary super wide angle 13 megapixel F 1.9 camera and they've done these dual cameras before with the wide-angle secondary this time just with pretty much everything around them being improved so the main cameras a lot better shots off this thing looked top-notch I gonna have to disclaim that it's pre-production stuff but they're clean they have punch saturated colors plenty of contrast and detail and dynamic range and of course having a fixed F 1.6 aperture means you can get pretty close to a subject and the background will fade away to a decent Boca which is cool and then the super wide angle camera has less distortion than before so less of that fisheye GoPro look and more of just a really wide angle rectilinear perspective which is awesome and then the camera app itself is really impressive really what makes this the number one feature so you can drag the shutter button to move between the two cameras zoom in and out which is smart that's also what Samsung is doing with the note so it's not the first place we've seen it but it's very 2017 and it has your usual massive amount of settings auto HDR auto phone triggers self timers all that stuff but then you look at all the modes look at all these modes in the phone auto mode is obviously the one that most people use but enthusiasts will get into manual mode manual video time lapses panoramas slow-motion all that stuff and then there is something called cine mode and when you turn on cine mode the camera records to a flat log color profile so you can maximize sensor data and dynamic range and then add color later the cine mode in this phone's video camera is literally made for people to import it from the phone and bring it to a computer and edit it later if that's not screaming enthusiasts phone to you I don't know what is so this is kind of the ultimate enthusiasts photo and video cameras obviously stuff like the video quality itself and more photo quality testing and the battery life those things will have to be tested for a full review but right off the bat v30 looks really promising and I didn't even cover everything but it's pretty clear this will be a mobile photography and videography powerhouse and a phone that enthusiasts who like all those boxes to be checked will really like so let me know would you get a V 30 I mean obviously with note 8 right around the corner with iPhone 8 about to come out possibly having an excellent camera as well is V fair deal on your radar let me know thanks for watching talk to you as the next one peace [Music] 
okay hey what's up guys I'm Kim be HD here and think about this have you ever seen the perfect smartphone no right I've ever seen a smartphone hit like all five of the pillars of a great smartphone all of those on the nose 100% it seems like it never happens it seems like every time you have a new great smartphone there's always one little thing holding it back but I think today that may change today we may figure something out here so those of you who don't already know the five pillars of a great smartphone from me anyway are great battery great build great performance great camera and great display if you can make a smart phone that nails all five of those things then you've made a great smart phone that's worth buying it's harder than it sounds but that's something to get into okay great battery life yes this one has that it may only be a 900 million power battery but number one it's removable and number two it's not powering the most power hungry specks in the world so I can pretty much guarantee it lasts longer than your current phone this one seems to be getting about two to three weeks of screen on time considering the screen never turns off great build quality check so I didn't have to convince you it's a well-built fell and you already know it kind of a legend for that it's a little bit thick but I've said over and over again that I don't mind thicker phones it's mildly water-resistant its dust resistant drop resistant shatter resistant time resistant if this thing is really solid great performance well this thing is snappy as hell I've been flipping through the UI a lot not really multitasking but more just flipping really fast through the menu options and I can see pretty much no lag at all so performance here is also great I threw some pretty big numbers at the calculator and after some key work it seems to handle it just fine not really sure why more manufacturers Dunkel with physical buttons but that was really satisfying I'm not really much of a gamer but this phone actually is such a performance beast that it did just preload games on it they just have games built in so I pick snake to which seems pretty straightforward and I pretty much crushed the high score it did take a while which shows that can definitely hold a lot in the RAM I don't know how much RAM it has but I swear it it definitely held its own and then great camera nokia actually took a really courageous approach with this one and just straight-up didn't include a camera at all I mean you know what they say if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all well if you're not going to include the absolute best camera why waste any space just don't put it in at all so you actually say if you don't have anything to worry about on the back of the phone no smudges and also no camera bump on the back so he used bonus points there and then great display okay there's not nearly enough pixels on the selamat have to take some points off but overall pretty complete package I give it an 8 out of 10 I'll definitely throw the wallpaper in the description too for those of you asking for it okay so obviously you've gone to your subscription box and figured out what day it is figured this would be a fun little project for April Fool's Day happy April Fool's Day it's funny though and it's this little project of making this video I never I learned a lot about these phones like I never owned a Nokia 3310 this was before I owned any phones at all so I actually bought like four of them I just probably just passed Windows Phone and market share because there's a lot of really interesting things this phone does for one thing it boots up super fast I kind of miss when phone's booted up just like that actually has an option to update the software I didn't try that because it was hard enough to get the sim card working but just a lot of cool stuff so that's pretty much it thank you for watching this one maybe know if you want to see other actually old phones like realistically covered in a video I have a Nexus One I have my first smartphone the Droid but there's stuff out there that we can make videos about either way thanks again for watching again this is your annual warning to like not pay too much attention to your Twitter for you today but if you want have some fun go open Google Maps on your phone right now you're welcome talk to you guys in the next video peace [Music] you 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm kabhi HD here and welcome to the 2018 what's on my smartphone video now I'm pretty sure I've mentioned at least once or twice in previous videos that my setup does not change that much from year to year on my phone now fair warning to those of you who saw last year's video a lot of the apps are gonna look very similar to that they'll see I didn't do this video over and over again because what's on my phone was mostly the same setup I have is usually pretty simple and this is because I switch phones pretty often during the course of the year nevertheless here we are people have asked for it I'm showing it to you again one of the more interesting questions I get from friends like outside of this is isn't it annoying to change your phone like to switch your whole setup and transfer everything over and over again every time you change phones isn't that and knowing after a while and the answer is yes but I've kind of streamlined it in a way I mean Google handles a lot of the migration of that stuff usually it's not that big of a deal and then I kind of streamlined it so it's nearly the same every time and I know exactly when I'm done setting everything out but anyway I'm carrying two phones as I've mentioned that I did last year two pockets two phones and it's my favorite Android phone right now and my favorite iPhone right now same thing as last year so this iPhone 10 in silver is my second most used phone it's good for a lot of those camera things like snapchat Instagram live the occasional periscope things that iOS is good at there's also a couple of apps some specific VR games and things like that that are only on iOS right now so I just kind of always have an iPhone in my pocket but if you saw Lou's video from CES a couple weeks ago earlier this year then you already know that the main phone in my pocket is the Panda Google pixel 2 XL but I still love this phone for all those same reasons that I loved back when I reviewed it a couple months ago and I keep coming back to it for those same reasons so this is my setup alright so first of all wallpaper I'll definitely link that below people have asked about it I've tweeted about it recently it's a little bit of a blue Canyon but this is the setup to start and I'll just give you that sort of a walkthrough basically I've said this before but I use the Google stock clauncher for a couple of reasons but mainly because a lot of the features that end up getting really popular and are really useful in third-party apps like Nova Launcher slowly make their way into this stock launcher now this side piece here with the Google News and all these cards it's it's decently useful but I use it a little bit less because it's actually gotten worse you can't swipe away cards anymore like if you're not interested in something you can't swipe it away to get rid of it and that's pretty annoying so it just kind of ends up filled with things that I'm not interested in which is pretty dumb you should let us remove stuff like this what is it I don't I don't care about half of this stuff anyway this is the home screen I got the weather up top and the date that's cool I don't really use a whole ton of space so you can see again like I mentioned it's pretty darn similar to the last time I showed it so here's my apps at the bottom I switch to tick tick which is my task manager app now it's really clean and it syncs with itself it doesn't really use Google Tasks but it's still pretty good and then I use Google keep to manage lists like grocery lists so those are the two must use apps for me Instagram y'all familiar with that I use it all the time Yahoo fantasy sports I'm doing a lot worse this year than I was in previous years although I do think oh it's a new week but I did win my last week which is pretty good my fantasy team is it's alright I had a late pick well what are you gonna do there's Google photos there's Google Maps there's YouTube studio I think pretty much every youtuber ever has YouTube studio on their phone you could use it to answer comments keep track of videos things like that that's all there Spotify my number one music player of choice the Tesla app that's how you warm up your car before you go outside in the freezing cold to get to it high and all the other management stuff I've done a video all on that app and then relay Pro which is my read adapt of choice people seem to ask every time I show this like why do you use relay Pro yes there are other pretty good reddit apps for Android this one just happens to be really familiar to me at this point but anyway I also use this to manage the mkbhd subreddit which we're using a little bit more now if you head over to our mkbhd we're starting to experiment with that and getting video suggestions there and things like that so I'll link that below if you're interested and of course at the bottom are the mainstays the phone the messenger the Play Store the camera app and then Lemang go is my twitter app of choice I'm pretty sure when I did this video last time of the year it was Phoenix they started messing around with a beta that I'm not as interested in but flamingo which is another bird is another Twitter app for Android that's really good remembers my spot in the timeline does everything well it's pretty it's pretty material it's good so flamingo I'll link I'll link that below as well now I'm gonna swipe over to my second home screen here and this is my calendar app the full-screen calendar widget it's the exact same that I used last time I was showing my phone but you'll notice it's kind of buggy and I can turn up the opacity and stuff to show this better depending on my wallpaper but I'm cool with it because it always highlights the top one but it always says loading at the top of each day loading loading that's not because it's actually loading that's just an android 8.0 bug that this app just has now I haven't switched to another full screen calendar widget because I still like the looks and the functionality of this one and how good it is I use Google Calendar for my life but if you're the developer of this app can you can you please update this for Android 8.0 please I'd really like it to actually say the date above each day thank you anyway going over to the third and final homescreen it's the shortcuts that I use just the apps that I'm using pretty often around now so wallet PayPal and passes I don't even use Google Wallet that often but this passes app I use literally just because of the carwash I go to which happens to have a royalty program every tank carwash is you get an 11-3 it doesn't work with Google Wallet so I use passes I think it's actually meant for iPhone and a dark sky for weather this is another one that started off really popular as an iPhone app that's made its way over to Android over the years it's almost as good on Android as it is on iOS it still has some bugs though but I mean whether app is a queue either as you'll see when I go to my app drawer we have ways I discovered this recently like in the past year turns out it's an incredible app for avoiding traffic and avoiding tickets nest I've showed that before I've got a couple Neffs cameras that's the security suite that's the thermostat that whole thing the authenticator app pocket cast is pretty new to me I guess basically during flights I have to figure out a way to pass the time and music kind of gets old after a long time so the pocket cast app with a couple good podcasts can be pretty good if you have any good podcast suggestions definitely hit me up in the common below I have the United app that's just because I fly United a lot and my boarding passes in there the health mate app from Nokia this actually used to be something else but then Nokia bought them and then now I have a scale that like talks to the app that tells me how much it's whatever and then the Google home app which is all the Google home devices you have of course if you have the shopping list I think they ruin the shopping list I just want to rant about that for a second you used to be able to say talk to Google and add something to your shopping list and then it would show up in Google keep in a list called shopping list now if you want to add something to your shopping list for some weird reason they changed it to show up in here inside the shopping list which opens in your web browser to this shopping list Google com why they did this I will probably never know they should definitely switch it back to talking to Google keep anyway last but not least YouTube it's a pretty pretty great site I've found recently they do some some interesting stuff over here if you want to check it out they host a lot of videos I'll share a link below but that's basically it for the home screen layout those are the apps the shortcuts you see pretty often those are the things I'm clicking the most anyway I'll finish it up with the the last scroll through all the apps that you know I have on my phone but didn't make it to my home screen again a lot of stuff pretty similar to last year but my main weather app of choice is AccuWeather platinum it's super accurate and it's awesome I also have after ship up here in my most recent that's pretty good for tracking just about any package anytime you copy a tracking number to your clipboard and open up after ship you asks you if you want to paste it and track it it's really good it syncs across platforms backdrops is again still pretty awesome for finding wallpapers Chrome Canary is also a lot of fun fun for showing new features that are coming to the main version of Chrome but also it's unstable it's super it literally has unstable in the name it's hilarious I have coinbase that's a thing that's new to me obviously cryptocurrency in the past year or two let's see you got daydream var Dropbox is pretty common you have the j-bird sound out for messing with the sound of your headphones the NBA app I it's it's alright it gives me notifications when cool things happen but scrolling down that's pretty it I have pocket I do use that a lot screener I use once in a while but it's awesome for sharing screenshots that are really pretty and I get down here to ooh BRR and venmo and ZocDoc and YouTube TV and that's pretty much it for the setup on my main phone like I said it's pretty similar to the last year but if you don't know now you know people were asking for it so now you have it maybe in a year if my setup is actually different I'll be able to share that but for the most part I'm expecting it to stay roughly similar so I'll link you to this video how's that so that's it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one peace 
hey what is up guys I'm Kevin HD here and right about at the end of last week we got a completely random announcement out of the blue for the red hydrogen one a $1,200 holographic Android phone so when it happened I gave my initial thoughts on Twitter I kind of talked through it a little bit and then I've been quiet since then but people have been asking me about it about what I really think about it non-stop for the past couple days so this is all of that so what happened was red yes this red the red who makes the cameras that I shoot these videos on first they made this hype announcement on the red user forums they do this every once in a while but they were like alright new product coming new product category get your credit cards ready it's going to be lit so of course on a couple days up to that people got really excited and speculating about what it might be is it a mirrorless camera are they making a stills camera are they getting into audio what could red be doing next and then of course the day and the time dropped and red hydrogen one was unveiled so it's the world's first holographic media machine in your pocket it's a standalone full-featured unlocked multi band smartphone operating on Android OS that just happens to add a few additional features that shatter is a mold of conventional thinking and then this picture this was the only photo released of the phone and then there is an order page 1,200 bucks for the aluminum one 1600 bucks for titanium well hmm so that's that's kind of weird so red the company that's making these cameras and these super high-end sensors is stepping into the world of smartphones where these huge players already Samsung's and apples and these massive supply chains how does a read gonna stepped in this is kind of like my two worlds colliding right now I guess if there's any target user target demographic for someone who's going to buy a smartphone from red it's probably me so yeah I bought both but to be honest there's not a whole lot actually known about the smartphone like I said there's only this one image of it and it's kind of dark and you basically just have the order page and this one PDF of a lot of jargon to decode multi-dimensional 2d 3d VR a RMR what is what does this even mean well that's what I'm here to try to decode for you and also for myself because I ordered them so basically this is how I see it going let me first of all let me brighten that photo up a little bit for you it's a it's an interesting looking phone and up front they said it's going to have a 5.7 inch professional hydrogen holographic display so this is the biggest question mark of the mall because we don't really know what that is exactly but I kind of got the visual of like a really advanced 3d experience and it will be glasses free as well and assuming it's nothing that we've never seen before which I guess I can't really assume with red but remember the Amazon fire phone back in 2014 yeah kind of something along those lines but obviously four years later and four years better physically right it's claiming you'll be able to really look around and experience real depth with this display and of course then we'll have some games and apps to support it as well not really sure if they're using the word holographic correctly in this case but we'll see and you'll also be able to create and capture and share these h4v files which are again are going to be brand new but that should be optimized for this experience but really trying to push beyond normal 3d and then just looking at the phone itself that brightened image we have USB see on the bottom a headphone jack nice and then the camera up top and a pretty interesting looking back almost looks like a heatsink like this phone is definitely going to be thick and then some grippy sides maybe also with a little micro SD card slot door because the phone does have that card slot and are also advertising this next level multi-dimensional audio to go along with the multi-dimensional video and of course we can't see a native speakers on the back of the phone which leads me to believe that they'll be up at the front kind of like boom sound which I'm hoping it lives up to and if you read the way they describe this audio on Red's page it seems like it should live up to that then at the bottom of the back of the phone you have these pins and they look a lot like what you see on the back of the Moto Z&amp;Z - this alludes to the modularity aspect so red cameras as you already know are already super modular via pins for the most part so you have all these attachable modules you can build a camera up from the base to be exactly how much or how little you want it based on your shooting scenario it's honestly an awesome system and I'm a big fan of it but it's also a pretty expensive one because red makes all of those accessories and they get to control exactly how much it costs because who else is going to make red accessories so this hydrogen one phone is planning on using those pins the back of the phone to become its own expanding modular system with some accessories that I assume we haven't seen it all yet because it have to be the size of a smartphone according to all the patents if you read through the Titan application all link it below the like button if you want to check it out and read it it looks like they want you to be able to build this up to be a full-on cine camera so you can see the diagram kind of how it looks attached to things looks like a full-blown lens mount on the back of this one a sensor mount and the patent also shows roughly what the front of the phone could look like so home button in the middle front facing speakers that leaks down at the bottom so that's good but then from the side the additional modules with HDMI and more ports and more pins looks really interesting you can see in this one the phone is all the way up at the front and then the modules attached via these pins on the back and they just kind of make it thicker while adding functionality and connectivity possibly a much bigger and better sensor for video and photos so we haven't actually seen any of these accessories in photos yet but we do know number one they'll be made specifically for this camera by red and number two they'll also probably be very extensive so bottom line it looks like this isn't going to be the smartphone for the average consumer obviously you know that from the 1200 or $1600 price but also the fact that most people aren't building up a smartphone to be nearly as thick as like a small mirrorless camera that don't have goals that are very different from a normal person plus toss in the completely insane sounding hydrogen a holographic display I mean it sounds like a lot but all that makes is a very unusual aspect so how do I feel about it honestly I'm optimistic I I think red knows what they're doing obviously they are incredible with image sensors and that tech and smartphones is something that I'm just kind of generally interested in but honestly there's so much good red stuff out there that I'm also a little bit terrified there's not that many companies that I would consider myself a serious fan of like I'm assuming you may argue that but I think Tesla is probably one of those and red I like pretty much everything red has ever made that I've ever used so if this phone isn't amazing in some way like every other red product I've used I'll be super disappointed but it's obviously as we've seen in the past really hard to be new in a smartphone game right now and make any sort of dent or impact even a company like red which is a huge multi-million dollar company has zero skin in the game right now and that's a big deal but I'm hoping this is the first of many successful projects that they dive into in this smaller modular game so good luck red I hope it's not just a Kickstarter and a money grab I hope it's a good developing product and project that we'll see in the future but that's just me let me know what you guys think would you be interested in getting this $1200 and red holographic smartphone let me know what you think thanks for watching I'll talk to guys the next one peace [Music] 
you like the iMac Pro don't you marques hey what's up guys I'm QB HD here and in my last video and that WWDC recap we talked a little bit about the brand new announced iMac pro and I kind of mentioned it possibly being a little bit of a trap and I want to elaborate on that a little bit so keep in mind this is a brand new product and it was announced but we're not actually going to see it until about six months down the road it's going to be in December of this year pretty rare move from Apple but this is until then everything we know is definitely true about the new iMac Pro so first off it's going to look from the outside like any other iMac but space gray so this behind me is the brand new 2017 KB Lake 27-inch iMac and it's a pretty high-end machine in a lot of ways by itself the iMac pro takes this shell this exact same body paints it matte black or Space Gray if you want to call it that and completely redoes all the inside so for the iMac pro CPU you'll be able to pick between an 8 core 10 core or 18 core workstation grade Intel Xeon CPU this will have turbo speeds up to four point five gigahertz out the box absolute monster chips it'll also have a choice between AMD Radeon Vega workstation GPUs which aren't even announced yet this event was basically an announcement for these graphics cards because you can't find them anywhere else it'll start at 32 gigs of ECC memory and will go up to 128 gigs of ram and it's all flash storage SSB only so it'll start at one terabyte of flash storage and go up to four terabytes of flash storage and it's fast flash storage at about three gigabytes per second throughput so awesome there and what's really interesting is the iMac Pro will have this new completely redesigned thermal architecture to make this all possible sounds a lot like the trashcan Mac Pro lots of workstation parts crammed into a small space with a completely new thermal architecture and new fans to make it all possible and then of course up front it'll also have this updated 5k display it's updated meaning it's a little bit brighter up to 500 nits it supports the entire p3 color gamut it's already a great display it's a little glossy for my tastes and we'll get to that in a little bit but it's already a pretty great 5k panel and then the ports on the back of the iMac are updated as well so you get your headphone jack you get an SD card slot 4 USB 3 ports 4 Thunderbolt 3 USB see ports and a 10 gig Ethernet port and back there you can also see the new events on the back that aren't on the backs of normal IMAX so some serious ventilation to go along with this new cooling system and then of the nice little touch the iMac Pro comes with some exclusive Space Gray accessories a matte grade trackpad a matte gray magic keyboard with a number-pad and a grey magic mouse to top it all off so should you buy it who is going to buy an iMac prep well first off this iMac this highest-end regular 2017 iMac is already a pretty high-end machine in a lot of ways like we've said and it's probably more power than most enthusiasts or casual users just buying an iMac ever really need the iMac pro leapfrogs all of this and it actually even leapfrogs the current trashcan Mac Pro in terms of power but then you have to expect a new modular Mac Pro coming next year to even leapfrog that and it's going to be modular so it's going to be way more upgradable down the line better expandability upgrade ability customization etc and the iMac pro isn't coming out till December like we said so by the time that comes out and you're getting your hands on it the new modular Mac Pro will be right around the corner and then second off Apple's made it pretty clear that the vast majority of people that are buying Apple desktops Apple Mac desktops or buying iMacs and that makes perfect sense to me what other choices do you have they have the Mac Mini pretty small not that powerful and not very popular you might have forgotten it existed and then you have Mac Pro a little more niche a little more expensive not a lot of people buying it so of course if you're buying a Mac for your desktop you're buying an iMac so with that logic Apple said alright you know what we want to make an even more powerful desktop for all these people who are pushing iMac to its limits you want an even more powerful workstation machine that's where the idea of I Mac Pro was born but the thing is those aren't the actual professionals most of the time and the people who chose the Mac Pro over the iMac chose it for a certain reason and those same people are most likely going to choose the new Mac Pro over the iMac Pro again so basically the question is what buyer is there is there a buyer that's going to want a more high-end machine a workstation grade Mac that's more powerful than the current iMac but can't wait for the new Mac Pro to come out a pretty impatient one basically and that's kind of why it seems like a trap basically I Mac Pro is in this really specific narrow target demographic then it's awkward space above the current iMac but where people are not getting the future Mac Pro they're kind of still okay with the all-in-one design I'm sure this thing will be great for all sorts of content creators for youtubers or for like photographers and people who like the current iMac and we're getting away with using that for all their editing that's still a great machine it's still a great display all that still remains but you have to know if you're in that target demographic or if you're just too impatient to wait for the new Mac Pro this thing will be an absolute beast I have no doubts about that that's supported by everything we see on paper the specs are awesome but the biggest downside for me with this thing is of course that it's not really upgradable just like the current IMAX it doesn't appear to have a Ram hatch like previous IMAX have so that's not upgradable and iFixit says that you can technically get to the CPU and change it if you want but most people won't be doing that so you're expected to live with the specs that you buy for the entire life of the machine and that's what separates it from the new modular Mac Pro that we're still expecting the 5k display is great you know but what if I want to upgrade to a not glossy display or maybe an 8k display a year or two down the road you know the GPUs are great but what if in a year or two GPUs I've gotten way better and I want to upgrade it to a newer better compatible one it's just that all in ones like the iMac have to be replaced all in one and it's kind of hard to get rid of an iMac Pro that starts at five thousand bucks when a couple new GPUs come out and that's just the starting price at $49.99 but with anyone guess what the highest end fully loaded iMac Pro will cost my guess will be it or be around $9,000 that's my guess maybe you can leave your guesses in the comments section below but that's pretty much it that's the iMac pro explained in a nutshell we have six months to see what it actually looks like until then thank you for watching talk to guys the next one [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm Kim PhD here and the day we've been waiting for is finally here the Samsung Galaxy s8 and s8 plus are officially revealed now say that a little bit ironically obviously because this phone was leaked everywhere but it's okay it's good to actually like see it in person now and feel it in the hand now that everything is officially official this is everything you need to know about this new phone first of all from the very beginning it was all about that display the design the lack of bezels just a jaw-dropping edge to edge nature of that front panel that's where Samsung went all in with this phone so the Galaxy s8 is rocking a 5.8 inch 20 960 by 1440 OLED display and the SI plus is rocking a 6.2 inch OLED with the same resolution so that's extremely sharp and that's an 18 and a half by 9 aspect ratio for those counting so it's a little bit taller even than the 2 by 1 aspect ratio from the LG G 6 so these are huge displays and very tall resolutions but of course the footprint of these phones when you compare them something with a more traditional larger bezel it's awesome it fits in the footprint of a phone with a way smaller screen they're calling it the infinity display I'm calling it like the almost bezel look look I can call whatever you want I really like it now it's not a completely new concept the galaxy s7 edge had the display glass melting over the edges already last year but for some reason that phone's edges always felt kind of sharp to me never really got quite comfortable with it but the s8 edges here feel much softer they're much more seamless feeling than before which no doubt took a lot of careful Engineering and then of course they push the display further up to the top and further towards the bottom of the phone by getting rid of the physical buttons and replacing them with soccer buttons so ok finally Samsung is actually now switching from Hardware buttons on the bottoms and the Chin's of all their phones to the software on screen buttons that's great I love them but what does that mean we lose by switching well first of all Samsung software buttons are not pretty I mean maybe it's just me but I think they're pretty ugly and they're also out of order like the back button should still be on the left but luckily we can reorder these buttons in the software to switch the order if we want we can't change the way they look but there's that and you also lose a physical home button which had the fingerprint reader on it on the last bone so the fingerprint reader now here moves up to the back of the phone and way up by the camera this one is kind of a stretch and actually don't mind you know fingerprint readers on the backs of phones like on the pixel excel for example when I'm holding my phone in a normal reading position the fingerprint reader is actually easily reachable so I don't mind that it's in the middle of the back but do you stretched out Samsung phones are a little bit taller so even with my big hands holding the s8 in a normal position puts the fingerprint reader just a little bit out of reach so I have to stretch a bit to find it and then with the si plus again when it's way up at the top of the phone like this if I just hold it normally and I turn the phone over it's like completely out of place and if I try to find it blind there's not really a big indentation to know exactly where it is so it's definitely something that's going to take some getting used to many people I think will need to use two hands with this in fact in the official Samsung commercial that dude does it with two hands so that fingerprint reader placement is a little odd but I think everything else about this hardware Samsung pretty much headed out the park this finally feels like a 2017 or even 2020 feature Estate smartphone design in the seamless beautiful type of way that we dream of but without sacrificing really any functionality or features it's still thin and pretty lightweight phone it still has USB type-c at the bottom with fast charging it still has a headphone jack it's still fully ip68 water-resistant still has wireless charging still has a micro SD card slot for expandable storage and with all that sandwiched between the sheets of metal and glass the Galaxy s8 will also have pretty much some of the best specs you can find in any Android phone so Snapdragon 835 four gigs of ram first one in the world with bluetooth 5.0 and it brings iris scanner also back from the dead from that galaxy note seven my only question mark here is the battery the only difference between the s8 and the s8 plus is not any features it's just the physical size so the displays are different and the battery sizes are different its 3000 milliamp hours on the galaxy s 8 and 3500 milliamp hours on the s8 plus and a 3000 milliamp hour battery can seem decent maybe little bit small but the number one draw of battery on a phone is the display and it's so easy to forget while holding that this is a five point eight inch display it's huge so a three thousand milliamp hour battery on a five point eight inch display not really too sure if that's going to hold up and then same thing with the bigger one the si plus is a thirty five hundred million entire battery which seems pretty decent size but it's a six point two inch display not a lot of six point two inch display phones out there and it's also a super high res super-bright display I mean that's going to be a big draw that's definitely something we're gonna be testing for the full review now the camera is on the back of this phone as far as I can tell are the same as the galaxy s7 from last year so 12 megapixel camera F 1.7 aperture optical image stabilization the whole deal its high-end and that's not a bad thing at all that was a really good camera but obviously that's not exactly pushing the limits here it's just a pretty safe bet that will do just fine and then of course there's the software a lot of people have mixed feelings about this stuff including me obviously I like stock Android and this is not that this is Samsung's UX on top of Android 7.0 with all their slightly redesigned colorful icons and launcher and everything here it feels fine with the hardware they have a new set of wallpapers to look pretty great on this display and the home screen icons and widgets are a little tweaked but overall it's nothing drastically different from before there are some neat tricks up its sleeve like there's this button that shows up when you're watching YouTube videos full screen that basically lets you do what the iPad does and punch in a little bit to fill the display if you really hate the black bars on the side your call obviously you can still rearrange the software buttons at the bottom like I said I'm sure we'll find even more stuff when we get to playing with this phone even more but the biggest new software feature of the Galaxy s8 is actually its personal assistant called Bixby and to me it's a little bit confusing just the way it exists on the phone at least two users I think so Bixby does all the same things that Google assistant does but by Samsung instead of by Google so you can it'll show you a bunch of cards in an order that's relevant to you so it tries to show you information that it thinks is important before you need it it's really similar to Google now and what Google does with the cards you access it by swiping over from your home screen just like Google and Bixby even has its own freaking button on the side of the phone look power button on one side then volume rocker and Bixby button on the other side that's a big commitment not to be fair there are a bunch of other like image recognition and context recognition things that they claimed Bixby could do but they couldn't show us any of these things that's going to be launching with the phone but the funny thing is this is still an Android phone it's still Android 7.0 which means it still also has Google assistant on the phone if you long press the home button sure enough you get Google assistant popping right out so it's weird I got this s voice rebooted type of vibe with those two things doing the same thing existing next to each other on the phone it's kind of a weird thing obviously we all know how s voice went down and I really hope that this isn't as bad as s voice will give it the benefit of the doubt we'll see when it launches but until then that's just kind of across your fingers and hope type of thing so overall as a package the Galaxy s8 is pretty impressive promising I might even say to me it looks like Samsung really picked their battles with this one there are certain areas where they clearly really want it to go all out and push the boundaries the design the display and it shows and it's up on the outside of the phone but other areas where they're definitely not pushing forward too hard are also pretty obvious the camera the battery it has an entire phone I'm pretty optimistic for the Galaxy s8 so there you have it that's everything that you need to know with this new flagship it's coming out on April 21st that's when you can be able to get it feel free to share this video with anyone you think might be interested in this bahama new flagship will actually probably hopefully not bomb and I mean might be the bomb but like not the bomb in that way you know I mean I think you know to me thanks for watching expect a full review of this phone obviously talk to you as the next one pays [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm can be HD here from Google i/o 2017 and i/o is definitely a little bit different every year but it's a Developer Conference for people who use Google software and for all the developers of apps that run on that software so while there is no new hardware there's no pixel to or anything crazy like that happening here there is a lot of googly software a lot of machine learning and image recognition and all that fun stuff that will eventually make it into the devices that we have now so there's definitely some stuff to pay attention to this is my top 5 announcements from Google i/o 2017 so number one is Google lense and I do feel like something like this would make a comeback so so much of like what I said this stuff at this conference is stuff like computer vision and machine learning and image recognition and this is a perfect example of a culmination of all that so Google lense is a new capability that will start showing up in assistant and photos and others that'll let you point your camera at an object and get more information about that object now if that sounds familiar that's because it is we've had stuff like Google Goggles from way back in 2010 believe it or not and then stuff in between like 60 etc but the technology has gotten a lot better since 2010 so this is actually almost a completely different product now Google lense and assistant is so good you can point it out a flower and it'll tell you not only that it's a flower but what kind of flower it is or if you're walking down the street and point lens at a restaurant because Google Maps knows where you are image recognition is pretty easy to overlay info about the place you're looking at and even more awesome you can point lens at the bottom of a router that's sticker you know where it says the username and the password and the SSN and it'll log you in instead of having to type it all out so google lens looks awesome and well it's not out right now I think if it ends up looking and working as well as it did in those videos then it should be pretty dope so number 2 is Google assistant and first things first Google assistant is now available on the iPhone so it's on my iPhone I got in the App Store you can get a two right now and this is the exact same assistant it works the exact same way as it does on my pixel or any other Android phone so that's awesome and there's even some iPhone specific optimization since obviously you can't hold down the home button to get to it that's worth serious so you make a widget to put right next to your home screen to launch the assistant to get right to talking to it you can scroll up to see your history of things you've asked for in the past which is cool and then you can also even type questions to it so if you're in a quiet place and you don't have the space to ask things out loud to it you can type what you want to know and hit Send and it will answer hopefully I've coming to the Android version soon and then the other news is now Google assistant will hopefully be in way more places really soon thanks to the SDK becoming available to third-party developers so the example they use on stage is literally pulling up Google assistant and telling it you just want some Panera and instead of it telling you what Panera is near you it actually pulls up the menu lets you pick exactly what you want to eat and orders delivery so that's pretty awesome so we're starting to see Google assist in a lot more places it went from being this pixel only thing to being an Android only thing to being much more widely available and that's kind of what Google i/o is all about number three is Android oh and you're probably you're probably familiar with Android oh because I readied a video about it probably watch my top five features on Android Oh video if you haven't I'll link that below that's where a lot of the main stuff is but I oh they have announced that it's graduated from a developer preview to a beta so now it's available in the beta Channel anyone with a pixel or a nexus can download it and you can check out a couple of new features that have also made it to this version one thing I really like is the picture-in-picture mode which is sort of like while you're doing one thing you can continue doing that in the background and move to another thing and just hit the home button to continue multitasking you get a floating window that continues your background tab so while you're watching a YouTube video you can hit home and open up a Notes app and start taking notes while the video plays along you're done you can literally just swipe it away there's also something called notification dots kind of like something you would see in iOS where you have those little badges for a notification icon notification dots are the same way they'll indicate on an app on your home screen where you have notifications so to check that notification you can either pull down in the tray like normal or you can actually long press that app icon on the home screen to look at it and that'll give you the same information so android o is coming along pretty nicely we should see the full final version of it and probably get a name for it sometime this summer but it's got a couple other little features like improved autofill better-looking emojis that are redesigned all kinds of faster beat x things like that so but if you want to see the full 5 apps new features about Android oh of course you should watch not vidya so number four is google photos so you may or may not use this but the improvements to it in the last year I've gotten really good and they're pretty much all in the space of machine learning and AI so it already organizes your photos just by things that's recognized in them it recognizes that faces the locations places you took them the landmarks in the background all sorts of things like that now just making that information more available to you so there's something called suggested sharing where it recognizes faces in your photos and essentially suggests that you share those photos with the people that are in them there's also shared libraries which can automatically share every photo you take of your kids for example with your partner and possibly the coolest one is some automatic photo manipulation now this isn't just like the little filters it adds to your photo apparently if this works well it'll let you literally remove obstructions from the front of the photo the example they showed on stage was incredible I hope it works that well but again we have to see alright so number five last but not least is Google home again you may or may not have one of these but it's getting some improvements that are improving it well too one is called proactive assistance so you know how Google now sometimes gives you little notifications telling you there's a traffic incident on your normal route or something that kind of thinks you might want to know ahead of time well now Google home will also be able to do that but since it doesn't have a display it'll do that with the lights on the top so now when you see it lighting up by itself you can just ask what's up and it will tell you that news there's also hands-free calling come onto Google home which I think it's pretty awesome and also long overdue and now can even start showing responses to questions that require a visual response on your TV or your phone so before it wouldn't make sense to ask Google home a question like show me my calendar because there's no display obviously but now since it's smart enough to connect to your TV or your phone it will show that response on a device with the display which is pretty convenient so that's pretty much it thank you for watching our little recap of Google i/o 2017 feel free to share this with other people who you think might want to know what was announced today and don't want to watch the to our keynote or you can watch the to our keynote I'll link that below as well but uh that's pretty much it thank you for watching and I thought see has the next one peace all right I want to ask you both what was you seemed like the entire day wonky no now you have lunch in you and outcomes with your favorite new thing so my you cooked favorite there anything sure yeah for me Google n yes you know I love the fact that we see a lot of stops and lets out humans taken a lot of information so to be able to point things that stuff you're interested in finding more about it he's pretty cool yeah I think Android go you know I ought to you actually one consumer one and one developer one is that cheating that's kind of cheating that do what I want okay cool Android go you know it's a new configuration of Angela or the one give your left crowd and it's important and when we really want to make that experience great and then Kotlin which is the developer thing it's of new language you hear the crowd allowed a lot of time it's a good developer conference so you get the get the crowd going with absolutely those are my favorite 
if electric cars are the future then luxury electric cars are the future of luxury right hey what's up guys I'm kitty HD here and I spent today with a completely unreleased future electric car called the lucid air and the team behind it to take the closest look at it yet and just to learn what the deal is with this car and the future of electric cars and I learned a lot now we're already familiar with Tesla and what they make and how that works you can check out my videos about them if you haven't already lucid err claims to be in a lot of ways kind of similar to that but with a few tricks of the police so the exterior is pretty familiar all the way from the miniature sized mock-ups all the way to the life-size one to one clay models they showed me it has its own unique look you could say it's not a hatchback so it looks a lot more like a big sedan than a crossover and they do their best to look a little more modern I think too extreme but it's a little sleeker the mirrors on the sides are a little smaller a little sleeker looking the low profile wheels kind of remind me of the BMW i8 how the door handles are completely embedded in the doors with push to unlock and there is extra lights around here and there even bar headlights and tail lights one of the most eye-catching features actually from the promo video those headlights groundbreaking technology we're actually not motorized in the prototype that we got to use which made me sad basically I can only cross my fingers that who knows maybe it'll actually make it to the final version but the exterior as clean as it is is definitely not the reason people are interested in the lucid err that would be the interior one of the biggest complaints with Tesla actually is the interior just doesn't feel luxury enough for some people I mean it was never a problem for me but the other people coming from you know BMWs and high-end Mercedes and Porsches were actually kind of disappointed with the interior of the Tesla and pointed at that as being one of the biggest flaws for the price lucid air is really attacking that luxury feel 100% they're going all out with material choices the layout of the displays the look and feel of everything - overall make the experience of sitting in the car especially in the backseat as dope as possible the first of all inside as the driver of front naturally you have a lot of control at your fingertips so as soon as you sit in the driver's seat you have three displays surrounding you a touchscreen all the way up to the left with a bunch of vehicle controls the heads-up display right behind the steering wheel with the most important information like your speed and the battery percentage or maybe possibly the most beautiful charging indicator status I've ever seen and then another touchscreen to the right of that with smart systems things like navigation and contacts etc it kind of makes sense that a high-tech vehicle from the future has this many pixels laid out in front of you but they seem smartly laid out and they have the features that are sort of complementing each other in the right spots in the car and on top of all of that there's another touchscreen a center console where you can display navigation info and third-party apps and all kinds of stuff like that but it's a little down and out of the way so you can hide it at any time with a push of a button that actually reveals more center storage so seems to be a pretty solid balance between physical controls and touchscreen controls for things that you do with the vehicle everyday from the front seat and then the second thing you'll notice as a driver or anyone in the parentheses is the windshield it is awesome it reminds me of what Tesla did with the Model X the glass stretches basically from the hood right up all the way over your head to behind you so it's just one big pane of glass so it's just light flooding in you can see everything it's kind of how the Lucid air got its name it creates a very open airy experience where you can see all around you and I guarantee that when this car is driving itself in a couple of years they'll be that much cooler just looking around it'll be a lot of fun to be a passenger but there are some differences between this and the Model X first off is that t column down the middle that you can see that holds an LED light strip is the ambient light and the rear-view mirror and the Sun shades and a second thing a switch for the electrochromic shading that will tint the ceiling from nearly transparent all the way to almost completely opaque now unfortunately this is also still in development and they couldn't show it to me working but it seems to me that that would be really cool and also really expensive if you ever got a crack in your windshield but either way it's awesome to be able to look up at any time and the weight is transparent you can see you know not just the clouds but even skyscrapers when you're going through the city or the stars and light since it's completely clear really cool stuff to be sitting in the front seat of the car and then you get to the backseat and that is where it gets real the backseat of the Lucid air is these jet like bucket seats with tons of legroom and Headroom with all that glass over your head still it just keeps sweeping back and the premium materials and the armrest and vents are all still there you even get your own little console in the middle with climate control and seat recline controls and on top of that this isn't just your average seat back recline this is like you're not gonna want to call Shotgun in this car you're going to want to sit in the back seat these back seats recline way back so so far back it kind of feels like a lie flat on an airplane when you're all the way back you're just kind of looking up at a clear pane of glass so you can sit back and basically just stare at the sky for a long car ride as a passenger that definitely feels like the future the biggest sacrifice for the seats this far back is definitely the trunk space for the size of the car and all its advantages maybe has one of the smaller trunks I've ever seen in a large sedan but lucid also does have a regular bench backseat version of this car that feels a little less luxury but gets a lot of the trunk space back so you know a little bit of a fair trade there that will probably sell a lot more in the US and there's also a sizable front trunk in this car that's a lot bigger actually than the one that's in the Tesla as well so there's a lot of cool stuff going on for the Lucid air as an idea and as a product the fact that this company lucid motors exists and is making a statement like trying to make a product like this is really interesting to me whether it actually comes out or not it sheds a lot of light on what it looks like people are going to want from a car in the future which doesn't just have to be a good driving car but also has to be a good ride-sharing car and a good self-driving car etc so it's silent huge spacious open airy high-tech and oh by the way happens to have a thousand horsepower and ridiculous performance because electric cars can do that nice so what do you think is this the future of luxury I know I'm not against it and I'm definitely rooting for companies like this to succeed to be able to provide competition and make what we already have gets better so let me know what you guys think of the air thanks for watching this one I'll talk to guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what's up guys I'm Kapiti here and this is the samsung galaxy s 9 plus as a couple days after the announcement we've had our chance to sort of soak it in and think about it for a little bit and it's become pretty clear actually that it seems like this whole event this announcement was saved from being called the exact same phone as last year by one major feature upgrade the camera so that's what we're all kind of looking at right now so while we have it before it actually comes out let's take a deeper look at what exactly will make this phone apparently different from every other phone out there let's take a deep look at the camera so the galaxy s 9 has a single 12 megapixel optically stabilized camera with a variable aperture and the galaxy s 9 plus we have here has dual cameras so the same primary camera and an additional secondary 2x telephoto camera fixed at F 2.4 so the biggest change obviously at least on paper is that valuable aperture so as I mentioned briefly in my impressions video of this phone with a couple exceptions pretty much every single smartphone camera out there is a fixed aperture lens which means the aperture doesn't change it doesn't open or close they're letting in a certain amount of light every time to hit that sensor and most new phones are around F 2.0 sometimes F 1.9 or F 1.8 pixel to one of the best smartphone cameras ever has a fixed F 1.8 aperture lens so the galaxy s 9 has this dual aperture lens it can physically switch between F 1.5 wide open which is incredible or F 2.4 depending on how much light is in the scene so basically it'll shoot almost everything at F 2.4 by default and auto but when you get down to about a hundred Lux Samsung says which is actually pretty low light it'll open up wide to F 1.5 but if you ever actually want to make sure you're using one aperture or the other you can go into pro mode and that is where one of the toggles is 1.5 or 2.4 now as far as the difference between the photos I'm still evaluating that but I have started taking back-to-back photos with the f15 and f2 4 and I've shared some on Twitter already so you can make that call if you see a difference right now I think showing them back-to-back is what makes it more obvious but the full analysis will be in the review for sure so that is a pretty promising new development with the camera that we're messing with but definitely not all that's new also new and the camera is an improved composite HDR mode so it's now taking 12 frames and turning in photos with great dynamic range and reduced noise and better contrast that's all in Auto HDR though so you don't have to do anything special for that there's also the whole new sliding UI of the camera kind of like what we've been seeing in the iPhone for years I think it's definitely an improvement it kind of encourages you to swipe around and explore all the different modes that you might not have even known have existed in the samsung camera app for years and one of the most important ones is of course this pro mode not a whole ton to say about it of then it keeps getting better you can change pretty much everything here so if you're in photography you know your shutter speed ISO manual focus white balance and even of course that toggle for switching manually between f15 and f2 for that's what I've been using to take the back-to-back comparison shots but also new with the camera is this super slow-motion video mode now if you jump into the camera settings there's actually already a ton of video frame rates to choose from you can shoot at 4k 30 or 4 k 60 frames per second you can shoot quad HD or 1080p even super wide screen at 18 and a half by 9 and there's also a high efficiency video codec you can toggle on or off and you might have also heard about 1080p at 240 frames per second but that's actually hidden by default it's strangely difficult to find you have to go into the camera settings edit camera modes and on the rear camera and then you got a tick regular slow motion for some reason it's unchecked and hidden by default online but when you do that's where the 1080p 240 FPS is the more you know but what we're really interested in of course is that new 960 frames per second at 720p other phones have done this there's been so many phones to do near a thousand frames a second but this is new to Samsung so this will turn a zero point two second video clip into a six second smooth video also it will only record for 0.2 seconds so here's how it works first of all it crops in a lot so you're gonna have to backup for your framing be prepared for that and then there's two ways to do it manually or automatically because it's super hard to time something that's that fast to press the shutter button at the exact right moment and you can try and that's what manual mode is for but that might take a while to get the perfect action but the automatic mode is pretty cool it puts a box on the screen that you can move around and then you hit start and it'll wait until something some movement enters that box to trigger the super slow motion so you can get some pretty cool clips if you place the box perfectly where you expect to action to happen it's not bad alright next up in the camera is something called a our emoji I like I said in that impressions video it's basically an emoji but not as good this one relies entirely on the front-facing camera no extra depth sensors or anything like that and it's closer to like snapchats bitmoji than anything else but it's so worse than that so you take a picture of yourself and it analyzes it for like a minute or so and then turns you into a sort of a animated character and then you can further customize your character to look just like you kinda unless they don't have your hair and then you have your air emoji it's pretty creepy if I'm being honest but I I didn't actually appreciate how smooth and accurate Apple's an emoji was until I went back after this and tried it again and it's like way better but I don't see many people using AR emoji past the first few days or two maybe just for fun but you know here it is it exists now so the last thing it's new at this camera is Bixby vision so yes Bixby is still a big part of Samsung's efforts but also a Bixby vision can probably be pushed in a software update to other things like the note and the s8 but this is what's new with that you go into the camera app and you see this little eye you click the eye and it'll go into this sort of recognition mode where it can offer a couple different things QR codes those are pretty self-explanatory it'll read those wines will literally read wine bottles and tell you more about them very specific places will identify where you're at and you can look around sort of find nearby places and landmarks and then shopping will try to identify a product by related product shots it finds on the internet and then lets you maybe buy them images just tries to reverse image search whatever you're looking at to find out what it is so the closest thing to what you're looking at on google images text is pretty interesting it uses Google Translate and will live translate any text in front of you which could actually be helpful in real life and the makeup section which just switches to the front-facing camera and puts makeup on you lets you try a bunch of different products and then gives you a link to buy them directly and that's it that is everything that is new with the galaxy s 9s camera and the s 9 plus it still has all the old stuff it still has live focus with the dual cameras for taking portrait mode shot still has some of the stickers and things but that's that's your camera reimagined now this isn't the full review of the whole phone so we'll wait till then to put conclusions on everything and see if it's actually worth it all but you could probably come to a lot of conclusions yourself I mean looking at sample photos we already know this is going to be one of the top smartphone cameras of this year it's just a matter of whether it falls at number one or number two or number three but stay tuned to places like Twitter and Instagram where all be posting sample photos as I take them and as I use this phone more coming up to the full review but until then thanks for watching talk to you the next one peace 
[Music] hey what is up guys MTV HD here and yes first things first we have already made a video about all the things we think we know about iPhone 8 all the rumors all rounded up in one place so the things we think we might know the things we may not know some really interesting stuff in there I will leave that link below but this this is taking it to the next level so this has happened before but this is a model actual physical in hand representation of all these leaks and rumors and everything we know about the next iPhone and what we're expecting of it so this is something like what case manufacturers might get their hands on to start to design their iPhone 8 cases and start to prototype their iPhone accessories this is all the physical dimensions and everything based on what we know so thanks to Sonny Dixon again for helping us get our hands on this but I figured I'd get a little bit more in depth with it since we actually have one now so right off the bat first thing you notice of course is the display which has some really awesome edge to edge action but also has some interesting top sensor protrusion going on coming down from the top you may have seen this in the latest leak where the home pod firmware had a little bit of a silhouette developers found that represents the next iPhone and it has this indentation at the top for these front-facing sensors it looks a little bit weird in the glyphs but seeing it in real life this is what it would look like and honestly still looks a little bit funky but now that you see how the display kind of wraps around that bar with the rounded edges everywhere it still looks really interesting reminds me of the renders of the essential phone actually which we have also yet to see in person but obviously this is what it looks like my biggest question is what Apple plans to do with the software you know will they put stuff up there in the top corners maybe battery to one side the signal strength to the other side and then notifications in the middle whatever they do it'll be really interesting to see but obviously the bigger story with this model is literally the screen to body ratio this has always been a weakness of the iPhone it's 20:17 bezels are shrinking the iPhone has had a massive forehead and chin and even side bezels forever iPhone 7 plus had a 5.5 inch display this year but it's still one of the biggest phone bodies on the market iPhone 8 model has what measures up to be a five point seven to five point eight inch diagonal but in a smaller body so this is a big deal for the modernization of iPhone design for sure smaller body more handheld more pocketable so thanks to some After Effects magic this is what the display on the front of the iPhone might look like when it's on with iOS 11 again not really sure exactly what they do with the status bar up top we play around this for a bit but you can see it gets a lot closer to that 2017 ceiling of just holding a display in your hands will be more breakable and fragile because of this design you know getting closer to the corners of course but let's be really worth it and people are kind of breaking their phones anyway so now for some other quick things you may notice about this body number one is the glass back so the iPhones up to this point have had these metal backs which of course feel and look super premium but of course don't support wireless charging wireless charging doesn't work through metal this iPhone 8 model has a glass back very similar to what we've seen in Samsung phones like the galaxy s 8 and Note so you can support wireless charging but keep the metal on the sides and still keep that premium feel in the hand the other thing is the camera bump on the back is of course still there it's pretty big but of course this is what we've been seeing for months now and leaks about the new iPhone new orientation for the camera sensors flash in the middle and between them and hopefully these new cameras get a spec bump to go with that big camera bump and take some more awesome photos and videos with this new year the power button on the side is something I noticed it's in the same place but it is a little bit bigger which is interesting because of the rumor that Apple might try to stick a fingerprint reader in the power button this year since they couldn't get it to work under the display in time but the most recent info suggests that this will be a normal power button and Apple will go all out with 3d facial recognition for unlocking your phone securely allegedly that can be just as safe if not more so than the fingerprint but you already know I'm gonna be testing that and then yeah just the overall premium look and feel of this model it's way nicer than early renders obviously just like it ended up being every year the glass even kind of has this 3d curve right at the edges sort of melts into the side rail so it's smooth around there it's smooth to hold but that is pretty much it and honestly this is as close as we're going to get to seeing the next iPhone shorter stolen actually leaking the phone in person but I let me know what you think is this something you would rock in 2017 and 2018 as iPhone 8 maybe share this video with your friends who are interested in seeing what iPhone 8 will look like but until then that's been it thank you for watching talk to guys the next one peace [Music] 
[Music] hey what is up guys I'm kitty HD here and in this box is one of the least anticipated new Apple products in a long time it was announced back in June of 2017 and it's been a couple months it got delayed now it's February of the next year 2018 and it's finally shipping and it's in our hands it's the home pod and now that it's here let's see what it's all about [Music] [Applause] [Music] so this is Apple's entry into the sort of a newish smart speaker market it's pretty late obviously but this is what they've come up with it's a 350 dollar tissue box sized mesh cylinder that actually has some really excellent hardware so setting it up is pretty simple it has that w1 chip inside so you just get your iPhone somewhere near it and it shows up on your screen you name what room it's in and then you set it up in about a minute like the air Potts did so that's definitely the Apple advantage for easy pairing and setup of an accessory the weird thing is it didn't add it to my iMac or other computers as a speaker I kind of wish I could have tried to use the home pod as a speaker for my iMac but you can't oh well classic Apple but the hardware is clean and super Apple II especially this white one it's just this fabric bulb that sits in your living room or on a table or wherever you decide to put it a little screen up in the circle at the top and all that has is your volume controls and a little Siri indicator that lights up when you're using it the cable as you've probably seen is built in it's technically removable with like a lot of effort so it's pretty clear Apple doesn't want you doing that that's more for like a technician working on it after the fact but most other speakers have removable cables so that's kind of interesting this one is a high quality sleeved cable though so I'm not mad and if you ever pick up and hold a home pod because of the 3d fabric it's kind of squishy just a little I don't know why it ever pick up a speaker but it's true the one weird thing that with this hardware is it kind of has this seam on it it's not easy to see but you can kind of make it out it's on a different place on my two different home pods so I honestly have no idea why it's there you would think they would always put that seam on the back by the cord instead of on the side maybe I'm just being picky I don't know I've seen some tear downs but I'm sure Jerry rigged everything we'll have an answer for us soon enough on why that seam is there but once it's set up there's a lot of talk about the things home pod can do versus what it can't do it's supposed to be a smart speaker and I say it's supposed to be and I put it in air quotes because there's a lot of things that when you compare it to Google home or Amazon Alexa it just doesn't do but the things it does do it does really well and really quickly so the inside of pod is a little different it's seven tweeters all facing out from the middle and one woofer at the top firing upwards so in theory is creating this sort of at 360 degrees sound that you can hear the same from any direction around the home pod and then it also does this bit of analysis using six built-in microphones to figure out how close it is to things around like a wall or an open space it analyzes that space and then it adjusts the levels to sound best from every angle no matter where you are so it's kind of like this smart sound analysis mostly to not overwhelm me with bass but the home pod isn't overly bass heavy in the first place it's super balanced it does great instrument separation and honestly it overall sounds excellent especially for the size it's only a little bigger than a normal Google home which I think a lot of people forget about it's really small but it gets really loud I've listened to a lot of different music on these different smart speakers lately and this is in fact the best sounding one some people have debated about it versus Google home max the home max gets louder for sure at a hundred percent volume it's almost too loud but it also distorts a lot at that volume and the bass is overwhelming so you pretty much have to go outside to enjoy it that loud home pod does not get as loud but at a hundred percent volume it sounds really really good and again its unique being that sort of a circular 360-degree sound and most people put a speaker that's pretty directional near a wall or a corner anyway but you kind of get an extra bit of confidence if you can put this on a table or anywhere in a room and it'll sound just as good hey Siri play alta sure here's a personalized station abouta so the array of microphones listening for your voice is excellent it can hear you pretty much all the time from across the room when music is playing loud it's been great at that but again what it comes down to is what home pod can do and what home pod can't do it can play music through Apple music so you can ask Siri to play a song or playlist or play the radio and if you're an Apple music subscriber it's hooked up to your iPhone and it'll work but let's say you're one of the 70 million people who uses Spotify and not Apple music yes technically it can work kinda you can airplay from Spotify to a home pod but then your voice controls don't work as well you can't ask first certain song or a certain playlist you can go forward and backwards in your tracklist but that's about it it's not ideal but from their home pod can do pretty much anything Siri does so if you want to ask it questions like who is this person how tall is this person some weather trivia some spelling your classic things like that it can handle that you can also set reminders so if you ask it to take out the garbage at three o'clock it'll do that and it'll set a reminder in your reminders app on your iPhone hey Siri who's James Harden James Harden currently plays shooting guard for the Rockets hey Siri how tall is he James Harden is six feet five inches tall hey Siri what's the weather in Honolulu tomorrow the forecast is calling for thunderstorms in Honolulu Hawaii tomorrow the high will be 78 degrees and the low will be 66 it can also read your last text message out loud or send a text and we'll get to that in a second but it also can turn on and off homekit enabled lights it can connect to Evernote it's about it but here's what it can't do so for all the great microphones that are in home pod it can hear my voice from across the room it can't distinguish my voice from your voice so if you have a home podding you've been watching this video i've probably triggered your as multiple times because it thinks we're all one voice so that means anyone who's in the room with you and your home pod can ask it to read your texts out loud or send a text message for you because it thinks it's you so if you're not into that you definitely want to uncheck this show personal info tab either during the setup or after the setup you can change it but that's just a weird quirk about home pod you would think with mics so good and with Apple software so good it should be able to tell our voices apart home pod also cannot ever connect to anything that's not an iPhone it can't be used as a Bluetooth speaker and there's no audio jacks so you can't plug anything in to use its audio quality for anything other than an iPhone you also cannot set Spotify as your default music player anytime you ask it to play something via your voice it will have to be Apple music you cannot connect two of them together as a stereo pair yet that's apparently I've heard coming in a software update but as of right now you can connect to Google home maxes together as a stereo pair doesn't happen with home pod yet you can't order products online you can't food online you can't call an uber or a lift with it you can't have it read calendar events or set any calendar events you can't set multiple timers at the same time only one at a time which seems like something you would do in a kitchen with a smart speaker you can't have it make phone calls by your voice again that's something you have to setup on your phone and then airplay to the home pod you can't look up a recipe you can't use Find My Phone the list goes on and on there's so many things at home pod when you compared to other smart speakers just doesn't do so in conclusion home pod is a weird product it's 349 bucks right now which means you can compare it to other smart speakers like Google home or Amazon Alexa or some other dedicated speaker systems like Sonos it sounds better than any other Bluetooth speaker it sounds better than the other smart speakers and honestly it sounds better than a lot of the dedicated sound systems like a Sonos the audio engineering that went into this thing the clarity the instrument separation the bass response the 360-degree sound is next-level the engineers should be proud of this but in terms of smartness smartness Siri versus Alexa or Google home not even close so you've probably heard this conclusion before but if you're in the Apple ecosystem meaning you use an iPhone you use Siri a lot and you're an Apple music subscriber then this is the best sounding smart speaker that you can get but in most cases honestly you're gonna be better off buying a much smarter speaker that can do way more that sounds almost as good it really feels like getting a home pod right now and using it a lot just magnifies everything that's wrong with Siri and all series shortcomings so the engineering team that made it sound so good they should totally make a separate $350 Apple speaker with a headphone jack that anyone can connect to and that would do well in some competitive world but for now if you're in the market for a smart speaker I'd say shop around watch some other reviews this isn't the first choice until then thanks for watching talk to guys the next one taste
