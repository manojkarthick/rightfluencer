hey everyone so I just got out of the shower if you could not tell why like I I showed it in my PR hall like a huge power hall and debate was myself it wasn't actually a power package but I just showed it in that video a whole lot like my book from Sephora and basically what I did is I went through each category and I bought the highest user rated so like customer rated beauty products in each categories so these are supposed to be like fan favorites and everything however I just went on the website and half of them are different now because obviously it depends on how many reviews are on there at the time so some of these are no longer like the highest rated so if it's completely my bed I was supposed to film this like a month ago or something like that but obviously haven't over to Germany and I've had a lot of stuff happening so I apologize that this is super late if you do enjoy this video regardless I will look do another one maybe on like the lowest rated products or something like that and I'll do it a lot faster so that it's way more relevant but I thought I might as well still try this out because you know at one point in time these were all the highest rated products on each category on Sephora rated by the customers so I'm gonna see if they're actually good and if I agree with the reviews and I will look at each product on the Sephora website and read you a couple of the reviews on what people say as well so we can kind of see if I agree with the people's reviews okay so at one point in time a month or two ago this prime note was the highest user rated at primer on the website the thing is I only had a few reviews but it was the highest rated so it's what I picked up obviously if there's Atlas reviews and you know if only three people rate at five-star it's obviously gonna pop up near the top where is you know an amazing primer that maybe has 30,000 reviews and it only comes out as like a four stars obviously gonna pop up underneath so it's totally not even accurate so that's part of the fun right like that's part of the fun so this now has four stars on Sephora which is still really good so this is called the bare minerals combo control and milky face primer it says step up your makeup routine with a promise specifically formulated for skins needs helps to even out skin texture preparing it for a smoother foundation application and longer lasting of with no key to powder texture dries to a natural finish contains a special extract to absorb oil and reduce the appearance of pause and specifically formulated to absorb oil in the t-zone and maintain skin's moisture balance so it kind of sounds like it would be okay for most skin types someone said it controls their shine someone said it makes this can it feel super smooth even if they aren't wearing makeup someone else is it's beautiful oily skin someone have somebody gave it to sty so those people will find this person gave it two stars saying it's nothing special it makes them mad for a few hours and then they're back oily and then the other person said nothing special three stars and they just sit as average it's not good it's not bad so let's try it sorry if this video is really long I feel like there's a lot of information this is the packaging it's just like a normal like chew of like just what about oh it's a very like liquidy I guess that makes sense milky oh it feels quite nice it feels quite thick which is weird because it looks very runny but when you massage it in it feels like it's really filling in your pores and I do have a history of liking at v-- and minerals Primus so I hope I do like this one it feels quite hydrating but it still feels like it's kind of blurring my skin you know what it actually feels a lot like that wet and wild primer that I used in my drugstore full face first impression video I'll link it down below which kind of ended up being a massive mess okay regardless I feel like this make my skin look amazing it looks so beautiful I can see why someone would use it with no makeup so now let's try it with some foundation on top so the foundation I have is the Tom Ford a traceless foundation SPF 15 30 mil and I got the shape for hopefully it matches me today I put a bit of fake tan on so let's see what people have to say about this product this is an online exclusive it costs $85 and it sold out in most of the colors so it must be pretty good if it's sold out and it has five star reviews but it only has six reviews so one person said it lasts a good six hours without you nyet touch-ups and they live in a really humid hot area someone else said it gives a really good coverage while not looking too cakey it does look traceless they said it's a traceless foundation so hopefully it doesn't look too hippy someone super Julie it sits nicely on this and people are basically just saying it's their holy grail foundation every single person loves it every single one of those six people so let's see if I like it okay so this is still one of the top rated foundations on the support at the moment while I'm filming this and this is the packaging by the way just so you know it's beautiful I love Tom Ford maker I'm just gonna use a foundation brush today because I don't have a damp sponge oh my gosh I know like people hate it when I apply my foundation like this I do like little mini Instagram tutorials sometimes and every single time people like who even applies the foundation like that I do okay don't judge me okay so used about maybe a pump and a half I live in my whole face the pump is really easy to control and already on my finger it fields are very soft I'm just using a flat face brush ooh blends out so easy the color is pretty good it's a little bit pale for me but I'll be able to wear it when I've got least fake tan on at least I don't think the foundation loves the primer though cuz it's kind of separating a little bit but I think it's just the primer I should have really looked that up when I got these but I just as I see it grabs the top-rated stuff of Sephora so this happened in terms of the way it applies I love the way it applies the coverage is really beautiful it does look traceless I would call it like a medium buildable kind of coverage I'm going to build it up in a second just to double-check that fact I'm gonna use about another pump I'm just doing two half pumps maybe a little more I just created a different brush what am i doing only I go okay whatever I think if you have written it's like discoloration it's really good for that it's not covering out my free calls as easily okay so do my skin pretty well no I guess the prime is kind of sunk in a little bit more maybe yeah I think that is a beautiful finish it is so radiant and just looks like skin almost okay so so far I do like that foundation I'm definitely gonna try that again another day okay so for the it concealer it actually came up with a Sephora brand this is the make no mistake high coverage concealer I have been known to really like a lot of Sephora products usually the lip products so I'm very intrigued to try this I hate this stuff this costs $14 it's had a hundred and thirty three reviews which is a really decent amount to get a good feel of like the overall star rating which is four and a half stars that's pretty impressive someone says it's really creamy pigmented blend well someone else did they only need the tiniest amount to cover up all of their under-eye circles and you definitely need to sit with padded for increasing someone said they're finally able to say goodbye to their Holy Grail nice creamy radiant concealer that's one of my favorite concealer stomachs I'll just try this and so once it is opaque creamy and not cakey I'm so excited to try this so if you're near the tiniest amount oh god I'm just going to start like that it looks quite sticky I'm gonna put a little bit around my nose and on it these breakouts - okay I'm gonna have to cover that with foundation now it's way to power by the way I got the shade too much sis me and you get 10 ml of product which is pretty decent it's definitely covering up my redness on my eyelids and a little bit goes a really long way I do feel like with this product it blends it's very easy with your finger to be honest that's quite sticky almost ooh to promote your on my nose hole hole Wow okay yeah holy crap you know like try to watch them off with my brush and for me it's really sinking in to my under eye lines quickly so you dude you really need to see it this I find it a little harder to work with to blend like I can't figure out like it seems to bling really well on the finger but it takes ages just looks kind of streaky as well like no matter how much I blend it it's just I don't know going streaky so I don't know if I agree with their reviews it's definitely not working so well for me it's these other people it's like no matter how much I believed it it just doesn't look even I think that's the best way to put it okay sorry I've just found the pad a top rated so it's the erosion dome and my funky pressed powder I think I don't know if that's a pronounce it but this is a here and this is rated 5 stars but it's really quite a review and someone just did it's great oily skin and I haven't used this before I can't even remember what I thought of it I'm just gonna use some on a smaller brush under my eyes to sit this horrendous conceal I really don't like it to be honest guys like look at all my eyelids it's just completely like not covered anything in the end so I'm just gonna bust some of this powder over I think this is like a translucent color I'm not sure I already had this in my collection by the way yeah it just isn't we'll finish in this cost 60 at $6 so it's not cheap as Japanese so you're just using it to sit under my eyes oh my god my under eyes look so ugly I hate it look I'll show you up close in a second I will just set my face first so I'm just using a powder brush oh this is a nice sitting powder or something that's translucent it just mattifies but it doesn't like you mattify very much it leaves your skin looking really natural still the only place where the foundation and primary and stuff looks bad is on my nose but I think it's because I put that concealer on top and the concealer just I don't know it just does not agree with my skin either there it doesn't agree with the foundation or anything look under my eyes look how ugly they can feel it looks I am not a fan next up the highest rated and face spray on Sephora for a while was the Lyla be a glow face mist I've never tried this brand in my life this cost $48 which is fairly pricey and you get 30 ml of product let's have a look I just want to put some of this on now to kind of hopefully stitch all some of that can seal I don't think it's gonna do anything but I just want to put some on okay well that looks fancy it's very small compared to all nighter you get 118 ml and then this one you get 30 ml almost so expensive beautiful packaging I mean there's stuff better be good because that's expensive it's a hydrating mist rich in natural ingredients from earth and co2 leave the skin balanced and rejuvenated you use it to prep your face your makeup or refresh and hydrate at any time this was rated four and a half stars at 23 reviews so it's pretty good like quite high rated and it's good for any skin type pretty much it just is it helps to maintain a flawless cream for the complexion it smells very similar to the Jerrod Cosmetics sitting sprays like that kind of the general smell they have maybe lately lavender and it feels more like a face mist rather than a sitting spray and I could probably rather use this on bare skin just as like a refresher like oh it looks really wet now on my makeup I feel like it is super heavy it feels really heavy like it doesn't feel as light as the urban decay for example it feels a lot much thicker which sounds weird cuz it's like a water but I mean I'm just calling it like a feeling you know what the more the sinks and know like I do like the way it has a lift of my skin looking it's very glowy so like because I like this kind of look I feel like I will get my ears out of it but I still stand by what I said so he'll be feeling okay nice that we haven't the makeup forever brow liner this is no longer at the top of it the page just costs $23 I got it in the shade at 20 which is blonde it was rated four point four out of five which is really decent still someone said it's a felt-tip oh no I hate felt-tip brow products oh god this could be a disaster okay anyway people see this the best felt tip liner they've tried though like people have see that they have tried so many pencils pans pomades and this one that makes them want to start a long-term committed relationship with it man I hope I like this because I usually don't I'm not gonna lie oh try to be as like clean slighted as possible so the fresh product no bad experiences from the past will also my opinion on this it's a new product let's try this okay it looks way different from any other felt I've tried it looks like an eye liner felt almost so weird okay oh God it's quite pigmented I'm gonna have to tidy that up a bit I'm kind of going haywire already this is so much better than the ones I've tried in the past it's a little bit hard to control though cuz it's really stiff I totally do not hate this I'm so surprised feel like it's really like thickening - oh my god that's so not bad at all colours pretty good - it's a very like cool toned blonde color as worried it was gonna be a way too pale for me cuz I like dark eyebrows but it's still quite dark it makes me very excited the worst thing about it is yeah I'm kind of clumsy but we can just clean it out with some concealer there's such a bad shape what am i doing um I feel like I'd be easier to use if I like used a brush with it just like put my brush on the tip because I really like the formula I just don't know about the actual little applica it's not the worst thing in the world it's just like taking your way longer I am a fan of this oh my gosh pleasantly surprised looks really shocked her like if you love that bold eyebrow look it's super like okay so if the top rated I should eyes it's coming out with the it naked vault by Urban Decay so I'm just gonna use the Naked palette on my I stay and I'll keep it really simple because I mean where do you know I love the naked palettes here it is here hundred ninety-five at dollars for way more value and it comes with you know your lipsticks eyeshadows and stuff like that I am going to use the og naked I've not touched to this and it's so long this is one of my favorite pellets of all time I don't know why I just don't use it more often I guess because like we all went through that phase where everyone just use naked palettes 24/7 and I guess I wanted to use new stuff so I just put this at the back of my drawer but it really is it one of the most amazing colors so throwback time I'm gonna start with naked which is just like a crease color and I'm gonna pop that in at the crease this is a firmablend abhrush mix of beauty and then I'm going to take buck which is a slightly darker brown on another boom blender brush I'm kind of going on the inner and outer corners so these I chose incredibly blendable really amazing if you don't have a Naked palette I definitely recommend it I like the naked one into the best is that one's okay I don't like naked smoky and I don't really used The Naked basics either going back in with naked jizz on my eyes and they're not going to take an angled eye brush and take the chin which used to be my favorite color if you could not tell and she's gonna go on the brow bone and on the inner corner just to keep up the super glowy look and then I'm just gonna take a little bit of half-baked on my finger which is like a golden color and I'm just gonna put this in the middle of my eyelid where I makeup is so simple moving along to another product I have not tried this product right here Ford I defining pin this isn't it the shade deeper and this is so long with an eyeliner I can hear too well here's a Maybelline the lip pencil like it's so long double-sided okay so this cost $57 it is out of stock currently and it's still it radiated four and a half stars after 48 three reviews so that's really highly rated people were just saying that both sides of the pen that provided the purest black line people say it's so easy to use they say it's super smooth they say it's the best eyeliner period and I've tried Capaldi still the bomb CIT Exeter after let's give it a go for ourselves okay so how does this work the side okay this is like the tiniest little pin tip I've ever seen in my life is it so small and then the side is more like your regular size so you know try the regular side Phest oh it's so sharp oh my god it really does give you like the most perfect line there's no bleeding it's super easy to use oh God crap very black and there little brush tip has a little bit of flexibility to it which I really like it's nice and easy oh god you really can't get a really sharp line I don't want to like this because it's a very expensive it's so sharp okay I'm gonna try that smaller brush on the inner corner so little I actually find this way harder to use I'm gonna go back to the long one I'm gonna go up nice and close so you can see how sharp that line is so far I really really like this eyeliner Wow we could probably make it a little bit straighter but I'm scared it's gonna go so thick it's so black oh my god I love this oh that's so crooked Wow my eyeliner just goes so thick look at the state of there that's hideous let's just talking about how easy it is to apply oh my god that's ugly Wow okay how am I gonna fix this oh my god it stays put I can't even wipe it off it's just so smudge proof it will not come off well it looks like this is my life today so yeah don't judge me for my eyeliner today it's not going anywhere it's that's it how to get this off now I definitely do like this a lot but just be careful because once it's on it's on okay mascara time okay so the most cars have changed quite a bit I have the roller lash by benefit which I actually really like I prefer this - they're real they're real mascara I really like this I've shown this in a few videos it's $24 rated 4.6 out of 5 with a 4 reviews so that's really really really good people are just saying it's really good long lasting it does exactly what it says it well so if you've never seen the Wonder before this is how it looks by the way all the top rated mascara is on so for right now we're all gifts it's like Christmas ones with minis which I don't own anyway I'm going to show you how this performs I really do like this one okay so here's one it coat I have no idea if you can see past the eyeliner but I really like it it's not like my favorite mascara in the world it's just one of those ones that I like old hippy yours it does the job I definitely do think it's one of my favorite curling Atmos cars I am going to use it the Thunderer lashes by beauty these are faux mink lashes they're sideways you can see how super fluffy they are like they just saw the luminous and silky smooth okay I'm gonna let these sit there and stick lightly the glue continue to stick down for bronzer / contour something will limited-edition popped up which was kind of funny hopefully it's still available xym doing this so late i am at the worst i am sorry okay out of stock currently but it's still on the website so hopefully you guys can sign up for the out of stock notification it's $59 and it's called the board to pledge highlighting and bronzing a palette and it is exclusive to Sephora let's have a look at it I love nas like face products they're so beautiful I have a lot in my personal collection so this comes away some highlighters and Sun wash diffusing products by okay so really like you could just use lagoon or casinos it's called Laguna and Casino in it and I have a different highlighter I'm gonna be using so I'm just going to use Laguna and Casino and rugs and comb to have bronze I'm just being use actually the darker shade which is Cassie no this is a chili powder brush I love the finish that is Laguna and Casino all over my bronzer and contour area contoured with Laguna which isn't like the perfect contouring color but oh well when I put in a contrary into Sephora that's the pellet that showed up is top right edge by the way it's got a hundred and sixteen reviews and it's been rated four point six out of five so really highly for blush I am so excited that this popped up is top rated it is Vizia or Liza I'd never know how to pronounce it the C ha maybe um this brand is so expensive I have a few of the eyeshadow palettes but this is a blush palette and I'm so excited I don't often wear blush anymore by the way this is in Rose Caro um but just because it's this brand I love this brand I'm like really excited so let's say what other people said about it so it's $80 which is so expensive but you drink it six different colors and it's rated 5 stars with 16 reviews so everyone that's tried it seems to love it they say that very pigmented so a little goes a long way long lasting haven't even had to touch out I have no idea what color to use that will look so intense so many years at this color because it intrigues me my a chili powder brush again oh so pretty is very pigmented he's the smallest amount of my brush oh my god is so nice woah too much okay way too much now for highlighter oh my god I love this blush honestly you guys don't get the full effect of how beautiful that turn is oh my god I feel like if you're a makeup artist this pellet would be perfect because you have it colors for any skin tone there are pale ones and deep bright ones so you could go from it's super fair-skinned to strip a deep skin and you'll be sweet I'm so impressed man okay the highlighter that showed up is this one here and to know I've never tried this brand either so this is a little bit exciting okay oh it looks cool okay it's $42 it's in the shade endless summer which is a pink champagne that's right up my alley and it has dropped back a bit in reviews so who will see how good are they it is now rated at three point eight out of five so this is the lowest rated product we have tried today so far and it's because it hasn't been given it to true star ratings to bring it down a bit saying it's a beautiful finishing powder people have said that they haven't been able to put it down it gives there it's gonna natural lit from within it glows see the sounds right up my alley because that's like mate so beauty highlight is there good all over or is a natural highlight some people say that they are disappointed because it's a dark color it looks like I put bronzer on the top of my cheeks oh yeah when I purchased this it was a rated super high obviously it was the top rated one at the time oh my god this is so weird look at the packaging it's like a wooden it blocks like legit and then this is what the color looks like okay it definitely doesn't look very light you know what I measure I'm gonna dampen my brush with the sittings where I got it does look glittery I'm so scared okay this is wet and I can't even freaking see it on my face okay here we go starting to show up this isn't even as intense as my XY Beauty ones which are natural but they've so beauty ones are very buildable this is third layer and like it's still so subtle fourth layer this is way more subtle within the two-faced ones you know those natural ones my true face that's layer sixth layer is this 100 layer challenge like this is what if so beauty would look like after like two layers seventh layer oh yeah it's quite glittery like it really shows up the imperfections on my face okay I'm not to do ten layers on the other side of my face now you know what I give up I don't like that I'm gonna go back in it to my nas palette and use one of these highlighters because they look so pretty I'm gonna use actually a little bit of a gold to go with my eye makeup maybe this one which is like a lighter gold and I'm not gonna wait the brush the brush is dry by now already that's so much more like these ones are quite shimmery the quantity inside metallic until it's a good way I just am in that mode today like this is just glittery and barely even there like it's not good and this is one layer and it's way more wet looking I'm just like drenching my skin in it I love the look of it so nice big fan of this palette like I'm sorry--but this is a million times better than that other one not a fan and then I'm going to resit my face with a little bit of this even though I don't like the way it feels like definitely by now it doesn't feel heavy but it feels really heavy at first but I just want to make my skin look good with glowy again smells identical to the dry Christmas leavened dough I mean that's what it is let's now so I've got two products okay this I think is the lip liner that showed up and then I go to matching top-rated liquid lipstick kind of situation okay so this is a jewel lipstick and lip liner and then I think this must be what came up when I searched top-rated gloss so this is it here it cost $28 I have the shade Ohama breeze it's a matte finish it's been rated 5 stars with 9 reviews I've never tried this brand before either wonder beauty so I'm so excited so people are saying it's innovative it works it's cruelty free which people love it's a lip liner and let's sit together that's easy to use perfect in color it doesn't cost a million dollars excellent pigmentation I have to say I think it looks really ugly it's just a really awkward packaging but the quality feels amazing the packaging color is really cool it like deep reddish metallic color okay so I missed you mean this is the liner it's just a wind-up liner so that is the color if the lip liner and a huge fan of that it's a really beautiful color and then at the lipstick ooh it's like one of those rounded tip which wigs me out looks like a pretty color yeah it is really creamy but it's still met it feels really good don't do what I did I just lift it out a little bit and then I put the lid on it and crushed it and it's all cursed now I'm such an idiot now let's do the lip gloss even though I don't normally wear lip gloss that often so this is milk makeup I've only tried a couple of times this brand the look the vinyl and it's in the shade chillin and this cost $24 and it is rated 0.7 out of 5 with 7 reviews people are just saying that they are super true to color the color stays on and it feels very comfortable on the lips the foremothers thick and opaque with just the right amount of gloss however it is transfer prone and sticky oh yeah I can tell it's sticky like the like resistance on the tube like pulling it out it's not as thick and sticky is they made it sound I don't think it's that sticky at all in fact I actually quite like it this is the applicator by the way it's just a little dirt foot applicator doesn't really smell like anything and it looks really pretty maybe if you put on like a crap-ton of this it would be sticky or like thick but it's very it's not that bad so there we have that I'm just gonna go blow-dry my hair so we can get the complete finished effect okay so let's quickly go through the products primer I definitely want to try some more I really liked the way it made my skin look and feel but obviously with the foundation it did not go very good the foundation I love the finish I love the kind of coverage like the medium kind of buildable at coverage I just think it looked really beautiful on my skin and it looked really youthful and glowy and healthy the concealer was a no from me do not like it the powder I do like it's a good translucent pressed setting powder it is very expensive than you could probably find a bitter ones the way cheaper the bronzer palette by NARS love this so much if you guys can pick it up I definitely recommend it cause you can't get the it bronzes it separately I do own them separately the blush palette I adore I want to keep using this that color well that colors it oh my gosh like I just think that is so appreciate like so beautiful for summer we're coming up to summer here in New Zealand I'm so excited the highlighter know from me did not enjoy that the brows I actually really ended up enjoying all of it to be honest like it feels really nice in second place I didn't use a brow gel a bit but it's still can I stuck my hands down and it looks so sharp and beautiful I should have hello obviously all of that the eyeliner love it it's just so hard to fix if you screw up but it is really easy to use I think I was just having a bed eyeliner day I'm so going to continue to use this however I don't really like the mini sight which surprised me the mascara I really like it's not my favorite of all time mascara but stiffly my favorite killing mascara lashes obviously I love these but they're not on so far these Ronix a beauty shop comb the lipstick I enjoyed I don't know if it's something I would like go out and buy all of the colors just because the packaging weirds me out a little bit but I can definitely see for people that you know just want a makeup bag it's really handy because it's two-in-one and it's not too big I love the color as well like it's definitely a good product I just don't know if I'm gonna rush out and get any more of them and then the lip gloss I probably still wouldn't reach for this all the time just because I don't use lip gloss all the time but I definitely don't think it's bad and I don't think it's as thick and sticky as people say but I did use a very thin layer and then at the sitting spray I definitely don't think it's worth the money it's such a small amount for the cost quite a heavy feeling it's very fragrant if you don't like lemon do you will hate this but I do love the way it makes my skin looks to be honest like it just makes my skin absolutely glow so I probably still will use this and who knows a microloan me like maybe when I get used to the formula of it I might like it a lot more so I think I talked about everything I hope so I hope this video was helpful let me know if you guys want me to do a worst of Sephora like all of the low rated makeup on Safari I think it could be a really fun video to see if they're as bad as people say or if you have any other requests just a luminar and if you made it at

hey everyone so today I thought I would do a little get ready with me life update and another cocktail series look so I think I said I was going to do pinnacle Ida and sangria and then rip this series up I'm going to make a playlist of all of these cocktail looks and open it down below for you but yeah and I've been wanting to do a pina colada and a sangria look for ages but I've been filming other videos and then life has just been really bad so I just haven't done it in a while but I just really felt like filming today so that's what I'm doing my skin is so dry so I'm starting with the glam glow glow starter and nude blow I'm just going to apply so mmm as a lot of you guys know my Nana passed away um recently and she is the family member I've talked about in so many videos that was in hospital since last August I bet they last year so she passed away I'm not gonna say peacefully but she passed away surrounded by family last Saturday which by the time you watch this is probably a couple weeks ago um it's really weird like I don't feel like it's sunken in I keep thinking to myself like today I need to go get my PO Box mail I need to go get groceries and then I'm going to go visit my Nana at this afternoon and it happens like every day I just forget that she's not here anymore and it's really horrible and because we've put her funeral off for a week it's next week because my family members I've got family members overseas they need to get here and just because we need to organize the funeral and everything and get the insurance and hasn't all of this awful stuff yeah so I guess because we haven't had the funeral yet it hasn't sunken in and they're aspect eat that like a haven't said goodbye like that like I said goodbye to her when she was alive and like when she was passing away I was right there I gave her a kiss on the cheek and I told her how much I loved her and everything but like this is like we're the first I've cried because I haven't actually talked about it with anyone yet like a part from the day it happened like I've cried you know but this is the first time I'm really talking about it and it's like to myself I feel like I'm in denial and I feel like it hasn't sunk in and I feel like no it's just really weird I'm gonna do my brows if it's just gonna put on a little bit of this Anastasi of people he Hills I've raced it Foundation just kind of around my brows because it makes the product go on better i litter I like head my sponge right here I just with it and I don't know where it is I'm going to use brow Zing's by benefit I love this stuff oh sorry it's gotten real bright all of a sudden so I'm kind of just in limbo right now in denial I've never dealt with grief before like this the last family member I had died cuz I've got a relatively small family was when I was a lot younger and Intermediate School so would've been Watley I live in or something I don't know and I just I didn't understand it so much I guess like adds up see it for sure but this time it's a lot different I'm older and I don't know it's weird and I just feel like I'm always doing so much stuff to try and keep myself busy because as soon as I sit there doing nothing I feel so much worse and I don't know how to deal with this and I guess I've just been trying to be strong for my other family members for my mom for my grown dad um cuz my granddad's alone now which was really sad so just being there for him it's so hard and I miss thing mine and already like because I feel like they should be like visiting her cuz I visited her so often like most days I visited her and ouija was in the hospital and stuff and so like I missed her so my Nana um pretty much like growing up for me my parents weren't really together and we weren't a well-off family so growing up both of my parents were working a lot to provide for me and provide for themselves and the family everything so for a lot of my life growing up I spent a lot of time with my Nana and my granddad because obviously they have two sets of menos knitters and brunettes and once it were a little bit younger on my dad's side and they were still working and then my Nana and granddad my Nana that passed away they were retired and so I spent a lot of time with my Nana in the school holidays weekend's just when my parents were working a lot and also I lived with my Nana for a long time as well growing up and my granddad I looked with them and my stuff my childhood memories I with them like which sounds bad like not so much my mom and my dad like I have memories with mom and dad but most most of my memories are with my Nana and my grade Ned and like my Nana was the most amazing dinner like she was like your typical Nana like my parents used to eat seen me off to my Nana and grenades it's like a punishment like if I'd been naughty or something not like I was naughty often but a couple times I was naughty and so they were like right you're going off like if it was like over the school it is like you're off there when I was old enough to actually stay at home alone you know but they were like no no you're not gonna stay at home alone and go on the internet and have fun and play The Sims and stuff you're gonna go to your nanny and green Nets because Nana and granddad were like in a small small country town and they had no internet and there was nothing to do and it was honestly quite boring but they used to think that was such a punishment but I always secretly liked it because I just loved spending time with my Nana and no matter how naughty I had been she was always like education and I'll make you some custard and she'd like bake me scones and she'd make me like different me I mean make me different meals than what she was hitting so I was like I don't want vegetables Nana and so she'd make me like something completely different like she split me rotten and I loved her so much I loved her so much and just throughout my entire life she's always been there and every year she rung me up with the heads to me and understand this fear so much I need to stop talking about it now but I just wanted to update you guys and let you guys know you know that's what's happened um I feel like I'm gonna be even worse than this next week when the funeral happens so I'm just kind of like working when I feel like it like I said today I just felt like filming and putting on makeup I haven't even like showered today yeah I got bit from the German I just wanted to film um so I'm kind of like sweaty and disgusting right now my his revolting but who cares I just wanted to update you guys and I'm still getting messages saying like oh I hope your family mem is doing okay so you know I just want to come on here and update you because you guys have been so supportive over this entire like year of this all happening um and I just felt like you deserve to know so she passed away and I don't know she passed away from the cancer or the blood clots because she was getting blood clots in her lungs as well um that regardless you know she is gone and she's not in pain anymore I have been doing my brows for like ten minutes cuz I'm just like babbling I thought I'd start with my makeup today don't know why that's what's happening I feel like those eyebrows way thicker than this one I'm going to take a short shader brush and just tidy up my brows I'm just kind of applying a little bit of foundation around I'm gonna do my foundation laters well a little feeis loose so I really can't much about how it looks right now I'm just trying to make my eyebrows look nice and sharp so other than my Nana sadly passing away sadly happily depends how you look at it like like I said at least she's at peace now I just wasn't ready for her to go even though like she's being sick for a year and I've been seeing her second I'm you know you'd think I'd be like prepared for this moment and I feel like I am and I feel like I'm not anyway um so apart from that the day before my Nana passed away my mom wasn't like they say everything happens for a reason but this is weird um she was in a huge car accident doesn't really look huge because it was just sort of lucky the way it happened she was going she was driving out of town in a hundred Kazon just out upon me really close to pommy and someone pulled out in front of her to do it u-turn and mum tried to break obviously like slam on the brakes kid she skidded and then the other person I don't we don't really know because mum didn't really talk to him but mum reckons maybe he slammed on the brakes too when he saw her like oh  you know and mum hit him and then when my mom hit him she actually flipped so the car rolled and ended up on a fence like super Beverly I'll put in a photo um surprisingly the car wasn't too damaged obviously it was a pretty safe guy I think was I could dodge something she is so lucky to be alive like everyone involved was just like how are you ok it was a huge crash and it was actually lucky that the other person stopped and my mum hit that person they were fine by the way they're not hurt at all um look at that completely okay which is so good aswell because I wouldn't even wish for him to get hurt obviously and it was just an accident and it's lucky the accident wasn't worse than it was be it was just an accident so that's all it was um anyway if that person didn't stopping him from actually managed to because she went on the inside so on and using we dragged on the left side of the road so because the person was doing a u-turn or whatever instead of going on the other side of the road mum had to go the inside way so if she didn't hit the other car on the inside and she likely this is what the policewoman said she would have likely slid straight into the power pole and not many people survive you know going 90 kilometres over how the first month was going at that point straight into a power pole so I'm just so thankful him mum hit the other car like it probably ended up the best way it could have may no no passing weather next day is like imagine if my mum was hurt or worse plus a measure of my mum was like even if my Moroney just like heard arrests or something she was in hospital at Burger risk I don't know she was in hospital winning my Nana passed away and I just be sorrowful like who's just so much they happen at once so that's what's been happening and my wife life is just horrible right now but I figure it can't get worse at this point hopefully please don't prove me wrong I'm sorry that this is like super depressing I just wanted to fill you guys in and because this is like my therapy talking to my style we're talking to the camera I'm like getting it all out um because you haven't really talked to anyone else about it I was so sad to my Nana passed away right after we played her one of my favorite songs in the world which is actually the song I've always wanted to walk down the aisle to which I've wanted my friend to sing me down the aisle to my green it was singing it to her my mom was holding her hand then we like change the song and then it happened and it was just I don't know I've never seen anything like it I feel so weird right now okay can steal my eyelids I'm gonna stop talking about this now okay no wait last thing I just want to say thank you so much to everyone who has wish my family well true any companies that have seen does flowers to any person that's left me a message um honestly thank you so much I really appreciate it it's so nice to know that you know so many people really care and we really appreciate it even if I haven't replied to everyone I think this still people were my personal Facebook who I haven't even replied to because I've just not been on maybe Center obviously um but you know I do appreciate it and thank you to everyone that cured while it was happening thank you to everyone who asks for updates everything like I know it's such a random thing to talk about me what's my fault with but I've also been at my meetups and people have said to me that it helps them get through things they were going through as well like me talking about the stuff they said you know seeing you go through something like this that's so heartbreaking like it helped give me strength to do the same and it makes me cry when I think about it and a crying person we people tell me these things but I don't know it's a weird thing to share with you guys but I think it's a good thing this year as well like this is life and really terrible things happen but if I can get through it so can hear okay now I'm just going to see it my eyelids I'm gonna use some of this beauty bakery flower sitting powder the pink oops and I know this is weird but get out of there I'm gonna refill and my brows now anyway I know this is weird but I like to kind of double prime because that is how pigmented pigmented that is how discolored my eyelids are I've got very thin skin and you can oh this is my open eyes met yes okay I'm using the smash boss lip primer I've got really thin eyelid and you can see all my veins you know it seems very extra but if you don't have the same problem as me you could just do one layer anyway I always think I'm okay oh this is I stopped talking about it I'm not okay people keep criticizing me they're like man you're working do you not care do you don't can't leave you minutes just started I just realized it was only one way to grieve okay so we're doing pina coladas today I feel like my eyes are really ugly but whatever so if you didn't know this is what a a piña colada looks like it's one of my favorite cocktails but it makes me feel sick every time I drink here cuz they're so creamy and rich but it's all good it's basically like coconut pineapple you know so you're looking at some white pale yellow they often serve them with the cherries and bits and pieces so maybe I'll incorporate that as well but this is obviously going to be a very simple kind of look do I even have like pale yellow eyeshadow I'm operati I have found an earth propeller with a pale yellow color this is new so this will be exciting to try out for the first time this is the must have met palette by refresh I drew him a discount code for you down below if you want to use it I don't really mind it's up to you there's an affiliate code so you can find some houses if you want and then there's this I get beautiful deep golden here which I kind of want to use a little bit of just cuz it looks fun even though that it's not really Pina Colada color it's still yellowish so mostly maybe let's color just yeah just gonna crease blender brush what is this and then from the same palette I'm taking the color that's just a little bit dark and next to it add a little more and now I'm going on with that really pale yellow color I'm gonna struggle to try and get that yellow to Peaks or I think because it's such a pale yellow but this would be a really nice brow bone highlight because it's a really subtle kind of yellow now I'm going to go and with that dark and kind of golden yellow this is from the editorial matte checkers palette I'm I decided to try this I love the packaging it's so thin yeah I don't even know what I'm doing with this let's just go in and out of corner maybe I'm just making this up as I go sona's pigmented as I thought it would be TBH I'm just going to press it all over screw it what I might do is go back in with that um pale yellow and kind of go over top of the gold to make my yellow lucky I did my eye makeup first not my foundation cuz I've got heaps of fallout from that color I'm taking the payoff this yellow is not that pigmented taking the pale yellow and what the heck is going on these are not great so it's gonna meta Phi that color a little bit but whatever I hope I can pull this look together I'm not feeling very faithful today now I'm going to take this color is really wedged it's like a golden and greenish color with a bit of white in it which I'm trying to portray that whitish color of the Pina Colada that color cervical I'm just blending damn I shall use this as a base I've got the waterproof color and yellow by Anastasia Beverly Hills don't know how I feel that any of those eyeshadows I use just before like the matte ones and the crease were okay but I liked the brow bone one though I like that color I'm just taking the pale yellow again from the orphan pellet I don't know what I'm even doing right now my brain is just weird I'm using the color I used to highlight gonna pencil brush and a little bit just on the middle of my eyelid and I'm going to use some of that gold color goes around the edges okay let's do some base so I can tidy this up and finish the eyes I'm going to use the bindi Beauty primer way too much I don't even know what foundations I hope they mesh me when I'm this I'm going to use some in that one twinning HD foundation I make it forever twist of the day is what is your favorite foundation right now I'm loving the Rihanna one to be honest but I need a lighter shade when I've got no feet down on let even this foundation it's a little bit too dark for me but whatever so is everything right now for some reason I'm just going like so pale lately weird like I'm often pale light skinned but yeah normally I don't get this light like even my light foundations are a little bit too dark but it's summer coming right around the corner it's spring now I'm sure soon I'll regain a little bit of color into my skin or flu I actually apply like the eye makeup now that I'm evening out my skin tone it looks quite like a tropical and fun for spring that primer into this foundation it makes my skin look so flawless like I've got zero pause if you want to see my Finn T first impression I'll link it down below well like it makes you look orange when you comment on that but if you watch too light there you know update when I've got all of my makeup on you can see it's not orange it's obviously the color balance but anyway yes I've tried a lot darker I also said that it tried a lot darker like eight times in my videos not eight times beena I definitely mentioned it a couple of times I feel like some people watch like the very first part of it that you only comment and then like I talk about the stuff that people accuse me of No Meech tank which is kind of annoying that that is life listen to me just being a little bitch today bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch I think I'm entitled to be moody today though forgot how much I really liked the finish of this foundation it's a little bit too dark for me but I don't care in my eyes I'm going to use the same concealer I used before my eyelids if I can't even find it here it is fair neutral tin by color pop the concealer I'm really liking this the hype is real right on that wing I'm just using a brush make sure it's nice and sharp this concealer is a really good dupe in my opinion for the Urban Decay Naked skin which is one of my favorite concealers ever like real nice and thin texture great coverage doesn't crease it just looks really flawless and smooth as primer - it makes everything you put on top of it just don't want this story beautifully look how flawless my freak was it gone and then I'm going to use my pixel locket powder they kept on teacher to see that the student potter makes everything look like silk I just inhaled so much and then if we wear offs on my face I'm gonna take the photo bomb powder foundation this is an latter than light I'm using the glam glow glow suit I really like this it makes your skin look kind of oily which I like under my eyes I'm just gonna take that color again I'm using that yellow and my waterline by the way guys I don't even know if I'm doing Halloween this year because I was planning on buying all this stuff for Halloween last week obviously other stuff was happening and ideally I should be filming them just wait next week and I'm just not in the mood like I've got other stuff I'm focusing on like I like doing videos like this where it's just chill that I'm just making it up as I go but for the Halloween videos you know I try to prove a lot of thought into them and they take a lot longer and it's a lot more intense you know it's not just like relaxing putting on my makeup hitting to you guys like I've really gotta think ahead and I'm I'm just not very capable of thinking ahead right now so I don't know what I'm gonna do there I'm sorry if I don't really do Halloween this year but it's just life life is just cooking my ears just sharpening up that yellow by the way this is a winged liner brush and is the best you can get the sharpest line today flexures I'm going to wear some that I'm bringing out on X would be soon boom I feel them for a while they have faux mink lashes and if you watched my drunk get ready with me with Sally she wore a pair of them and they looked incredible so I'm gonna wear it here we're up here today got real dark real quick just in but these are the thunder lash so pretty and natural voluminous lots of volume lots of layering as you can see and they feel like real mink and they're not I'm going to your face put on some it Chanel low volume dish you know let's go wrong I just want to do no I lied I want to keep it light and pretty because the pinna clutter is super tropical and pretty and light colored but I want to do heaps of lashes because I love what's lashes did you guys know I look so pale and sick without any bronzer on it was just cuz the eye makeup so light and bright like ghost looking so there is my lashes with just the mascara I need to trim my nostril is like ASA like I have powder can you see that powder told you I inhaled it now I am taking it some it gimme brow and just touching up these eyebrows you ever have any powder that kind of it was happen there while I was doing the rest of my face and that rain so loud outside it's so miserable I wish the weather was reflecting my makeup right now but unfortunately as the opposite I've been playing with some of the darker colors for my beauty highlighting they have that glow when you buff them in so they can be look how weird their looks on my skin right now not the best but it's got that golden kind of glow like it's so beautiful for a highlighter I don't know if you can see it also just looks really good similar to how I used my hourglass bronzers just as a glowing bronzer on my skin tone so I'm kind of excited I just like to put it where I kind of highlight and blush and it gives my face a little bit of color and it just looks glowy at the same time like you can see the glow it gives on my skin time imagine that on a deeper skin tone would look way better I just like it to bring color to my face like you can see like it's just so perfect make sure looks sunkissed looks better once I have contoured so I'm gonna do that now let me know what you guys think of this because I'm still working on it but yeah using the top pro at glow palette and at bronzer brush Curtis so my highlight I'm going to use Lucent by XO beauty and this brush is filthy so hopefully doesn't know it's good sometimes I just take the risk you know like is it gonna make my cheek that color will what color I don't know so penny just going over that high part of my cheekbone so where the stuff makes my skin look photoshopped I'm using that like daca highlight a powder just it's like the blush and stuff as well so long ago it looks like I've got like you know coverage and all of a sudden what's going on I need to wear like a turtleneck today okay so that's the makeup look almost done I think we need some kind of like cherry lip just to sit off the Pina Colada look this would look so good with just nude lips I might do that next but for this tutorial let's do some cherries OOP here's some more and so I'm going to use this kind of like pink red because I know cherry-coloured you know this is Bachelorette by Kat Von D I would probably never actually wear this color lip with this eye makeup but I just wanted to make it what is that I just want to make it super pinnacle artery so tropical looking the lashes I'm obsessed with I love them so much so you keep an eye out for those they are beginning production really soon so I'll update you when they're coming can't wait for you guys to see the packaging as well this so calls gonna finish off with some of this oh it doesn't taste bad so

to have another one because I go through this stuff not like super quick so I got so many primers but I love it so much so having a backup is always handy and then it they've seen another of The Hangover three-in-one it's sitting sprays which is awesome I do like this I'm not like completely sold on this spray ball although sometimes it's quite clumpy but I do like the formula and the smells

to take this to the beach house and just leave it out it will hold on that was very premature we are still people have been asking me for an update with the beach house we are still waiting on a couple of things to get checked off from the council we have the house but if there's like stuff wrong with it then we can get out of the contract so we are hoping and praying there is nothing wrong with the house and it is a lease but I'll tell you guys like if I get a beach house and everything but just saying like if I get the beach house look how he right this is it look at the little octopus oh so cute next up is some stuff from art freh is skank-ass so we have cool as a cucumber moisturizing primer and one I love the feeling of cucumber on my skin I can't eat it makes me like really sick but I love the feeling of cucumber on my skin primer and moisturizer in one I'll have to try that in the first impression this is a energizing elixir reach hygiene facial toner this one a perfect elixir with apple stem cells my fellow water gentle cleansing is it like he cleans oh yeah cool next up we have something from you a this is the sweetheart long wear lip topper look how cute it's a little books like that and this is the color it's like a straw Bree shimmery shade and then we have something from a shop I bought off so I would still make it to you before I went on Etsy and I actually purchased heaps of makeup cuz I want to do a full face of Etsy makeup which is all just handmade from people that make makeup I thought it'd be a really fun video to do so in here we have a pressed powder highlighter this is from posh pepper beauty.com boy etsy.com posh pepper beauty and they gave me a freebie as well which was really nice of them so i think this is the freely phoenix posh pepper beauty that's so pretty so it's like an eyeshadow or highlighter let's watch it I kind of shouldn't swatch it because I should let them be first impressions in the you know video when I try everything out but that's really pretty man have juicy peach I won't swatch this one oh my god this so nice so yeah it's all handmade stuff which is so cool that is the label on at the back so yeah keep an eye out for that video I'll try to film it in the next couple of weeks I'm away in Fiji next week but yeah when I get back I definitely want to film now okay next up we have the ever controversial for a good reason heart shaped tape foundation hydrating foundation shape tape mat foundation so they must be both in here size fits all foundation isn't one size fits all that's why we made two it's kind of ironic so I asked people if they wanted to see a first impression on this foundation and it was very split like if they were like 50% people they were like if they seemed it to you here why not then there were 50% that was just height than that like not even interested just because of the way they don't situation I don't even know how they dealt with the situation but clearly it wasn't well because um people are not happy about it fair enough I'm not gonna tell people how to react or how to feel about it I think that it sucks that the shade range they bought out first was so small they could have at least done like you know only a few shades but kind of done late a couple why a couple medium and a couple dark rather they've like all right you know what I mean like if they were always intending on expanding the shade range I don't know like I just feel like for a big huge company they should be able to do heaps of shades straight away they've got millions of dollars to spend on it and not like a small indie company they're a huge company they're both clean to you wanna be at cash and saying that I've heard mixed reviews on the actual foundation some of my friends really liked it some people in YouTube don't like it I don't know let me know down below we'll make a final decision if you want to see a first impression or not so yeah there's a few different colors there they sent with some washi tape to sponge it sure looks really cool it and then this brush down here sorry let me know if you want a first impression otherwise I can always just try it in my own time and let you guys know what I think of it within another video with something like that totally up to you guys or I could do a chitchat get rid of me full face first impressions featuring one of these I've no idea if they've brought out more shades yet or not yet I don't really know how it's working I have to be honest haven't even looked into it I've just heard all the drama on Twitter so next up we have it something here from confident sure looks like it's from at the farm oh okay I think it's mean to be like a joke and the winner is Shannon Harris because it looks like I've got a new bronzer take home the bronze let's have a look oh my gosh this so many colors seriously these like how many six of them look at them all so I already know I'm obviously gonna want one of the lighter ones try to figure it out because they don't actually have like light to dark names they've got different names these ones look the lightest I'd say so we've got Oscar which it looks like that and it is just it looks Matt I think I have to look at these off-camera and decide which one I want to keep because I don't need to all of them this money here is called at Tony that one's definitely darker and warmer oh wait that one's Oscar as well okay jokes they've seen me to of H there's only three and then the final one here is called a Graham Graham super dark reminds me of um you guys know the bomb bronzer and then they see me some Marylou they see me at the scuba water resistant mascara so give both of those away because I don't like water is a super mascara personally very much and I've already got one of these naturally it's one of the best highlighter zebra and then I'm gonna keep this one Schwing I love Schwing and then there is a meet Matt Hughes in devotees and you look at lipsticks so save heaps that stuff for a giveaway and then we have another gift here for me I'm just searching miss right now my hair is all out mention my hair is all over the place this is a gift for me and a mesh from Valentino perfume so thank you so much I'm a huge fan of Valentino perfumes I've walked quite a few in the past with my own $10 I love is it just called pink Valentin or the one in the circle I don't know anyway this is a Valentino Dona aqua the packaging is so it's so beautiful I like the gold and I love the pink if it wants to focus thank you very much and it's like a canvas kind of feeling blocks I know it doesn't even matter what I'd mention it and then the bottle is so pretty it is this kind of like not spiked but you know the glass design with Valentino on it and then it's got a little protector so that's what it looks like with the gold that's good Wow I'm gonna put some on this can be my Valentines Day perfume it's so good what does it smell like lightness and indulgence composed by Sonia constant Valentino Dona aqua is a collision between tender green almond and frosted appear the want of frangipani Rose accordin meets a suggestion of sandalwood I don't know what I can smell but I mean it's good that's all I know definitely go check that out Wow I'm a big fan I've never actually smelled that one before I don't know if it's new or what but and then I don't know how to pronounce this Valentino warm oh well something once again I'm gonna open it hamish won't mind you should have seen how cute he was the other day we were in the Maldives and he took with him his Hugh go boss Cologne his head of ages and he like shots at me from the bathroom he was like shedded I finished my cologne it's like he was so happy and I totally get what he means like it's like when I finish a foundation or something I'm like oh my god but also kind of sad but it's like such a satisfying feeling so it's a good time for a new one although he actually had like freaking 50 I honestly think he's got as many clones as I do perfumes I'm not even joking he's go off box again is really beautiful obviously more manly with the khaki color and it looks like my one except a little bit different obviously and the liquids more of a yellow color there oh my god is this whoa that smells amazing I'm forcing him to wear that later that smells like fresh out of the shower but men what it smells like man but in saying that I would almost want to wear this cuz that's how good it smells clean I might have to borrow that sometime honestly when I say like a centers like men's or women's or like when a shop scissor door whoever says it like who even cares like just wear whatever seat you like because seriously that's good hi Shannon here is a new

you instantly will look at that and be like oh I don't want that that's not pigmented enough for me blush I like buildable that's just my personal preference because then you don't go crazy I feel

not just ring lights so cool look at that forty shades eight dollars age and look at the packaging how unique let me know if you guys want a lip swatch video that could be a really cool up swatch video I just want to like grab a couple random ones naturally I'm going straight for is this a pipe I think it's a pug little smushy face to puggy this one is called 44 met and it's a black look at the packaging it's like pink on the inside it does feel a little bit cheap like the plastic bit the actual outside is made out of paper which I've got no issue with I actually quite liked that idea because you could recycle it once you use up the lipstick but the actual like it just feels a bit like wobbling like you know the stick inside feels a bit well place when is number 50 tripping it's a lilac okay so they seem to kind of match the color this one's from the wife duck and it's called love love and it's a met yes look at that I just watch it on my hand oh it's creamy it's like a creamy matte it's not a like a drying that whatsoever see it's got a slight shine to it oh okay yeah let me know if you guys want a lip swatch video I would happily do that for you guys because this song

releasing lipsticks at the moment so well like highlighters and skincare and sitting sprays and stuff like that I feel Oh lipsticks I'm all about I'll do let's watch with you on most of you and then I have something from the bomb wrapped up in this little tiny little packet it is bonnie lou manizer highlighter and shadow ooh that it'd be so nice on deeper skin tones for a highlighter on there to be a bit dark I'm saying I'm saying I'm thinking well maybe if I had like a heap of nah I think they'd be too dark eating them with fake Tamlyn that would be a beautiful eye shadow from my skin tone if you've got deep skin at check that out if like mary lou is too light for you next up we have the urban decay Kristen LeeAnn palette or like not palette collection by open decay did I say that already

cool and then the ice sugar palette which let me open this for you as well it's like this again it kind of looks quite cheap like the packaging it's very like techy but the colors do look really

hey everyone so today I have an exciting haul for you guys this was so highly requested so I finally went on to miss a maze-like shop Macedo combos I don't know I'll link it down below but basically it's a website where they have makeup accessories and heaps of other random stuff the super super cheap I got pretty sure a lot of stuff like $1 so people were requesting and makeup tutorial using super cheap makeup from shopping this a or whatever it's called and so I wear mine and bought a ton of stuff and I thought I will haul today and my next video will be in makeup tutorial even I stuff it in here so hopefully it's good to be honest like I've got really low expectations because the stuff was ridiculously cheap it did take a couple of weeks to arrive but I really mind to be honest kind of like a surprise because I order stuff and then I forget about it because it takes a while to come and then I get it and I'm like yeah presence to me I will link this and make it straight down below by the way okay what's in here it's all breakfast messaged some packaged food really well I don't like really impacted she makes stuff together as you can see there is like a ton of over asked where's my phone actually check my set I want to see how much stuff on shopping estate is yeah one dollar makeup accessory is efficient how do they sell stuff for one dollar I start understand like how do you even make a profit they do ship internationally of course it's like ten dollars I've got heaps and heaps of stuff like seriously one dollar each one dollar as I said I don't really have like the highest expectation for my swatch a few things today but yeah watch out for my next video roll put the stuff on that face I tried to get enough stuff so I could do like a full faced tutorial with everything including like foundation powder blah blah blah anyways let's Evan I'm kind of excited everyone loves a good bargain so I'm hoping it's good holy crap I got a lot of stuff so everything came packaged and like a million of these little bags it was like that so everything seems really nicely killer and I did get some accessories and stuff as well by the looks of it so so many brands I have heard all that before and there some of them I've never heard of in my life for example I got some stuff from the brand clean color I think this time draw down and stuff in here which I have tried before on if you join and you know what it's not bad stuff like it's pretty good stuff especially for the price so I'm pretty sure this is cheaper on this website thing on beauty joint like this is a doll eyes I just like don't understand how it's a dollar see how does anyone make any I don't get it but hey I'm happy okay I'm like uber excited now that I'm like seeing all of this with my own eyeballs okay so I'm going to go through some of the stuff quite quickly it cuz obviously I'll talk more about some of it in my makeup tutorials so this is an eyeliner super gel intense and it Brown by the brand santaís I think it looks like this let's actually open this one because I'm curious to do this actually creamy and intense like it suggests like the package it comes up like a little sharpener on the actual pencil look at that that's quite cool with debits and can sorry I've got least angel in my hand I was watching makeup last night look at that that's not bad like definitely it's not as creamy as some of the hiring brands like her but I thought it was going to be garbage and it's not garbage so that she decent like for the price that's creamy for the price you know I mean I'm just going to go on a random order because otherwise it'll take me all day to do this all this buy my stuff this is a color correcting a face primer radiant glow pale balanced by a muse which is also another brand that is usually on duty joint this looks like a lilac primer why does this excite me so much so there should be quite brightening and good for people that have quite dull skin she feels really sick and creamy and moisturizing well it has such a strong scent that I'm not a fan of that it smells like lollies but it's like uber uber strong but hey if it works well for a dollar I will get past that this is really exciting to me also because I often get requests to do makeup tutorials using like eBay makeup and stuff which is super cheap but the difference between that is that they are not proper brands which means they don't necessarily have to do testing it doesn't mean they necessarily have to list their ingredients so there could be anything in there raspberry and hair proper makeup brands do know me and they're just really really cheap but at least that means you know if I find some like poo in your own and crack cocaine and your makeup that the reason I don't do anything with fake makeup or either makeup is just like quite dangerous people have literally gone blind because of that makeup so I am here to try and find you some really good stuff that's really cheap so I'm sure least some of this stuff will be amazing I'm sure some of it won't be great but that's why I'm doing the video okay mix that we have it this one - matte liquid lipstick by aoa studio this color looks so nice is n nerd oh it smells like cheery no I hate the smell of the artificial cherry oh my gosh look at that pigmentation though that was one that's why I love the color I love really warm kind of nerds like that like a warm nudish brown people yeah the smell is disgusting but the formula so far looks pretty good don't be so rough on like cheap makeup but it's just because so much of it is terrible so I'm giving you my honest opinion okay I don't want to be like oh wow this is so good and then you get it and you're like why the hell does that smell so terrible widen chin and say that so I'm just listing off everything like I would for a high-end product you know what I mean okay this hair is an amuse smokey eyes eye shadow in Kitty let's give it a little switcheroo you ready let's see oh it feels really soft it's decent it's not too powdery that just has to on my finger because the color kind of blends in but they said she quite doesn't it I'm impressed we have a volume mascara by a muse and a clean color Framus brows tinted brow mascara and I got the shade brown at black so I want something quite dark I'm like ridiculously excited to film and makeup tutorial using this stuff tomorrow and except this is a oh0 one to cover HD concealer I might give it a little swatch and see if it's like pigmented because I have tried it cheaper concealers back in the day when I was a teenager and have much money and I mean they did the job but you saved you so much product to get the coverage I used to use concealer from the turtle shell plate before I did youtube videos and the shade here is called a light yellow all that pigmentation actually looks really good look a bit that looks like a really brightening color - we got a Sun little lipsticks hand by the brand c'est la veille salasi maybe I'll just open one of them the packaging looks quite luxe like it's like a matte tube square with metallic gold writing a little color swatch and then the stickers meet with the color so this one called met lipstick and posh petal it's really four inch straight out look that's okay we can just second they had been sometimes with my high-end brands too it's just because it's come loose and the shipping you can just like firmly push it back in and it's usually good to go so it's like a bubblegum pink I'm just going to swatch it on my hand okay this looks a little bit chalky but I'm sure you could work with it well if you're going to go on at the ex elope it's probably just the color for the reason it looks factual because it is a very like pastel pink you know what let's just watch the other one - this one here is called warm red thank you being on this website cruelty free as well this one's also a little bit looseness like dinged on the top that one's better that one's a lot creamier feeling that color is so nice one dollar I cannot wrap my head around this they must buy like a millionaire riverbank mega patchy with another eyeshadow in the shade at chocolate by a mousse so that's just a darker color than the last one I ripped the foundation and another bag which is quite good in case it leaked this is the LA color liquid makeup and this is going to be a way to ask me a but I think I bought this so I could mix it because some of the other colors was really pale I'll try to some sake anyway I also up this one a mousse flawless liquid foundation and that's will put a bit of shape Smith in Caribe and Luke uses let's watch a little bit oh look at that quite streaky as you can see it but it feels really really lightweight and quite creamy so could be okay I'd never feel tacky afterwards I almost couldn't feel sticky after I wiped it off I also got the scent a USA magic a skin that beautifier BB SPF 20 it's in the shade at 12 I believe so I think it's like a BB cream kind of product also got a pencil eyeliner by salafi again and this is in the shade nude almost watch this okay this feels really hard like it's scratching the heck out of my hand the color is beautiful but yet it's not creamy at whatsoever the other one was so much better I got this at one to cover HD concealer any yellow it's the same brand as the last one so just a different shade and some Cara lashes which I believe I have tried back in the day these ones I hate I think they would have looked like this on the website so I wouldn't have try I'm at least of like a free gift or something these ones a nice so these are the shade to the shade these are the style 213 those look really pretty too quite wispy and long and then this is the s and K at Qwest Eilish silky milk foundation its best 20 in the shade - this looks quite pink I don't know how this will go and some elite colors a shadow a trios I love that pink color so appreciate of this one here this is the eye shadow darling compact by sente and it looks like this really hot pink and a peachy color and a lighter pink color it's a little bit more muted I really want to swatch this so I'm smells really bad of this yeah this smells like no typical I get grandma's smell like talcum powder but if the product is good I mean to be worth it okay these are very powdery but you are getting quite as pigmentation off them the hot pink is definitely not as hot as it looks in the pan but these two look quite pretty and not the most amazing actress I've ever seen in my life of course but for a dollar we will see how good they're obviously I can't use everything from the tall on my face at once they'll use as many different things as I possibly can I got another one of those I should apologize this one's like mint green light purple and really bright vibrant purple another lipstick by salafi in cocoa this is like a really dark brown there's a recurring theme for this brand but we'll just once again push it back in these have a weird smell to it it's not as bad as that I'm a cherry small but I can't really pick up like plasticy definitely workable it's not as nice as the orangey color which before it's a little bit more patchy but it's not like super drying feeling it feels quite creamy and we have a one time Mitchell liquid lipstick by the brand AOA studio and this isn't a shady ya consider quite pretty I don't usually love metallic lipsticks I mean that could look really nice on up a little bit on the middle my lips I'm wearing a bunch of ice so if you get the line they're just like a really sheer layer holy it's so metallic so that's quite cool just going to use them messengered my lip feels really really slimy like a really slippery not tacky at all it's not sticky okay I'm gonna start mixing forgot so many other random things in the hit also I want to show you so I got some of these scrubby a facial cleansing pad which is basically just like a little exfoliator and I love exfoliating my face I always have to exfoliate my face because my skin gets build up really quick like I think my soul turnover is quite high so I get a lot of that doll it did skin on my skin most days so I just thought this would be a really nice gentle option to use every other day when I'm not using proper exfoliator it's just got really gentle little scrubby bits on it so I got a pink one and I got a hassle and a monkey cream color okay also of these miss a these are like little elephants which you can balance your phone up against if you want to do like live streams and stuff so I really want to do an Instagram livestream so some earrings here little disease kind of expecting the quality to be really really yeah a bead that just fell out up stood there I've broken already the only reason I say that is because I feel like this is very similar quality to like eBay jewelry and stuff I have bought a lot of eBay jewelry and more often than not it's really bad like it'll just come broken and fall apart really quickly but every now and then you do get something really good but it's kind of assumed that it would be very similar and it is it just came aware that there's some more accessories in here so hopefully they're a little bit better like I got some chokers so this one here would be beautiful and again I believe these were all one met dollar and I got this denim one which is like a corset kind of style and this one is so cute this is the same as the black one but a mint green and then this one's a little bit fancier you can't really tell bit cool tehsil and little rhinestones on it for a little bit more glam pink light so this year yeah it's the more earring there is more makeup by the way guys and just doing some other stuff so these are stud earrings and they've got a little gem on the back of them and little tassels I think they're actually really fun if all just I make up like something real retro to change my outfit does these ones look way better quality like these ones are not falling apart at all new stuff I have a clean color Brow's essential kit this is so dark I got the shade ash brown thinking bit like a light brown but it's like uber dark but I'm sure I can work with it and I also got the brow pomade by clean color this looks completely wrong for me this is in the shade I don't even know what shade this is in it does not say that the color is like super warm at Brown like uber warm so y'know we have the LA Colors met eyeshadows these will be really good just for late transition shades I think so Italy did good let me swatch them since watch two random shows yeah those are super pigmented and not powdery at all they feel really smooth it reminds me of like Maybelline quality of eyeshadows next up this is an extra a if packaging this is the mineral blush by Cente and the shade 2 purchases - and this analysis - a cute little engraving the flower on there swatch it that color is so pretty I love it and it feels really soft it's a little bit powdery but I don't mind when it comes to face product they're a little bit powdery next up we have a contour trio by a mousse this is in the shade natural I think they don't really look like very good at contour colors but I took what I could get because I could not find any kind of contouring a product on the website that was in stock so I'll just have to do my best they look like nice colors to bronze with though and then next up I got this govt USA Sun glows shimmer bronzer this looks really pretty to be honest it's quite chunky glitter but look at that pigmentation what a joking there so I presented I got a couple more of the amuse I show singles did it and chestnut I got some makeup brushes I think these were like the equivalent of $1.00 per brush I'm kind of expecting them just to be like eBay is freshening I feel like you guys may think that I will be biased got my own brush line but I just want to try them out they'll give you my honest opinion often these cheap brushes can be good for like uber beginners like people like literally just doing with makeup and getting the hang of it this is you want a brush that's going to help with your application in terms of actually making it look amazing because brushes can really make your makeup go to the next level like good makeup brushes often really cheap makeup brushes can be a little bit flimsy a little bit less dense just not as good but you notice these are really soft just a little bit yes Lindsay like not super dense that those kind of pressures do come in handy more than you think like this one here feels really play sticky but I still feel like it might do the job there's some shading I'm not surprised honestly like for beginners I'm sure these will be fine so we'll give them a go in the makeup tutorial I also got this flash here called honey pink by Prisma and Lucent finish whatever that means it's very similar in color to the last one except more match the packaging skills so freakin cheap which is fine but literally like this feels like kids makeup like it's like bindi and then I got a pressed powder so I'll definitely use that in this true this is by clean Easter and then a bronzer by scent a bronzer and contour powder this is in the shade rose so Zoe looks like and I got a one skin mattifying primer by aoa studio so this one's obviously more I'm guessing the silicon consistency let's try it and it sure looks just like a moisturizer oh it's got bad smell that feels really nice it feels definitely a little bit like silicone II but a little bit more straightening at the same time actually feels very comparable to the makeup forever step one skin equalizer leave that color texture this will not rub off either this is what I'm wearing on the middle of my lips the metallic liquid lipstick is like completely budge proof so another HD concealer by aoa studio in the shade light ivory i think your light ivory and then I got this liquid lipstick and the shade of faded this looks so nice I love that color and then this one here is in the shade of vintage which is like a really deep rich red make sure early exercise trollies liquid lipstick this so cheap and they actually seem to be really decent truly pigmented and then another concealer and the shades beige a little bit darker we have another metal lipstick and st. which is like a really big car rusty red color a clean color madly matte lip gloss in the shade one six four five this is like a really new to kind of purply a nude color and then this is a madly matte lip gloss in the shade one six three two by the same brand like a rosy pink color which i want to swatch that I cannot get the plastic off oh my gosh look at that that's so good and then the other one which is more like a purpley movie oh that one's not as good burning maybe you could build it up and then one more in at the shade one minute six four six this one looks a little bit darker maybe it's very similar to a little bit lighter and a little bit one mood oh they smell terrible again why don't we get cheap makeup boys smell so bad I don't get it can't they just make it smelling vanilla or something like basic and then we have a bunch of these a Oh a studio lip liner here so I got like just a few colors that kind of match the liquid lipsticks I've got I got the shade vintage to match the vintage I got to the shade at bombshell I got the shade nude and the shade faded yeah I'm sure those will come in handy we'll try it about in the video and then I got this contour stick by la colors and a highlighter I don't know what could contour so anyway so it's a highlighter and yeah that's not so good it's just like really patchy and hard to draw on and not creamy and not that impressive and then the final thing is a GOI eyeliner by clean color so I'll definitely use this because it's like a liquid eyeliner and then a black eyeliner on the other end so you get both in one and that my friends is everything so to be honest I am actually quite excited to do this video because a lot of guys approach did not seem terrible once I've got them on my face of you have to give a better review of course because some things perform better on the face and some things perform worse on the face so we won't know until we actually give it a go yeah keep an eye out on my channel for my next video also water on my social media and FAFSA makes you fall new over there and we will see how well it goes I'm so excited I love it the necklaces I think business sort of freaking cute like adorable anyways I'm gonna go hear some lunch now I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and the question of the day is what is your favorite online website to go shopping on and I will talk to you guys and many fear hi hi television how can we do one more filled out so tasty breath there we go shouldn't be driving a row 
hey everyone it's so today I am doing a first impression would you really know if you read the title anyway and it's gonna be on this money here which is a drugstore brand wet-and-wild I am quite a big fan of waiting wild most of their products I seem to like there are a few I don't but most of them I do so I'm hoping this is one that is good and we're modest so affordable and cruelty-free which is amazing so this is called be a photo focus foundation I have bronze beige and soft ivory with me today it's in like a glass packaging with a plastic lid it says goodbye photo flesh bag helps eliminate white paddock or reflection it's been tested under 7 light conditions with top smartphones and with and without flesh here 30 mil which is your average amount for a foundation and US dollars and is 5.99 this is your skin only better and it says it especially made with a matte light diffusing complex to give your skin no filter perfection speakest in all of these Lighting's i love how it's like a nightclub lighting i'm not quite sure how many shades they have but it does look like that quite a good shade range they look like they've got some darker colors obviously I'm just going with the website swatches though that I'm sure you could google it so I've already moisturized names but it I've got like fluffs tucked away I'm going to prime half of my face so we can see if there's any difference with the longevity at the application the look of it I'm using it the easy way anti blemish MIT primer did I say blemish blemish prime this side of my face today this is TMI but yesterday I popped out of black heat it was like sticking out of I know he's like this hot piece of like something I was like what is that Hey look it was a black kid pops it out it literally lifts a hole in my face I'm gonna fiendin okay now I'm just gonna figure out which color I am so blue it comes on low it dipstick is the cold dipstick Teletubbies today oh no it's just cold anyway so in this shade is that bronze beige which looks decent don't mind my fake tan it is horrendous horrendous my skin started peeling which never happens it was really weird I'm and then the shank it is soft ivory so I might have to mix them there you go so yeah I'm just gonna mix them I I'm just going to nanano prime side I have no idea how much to use so I'm just going to a little more direct it's quite ready okay and then the lighter color I'm just gonna select someone just be careful it is running and it drips today I'm going to use a rounded face brush to blow a little salt okay I'm just going to stipple first I really like the undertone of these colors they're good undertone for me they're not orangie or anything hopefully it doesn't oxidize that it'll be the next thing it's very incredibly easy to blend and the coverage is quite good considering helot like slimy and slippery and finishes it's not like super thin but it's just very runny you know I do feel like it streaks a little bit so it does go on bitter when I like kind of tap it in like this or of course you could use a sponge that's kind of good so I'm kind of like buffing it first and then I just like to tap over top it's really quick to like blend that color looks pretty good let me zoom you in so it's sitting on my skin quite nicely it's not emphasizing my pores but it doesn't conceal them either the coverage is like a medium coverage I would say you can see it's honey bit of redness I'm just going to see if it's buildable so let's do it a little bit more it's gonna do another stripe of each color so many blue not it's quite runny you can kind of see what I meant love the color such a good color and stipple see like when I tap you can see where the brush goes so it can be a bit streaky so honestly probably a sponge would be better like honestly it applies amazing with a brush like you can see but I feel like with a sponge you're gonna get a seamless finish a little bit quicker so that's how it looks it does not look heavy whatsoever it doesn't look cakey at this point like you can tell I'm wearing makeup but it's really pretty and in my opinion it's quite a natural finish it's not like super matte which I like I don't like anything to metal myself and I find I can just use a powder if I want it to be more matte so I really like the finish and it did cover the redness that second time around honestly I think that's looking beautiful it doesn't cover the frequence as much but lovin it let's try it on the prime side now I can't remember how much I use so I'm just gonna go do a few more dots around the area whoops I do wish it was in like a pump because it just is a little bit like Missy with this stick it doesn't stick to the stick very well um you have to be very careful so I feel like a pump would be a little bit safer oh wow the lid feels very techy like it would break easily like you didn't yeah that um but the actual like bottle it's nice and glass and it's not too heavy it kind of reminds me of my favorite foundation by YSL diffusion ink it's a very similar taste to today like it kind of dries down to a velvety look but differently has not dried completely meant to the touch like I think you definitely would have to sit this with a powder but it yeah it really does resemble my favorite white cell foundation which I hope it lasts well throughout the day because I'd be so happy to find a cheaper alternative plus I think it's quite hard to get these days for some people I've been told it's not discontinued but I can't find it on some website so I don't know okay on it the prime side definitely it's not as streaky it really did stick to the base a lot better and I didn't have as many of those brush strokes so it's good thing cuz it's such a like slippery runny ish taste check the private it just stuck it down which was good so that's good to keep in mind look at this Nick look what is happening I think this looks so good right now oh my gosh I don't want to get my hopes up because the last couple of them first impressions I've done have not been great so I'm like nervous but I mean first impression wise like this feels so nice on my skin this freaking eyelash can you just buzz off on my nose it looks a little bit chunky where I've got some drier skin it's gripping onto it a little bit but not as badly as those last couple of foundations I reviewed so we'll see how it goes throughout the day really liking the way this looks on the prime side differently conceals may pause a little bit better it's not like a huge difference but do you think the primer worked well in this case with this foundation so I'm going to quickly check on my concealer brows powder and all that stuff we'll be right back okay so I've done my brows I've done all of my base and everything I used my no feel to concealer with my Kat Von D sitting powder under my eyes and then for my skin the rest of my face I use my covered face pressed powder the only place that looks a little bit cakey is actually summaries on that unprimed side of my face right here where I put a little bit of concealer it looks way chunkier than the other side I don't know what's happened but I thought I'd point it out other than that the rest of my face looks so flawless it feels it lovely like really lightweight if you see it it definitely probably looks heavier than it feels to be honest it looks a very full coverage and very glam at this point so I'm actually quite happy with how this looks I'm feeling positive I hope it performs it well throughout the rest of the day also something good to note is it hasn't oxidized in my opinion it still looks amazing it looks pretty much the same turn it did just before so I'm gonna go film a different video now a makeup tutorial and everything and I'll come talk to you guys later the time is currently 11:00 a.m. I am starting a little bit later today so I will see you guys later hello hello there um so it's only been on for an hour and a half but I just came back because I just had to blow my nose I just want to say it comes off very easily like where I've blown my nose so I'm just going to take my little with the foundation brush that I used earlier and just Pat on that area and we're pretty much good to go so I so far honestly feel like this is such a good alternative to the wire sell one like I just think it looks incredible it looks velvety smooth that looks amazing coverage hasn't faded or gripped onto any dry areas anymore you know then before even on my nose it doesn't even look that bad now that I have it seated with powder and everything it looked worse just at the beginning when I didn't sit oh I get to be miss I'll feel like it's ever so slightly starting to sink into an expression line up here so we'll keep an eye on that throughout the day but so far it hasn't fainted or anything like that the worst part is just that you know when you blow your nose it kind of comes off which I swear something in my eye oh I can't find I think what eyelash in my eye that's like I'm tonight gonna oh my god this was in my eye this is garbage but can you see that huge fluff I don't know if you can see how long that fluff is it's kind of like cliff it's literally like an inch long what the heck I feel better now as though saying yelling most foundations kind of smudge when you blow your nose so I'm not too bothered with that and that's obviously not something that's gonna have it every day so anyway by the way I'll link this make a look down below for you hey guys a quick update so it is a three pm cyclist on that four hours ago and I just wanted to say it's still looking amazing I can't see any changes it hasn't faded whatsoever look how perfect that still looks I was thinking more about it and like the stick I wonder if they actually were going for a wire cell kind of droop situations this is the white cell one and it also comes with a little stick so like I don't know if they've did that to copy this or if it's just a coincidence and they're really not trying to copy this that regardless so if I honestly think it's a pretty good trip so looking forward to seeing how it wears throughout the rest of the day around my mouth it's a little bit cakey but that is because I've read applied it breed applied and read applied it ivory applied it a few times and I just did a lip swatch video so I've just got a little bit extra product just around here so I'm kind of gonna ignore that because obviously that's because I've been removing makeup putting it back on removing it back on I mean like using a brush to buff it in so we're gonna ignore the immediate lip area okay hey guys so this is my second last update it is at 6 p.m. Tim PASOK's pure it is still looking amazing like I say around my lips just a little bit dodgy other than there look at this this has like not faded and almost every foundation fades on me so I'm so happy the worst I can comment on is it's a little bit flaky right here you can say it like right there and I think it's just for me reapplying my makeup around my mouth like I stay done like massaging it's kind of gripped onto it because I also have really dry skin down here but it hasn't gripped on to bed so around I knows it's barely creased it often melts right here in creases right here but it hasn't really done it too bad it has a little bit but not too bad it's actually sitting a lot better than most Foundation store around my nose I'm like pretty stoked right now hasn't sunk in true expression lines any more than last time and it still looks really nice and even it doesn't look patchy or anything like that apart from right here like I said but like the rest of it look how terrible this is look I should have pulled out my chest but anyway I'm stoked hey guys so I had pizza for dinner and then I felt really full so I told the dog for a massive walk and hike s with you right now so good taste it is 9:30 p.m. just got home it still looks pretty good it's definitely deteriorated at this point but like is it it still looks good it's just I mean it'll cut close there's a little bit of it here and there that it's not so ideal so it's Meryl Waters they like ten and a half hours I can't remember what time I started anyway it's been on for a really good time a good time a really good amount of time so like tired right now I'm actually very happy with this foundation I'm a hundred percent gonna keep using it the sweaters differently coming through a little bit so I'm not sure how to go on super oily skin like I can feel the sweat coming through but it still looks quite nice it doesn't look too shiny I have my light on and as you can see it's not like bouncing off it too bad like it doesn't look too bad I'd say the worst area is pretty much just around my nose it's got all the cakey but disclaimer I have been at blowing my nose here in this rat day I think I've blown my nose about four or five times I only touched it up that first time like I said in here it was a little bit cakey after I did my concealer so I don't think that's the Foundation's fault because it didn't do it anywhere else and his faded ever so slightly down here but it could have been the pizza it has not faded it's a miracle it hasn't faded I'm so happy this foundation is so cheap and it seriously is pretty much a droop for my white South Asian I'm gonna go to help with my friends cuz I've made all of my friends buy the white South foundation they're about to all be angry at me because they could have saved you like $80 and New Zealand the white cell foundation it's a lot of money just FYI so let me know if you guys have tried this foundation leave a comment down below if you're going to try it if you have tried it if you're not gonna try it love to know what you think if you've tried out let me know your review and yeah I'm stoked I'm so excited to try to gain one day when I'm not sick just see how it lasts you know without the blowing nose situation I'm pretty increased though usually when I'm sick or like getting over six the foundation doesn't last as well like just say him so yeah I'm very very happy I think it looks super flawless the color is a perfect like obviously most of them but the undertone it didn't oxidize it didn't cling it too badly it to dry areas and just I think it just looks pretty let me know if you agree and I will talk to you guys in my next video you 
hey everyone so today's video as promised is that the first impression full-face at video from the stuff I got in my previous haul I'll link it down below he didn't say yeah it is the video I uploaded right before this one I'm going to try out a bunch of the products on my face today and see if they're any good the previous full-faced first impressions video I did did not go well at all I mean I pulled through at the end but they were just so many products that were not amazing together like they were necessarily terrible products but they just didn't work very well together so hopefully today we've been alike so if you want to see me put stuff on my face then just stay change okay first of all let's do it some headband action now my face on my chin I've got all this dry flaky skin because at yesterday I decided to for some reason like rub my face with my towel too hot and I gave myself like carpet burn on my face so the rash it's now red and peeling doesn't hurt or anything but it just looks really ugly so please excuse that it may look really bad once I put makeup on top of that but Yolo it's fine I have extensions and at the moment like a million extensions and I just don't know how to go about my life with these in my head they just clip in once by the way anyway so I'm gonna start with some of it the Too Faced hangover 3 and one sitting spray just going to put some of this on just cheer waking myself up a bit oh oh they're so good I am so tired right now I woke up early went to get a blood test straight away which ways makes me feel like really like mad afterwards and then I went to the gym up there and busted my ass and then I go home and shower and now I am here and I'm like alright let's try this this is the j1 jelly PEC dramatic firming skin was improved elasticity and pore smoothing looks like this jae-won and it's a Korean brand which I love Korean brands so excited to try this out never actually hit a bit but apparently it's like old all that lately people are loving it or something I don't know looks like this it's like a silicone kind of product it's so sticky huh it feels like a pillow face mask this is a face mask or is it I thought it was a primer it might just have to Google this makes my skin feel so types like superglue for your skin a multitasker that firm skin hydrates and grips makeup it feels like a freaking face it's so sticky that makes sense slow to grip makeup on top of that I'm very intrigued definitely be used in anything like this before okay please don't be a fail I have some Clarence foundations right here so we can give one of these ago I'm going to go straight for the paler one cuz still pale right now but I'm just gonna check it before I like to talk about it too much because it's probably gonna be too dark still let's have a look it's all separated I filmed that unboxing video I really go and then I went overseas and then I got back and then I had doctors and I was visiting my family member and I was editing videos like crazy today is Friday it's the first time I've gotten a chance to film so yeah I filmed the unboxing like a week ago I can barely remember any details about it okay I don't know I think this is like the only foundation I have so we're gonna roll with it this is the Clarence for perfecting messes lying at foundation in shade to nude beige I also have shade at three but that's just gonna be even darkest so we're gonna try this shade it's probably gonna be too orange or too dark for me maybe we can just mix it with some other foundation if it's that bad I don't know let's just try it up Oh stuff is sticking to my face like fluff I'm gonna start with a little and then it used my flawless finish spongebuck so beauty to blend let me zoom you hey it's a very matte I don't usually go for a net but we're trying something new today guys I mean I go for met just not like this man like this is so mad blooms that easily it's quite a thick formula okay no joke my pores look non-existing like you can't see my paws at all what the heck that primer is so good and it's actually easy to bleed on top of even though it's a sticky primer the one thing is my face feels quite like dry now it's probably just a combination of the primer and the foundation so I met have a single piece of glitter on face I cannot get it off Stroeve my life okay still have some discoloration on my skin but like what the heck look how a nice and blurred my pores look they're like gone what now I need to put some of this foundation down my neck so that I kind of match screen to a little bit more foundation up here to this foundation looks so smooth I think if your dry skin though you should give it a mess because it does not feel very kind on dry skin I'm going out for dinner tonight so hopefully this doesn't look like a total disaster so this how it looks it's probably a little bit the wrong undertone for me it's a little bit orangey do I like it I like it I don't know if it's the kind of thing I would reach for again and again cuz I usually go for something with a little bit more of a glowing like a natural finish not necessarily a dewy skin net foundation but just like this is so mething gonna be fine once I had highlighter and stuff but straightaway I would say is like not a favourite of mine but it does it looks so smooth across my poise in conjunction with that primary specially but I mean it is designed for pause so hopefully it's good - by yourself - just gonna put on some of this instant light lip comfort oil by clearings this is the mint one it feels so good I love the scent of mint as well about the flavor of mint okay so hopefully I'm not wrong in saying this but I don't think I got seen any concealers in it PRM Boxing Hall so I just went for it Dix through my makeup and found the color pop and no filter concealers cuz I haven't tried these yet I got these a couple of PR package unboxings ago I heard some really good things about these to be honest so I'm really excited to give them a try and I'm going to use these to kind of hopefully lighten up they at confliction a little bit okay so I have two shades of fair neutral and fair hair ten and five I'm using fair neutral it just blew it's so lightweight just to kind of lighten up my face a little hopefully and then I'll use the lighter colored right underneath my eyes oh that's so easy to blend it reminds me of my favorite urban decay concealer The Naked skin it's a very similar kind of texture can't really comment on the coverage it because obviously I've already covered everything so easy to blend okay now let's come with fear 5 under my eyes and see if it's good this one's super yellow based the other one was kind of a neutral I like the packaging too white lid silver ring and then it's just got no filter concealer on the top okay so I use like a mild too much yeah ya did oh well it's easy to blend sir that's good I used too much but like it's still blending out really nicely it's not heavy it's not thick and sticky or anything it's really lightweight and it covers good look at that that's so brightening this is legit yes so good oh my gosh okay we're off to a good start today guys okay overall first impression on the concealers I am a fan so far hopefully they wear well throughout the day hopefully they don't crease or anything they don't look like that crease at all at the moment but of course I just applied it so who knows at least I kind of look like a Mitch right kinda I don't know this is a pink sitting powder which it gives me the shits I really want to try it I don't know should we just do like a really light dusting if it's a disaster I can always just put on something else and talk so this is by a beauty bakery flower sitting powder in pink I'm gonna take a little bit on my sponge try this under my eyes just cuz I think the pink might help to kind of illuminate a little bit too much too much it looks very smooth the concealer and the pada my under eyes look like a newborn yes she quite like it it powder kind of like brightened up under my eyes a little bit on the F of my cheek it's so bad I'm gonna try more of those beauty of bakery products too oh no I forgot to do this I suppose I haven't actually set my face makeup so I still kind of can but maybe I'll try that in a different video now we have the Too Faced Born This Way a thrill is sitting at powder love the packaging it feels quite like ooh fancy it's a little like plastic cover on it Oh two-faced living in 3016 wait 3017 I don't even know what year it is it's a little love heart no it's the little things the actual powder itself looks kind of yellowish which I like I am so freakin that right now let's go stamp loose powder and then buff it in afterward okay so overall the first impression on my base I actually think everything works decent especially at the primer and especially the concealer my color pop I am now going to do a second impression which I know sounds really strange but in my first impression for the Kim Kardashian noice beauty at contour palette the powder contour palette if you haven't seen it I'll list it down below for you but basically I was a very 50/50 on it and a lot of people asked me to use expert Beauty brushes with this to see if it's any better they're not with this little brush here so we'll do that today and then I'll try that cap on deer cream contour in a different video so I'm taking a medium face brush with this side first which is the warmer side by the way this is that the light kit which in my last video I said isn't really good for super pale people so if you are paler than me it's probably not gonna be any good this is so orange but let's try it with this brush to see if it's any better to be honest already it's better it's still very orange but just because this brush I guess is bigger it's got more bristles and everything it's not so like I don't know like this just kind of placed the product and didn't blend it up very well I guess this brush if you've got a brush like this doesn't have to be mine of course but if you've got a bigger brush like this it just helps to diffuse the color so it doesn't look it's orange and maybe a little bit on my nose okay now let's go in with a bronzer brush and in the color tone color which of course is contouring it supari now I did not my miss color at all it was more just the application that I wasn't a fan of I chiefly could see myself getting use out of this highlighting contouring palette bacon K it's not my favorite still even with these brushes it's still not my favorite favorite just the application they apply fine with the brushes but I mean for some reason they just flames like hit one day and like tossing stuff just less fussy it's fine did I have to make sure I blend it well and like you've got to be careful with the product on your brush because so much comes on your brush you don't want to put on like too much bronze or anything at once you'd rather build it up you know so yeah I don't hate it like I knew this it I hated it it's not my favorite still but I mean it's okay I just think for the money it's way too expensive I think to be honest like on my skin tone as you can see it's still a little bit too dark maybe when I've got fake tan on I'm going to have to give it another go because I feel like it'll look a lot better on me when I'm fake tend the highlight is I really did like I was a big fan of the highlighted I think she should sell these differently cuz they're really good I might use some I just want to try this as well cuz this is new this is the Beauty bakery illuminator tip-top open slowly this is in the shade it frosted I believe that's how it looks it's quite glittery but it's very pretty I'm just gonna buff it in well coz I don't know I'm not a fan of like glittery highlight it there we go now that I've buffed it it looks really pretty it's actually kind of subtle when it's buffed into the skin anyway I think this would be so appreciated on like your collarbones just with a bit of glitter it's too dark for me Yolo I'm just gonna use some of let's do this one from the Kim K pellet say with a smaller brush this is one coming TXO beauty probably not to make shield to be honest you know like this kind of size so much better than this like this was just too big in my opinion for highlighter I even usually use a brush slightly bigger than this but like this big is just really big I actually like this brush though I think I'm gonna use it for like blush and stuff I have this cheek tint curl days by Elizabeth Auden but I don't know if this will blink while on top of my foundation I could give it a go this could be a total disaster because usually I would apply this before my powder so this is how the product looks by Elizabeth Arden just try it with this Kim K brush I'm gonna try and get like a tiny amount and then I'm just gonna see it they're just gonna kind of put it on my hand oh it's so cooling you can't really see it though I need to build it up too much too much move okay Oh with the sponge oh that's so pretty it feels so nice on your skin it feels like ice if she didn't bling too badly on top of my powder okay I know I put on quite a bit but I'm just like really obsessed with this color and the finish like the formula sorry for the finish I feel so cooling it looks so beautiful it just like soaks into a skin I'm having such a good first impression day today like almost everything is good like full-on stains your skin look at this it's like it's much proof look at that so I'm just gonna quickly fill in my eyebrows with this Urban Decay brow box I'll be right back BRB oh my gosh I stole this meme the other day and it's like have you noticed how you remember I be in group chats and like private messages because we live on the internet now your mum doesn't have to like force you to disconnect so that she can use the landline anymore okay I have Mike Jacobs undercover eyeprimer oh six PS we're gonna stick with some reason oh it's skin toned yes yes okay that makes me happy literally like all of my brushes of Duty again this happens to me way too often yeah anymore I thought a little would go a long way but it kind of doesn't so we'll be generous it kind of Smith look it's like smearing my pattern foundation underneath I'm just gonna use this shinik so I Pell it quickly with the flesh tone color just to sit there and give a little coverage before I start with the other eyeshadows I've got so many new eyeshadow palettes and I don't know which one to use today I've got the color pop one I've got some Mike Jacobs ones I've put a beautybay free one and new or four ones and you Mac ones like what do I use a little bit cakey and funny on my eyes that primer it just separated my foundation and stuff from Unzen a in the inner corner looks funny Mike Jacobs what are you doing to me might be one of the first products I don't like I'm going to stop the a beauty bakery ice cream at pellets Neapolitan and I am going to take this orange why not random next with a sundae Funday this is a fluffy blender brush I'm just kind of like putting that just in the crease random leaks I've no idea what kind of look I'm going for today but apparently I'm using orange I'm gonna use that color pop pellet to feel I have done so much today already and it's only 12 o'clock so weird when that happens like when you get heaps of stuff done in the morning and you're like oh yes sweet it must be the end of the day now time to relax and then you look at the time you're like what these eyeshadows a really nice and pigmented easy to blend I'm going to go in with the femme Rose Decker Uche color pop pellet I'm going to take the kind of like muted pinkish neutral color this one right here I'm going to buff this straight underneath my lash line on the outer half I love this color I love colorful eyeshadows this so good this is no exception first impression it's great I'm gonna take a little bit of this deep into the crease as well this is a naked heat pellet eyeshadow brush urban decay just kind of blending that underneath the crease and my into the deep part of the crease I'm making this up as I go if you couldn't tell I'm going back in with my fluffy blending brush in this color just here here a little bit too bland all the colors together now what color maybe that's cause it's got like a purple reflect but it's also like gold which you can't even see in real life in a real life it looks gold on camera it looks like purplish it's so weird just taking with an eyeshadow brush this is not as pigmented I might write with my finger okay that's kind of it uh the reef litas super pink in this pinky it's like pink purple gold bronze all at once this is probably a little bit on a base to be honest like it's pretty but you can see straight under it too okay hold on let me put on some of this color on my lid I'm getting a little bit of Fallout but I'm really packing it on so it's kind of to be expected that shimmery colors are really disappointing to be honest like it's just not going on my eyelid like it looks like in the pan at all not even close pretty much just like leaving a shimmer and hits a fallout you've been doing so good still those meds I'm going to spritz my finger with some sitting spray and see if it makes it better mmm marginally it still looks pretty don't get me wrong but if you could see it or luck you'd understand what I mean like it doesn't look like how it looks it's just not working oh this smells so good ah does she sing a shimmer brush should my fan brush using a little bit of that orange increase blender just gonna bring that down the bottom - a little on my inner corner I'm going to take this shade it's like pinkish oh look at that ugly um hi Mona okay so overall the eye primer no the neapolitan pellet is pretty I like it there anything about it that I don't like is I feel like I've got every single one of these colors it's just like everywhere but they are really pretty if you're looking for like a good neutral palette they work really well and then as far as this palette goes love the mess and I'm not really a fan of the shaman's even there in a corner one is just like kind of underwhelming like it's not that bright like if I go in on top with a pencil brush the same brush with my pellet like look how way more reflective letters then that okay so that is how it the eye makeup looks it's very bright very fun I think it came out pretty I got this mascara here this is the bold and bad lash by Mac I love the packaging it's so cool it's got two different brushes so I'm gonna start with the smaller brush look at this oh that's so good oh my gosh I love this brush it's so easy I'm going to use this small brush and those inner lashes okay and then this is the other wand it's like a huge thick one the formula of this is nice it's quite liquidy but not too much that it's like splattering everywhere look quite impressed god it annoyed me so much when I was doing my concussion-like review and people like you are reviewing this way too harsh yeah anything this harsh and I was like I'm reviewing it like normal it's just going to show that it's not up to par with you know things have a similar price bracket it's like people expect me to either one give a good review just because it's somewhat famous or T really they just assume that I'm lying about everything else but I'm not like people say oh like you don't complain about critized if you watch my videos you'll see that I actually do sometimes it's just that I guess so don't try many pros I actually hate I end up liking a lot of things but you know I know those people obviously didn't watch my last full face first impression I guess what the beauty world these days like companies know what's good it's hard to make something that's terrible like you'd have to be an idiot to makes I mean that's terrible you know this is going way better than the last full face first impression I'm finding a lot more good things in this one I don't know it was kind of fun though right like single the fails as well so it finally hasn't really been any fails in this one apart from maybe their eyeprimer I'm so disappointed because I love the coconut range by Mike Jacobs I'm definitely gonna have to give it another go and see if it's any better the next time around but yeah that just went so okay weird and separating I like this mascara is not my favorite mascara I have to say but it works amazing I love this more brush why is it not my favorite you may think I don't know it is really good though I don't know I'm just not like oh my god you know I would happily use this looks even better at clothes actually could those lectures my lower lashes look like little feathers full lashes I have the sad looking lonely tray lying down in my trough so use this this is the party stick makes our beauty I'm going to use the top ones to here okay lipstick I have no idea what to do show you something fun like that maybe this one does this match I look Linus by Elizabeth I did better I think they'll match so let's just go straight in this color is it the always on liquid lipstick in demand by Smashbox that formula that's a pretty color this lash is actually ruining my day not really but fill in my eyebrows look really weird today they too doc I think that's cuz my his freshly died and freshly turned so my Hill is lighter than normal maybe I

as you guys already know the conditioner I have actually tried this before I didn't love it I don't like it that much but it did hydrate it just in real time it's only a very lightly colored product

bought this for our beach house which we were almost certainly going to get but then ended up having bad water damage and then they said that they were going to fix it for us but we just didn't feel comfortable with the level of repairs that they were going to be doing in so we decided to step back from this house which was our dream house to show you pictures sometime on my blog channel and we've decided to just wait it out and wait for another half-hour long image not much on the market right now which like we're not a huge rash we've been looking for ages late years but I mean this was the perfect house but it sounds stupid I know but the damage was bad and we were just like if you're not completely repairing the wall then we're probably not going to be keen and they weren't going to so with stiff away so now I've got a few things that I can you know I already got excited and I bought stuff but that's fine I'll just put it in the garage and so we had a beach house sometimes I

everyone so today I actually received API package from that k'kaw Beauty which if you did not know is Kim kardashian-west YouTube and it contains the new powder contour kit which looks something like this and I go all three palettes so I thought I would hop on here quickly and through a little bit demo review doesn't work how good is it review you know um these babies I have seen it swatches on Instagram some of them look horrendous nice to put it bluntly and then some of them actually looks decent so I'm really curious to see how to perform it for me this is not sponsored or anything these are my honest opinions as always I'm going to swatch each set each kit and I'm going to try one of them on my face as well and we'll see how they work on the skin because as you guys know especially face products more than anything they can perform so differently on at your face rather than just washed on your hand so I'm really really curious please good just quickly as well I did actually do a little mini review in a to check it really with me of the k'kaw Beauty stick contour stick so I'll list it down below and short I was very 50/50 on them because one they did work great so we're really easy to work with and easy to blend I just felt like that was far too expensive for how much product you got like I feel like it was a bit of a ripple I wasn't sold on the applicator so I will betray the brush applicator with this today this is a new applicator it comes with absorbent side and then a flat side as well so yeah it says these are better than the contour stick from k'kaw Beauty I'm hoping they will be and personally I do use powders a lot more often it then creams as well so good start I think I'll swatch them on my arm first and then go ahead and use them on my face afterwards just after I see what the colors are like because I don't really know if actually go for light or medium by the way I'm using my ring light today please tell me what you think of this kind of lighting I do want to get some more background lighting just to kind of light up the background a little bit of but it's just so funny outside so I'm using my ring light let me know what you think I do prefer natural lighting but yes let me know what you think I'm trying to see how much these tests cost but they're out of stock right now and they won't let me even look at them okay so according to bustled calm the kits are fifty two dollars u.s. there are five pieces in each kit which shakes out to just under live in dollars per item because you get brush and then you get four different colors in it the kit now if we compare the kit to a different powder you're getting at 7.25 at grams of protein each powder for example in a two-faced bronzer you're getting 10 grams which is just under three grams more in me at heart pocket princess you get nine grams which is just under a couple of grams more in the hourglass ambient bronzer you are getting a living gram and a Becca highlighter you are getting eight grams for only a small amount more in an EXO Beauty highlighter you're getting at ten grams and a glow kit by Anastasia Beverly Hills you are getting seven at point four grams certainly a roof small amount more than what Kim kW is giving you and finally and the Natasha - no no contour kit you get seven grams so actually a little bit less in this one so I think the amount of product in the kit is decent this time it's a little bit less than what you are getting in a single compact which is expected because it is a portable kind of palette it is kind of more common for them to have a little bit less product in them so so far that is it pretty good for the price is it worth it who knows we're going to see what it's what she's like so I'll start with the light kit that's on here they've been showing us the medium so here we have it the light kit I just dinged it anyway and then we have the medium kit this one's the medium kit and then we have it the dark kit which compared to the medium you can see it's quite a bit darker in terms of the bronzes one thing I noticed straight away is that the contour color and the light kit seems to be a little bit nicer than the one in the medium the medium kind of looks really really really warm okay time to swatch them - the first time so this is the light kit biet light highlighter initially it's portions decent this is the more pinky highlighter on the other side okay this one I'm just going to build it up a little bit it's actually a really beautiful color it's like a pinky kind of highlighter I hold it back here you can see a bit of the warmer bronzer and then the color kind of contour shade my lifes are definitely blowing it out when I get up close but I think that's decent pigmentation definitely not as bad as what I saw on some people's pages so so far that's pretty good I mean they look a little bit patchy but it's because I like piled the swatches onto my fingers when you use on your face obviously you're not going to be piling it on like that that's always going to look different a face I'm going to hold my opinions until I try it on my face because that way the true you know results fly next up I'm going to swatch the medium kit so you can see what if the highlight is a lot more yellowy golden and in one of the bronze is a lot warmer it's a very orangey kind of bronzer which can look really good speak if when you apply it not to apply too much to give you that really orange look okay so first off this is the more pinky highlighter so far so good yellow gold and highlighter the color bronzer contour color quite powdery on my arm but of course would be a different story once it's on max pay for the brush and then the warmer bronze the color oh yeah very soft part is there one swatch really nicely though okay now for the dark swatches so here is the dark palette so again you've got a warm a kind of bronzer and then you have a couple of different highlighters one of them is a little bit lighter and a little bit more like pinkish like a warmer the other one is that darker a little bit more bronze e golden so this first swatch is the kind of bronze e golden highlighter of course this is not going to go on my skin tone but for those of you who have a darker skin tone but it looked really beautiful so this one's that be more pinky one next color here is it the warm that kind of bronzer shade it's so pigmented and then the final one here this is the color kind of contour shade yeah the pan is still very soft when you touch them but that's what they will look like so now of course we need to kiss them on the face because they always look different once you force them on your face and use them with a brush slice again is not sponsored whatsoever I'm giving you my own honest opinion on my own experience not anyone elses I definitely think for me the light one today should be good a medium kit I'm a bit worried about that like contour color so once again here's what we're working with this is the light kit and I'm going to use the brush that comes with it so I usually start with my bronzer before I contour so I'm just going to take a cap of the bronzer color like the warmer bronzer you look in the bristles it does look very powdery but they're the fallout on my fingers I've just tapped it off the brush is reasonably soft like it's not the softest brush live in the US but it's not bad okay that time I didn't tip it off and it's going onto my skin quite patchy so with this product please make sure you tap it off so I'm just kind of putting that all over my cheek how I would normally Braun okay this is the light kit right yes this is the light kit I have a little bit of a tan on right now and this is even quite full-on for a bronzer on my skintone you are very fair I think it's a good way way way to die for you lucky I didn't go it would be at medium kit because yeah I'm not even through the pale right now and it's like not that wow it's quite orange okay okay we're just going to roll with it making sure the tap it off each time just doing a little bit around my forehead a little bit just on my chin and my nose okay so you can see the color now that I've blended it a lot more not as orange looking but it's a little bit patchy I don't know is differently in no stretch of the imagination my favorite bronzer I mean I've got a million other bronzers I would probably choose before this one it's just very warm I mean which could be a good thing but it's just a little bit patchy too it's not very easy to blend well it kind of is easier to blend but it just grips onto my skin funny it goes patchy as I blend it I don't know if it's the brush or the product but just just say I've just made my lighting a little bit darker so you can see a bit better okay now let's try at the contour shade which is this one here the brush is a little bit angle which I'm going to take the tip of the angled part and once again I'm just going to make sure it's have it off really well the contour color is decent again it's a little bit pitchy know how I feel about this doing only not the worst powder I've ever used but is the contour better than my Kat Von D or my Anastasia Billy Hills no I don't think so if you have those palettes and you like them I would just stick with it I wouldn't really bother with this definitely you're not the worst but for the price as well like it's not the drugstore product or anything it's really not bad but I would probably compare the quality more to like Maybelline or something rather than something high-end you know you're on I mean like it's decent but it's not like the best of the best okay so there's that I definitely made it work but I think if you were a beginner with contouring and bronzing you may have a bit of trouble with that because yes very patchy but if it's like too pigmented or what I really know what the deal is okay on to the highlighter which I'm really excited about so she reckons to use the domed aside with the highlighter I do wish the brush was a little bit smaller I feel like this is more of a contour brush almost like I feel like that would be a bit of a contour or even blush I think it needs to be a little bit smaller for highlighter that's just my personal preference everyone's got a different preference I'm going to do a 1 in it highlight on each side so we can see what they look like so on this side I might just cap it off okay it's actually really pretty the brush is too big for sure for me anyway that's very pigmented with just a little amount of product you saw right at most of it off it looks quite powdery I don't have anything against powdery products by the way on my face I actually don't mind this I'm just letting you guys know so as you can see with this lighting it is quite intense it's quite blinding but I actually really like I don't find it as chunky looking as the Becca highlighters for example like it's a lot smoother looking actually really nice like it doesn't accentuate as many pores and things as some other really shimmery highlighters do I quite like that actually ok let's do the other side I'm just going to wipe off the brush so the other side is more pinky going to tap it off I'm just going to another layer of the slide it's a little bit more subtle the brush is really good it in the sense that it really bust out the pigment and makes it look really airbrushed I just wish it was a little bit smaller so there's that side I definitely preferred that color but the sights still really pretty I would say the pinky went a little bit more natural than the other side so it's quite cool that you have a different option and the same palette there's only the bronzer and contour performed because I really like those so I'm very 50/50 on this I'm just going to put some on my nose some highlighter the highlight is I would put up there with like in a star typically whose the highlight is a beautiful as long as they last of course yeah they look really really pretty it's just the bronzer and the contoured didn't perform as well they're definitely workable I just think for the price you're paying they should be really good they should just be good they shouldn't be petty or anything like that I'm just a little bit disappointed in the actual application of them once again here are all the swatches so let me know what you guys think a visit down below I think if you are a paler than me do not go near this I think the contour in that bronzer it is going to be so so full-on on your skin tone I don't think I could use this if I had no effect at all but you can see how orangey it shows up on my skin tone and I've got fake tan on right now so that kind of sucks but anyway the brush 5050 like I quite like this side although I wish it was smaller this side I don't like as much for some reason it feels a little bit sharper on the skin whereas the psycho is really really soft and in this 50/50 as well like I really like the highlighters but not such a big fan I'll be contour from the colours by the way I've got to say the packaging I like it's just kind of the same as the inescapably Hills paper packaging I like the color of the packaging I mentioned that last time some people think there's a nude kind of cheap looking I actually really like it personally and then on the back it's got your little kind of explanation contour one contour to highlight one highlight - I just did say I do like the undertone of the contour shape though I just wish it was a little bit smoother with the application again it's not the worst in the world but a nerve the price I just expect it to be very smooth not hard to work with I feel like it's a little bit hard to it with obviously I'd be happy leaving the house like this so you know it's not terrible just not my favorite you know thank you guys so much for watching hope this video it did help you out also comment down

used the mask now and the moisturizer and I'm quite impressed by both they're really good for um sensitive skin or like irritated skin oh here we go healing mushrooms a practical and culinary guide to using mushrooms for whole body at health I love mushrooms for only in other foods like I'm weird about the texture but as long as I have it like on pizza and pasta and stir-fry or something like that I can eat them but I just don't like them just like sauteed or like you know just fry it up I'd have to have them with like another texture if that makes sense I'm the same with things like eggplant zucchini like it's just a weird texture and like tofu okay now on to the actual like beauty products so we have the oh my god exciting I use my cellar cleanser quite often just like when I'm being this is so bad when I'm being really lazy at night like especially if I haven't worn makeup that day sometimes I'm just like I can't be bothered washing my face properly so I just check on some my fellow water I use it to clean my lashes I use it sometimes to remove a bit of makeup like if I don't have my face halo on my water bag so let's the make a mushroom micellar cleansing water and then we also have it the mega mushroom skin relief soothing a treatment lotion this product contains natural ingredients which may settle for optimal performance check well Andrew will MD which is the

happened like a lot people will go this is such a late this is horrible by the way people will go to companies like especially indie companies that maybe don't you know do PR stuff very often I haven't really seen that stuff before because I guess they're more vulnerable than a big company that's gonna know it's a scam but basically what they do is they go to an indie company don't get any ideas cuz almost never works out in your favor and you could literally get arrested for it just saying anyway they'll go to these indie companies and basically be like hey my name's Cheuk so this is my youtube channel and so it's the link of my youtube channel my videos can you please give me some samples so I can do a review for you and then they put in their address and it's not me so I feel really bad when that happens to companies but if you are a company and I have emailed you and maybe you're unsure just feel free to send me an email just check with me and I will be happy to clear it up because I well I can say this right now I never asked for peer it's either organized through my management if I am looking at doing a sponsorship with a company or something like that it's either

gonna don't ice and rose gold highlighters which I think I had most of them if not all of them I need to check and I can do giveaway and then the next one has the Train rose quartz and at Pez that mixed up we have a mini gift set of the deep lip creams their lip creams are really beautiful I need to do a little like video swatches or something safe so so so many of them and I've already used them maybe like two or three times in my videos like they're really pretty though I do need to use them some more and then we have metallics which I definitely won't oak so it won't really use awfully I do actually like a couple of the metallic ones a lot it's just that I don't wear metallics very often every time I've done a video like a tutorial or lip swatches I'm often pleasantly surprised by you know certain shades I guess but in everyday life it's just never anything I would reach for you know what I mean I would always just go for like matte or cream rather than any type of it and metallic this one's a nude lip cream set actually so much stuff thank you so much you ate and then this one here is a list of lip Stoppers which are really cool this is probably more what I would wear in an everyday kind of situation if I did want something a little bit more metallic I would use a lip topper it's got some beautiful colors so okay next up we have it something from the balm it says hi Shannon was so excited for you to try on uist lunches love it your friends at the bottom fool they've got a new highlighter Bonnie Lou you guys know how much I love Mary Lou it used to be one of my holy grails it's still kind of it is but I just don't use it as lotion anymore cuz I used to use all the time and then they have these mr.right long-lasting eyeliner pencils which I love these I've got the node one and I use the node one a lot you're insane in my videos so the eyeline is I'm definitely gonna put aside I'll use them in a video at some stage but I just want to swatch the Bonnie Lou so it's darker than I thought it might be but plants still works on my skintone that's so pretty it's kind of like a rose gold like it's gold like this and then it's kind of like a pinky color like that like a pinky bronze pretty pinky gold or rose gold you know that's actually studying that it looks so beautiful medium and deeper skin tones I'm not sure for super thin skin I think I'll have to be quite fake tend to wear this but we will find out ourselves put it in my drawer of stuff to try soon next up is something from mac cosmetics or my book don't feel like I need to go through a giant walk tonight after all of those let me take the dogs out or something because my legs cramping up they need to be stretched this here well looks like something for Christmas so this is snowball I bagged smokey pink let's have a look and see what's inside so this is the makeup bag it's actually pretty cure it's got like velvet little raised fits all night like snow and inside we have this little jewel eyeshadow extra meat a little bit extra dimension I'm starting to lose it ice with we have a I like a shawl grass black and then don't we have a mascara this is a really good gift also just for anyone that doesn't wear like a ton of makeup because that will obviously get a lot of wear out of the eyeliner and the mascara and then you know they have an eye shadow to kind of experiment with if they want and it paint color is actually really stunning this is the an extreme dimension lash thank you so much Mac there's more though on this little bag we have appreciate they didn't see me a press release I'm assuming this is out so know now or I'm not sure this is the shimmer and spice a 47 sample oh my god it's like a joker a glittery color it's beautiful packaging Bowl probably never wear that color I just love the packaging so much it's kind of like a crushed glass fit if they're made sense you know when like glass shatters it looks like that really close up it's hard to tell on camera really and then there's a face powder hippie it go it dazzlingly it's kind of a tongue twister well that's pretty well looks like you kind of soft like bronzer illuminator kind of situation good on deep skin or just like it's like a bit of a all over booster I guess if you didn't put too much on I don't really want to swatch X I might give it to someone else donate it or something like that because I don't really think I'll get much wear out of it on it my skin tone but think you mix so much those collections look amazing I'm gonna have to check the collection out and see what else there is that I might actually wear you know what I makes I love the packaging okay so we are down at two at the at last for I think okay so first off these are some at designer brands all these are like they must be droops Fuller's Lancome ones but jellies shakers or like I remember what they called I haven't actually tried to link on ones but these are called lavish lip oils and this one's peach Bellini and then the other one is in the shade of pink sugar I'm just going to swatch pink sugar oh I don't know if the applicant is the same as the lang once gonna track them like I said but then that kind of shiny oil as you guys know I'm loving my tinted lip products lately with a passion well this is from Charlotte Tilbury love Charlotte Tilbury stuff as you guys know bought a lot of it in the past with my own at coin cuz it's the first time this might be like the first I've ever been sent Charlotte Tilbury maybe is that can't get into it one of those like stupid crappy boxes there's a lot in here ok so inside we have the magic cream I have actually tried this I bought this just like a little treble like sample size I suppose and I wasn't actually the hugest fan of it I kind of want to try it again but kind of think I should just like donate it because if I didn't like it last time I don't know why I'd like it now but who knows we'll see I'll decide later next up I got the Wonder glow which I already own and love I've actually used it quite a lot recently if you've watched my little Instagram mini tutorial I think I put it in one of them as well it's basically just like it's super glowy and moisturizing kinda product by the way my leaning forward right now cuz like otherwise I'm really far away and it's like a really glowy kind of priming product you can use a loan under foundation on top of foundation with your and then we have a met revolution lipstick in the shade walk of shame I think I might have this I'll have to check but this is the shade or no anything I have this one I'm thinking of a different one that's sort per se and the page is amazing you see me use Charlotte Tilbury my videos before the last thing is the film stock bronze &amp; Glow which I also own already I used to rave about this still I just took it to Germany with me if you guys watched my vlog I showed me packing my makeup I love this so much so I'm gonna save this for a giveaway thank you so much Charlotte so great as you can see I love your products already who's already hit most of it okay we have a gift from I think Sally is this vasawi yes it's

the fuck do is but I can still do a video on it if you guys would like me to its called jelly bean and it's basically like a jelly like a different texture that no one has seen before so needless to say you guys know how much I love trying out new products if you're liking my videos lately I either like first impressions full face first impression foundation first impression or holes or literally

hey everyone so as you can see today I have all my makeup on apart from the brows so I feel really incomplete right now I am doing a first impression it does it work video on this eyebrow stamp which I hold ages ago like two or three months ago I've been promising to do this for so long so I'm sorry it's been delayed but it is here today we're going to see into quark I bought this of eBay I think and I first saw this on Facebook there were heaps of viral videos like people just stepping on their eyebrows and it was really quick and easy that looked amazing so I wanted to see if it really was good to some other youtubers hair that uses and video since then but I haven't watched in your phone because I want to have you know my own first impression and I just want to try it out myself and see if it's really as easy as it looks because it did look very easy and I feel like it would be but we'll see by the way on my lips right now is laotong my lashes are the Stinnett by Expo beauty and my eyeshadow is the shine expert palette by BH Cosmetics and then my top is the shading so a white box boutique collection I am all sharing load up right now anyway so the brand is lizzie and pretty sure this is chinese it says all-star skincare eyebrow india designed specifically for chinese women eyebrows sam self-selection went carefully selected up a sponge texture skin friendly mega on the skin eyebrow powder silty smooth and delicate strong adhesion and natural skin fusion select the eyebrow chapter light that eyebrow powder fit the eyebrows gently click the burst of the perfect eyebrow I shit you not that for instance English to foreign language honestly like translation to my favorite thing ever there is so much they can go wrong with like the English language being translated into another I just love this I listed it according to the specific circumstances of the eyebrow brush or eyebrow pencil for a little repair lazy eyebrow makeup 6 seconds to get eyebrow with 3 color optional unique durable waterproof and sweat formula durable stickers do not Halo makeup lazy essential art effect so let's try it out I got the D shade 2 and it looks like this when you open it up it also comes with this little baby angled eyebrow brush so it says eyebrows and you get six gram of product and then obviously these are the steps or you've got to lift one of the right ones the eyebrows I don't think is going to match my eyebrow shape whatsoever it just comes with one eyebrow shape so what you see is what you get we are just going to dive straight in this color HL it's quite dark hopefully it's okay I'm going to dip this evenly all over okay we're going to rub rub rub rub rub now it's evenly it distributed oh no I need the tail okay now it is evenly distributed all the little sponge it's just like a sponge texture like a face sponge or something and we are going to try and line this up this is really hard to see you guys okay you put a marine here too so I'm just going to look down into the mirror oh my god it doesn't fit to my eyebrow whatsoever I am going to just kind of go on an angle and match the angle my eyebrow it kind of works I'm going to go one more time I mean it kind of works right it's not perfect so people that have really sparse eyebrows it may work I'm going to take the little angled brush and just kind of fill in any gaps it missed the very end like the tail of my eyebrow is in two sharps I would like so I'm just going to sharpen that up with the brush that they supply it I mean to be honest that was really quick too the color isn't too bad it's a little bit dark but I mean it's a good undertone so I would say if you're going to use that you definitely need it to tidy up around the eyebrow which I will do it if you can let's do the other eyebrow first you can just go ahead and clip that back in place packaging is actually kind of cool like how it's a little compact like this so you won't lose it okay so rub rub rub rub the powder with your sponge so I'm using the front half of the eyebrow stamp to the front half of my eyebrow okay moving right along and then I'm lining up the tail and just doing the first part I'm just trying a different technique for this eyebrow is not well it'll look obviously I think you're going to end very slut eyebrows us to work I actually think if you have very little eyebrow hair if you just have sparse eyebrows or if your kids don't grow or anything like that I think this would be really useful because it's going to give you the shape and then you can follow up with concealer sorry about the lighting was a little angled brush and just tidy it up but I mean someone like me that already has like Drew defined eyebrows and it doesn't really match so it's quite hard to use I definitely think the actual idea of this is great it works it's just the wrong shape for me so I'm just going to fill in the beginning of my eyebrow that kind of got missed I don't even know where my real eyebrows are anymore I'm pretty sure like that is not my eyebrow at all my wrath underneath okay anyways let's just clean up the edges this is a Smashbox concealer the studio skin 24 hour so if you do use a product like this if you're a beginner I think the step is really good too because it really does help like I mean this is probably better than how I used to fill in my brows when I first started I'm also going to conceal just under knee I got concealer of my Amish and then I'm going to use this random top brush look at--look Steven it's a little bit patchy but I mean I would happily lose the half like this which I do have to soon because my nails look at my nails I'm going to go get them fixed after I film this just filling in some gaps with the powder the actual powder is quite nice it's not too patchy considering it's like quite a cheap eBay product you know what I mean now on top of that I would take some brown mascara like I always do and like starching right now like this definitely the first technique I do right is that in one go was a lot more successful then this because I swing Duke if I we will do the exact same thing on the other side to tidy it up I definitely think the so turned out much better than this side besides a little bit cakey I used too much powder and it's gone really like patchy looking so you just don't want to use too much of the powder or hopefully once we put on this Bronwyn skirt or even it out a little luckily my roots are so super dark it kind of matches its color it's definitely not bad though like I mean it's obviously too dark for me but it's such a nice undertone it's not warm or anything like that it really does work nicely so there we have it the finished eyebrows so somebody like me that is already used to filling in my eyebrows I definitely think there's not much point to this however it is definitely good I think if you suffer from something like alopecia if you will like his jutsu most therapies if you naturally just don't really grow mini hairs on your eyebrows or if you've over plucked and your hairs are really really spiced and you just need help with your shape I think this is actually really decent I think you could go in with the stem do a nice thin layer of that just a one-pass like get the shape right and then you could go in with a little brush or your own brush if you want to use your own brush and you can just draw in like use a little bit more powder tidy up with a little bit of concealer and you've got your eyebrows done the reason is going to work great to me with purely it because the shape of my eyebrows was completely off I think it actually works really good I'm actually surprised I kind of assumed that it would be really crisp I don't know you know usually these things don't really live up to the hype they don't really live up to the viral videos that people create usually people make them look the viral video so wrong doesn't bother but then we actually get it not necessarily that good then I actually am quite impressed if there was different shaped eyebrow stamps I would totally rock it so there you have it I hope this little review was helpful such a random product but it was really fun we know if you guys have tried this before or anything some life and did a few different brands floating around with a product like this question of the day what kind of eyebrows are your favorite do you like really are dry brows ombre eyebrows really bushy eyebrows like split eyebrows my personal favorite is actually eyebrows like this like really flat eyebrows but my natural ones are super arched so I can't really pull it off so i love-love-love build of thick sweat eyebrows it's like my favorite thing is a thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and let me know what the viral product you want me to do a look on it next or like test out next or you know have a fantastic day and I'll talk to your minutes to do [Music] you [Music] 
hey everyone today I am at doing a really exciting video another kind of little mini launch situation as you guys know recently I collabed with white folks petit who designed my own clothing range I will link the video down below like all the original stuff which is still online right now you guys seem to love it so much that we wanted to create a few extra pieces for you I had so much fun and working with white folks we take it designing this extra stuff I'm wearing one of the pieces right now just quickly though I may be a mirror of a day right now like the lighting was so good at literally like an hour ago it's currently 10:00 a.m. and then all of a sudden this giant rain cloud came by and I look so orange I can't fix it like I just can't fix that orange not in real life just on here anyway I just wanted to point that out you know my foundation does not match my tears okay here's my day so far sorry just a quick little ramble got up was like yeah I'm doing a clothing haul today so I'm gonna put on some fake tan because I was pale AF and my skin is still healing a little bit I go back from the Maldives and my skin was so dry that it was just like peeling a little bit it's not sunburn peeling it's literally just so dry that my skin was like flaking off and then anyway I like put this stuff on and it's old huh can you say that so you know when I'm trying on the clothing I apologize I'm not in my best state right now I don't care cuz I'm just too excited for this video I don't want to delay it any further I just wanna get it up if you're wondering what my lip color is it is daijobu by EXO beauty my lashes one to last I'm so excited to show you guys take a look by the way make sure you keep an eye out on Instagram because we are holding a really epic giveaway as well so new stuff is mostly like t-shirts because I wear t-shirts basically every day of my life like you know when I'm at home when I'm popping out your earrings would I just hang out on the weekend t-shirts my go-to thing I just love t-shirts they're easy they cute don't have to worry about styling them too much you can wear them with jeans skirts shorts whatever you like okay I'm just gonna stand up this one here says it legit I am currently wearing a size medium they are quite like oversized with all the clothing I'm going to show you today I usually wear a size medium especially up top I'm a size 10 up top sometimes I wear a size large but I won't like this super oversized look in my Schoeneck saw white fox clothing line at the sizes go from extra small to X X X L and heaps of the other styles are restocked as well just letting you guys know so anyway and most of the clothing I am wearing today it's medium a little body like if I wear like a dress or a place so I'm gonna size 10 to 12 kind of depends how bloated I am their day I struggle with like really bad bloating go into a net repair zone just finally trying to figure out what's going on with my body anyway sorry I haven't filmed it like two weeks so I'm super talkative so yeah I'm a size 10 to 12 and I sit between like a medium and sometimes a large just so you guys can kind of figure it out for yourself if you're like judging off me or something so anyway this t-shirt hit is a medium and it says legit on the front if you guys know I mean you know it's a word I say a lot something that's very legit means it's like it's super good super awesome it feels a weird right now I don't know why I haven't even had any coffee today and I love it love love the fit of this my favorite way to wear it is in a little knot at the front just to make it a little bit like cropped and then I wear it with some denim James it's super cute love love love this sometimes I even wear it to the gym cuz I'm like hey everyone look at me leave my house normally next up is a crop top and this is one I designed also it's so cute it's got a little smoothie this one here is the size large my size medium is in the wash because I got fake tan on it typical I do prefer the way a medium fits on me because it is again a little bit like of an oversized kind of boxy of fit which is super super cute because it's not too tight it's really comfortable its Lao Chi yeah it's not restricting or anything like that and it's just called the smoothie crop the most successful t-shirt in the entire collection it was by far they can't be bothered tee which is also my personal favorite and I wear all the time in real life we had so many requests to do it in black so here is the compy bullet tee and it black I'll show you how it looks on the thing I also love about the t-shirts is the sleeves are really loose and a little bit longer I just feel like they're so flattering so yeah that's what it looks like and if you guys know me you know I say this quote can't be bothered it's just my daily mood basically can't be bothered and the last crop top this one has the word obsessed if you don't know why like do you even watch my videos I say this way too way too often I'm apparently insist about everything this one on the website is called the I'm so a crop because you know I'm so obsessed with it by the way I just want to show you how close in case you didn't see my original try on a video or look how cute the label is it's got my name on it once again it is that kind of like really floaty crop top style super casual super cute perfect for summer or for layering I think you guys will love this one and once again all of these come in the sizes extra small to extra extra extra large and then because if I stopped here like that's all my stuff if I stopped here this video would be really short and kind of boring probably it may be I don't know so I'm gonna show you some more of my favorites of whitefox boutique currently I went on there and just chose heaps with my favorites to show you guys and some accessories and bikinis as well I may not try on the bikinis right now because I'm not feeling like 10 out of 10 right now but I am going to Fiji at next week so I'll probably wear some of them and do some snapchat stories and stuff like that I'm not sure if you guys saw me doing that at the Maldives so yeah I was doing like a little like photo of my bikini each day so let's start with them Fox swim these are my first Fox moment swimsuits I'm ever going to try and I'm so excited because I've seen so many people when it's groom wearing them and they look amazing and I love the colors so I go to size lodge I hate it when I buy a bikini and it's like through tight and pinching the sides you know I don't like getting the muffin top with it so I just buy a size up normally this one here is called the Santa Rosa I love this so this is at the bottom they're high-waisted which I'm all

guys to try out the new t-shirt styles I hope you guys that love them as much as I do I'm going to stop talking now because I just for some reason cannot stop talking and also she guys in my next video 
hello everyone so today I am so excited to film this if you guys know me you know I love Rihanna so freakin much and I have very eagerly been awaiting at this launch of the Finn tear beauty products by Rihanna I love us so much but of course I'm going to have to be honest in this video as always I'm going to tell it like it is but so if I have heard amazing things about this brand and I'm just so impressed with the show branch like I feel like everyone's saying it because it is just such a revolutionary moment in beauty right now there are just so many shades like I think most of my viewers will be able to find their shade in foundation with their you are a pale girl or a deeper skin girl I feel like you will hopefully be able to find a mesh you need to check it out I'm pretty sure there's about 40 shades I didn't actually get to see it in store I bought this stuff of Sephora New Zealand which can I also say is amazing I am so much respect for that because usually here in New Zealand we have to wait months for products that are watched in the u.s. to be launched in New Zealand as well so the fact that I could go on Sephora New Zealand on the day of launch and get it and it arrived in like two days like that is so cool so much respect for that if you follow me on Twitter or Instagram you know I am like so sick right now but I just could not hold out any longer I was so excited to film today I'm filming a couple of videos today so yeah my voice is a little bit funny but I'm just feeling really happy and excited so don't think I'm like not in the mood it's just my voice it's just evening okay so I'll show you quickly what I picked up I didn't pick up like everything from the collection I kind of just ran around and picks random things and was like yep because I was so terrified that it would sell out on something which it didn't which is also amazing obviously they were really ready for the launch they didn't just stop like 2,000 production are like they've really had it full stocked which is so good so everyone had a chance to actually get in there and get what they wanted it was just such a good launch like goals anyway so we have here the match stick trio conceal contour highlight this is it the medium one I don't know if I got it a little bit too dark for me or not but we will soon find out I just wanted like a slightly darker contour but there is the concealer in here but maybe I can use all my face anyway the kilowatt freestyle highlighter Mitchell moon which I've heard amazing things about but I've also heard Raeleen team so hopefully I like it because sometimes they go for a more natural glow this is a pro filter soft matte long with foundation mini sample like the samples like a pretty litter size hopefully the colors okayish and I'll be able to take it traveling with me it looks pretty good this is the shade 210 and then I put the profile to soft matte long wear foundation and 130 and 180 which hopefully did not too pale because this is 210 and it's like pretty good who knows we'll try it out in a second but I also got the girl next door and Chic freak kilowatt highlighted chiller and another one in this one's in the shade lightning dust and fire crystal and then I got the profile sentence didn't retouch primer which is supposed to work on any skin tone and soft matte okay I am so so so excited so obviously all this just kind of like face stuff we'll start with this see how I like it you guys have been requesting me to do this everyday I was kind of like oh you know like cuz I was in VidCon when it launched and everyone uploaded their review so quickly know is I don't know what's gonna want me to do one anymore you know but I was wrong I have literally had so many requests every single day to do a fenty makeup review you know so I'm doing it just gonna go wit a sponge okay so I'm going to start with the primer I'll put all of the links to the price down below so you can check the pricey and everything it is kind of like a standard high-end kind of price range from what I've heard everyone seems to be going absolutely crazy for this stuff so I hope I have the same opinion but sometimes I do not okay first of all this is the first time I'm like hold with the packaging and it is so luxurious it's like a glass packaging it feels expensive I love the like nerd kind of paint kim k has her like a nude packaging which some people hated like right her but I said I liked it I did like it this is a little bit lighter and more pinky so there's the difference and then the frosted glass is just so luxe I'm a huge fan yeah 32 mil which is a really good amount you open it up it's got a little pump which is perfect smoother pour diffusing finish extended makeup wear so I'm just going to take to get first here we go the pumps are very small so I've taken two pumps and I'm going to put this on half of my face I'm gonna do this like I normally do first impression videos and just see if there's any difference with the application of the foundation on both sides smells like quite nice it's like quite rich it's a really weird way to describe the suit I know okay I feel like I need a little bit more it feels quite hydrating and balmy like it feels like it's kind of all notice pore filling prime as its if it feels hydrating at the same time and I totally dig it I just feel like you have to use quite a bit of product at the same time though because I'm sick I haven't actually been able to swallow properly the last couple of days I mean it sounds really appropriate um I haven't have to swallow and so I have been avoiding eating and drinking water which is the worst thing to do when you're sick but it just hurts so much to swallow so my skin is so dehydrated right now I'm skelling water at the moment trying to catch up oh my god this made my skin feel so soft I've zoomed in so you can see there is no filter on my video it literally makes my skin look like butter look at that okay who versus the other side no it doesn't look bad but this is just like but it really has kind of blurred my skin okay so far so good so for a very very very like initial first impression I could definitely see myself using this more than once I can see myself going back to that one we'll see how it performs with the foundation on top now so I have the two shades of foundation this is the box and in the third sample which is a little bit darker which I'm actually not working a little bit you know I have heard that it doesn't dry down a little bit darker so when you're choosing a shade you want to let it dry and then actually see what color ends up being before you just commit to looking at it in the bottle medium to full coverage for all long wear and white is yeah that sounds good to me at times such beautiful packaging it's the same packaging is at the primer but with a wife's eye kind of lid okay so this is shade 130 actually that kind of looks good too I don't know what's wrong with my eyes right now everything looks fine and then this here is shade of 180 I might try to shade 180 but it sure looks like it could match pretty well to be honest I wanted to get a couple of different shades because I always with a 10 so let's try this one out now I'm gonna start by doing the crunch side yeah so that's how big one pump is just there I'm just going to do two pumps and then taking my sponge I'm just gonna kind of stipple it around so it's so easy to blend it feels like quite watery like a really lightweight texture doesn't feel thick it's so easy to blend this color will probably be actually quite perfect for me right now by the time it dries down don't forget your ears people I'm taking one more pump and just putting some down my neck cuz my necks a little bit light okay that blends out so freakin easy I've heard really good things about the Rihanna Fenty sponge and brushes as well I have not tried them yeah it didn't grant them I'm gonna take a little bit more just on the pointed edge of my sponge for around my nose I so many blackheads right now as well and it seems to be kind of sizzling on my nose quite nicely anyway some foundations but I have a lot of black kids just look really cakey this is not look cakey I know I've said in the past how much I freaking love Rihanna but I'm being very honest right now like there's genuinely looks so smooth on my skin it looks full coverage you can still see a few freckles it's not like cakey full coverage it's like a natural full coverage which sounds crazy just in the sense that it looks full coverage but it still looks like skin by the way ever loose brain acts so can you Invisalign train so that's the prime side with just one layer well one and a half ways down here it is so easy to blend and the finish is like a natural kind of matte finish I think the only downside is I felt like I used quite a lot of product but at the same time when do I not so I'm gonna use a couple pumps on the other side of my face now the side is unlit primed and it seems to blend out just as well the other side feels a lot more hydrated though but we'll see how it feels and where's throughout the day with no primer because a lot of people don't like to wear primer so I want to see if it wears well you know over a long amount of time just as okay now for some reason like on this side of my face the amount of product just went so far seriously this foundation is even like pretty much covered my under-eye circles not completely but almost I am genuinely like I haven't been this excited about a foundation in a while it genuinely looks so good looks so smooth here's their close-up with a dark exposure you cannot see my pores on the side of my face with the primer and the foundation usually my poles are kind of bigger down here okay even on the side with no primer it still looks so smooth so it applied amazing on both sides and to my eyes is very dry and there's a little bit of dryness picking up but it's not terrible it's only bad when you're looking up for this close you can't see from far away it really does feel quite comfortable on the skin I don't feel it it doesn't feel heavy or cakey like yeah it just doesn't feel like I'm really wearing much foundation at all it feels like I'm wearing more like a tinted moisturizer or a primer or something so far so good seriously there is no filter on this video look how smooth that is now I'm going in to the 20 Beauty matchstick trio can still contour highlight okay they come in this like hey subha packaging which i think is so cool i mean you know it's a little bit gimmicky like it sticks together at the same time I guess it could be handy if you were traveling with them and you make a bed agent want them two'll sketcher around your handbags that kind of stick to get that especially if you did it more like this so I can see how like you know it is functional but at the same time it's kind of just like cool like I don't really care about it it definitely looks cool so the packaging is really nice and sleek kind of fits into the palm of your hand I love the color so let's start with the concealer which one's the concealer okay this one here met skin stick in bamboo so this is how it looks I'm going to try this under my eyes even though it's not super light color for me we'll give it a go okay it's quite creamy covered up that darkness on my inner corner how much product do you get you get 7.1 Nick Graham which is a decent amount for comparison and a liquid which you'd probably use a little bit more liquid usually you get 10 ml so a little bit more liquid that's how much you get keep you in mind even though it's not that long like it doesn't really look that long it is quite a thick kind of applicator okay let's try blending okay it's easier to blend that I thought it would be I don't know why but I just kind of thought maybe it'll be a little bit harder to blend cuz it's like I don't know it's quite full coverage but that blooms out quite easy there we go oh my gosh there it's actually like a really nice finish - it's got a kind of Sheen to it look it looks quite healthy I don't know if I'm imagining it it's is it's a matte finish on the packaging but I know it's me it's got this like healthy Sheen like it's not a dewy finish but looks good it looks really radiant okay I'm more impressed than I thought I would be just because I don't normally go for like cream they just start to get on my desk it gave me a friend um just cuz I don't normally go for like creams I guess like I'm usually a liquid concealer powder contour kind of girl but anyway let's try the cream contour so this is in the shade maca and this is the color here let's give it a go I'm gonna do half of my face first you get the same amount of product and this as well once again I'm going to take my sponge actually no let's do a brush this is a round face brush I feel like I'm buffing it into almost nothing like hide to blink for some reason like it's not bleeding just gonna spray my brush with some sitting spray and hope that this helps I like the color but I don't find it very easy to blend oh my nose it did that's so weird I'm gonna try a little bit more with the week's brush that makes it blink so much easier for some reason on its own not so much I'm gonna go back in with the concealer and just tidy up my face a little because I kind of blend it away a bit of my foundation so I don't hate it but I don't love it at all like I don't think I would really reach for this um it just cuz I'm too lazy to actually sit here and make it work if you love cream contouring like you can make it work I think you just need to make sure you're using like maybe I should have used my wet sponge but make sure you are using something a little bit damp to help Linda Lister the side with no primer now this is way better the foundation definitely did dry a couple shades dark I love this show but probably almost makes me when I've got a fresh f8 tan on you can see where I draped it down like to cover up my neck before and I pull it down in my chest which my chest was darker than my neck originally is really pale now in comparison in comparison in comparison anyway okay so there is the contour shade not my favorite but not terrible but you're not my favorite I don't think I'll reach for that either just using a little more concealer again I really like the concealer side I think your damp sponge is the best way to blinis okay my skin looks really flawless though like I really like the way my face is looking even though that was a lot of effort for the contour shade to blend out but my skin looks so flawless it definitely dried quite a bit darker so it is true definitely go for a lighter shade yeah now I'm going to try the Shamus can stick this is trippin and it looks like this this color is really pretty not normally something I would go for but I mean let's give it a go looks like that just like a peachy color I'm gonna try it on the other side by directly applying it to my sponge okay that doesn't work this is not like going as nicely onto my face why is like maybe it's because the foundation is dry I'm finding stuff white difficult to blend on top of maybe you need to work a little bit quicker see I'm gonna have to like keep trying these products may exposure is really dark right now you have to keep trying these products to see how I like them again because maybe it's cuz I'm talking so much that the products are drying I don't know I'm not the hugest fan of this it's just exhausting I really like the color though on my skin tone it does make my complexion look so fresh and beautiful I think so far for sure the foundation is by far my favorite I love the foundation I love the primer and I really really really like the concealer matchstick okay now I'm just going to quickly sit my foundation so I can try out the it powder I didn't pick up the Rihanna one don't know why but I'll need to because I have heard good things about it oh my god holy flawless this is so flawless and it does not look heavy it doesn't look or feel heavy like I just don't know how to describe it to you it is incredible okay so this is what the packaging looks like this one here is middle moon kilowatt freestyle highlighter you get eight grams of product which is a really decent amount in comparison you get stupid grams in a pica highlighter it hits a huge mirror which I really like okay let's watch this color on it the finger that's how it looks to really pale like whitish color I don't think I'll use this one today for like I'd like this one more when I've got police feet you buff it in it's almost like a white gold it's super pretty does look a little bit shimmery not too shimmery we also have here lightning dust which is the side and fire crystal so the fire crystal side looks quite glittery let's swatch it I know some of you will absolutely love that I don't usually go for like super glittery highlight is it is really pretty though it's a really pretty color that's how it looks and then the other side which is a little bit smoother looks like that underneath a little bit more subtle I think I'll use that one today the final one which will look beautiful on me more of a tan on or if you have more of a medium skintone I feel like you will love this donate stores on this side and then shake free is on this side so chic freakin smoke glittery oh my gosh / - that's it right there and then the most subtle side which is a little bit lighter as well okay I'm going to try out the fire crystal and lightning dust Juho and I'm just gonna use both sides but first I'll try out the more subtle side using a shimmery lip brush just like this yeah that's right up my alley it's quite subtle but not like it's not chunky or shimmering or anything it's just super glowy it's a beautiful kind of like beige color which sounds boring but it's not boring at all I really like it okay and then using a fire crystal only like highest point of my cheat barn this really amps it up it makes it like metallic this is for you guys who love a bomb like bright highlight this is something I wouldn't do on an everyday basis but sometimes when I'm in the mood it is very full on very like this it is very undeniably beautiful so do I like this yeah I really do I really like these I feel like I get so much use out of the more subtle side just for everyday wear and then you know if I'm going clubbing or something like that and I want a really blinding highlight with an extra bit of shimmer metallic then I'd go for this side here I actually really like the way that it's being designed like it kind of will work for anyone and there are quite a few different shades as well I only picked up a couple I'm quite happy I'm quite excited about this so I'll try out the other shades in some upcoming tutorials as well so we can see how they look I don't have enough to go with the sticks as well just to see if there's anything I was doing wrong today or if you guys have any tips then feel free to leave them down below so my first impression I like most of it I like almost everything the only things I didn't love were the face sticks for contouring and highlighting just found them quite dry and hard to blend where is the concealer was really easy to blend so I'm not sure what was up with that I look like Simpsons character I promise this is not accurate should we do a little flesh taste quickly okay legitimately this looks so flawless in flash photography holy crap okay I'm stoked with how this foundation is currently looking so we'll see how it looks throughout the day see you soon hey guys okay so it's been two and a half hours and this is how the makeup is looking I actually removed my eye makeup I did in another videos my previous video where I did three makeup look using the naked heat it was like a three in one tutorial I did three eye looks three different lips with the one pellet in the one video go check it out if you want I'll link it down below but anyway interests up removing a little bit of mic and still under my eyes so I used the stick this little bamboo stick it looks like I haven't even touched it like it looks brand new still and it blend it out so nicely once again like I had to kind of build it on top of existing makeup so it was buildable it's so perfect for touch-ups and now that I've got like a little bit of blush on like the contour looks pretty good I even added any other contour that is just the stick so the color actually is pretty good it's an effective contour and makes me look like I've got cheekbones so that's good it was just hard for me to blend so I'll experiment with it I'll try it with a sponge NEETs time to see how it goes I'm just so impressed so far this foundation looks so badass I love it it is just so lightweight but it looks so flawless it doesn't emphasize any of my pores or fine lines or anything it just looks like perfect skin here's a straight up like close-up of my skin it looks a little bit cakey on my nose where I've got my black kids and then once I put the highlighter on top of it in everything but that's only up close but I have to point it out to you it's there however if you look where my pores are and everything it still looks really smooth this is what's really dark watching as well it looks so nice and smooth like look how nice and smooth it looks on my skin now if I make it like actual lighting like this is like accurate how I look in real life right now like it just looks so beautiful the highlighter differently does emphasize a little bit over my like imperfections but that's to be expected it's very reflective I have some dry skin down here it's kind of starting to cling on we'll have to keep an eye on there throughout the day I'm so stoked I will continue to wear this throughout the day and I'll update you again soon hey guys so the foundation has been on for eight and a half hours now and I thought I would just jump on here quickly and show you how it's looking at so overall it has stayed freakin good it hasn't looked any more dry along my chin or anything like that so as far as people with dry skin I definitely think you can get away with it because like that's the worst it gets and that's not bad at all creased a tiny bit around my nose but nothing crazy most foundations kind of melt a little bit more than this on me so I'm pretty stoked with that and as you can see it like pretty much has not faded whatsoever so I definitely think the worst part about this foundation is it dries quite a bit darker than when you first put it on so you just need to keep that in mind when you are selecting your shade be honest I could have used the lighter shade today probably and it would have been okay the contour has good lasting power as you can see the highlighter has good lasting power they concealer into my eyes it's a little bit cloudy with like mascara and stuff on it but then again I didn't set it with a powder or anything I just kinda like lifted there so I have to try it some more but I really did like the concealer like the coverage was really good it was super easy to blend out and hit such a beautiful finish I really liked it so overall are these pros a hit or miss I definitely think hit I need to experiment with a couple of them more like that I'm cream contour in the cream highlighter at everything else I'm so happy with those highlighters are amazing the foundation is so easy to blend and it looks beautiful I love the finish I feel like it's a little bit oily over my nose it was so slightly so I'm just going to mystify let's see how it looks half of its just highlighted to be honest yeah look how much better that is so you could definitely blot during the day if you do get oily I don't get oily so that's weird for me but at the end of the day I'm definitely going to continue using this foundation I'm a huge fan think it's really good and the primer felt really nice it doesn't affect the longevity or how it applies really it just feels nice on the skin I'll have to try it with some other foundations to see if it's actually worth the price because it's quite expensive if you're worried that the foundation won't look good without the primer don't worry it still looks amazing without primer so there you go I hope this helped you guys out her back was helpful it's like the same thing just reworded into two different phrases if you want to see me try out some morphine to beauty products just let me know because I'm so keen for that don't forget to subscribe and thumbs up question of the day is what product are you most excited about from Fiji have you tried it yet I know loads of you guys have tried it if you have tried it please even know what you think I would like to get some discussion rolling in the comments about what you've tried what you like what you just like all of that and yeah I told you guys many speaker Hey [Music] 
hey everyone so today I'm doing another Jim Stern series video and I was looking at my little playlist I'll link it down below all of the gemstone that series looks I've done some like a decent looks I've done purple green red so I was like okay time for something different so maybe I could do turquoise today I feel like doing something quite the lamb and pretty and wearable so instead of doing like all over color like most the other looks are might just incorporate touches of the turquoise touches of gold to make it really like beautiful look hopefully you guys know how these things go today's video is in a collaboration with a brand I have been using for quite a long time now so I'm quite excited about this skin zenovia so Scandinavia makes some of my favorite makeup sitting sprays they really do specialize in sitting spray seeing spray is like one of my essential steps in makeup I pretty much use it every single time I do my makeup especially when I want it to last all day all night without fading and looking like crap by the end of the day like it's just essential and I also love sitting spray just because they have to stitch all any powders you know sometimes when you do your powder and blush and highlighter you get that really powdery cakey look I do feel like when you use a sitting spray it takes that away and just makes it look much more like skin like that makes any sense so shout out to your skin's and Navy I'm gonna be showing you a few different ways you can use Scandinavia and your makeup routine today they sent me so many new bottles so I'm stocked up for a long time now you guys may be familiar with the brand already if you do it here's the urban decay sitting sprays like you see me use these all the time in my videos they are actually created by skins Navy I just wanna let you guys know a quick fun fetch that I found really interesting when I was talking to the brand they said it was like a super time-consuming process creating the product because what they've done is create little like time release catch holes inside this like it sounds very high-tech basically what that means is it's like different from other sitting sprays because they're actual like active ingredients that keep the makeup likes it in place time releases throughout the day so I like some other sitting sprays may at work initially but they don't work all day long like they kind of go on and then they dry and then that's that Riz these ones just keep going and going and going throughout the day they keep working and have to say that I really do think Scandinavia is one of my favorite sitting sprays I've ever years it just work so simple is that like it works and it makes your makeup look amazing for so much longer so I do have a coupon code for you guys so you can get 25 cent off I will link it down below and that'll be active for two weeks so I'll show you quickly which ones I have here what if they actually haven't tried which is this one here the post makeup recovery spray it sounds really good though I'm typically going to start trying this it says gently clears your pores and helps prevent breakouts use immediately after removing makeup that's not that big and then we have to make up finishing spray which is just for like all skin types this makeup will hold your makeup on over 16 hours and it's for all skin types note holds so not just set your makeup but it'll hold it in place we have the oil control primer spray wherever the oil control finishing spray so you know if you are like quite oily it helps to control that which is actually going to be perfect for me today I don't necessarily have oily skin my skin is more like normal to dehydrated but today is it's stinking hot so a little bit of oil control is not going to go a mess because I get sweetie so I just like to shake the product up well and then on the back here it says to use a X and a tea formation I usually go him I put on way too much I just kind of go just but for the purpose of this video let's just do it how they say by the way like I said I love a good nozzle and these are good spray bottles which is so important like the mist is so fine look at this obviously I'll put a link down below where you can purchase this the idea was actually thought up because the creator of Scandinavia was at a nightclub and he was watching everyone dancing I'm watching they make I just like switch off and here we are and that was back in 2005 just creates a nice base for your makeup to go on top of and it feels really refreshing as well I want a glowy base today so I'm going to use some of the etat rainforest of the sea radiance drops I'm actually just gonna use my fingers to smooth those out next up I'm gonna use foundation I want to use the tight way first of the say but like I don't know why I've got so many shades I'm just gonna guess I'm gonna go with light medium sands this is one of my favorite foundations I love this one by the way I just want to say if you have noticed in the background might not shut it's because they broke in and I can't get them to shut seriously they're from Ikea and they are the worst today I'm going to use it and they sponge another little tip I'm going to take the actual finishing spray and I'm going to spritz my sponge just see it some days sitting spraying the next in with my foundation to make it last even better how's this color is this okay I think it's okay I want a more full at coverage so I'm gonna do one more I love the finish of this by the way I'm gonna churn in later today and show you how my makeup looks before I go and take it off before bed just so you can see how the makeup looks at the end of the day with all the city of spray hex tips and tricks' not really hex I'm sure many of you guys have already tried out the sitting space so if you have let me know what you think down below now I'm going to use some hot shaped tape I'm into my eyes I don't know about you guys but sometimes I find this kind of hard to blinged out so once again just by the way see you guys did want to see a top shape tape reviewer and I'm so on the fence about it oh my god I'm using like so much time today this is not even purpose I'm like on the fence I think I don't seem to have initially open the package here but a couple of packages turn our from top so I'm assuming it's in there I'm like on the fence because the shadows range is so bad I can totally see why people are upset and it's also kind of interested to see what it's like and it's coming from someone that is not obsessed with the shape tape like I'm just quite interested like I wonder if I'll like the foundation who knows I don't know what do you guys think I should do I know a lot of people are like boy call it but yeah I know they're expanding their shade range but I can see why people are pissed off like they're a mess of like multi-million dollar companies don't like they don't have the budget to create like a foolish shade range okay we're all blinged it out now it's time for Z powder um where is it so I'm using my favorite gear Kat Von D under eye setting powder just to prevent the eyeshadow I mean I like the concealer from creasing I don't know how I forgot the word just then this is just like the little Kat Von D brush that comes with it which is also really good I'm also gonna put a little bit for the my nose another trick for this setting spray if you get glasses lines use a decent amount on your sponge tip it into the sides you knows where your glasses smudge just helps to give it that little bit extra lasting tower against the mounting okay next I'm going to sit through some my face might just use a loose powder today because it's right in front of me this is the shade rail stand by los ELISA blossom that's there I'm going to use make jumbo face brush see I finally loose powders like this can look quite powdery but once again when you use the sitting spray the fixing missed it go on to sit it down and get rid of any of their extra cockiness this will be a really good test as well so I'm getting a massage today so we'll be able to see if my makeup stays on my face really like the way that powder makes my face look it's a nice color now I'm gonna take my Yvonne Chia brunson shade it to the same brush I love this bronzer so much it's all my all-time favorites look at that beautiful color and glow it gives you this really subtle glow like not like a highlighter just a healthy glows I'm just putting a like over my cheeks temples and stuff like that I'm gonna quickly use my makeup finishing spray like skin to Naevia just to see all those powders done and also help to kind of it whit my eyebrows again I don't know if you guys get this but sometimes when you have set with like a lot of powders specially loose powder you got to do your eyebrows they kind of look patchy because your brush gets caught in the powder and it just doesn't go on as smooth so a good little tip is just to use a bit of sitting spray over the area it was just kind of like so company excess powder and even everything out which helps like the brow pomade or whatever you're using go long a little bit smoother today I'm going to use my homemade by Chi Chi if you're a little bit dried up once again a little bit inside your pomade it just helps it go on so much today that you can also spritz your brush as well if you using like a powder or something just to make it go on a little bit like cleaner you get a more precise line and loose powdery look I'm going to take my turquoise liner by the way I'm inspired by I think they called like spiderweb turquoise the ones with the gold screenshotted some on Pinterest like look how beautiful so turquoise obviously like there are a few different shades of the actual stone typically it's like a greeny blue a light color this eyeliner here is cold wanna see a peacock by chichi by the way yes I have like a singular stripe of fate on my finger I don't know what happened now I'm taking a crease detail brush and this shade here called a mermaid by makeup gate look how stunning that is I'm kind of just smudging that underneath and then on a slimming crease brush I'm taking it the shade aquire I'm just kind of blending the edges just crowding my eyelids with some stay don't stray witches put straight my eyelashes wild I know chantix oh I'm so clever this is a jewel petal brush now I'm taking a fluffy blending brush with the shade need you I'm popping it into the crease and an outer corner and then taking a slim Matt crease brush into the shade dark horse and just popping it in the inner and outer corner of my eye we're doing a halo look if you did not pick up on that yet I'm bringing that across the crease softly but focusing most of the pigment on the inner and outer now next up just to make me I should have popped in the center of my eyelid you guys have seen me do this like a million times in my videos this is not new and I'm sure most of you guys probably already do this what is this fluff but I'm gonna take an I didn't shoot a brush and the sitting spree but skins Maivia I'm just really dampen that brush and I'm going to take the shade I'll end it glow just on my brush and this is going to make it even shinier than normal light look at that it looks like molten liquid so this is gonna be my like Golder threading I love this color look how shiny that is and then I'm just wiping off my brush and going back in with Island glow so it's a little bit more subtle just for the brow bone and then it just going back in with my little slim crease blending brush and making sure the edges are nice and soft I'm gonna take this look further because this is like kind of simple and like cliche like the turquoise on the bottom lash line I'm going to very sparingly use this glitter here which is called mother earth it's like the perfect turquoise it's got the equal amount of like green blowing it and it's quite a nice light colors whoa I love it this is size 2 okay so I mean this little kind of where I put the brown it's a lot more than I wanted to use whoops it's kind of aiming for it to be more like this but well so I'm just gonna do it a little bit heavier on this side to match just quickly before I continue the eye makeup I'm going it to how I didn't contour and then to highlight I'm gonna go back in with the shade Island glow on a shimmer chillip brush once again if you want a really intense highlight you can weight your brush with some sitting spray and then for blush I'm using my date night by ciate not another like type of turquoise that's super common is the one with like the black painting so I think I'll just incorporate that with the black eyeliner I was gonna do gold eyeliner but I really like how this is looking I feel like like we'll just kind of tie it to give there rather than make it look too out this I did want this to be wearable and it's getting more and more and wearable is the seconds go by like if you search turquoise gemstone like these ones here that pop up going to use my current favorite um eyeliner which is by Tom Ford expensive a of but it's amazing mascara today I'm going to use my Charlotte Tilbury full of fat lashes I love this mascara so much it's definitely one of my favorites today I'm going to use the illusion affirming lashes these ones are so pretty because they really like show what's underneath that makes the insight they've got lots of clusters so if they show off your I show a beautifully these are definitely one of my favorite pairs of blushes then on my lips I'm going to use my new XO Beauty lipstick in deja vu just to kind of warm up the lip a little bit and then I'm going to use a tiny bit of serendipity on top just to kind of just to make it a little bit more creamier smells so good and of course to finish off we're going to use them as Scandinavia sitting spray just to lock everything in place for the next 16 hours by the way this is also formulated at for sensitive skin which is really cool makers Jill wash by the way hints the hairstyle so there is the completed turquoise look I think it's so pretty and fun the glitter as I said was not supposed to be that intense but oh well I still like how it looks so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed it this simple turquoise makeup look make sure you check out my skin tone a via discount code down below all opinions on this product are my own by the way I truly do love this stuff and I think it works amazing by the way it's currently almost 11 a.m. I will see you guys again in a few hours hey guys it's starting to get dark now I just wanted to pop in here and let you guys know that it is 7:30 p.m. and this is how men makeup is looking and the reason I want is come in now it's just because I'm about to go to the gym and it's gonna get a bit sweaty so we're gonna see how it ways through the gym my eyeshadow looks just as vibrant all of my blush my bronzer my contour all of it looks amazing still and I just had a massage and I was face down so like that's pretty impressive okay I just got back from the ship it's 9:00 p.m. and I did MJ which is one of these sweeties days because I am a week AF in my add I did some leg press my back is drenched I had to dab at the sweat of my face but considering how sweaty I was it was not that bad I know make this darker and even though I was like Debian sweat off my face I feel like my foundations stay to put so well you can save a little bit paint underneath the foundation but that's cuz like if I had no makeup on right now I would be beetroot red like the color of this brush Ridge like I get some rude in actual fact this foundation hasn't really faded the coverage on my forehead on my cheeks or my nose is like perfect still like seriously look at that I'm just a bit flash underneath I can guarantee you if I waited a while and let the redness go down it would look amazing I'm actually gonna go walk the dogs now which will take me probably about 40 minutes so I might go do that and then pop in one more time before I wash off my makeup so we can see how it looks okay so I pretty much nailed it I was gone about 45 minutes or so and so a lemon hot and tired and sweaty and I just want to go have a shower but here's how many a couple looks at the end of the day I'm well and truly like sorry sweetie right now in my opinion my makeup still looks really good I did scratch this just before and it's kind of starting to move I mean it's been all the 12 hours and I could continue to wear my makeup even more so I didn't work out really hard out like I did today like normally I wouldn't really wear makeup to the gym but you can imagine you know if I was just like going about my day minding my own business this makeup would just keep lasting and lasting so genuinely I really like this stuff it does work it does what it says it's gonna do and across my heart's were on my dog's lives which is how it's really horrible but I swear I did not touch up anything even my lip color like it's obviously starting to wear off well and truly now but I mean I haven't touched on my makeup in any of these shots so this is authentic it still looks amazing and vibrant and my foundation coverage is still really good I'm still a bit flash because I've been working out and walking and stuff but you can see it's not as bad as before anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this gemstone look I got heaps of compliments today when I went out like got my nails done got the message like I said I hope you guys enjoyed the makeup look and if you recreate it please see me or photos thumbs up if you enjoyed this video don't forget to shoot the downbar for a discount code office Scandinavia and I'll talk to you guys in my next video I 
everyone so today I'm doing it you check it real with me and I'm recreating a look that I posted on my Instagram this one just hit so this photo was taken when I had my meet up recently in LA there's another photo on here somewhere I'm just trying to find it here we go here's the other picture uploaded of this look I know it's either those those so many requests to recreate this look so that's what I'm going to do today but actually I feel like first I should it get changed because this is freaking off so I'm wrong we're by the way but I'm like cooking in it who I thought I would wear gray like in the picture okay so I know you can see through the camera but I feel like my skin looks so freakin dull today like you really want to just brighten up my skin it feels crap so I'm just going to actually try out this which I show you my Sephora haul recently I like it down below if you haven't seen it yet it's called that belief the living truth first aid at 360 I kiss mask it looks like this and basically it's just to kind of brighten up the eye area you can read a little bit of information about it just they're cooling hydrating and creating a protective layer for 360 degree I kiss so it's going to go basically what it's supposed to do is just mix it in a 360 degree circle around your eye area until it's all soaked in so oh it's going to really weird taste just like hard to pick up it's like really solid but not I guess that which is like this much will do one eye and see if there's any difference in the way it looks okay I'm just going to apply it first and then it's being really gentle obviously since it's the eye area definitely feels good it feels really cooling keep see any difference it just looks shiny because it's hydrated it definitely feels good so whatever I'm going to do the other side now it smells quite good alright now that that's done they got to use it a few more times before I can give a proper review because at the moment it just feels like any old regular eye cream now before I'm going to use a glowy base just to brighten up my skin because it's so dull so I'm using the glam glow glow starter and it at the shade nude glow I really love the smell of this it's like the best smelling product I've ever smoked my life I swear like if you have a supporter you need to go into the shop and smell it and then just tweet me and tell me what you think cause question of the day what is your favorite scent so like see you two lip balm what is your favorite scent of lip balm or just anything like what do you like to spray on yourself what do you like to light up if it's a candle you know it mean just like any kind of thing what's your favorite thing I would say if I had to choose one it would probably be like vanilla caramel I also like love fruity since so it's hard okay now I'm also going to prime I'm going to use yet another brightening primer I was using a lot of hydrating product when I was you know overseas doing my makeup because all of the travel and all the airport just dry out my skin and a sucky my skin's not used to a lot of the icon like we have in common New Zealand but not to the same kind of extreme like I feel like and America was just everywhere we went like another stores and the hotels planes of course like it was just everywhere my skin got so parched I even bought a like origins hydrating mask because my skin was that bad I needed like instant hydration is such a fun trip like holy crap at the best time man how much had to follow it much fun like we will never forget that trip so I make it things happened it was so fun you want to see my vlogs from the trip they're already up I'll link them down below if you want to do like a little bit of follow me watching what if you want to watch me you know daily life okay my skin feels incredible now so the foundation I was wearing on at this day was the Laura Mercier photo foundation you know the parent of what it's called but it's just like their foundation it's really full coverage that I'm not going to use that today because it will not match me I've got like Norfolk turn on right now so I need something pale I still really want their nice a beautiful full coverage today because obviously like you can see that's like a fuller coverage plus amazing lighting we're in a hotel and the window that we had in our room hit like these really nice curtains on them you know let's share curtain the sheer white curtains it was really so outside and then I shut the curtains and I could be perfect perfect selfie lighting anyway so many years a mixture of these two foundations to find that perfect shade I've got the shade I really liked ten and this took 28 and then what I will be using to apply it is my angled face brush beauty I like the rounded ones for this foundation so I can really like this but it so usually use the angled face or the round top one and here we go pale I'm just going to like obviously as you know probably this foundation goes a long way like this right here would definitely probably cover my whole face once it's down my neck as well so don't mind if I do a little bit too much then a little bit this darkest shade as you can see neither of these colors match me so hopefully they will once I blend them together it's going to dab it all over I'm going mine isn't really dry such as moisturized it's not blending out easy don't forget about your ears if you like men you have like a breaking is play a little bit of foundation on them the actual AP when you hear up a color is pretty good I probably could have gone a little bit darker but I will be using bronzes my foundation I always prefer to go like half the shade too light because then I use my bronzes and stuff and it really darkens everything up anyway I'll link my first impression to the foundation down below if you fancy washing washing it washing it if you like a bit of full coverage you need to watch it okay like look at this thing it is a little bit hard to work with occasionally like it can be quite temperamental you really have to like blend it out buffeting it or it can go very patchy and not good everything matches really well now so go back a little bit you can see it kind of interests a little bit I was so done one time I was like really not drunk draft off kind of sweeping up makeup like me and my friends and my friends quite pale and so I'll use that I just gave it to her I didn't explain anything and she put on she was like oh she was like what is this because obviously she just assumed it was like a normal foundation and like it was so like boom because it's such full coverage with such a small amount and she was just like it was really funny maybe it's be this okay for the concealer I've been trying to get into a shape tip and this picture here I was using my collection it I'm going to use my collection concealer okay this is what I was using you can see this is well loved this is my collection concealer in the shade fair and it is a full coverage and super brightening and light without looking like creepy sometimes I'll use a really light concealer it just doesn't look good at all can we appreciate that before and after they look mmm this makeup look by the way so easy as I was actually doing it in real time it would take me maybe like 15 minutes or so like on the day of my new job obviously it took me long because I was really taking my time and I was working with creepy hotel lighting like I wish I could have used that window though so we mouth the good lighting the good selfie lighting but I didn't have a mirror that I could like take out there I only had like two my shining copolymer and this one like this and I was just like not excited to choose the bathroom oh because it was a lot easier I'm just touching out my makeup look like a handheld mirror but I prefer like you know doing my entire face of makeup using a proper I just I can't do it like this is what I use and when I used to film my first YouTube videos I'm pretty sure used to use like a full-length mirror but I turn on its side and from idea so it's like this big wide mer bleue I can't do little tiny mirrors as I said it is just touching up like a little bit of lipstick fix my eyebrows or whatever that's fine but yeah not my full face and taking a little bit of shape tape in medium and I'm just going to conceal this red dot oh it's a little bit too dark a well blended out well and hopefully you can tell mixer I'm going to set my foundation the powder I took to LA with me it was my mac studio fix powder but today I'm going to use this one because I'm obsessed with it right now this is my emerald beryl like natural onine performance wear powder foundation this starts like if ice water like you have to feel it yourself you need advice for it and feel it yourself it feels so soft on your finger it's swatches so beautifully and the color is so nice the coverage is so nice like it's just a really nice foundation flash powder I just dab my brush in wipes and can I tap it tap at a particular two tips and then again on the other side after I type it in the product again and then again mouths and then again on my forehead you get the ideas mystery it's everywhere I'm not bothering and my eggs I'll use a understating better but yet this foundation blush powder makes my skin look so low as Wallace and that my eyes was P so up by Kip on deep which is where my favorite thing part is there is a million times I despise the packaging like I'm sure she releases and get a packaging which she has to because this is terrible but the product inside is so amazing it's worth it it's worth the mess I'm just using a shimmer Shula brush hmm yeah this is exactly what I was using on the dance my eyes this is what makes my under eye look so smooth and Brad now I'm just going to a bronze and contour real quick because I just feel like a slight potato right now okay so the bronze I used with my yuan-chi healthy a glow powder and it's a variant shade too and it looks like it broke and so if you watched my Sephora haul video you know I bought a new one so this is in shade two as well I'm pretty sure they're the same note they're not all the same thing they both and shade two but this is deuce I'm so bad at like fringe deuce quits it quits here crystal and this ones that do Satan I just want to show you how they look neat to each other so I can't find this I think this is being discontinued or something and this is why always choosing my videos and rave about and blah blah blah so I thought I would get this one to replace it so that you can actually get it but this is where water may meet up and then this is the new one which I would use today but as you can see the colors are very similar this is the old one on my middle finger you can see it as the glow it's not shimmery whatsoever once you put on your face it looks so natural and just makes you look so radiant and healthy and amazing and then this is the new one so you can see they're very similar it's not the same I feel like this one's like a little bit less orange maybe but they're almost identical so if I do evidently use this in video to sleep same thing so today I'm going to use this one I love that the little stars so cute and at the brush I use was the domed fiber brush so I just kind of pack it on and then I like to put it over my cheek like all over so your cheek bone chain where I will contour because you know I contour after this so I like to kind of layer and then on my temples this color is just incredible and then up on the very top of my forehead like up here and then I'm just gonna have a little bit under my lip and then over my norsu special is amazing for bronze that makes it look so airbrushed so you can see it's really natural looking and it does look like natural connect lo Naturals I mentioned to your face and then obviously to come to our head this with me like I said and I use the zoologist here Mike favor at the moment is my domed contour brush which I cannot find so and data I will use my face definer brush and then the blush I used was melon pop by Clinique second OpenNet looks like this just same brush these my bronzer and this just really kind of blessed that kind of hand that look-ahead going on I did have a lot of fake tan on when I am had me meet up but hopefully you can kind of see the same effect with this makeup while I am to put highlighter and might as well just say it now I was wearing my secret highlighter I've got two different colors here I was wearing at the darker of the two yeah I was just changing my memory card and I snapped off my nail RIT that wasn't a bad break to be honest I like expose when they break down here this is one doesn't hurt anyway so my favourite brush to use with this product is a Gentile line brush so I love the small face brush which is at this one or their shimmer tulip which is the white one I'm going to use a shimmer trailer today okay so there is one pass can you just see the glow like it glows and that is what I'm wearing and at this photo I like a look at that highlighting it just looks so radiant and glowing like it's blowing I mean if I do like one more layer it's just such a beautiful glow and the best thing about this is it doesn't emphasize all of your like here's and pores and lines and stuff like that like it just glides over your skin it's like a Photoshop highlight it's just a glowy like perfect gooey beautiful radiant look tell the highlighter looks so I was wearing that and I just put a little bit on my nose as you can see okay now let's move on it to the eyes which is like the biggest eyebrows like what are you doing to eyebrows we need I make up one of the lectures whether the last stop start with deep eyebrows on my eyebrows that should come as no surprise I was wearing at cut brow by benefit but the eyebrow gel I was using was this the brow Hema by urban decay i think it's neutral brown is the shade it's quite dark so I'm just using a my eyebrow grooming brush and the tinted brow pomade stuff Thank You over this like combination these products the bronzer the contour the blush like I love it especially one of my favorite combinations lately now for the brow gel stuff it was so good I really like it or not I like it more than my gimme brow but I really like it nonetheless Ananas for my eye primary data it straight by benefit and I mostly use my broken fingernail to Linda and then I am taking at my shiny chocolate and I am first taking this color right at the top here I'm just going to go all over my eyelid can I choose a very fluffy at blender brush this is going to make the other colors easier to blend I'm just saying having a moment I think I lied about my blush I think I'm wearing must have and the picture below this one very similar color it's just a little bit more like deepen pinkier so lucious add some okay anyway now for the eyelid like the only for I'm using all of my eyes is a mixture of this yellow color and tarantella and to be completely honest with you I have done a very similar tutorial to this in the past so it's a lot familiar but I just couldn't say no you guys were equipped in a turban over again so I'm doing I'm using a firm blender brush today that should be wearing this look a whole lot lately just in like my everyday life once again on at my brush and I'm just kind of blending that all over the eyelid and into the crease see that quite yellow so I know I need to add a little bit more fit to your cotta color I just keep going to that I just keep going until you know I've got the color I want when you're mixing colors it's just kind of look depending on how much color you makes obviously see that color it's so pretty oh I've got a little bit of fallout to not panic I have a photo here somewhere with me looking down wearing this makeup so I can show you what it looks like here we go you can see it just here I'm also going to put it underneath and then I'm going back in with my fluffy and I'm just going to blend out those edges then we have something like that this color really makes my eye color pockets I like if you have blue or green or hazel eyes it look amazing on you actually if you've got any eye color like brown eyes as well doesn't matter I'm just saying it really brings out all of those like colors in your own so there is the eye shadow out there for the inner corner highlight and just the brow bone highlight this is where you but I own use like the tiniest milk color super pigmented you literally almost nothing and that the waterline was no so I'm using the full spectrum eyeliner pencil and nude by makeup geek and it's my eyeliner added dual wing I didn't use this product I use my next black eyeliner but today I'm using this one this is by Urban Decay razor-sharp introversion and they're quite a long wing okay I'm just not having two best eyeliners Asia is it really lumpy in here but if I keep trying to fix it it's going to change with faster like I wanted I'm gonna try fix it all good for mascara what I used was my once you do a lot of one you know they say Lord when I use but today I'm using it the full lash bloom by covergirl cuz they're ones come running out I really care about having perfect lashes I'm using falsies on top so the lashes today I'm using it Samantha though who debated this is what I wore on my meet up if you are an expert reader user they're kind of similar to the sooner or none or elbow kinda like the start the very middle pair if it was Center or definitely a little bit more dramatic these ones are so beautiful because I've got this really nice wispy and or lamb look at them so I saw my own instagramming you mm you can see we're almost done it the only thing we have left is the lip I'm a pretty sure I remember in my Sephora haul I said I couldn't quite remember which one I walked if I made up I'm pretty sure it's this one because it's a little bit more pink in the photos and this one's little bit more pink so this one is shade at 15 in the roof a lot shine I'm just going to wipe

the complete look once again I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I hope it helped loads and loads of you are asking for this so make sure you thumbs up these lashes are really pretty and really like them and a highlighter is a close up of the eye makeup is so easy like it's really effective and it really makes it the green in my eyes pop I think I might have used a little bit more yellow in this picture and a little bit less of the Terracotta so it's a little bit more muted so and whatever throw here to leave your requests it down below don't forget to check the down bar for more videos like this you want to keep watching me and I will talk to you guys in my next video [Music] 
hey everyone so today I am doing another cocktail Biden makeup look I literally just work out by then showered yet because I've got a facial later so I thought I would do my makeup have some fun and then have a shower afterwards and wash it all off because facial I'm still experimenting with makeup today so I thought I would do a crazy cocktail inspired look today well I don't know if it's going to be that crazy but I thought I'd do a Blue Lagoon so bright blue makeup show you what it looks like in case you've never seen it there are like a million different blue lagoons but they all look something like this quite a bright blue yeah I'm excited blue Long Island I mean to do this one we should screen Chaves talita that's cool it's like acidic scrambler so yeah that's why I'm doing it today I'm just going to get started and shed to you guys we start out with a little primer spray because I just feel dull this is the quick effect by urban decay should it tie back my hair because I've got bit here right now by the way this is a bralette and it's from misguided it's really cute sure the lady very aged smell super coconutty so if you don't like coconut stay far far away from it I'm gonna use a little primer I just grabbed this when I'm I draw it the first I grabbed this is a two task glow on Hydra base or some perfect me right now cos miss Draya we're done my skin feels a little bit dehydrated and I need a little bit of extra hydration often this is a really lightweight primer like it literally feels like almost nothing on your skin it feels like water so after I did that rubber face mask you know the one that I didn't really like that much the next day I woke up with it the most painful blind pimples so you see them and that holy crap my skin hated that mask full stop hated hated hated it and then this blow up this is a pimple that was already on my face it did come out and scab up and just wink really I clearly give it the benefit of the doubt and think that the masks up to draw out the imperfections but yeah still did not like it for my foundation today I'm going to use the iconic London pigment stick in to point to where am I could should cook it a little bit too pale for me what's three point three there might be bitter nevermind I'm going to use three point three so these are really creamy actually I might mix the two together now I had until probably answer croaky 2.0 you use a little bit of this too because I feel like the other colors a little bit too dark so as you can see this is really creamy especially once it's warmed up on your skin I probably can seem way too much Ben is just really fun drinks drugs when you say sometimes and I'm going to use a foundation brush today let's just use the things that's right here this is a vegan flat face brush I'm just going to buff it a blimp seems so easy I actually really like this that color explains I've been quite good my fake tan on my next saw patchy those next week do a little bit of foundation action down my neck ah Taylor I've just kind of like not really been clear turning that much this winter because it's just such a hassle when it's winter in your skin's all dry and captive almost raining all the time so the foundation is really buildable you can add a little more if you want a little bit more which I want Falana skin today so I'm just going to a little tad more you know that pretty much covered almost everything I use on the eyes too and my neck little donations is a stick form it really good for those of you who are in a hurry like I find them so much quicker to apply in a liquid and they're a lot less messy as well so good if you're on the go like if you're doing your makeup on a train or something like that they should cap it up my under eyes pretty well so I'm just going to brighten them now for this I'm going to use Estee Lauder g---men glow highlighting cream for the eyes and face so it looks like this by just like to use admire sometimes it's like a highlighter connect product to brighten up my dark circles because the coverage is fine I just need to like write in a little now I am using a well rested by bare minerals and shimmer Tila brush just to sit under my eye then watch me use my powder today I think I'm going to use my studio fix my old safe mrs. n at the shade c3 I'm just going to use it on a powder brush this is a tortoiseshell powder brush to interfere this lift in stock and it's going so good I love good skin dose okay I'm going to do it my makeup now on my eye makeup and finish off of my face and lips and legs normal I don't even know what can I make up look I'm going to do my eyes obviously it's going to be very blue heavy ok first let's do the brow I am going to use my cheesy brow pomade in it soft brows I mean actually use this in quite a long time and in the eyebrow groomer brush my brows are so here I need to plug them in some revitalash so that's product here you swing usually the tiniest amount of loads it looks so Kiki but with just a little it looks so good and then of course I'm going to hear some gimme brow on top which I'm running out of again and then to prime my eyes today I'm going to use Natasha - no no I stripped face I love the coverage on this and it makes all matches pops so good by the way I'm using an angled eye brush to blend so when I wear an idea bye you guys for a new video kind of series / not the series but just like a new video idea want to do pretty much so you know how I did make it cluttering videos I was thinking of doing like the opposite like putting my makeup away so as you guys know I often give see like millions of parcels and they have so much data to put away would you have to be interested in like a video where I put it away put it in my drawers organized and then see me like declutter when I need to get rid of other stuff and like I don't know I can always do one we can see how it goes but yeah let me know if you want to see it now we are ready for the blue okay I don't even know what like I should O's I'm going to using I mean this Dahlia color at the top could be really good okay so I've got their dubious place that palette the mid grade and then I've got this 12 shades of colored by makeup store and now I've got the Natasha - no no palette which has like the blue done bottom so I'm just going to like play with some normally I'd use my Z palette basically using my other palettes because I always use the palette so that's why I'm kind of going all over the show but you can just use any colors you are similar if you are wanting to recreate this look so looking at the image is like dark blue and white up low because of the I might just start with a good transition shade first to ease our way into this so I'm going to use a chillip crease brush and this I show here which is called preppy by makeup geek it's going to be hopefully the only little single action I use because there's a lot of nice shades and a Natasha Genoa but they're all very shimmery so for my transition color we'll just start off the blending I just want something you know net now I'm going to take this makeup store palette and use this blue color the shimmer all matte apart child and it's a little bit shimmery okay I'm going to use an eyeshadow brush with this color oh it's good and just put this on like near the added inner corner and then taking that light blue that's going to go like the eyes because the ice looks like a really pale minty blue clinical estimate it blows it didn't make sense to fling that in because I sure is so nice I'm going to save that icy blue color right down here too and then I'm going to take so I want this blue why not who is this boy here tell me very item just using the same lash your brush strokes capable of finding a new brush the edge clean okay Bank make sure crease brush it makes you kind of know start a crease with this and then I think I'll make a little bit more vibrant because a blue tint is very very vibrates I just don't want to go like bright blue straight away in case it looks terrible so this is just going to go in the crease just working really slowly because it's very colorful just a mega dots okay good so far so good I'd see on camera but kind of blending in with that first transition that brown shadow use which it she looks really nice now I'm going to take a tiny bit of this blue tiger because I bloom that on the inner part of the crease Bratton I really like that just taking that to some of that really shimmery color just sit on it my finger and it's going to go right in the middle or in below my chin over there eyelid oh my gosh there is such stunning pull oh look at that it's like foiled blending that out a bit so it was quite icy and cool I really want to use the Dahlia color from this pot here which is in this one so I think I'm just going to go ahead and give it a go first up I'm going to take this color in the corner which is a deep bright blotter on my chip crease brush and this could be a huge mistake that we're going in and then end with Dalia and using a pencil brush and this is like way more vibrant and like Blue Lagoon ish see that oh gosh it's drama I think that kind of brain still look together in a weird way because it's so different from the top blue you want to mean like it just kind of separates it and makes it look more vibrant I don't know sort of making any sense do I have blue eyeliner I sure do I'm going to use this one here cobalt cobalt blue by makeup geek I think black would look really good as well but I'm going all that so I'm going to use this shade here to highlight my brow bone from this pull it again so I can find a clean brush oh my gosh Shannon I need to wash my brushes stored in it okay I want to do some glitter let's go all out okay these are called x-ray and Madonna by lips coke view down below so x-ray size for Madonna's size 3 and I'm going to mix these together and here's how they look so you can see this one's like white but it's got like an a blueish roof flavors Class C HD on camera and then this one's just straight up like a beautiful blue so first I'm going to take the more white glitter I'm going to apply some of that on my inner corner this is just a q-tip see how it reflects that blue and now I'm taking a mixture of both of the glitters and I'm just going to put that right on the middle of my eye spring an extra little bit of glitz you can still say that shimmery it Natasha Giannone collagenase which is a little bit more like dimension kinda like a wet look I love this I love little fallout I do have a blue eyeliner so I'm wondering if I just put all out I don't know this one here is really cool because it's like a super dark blue am i doing a super dark blue to represent like the bottom of the cocktail do you not I mean so this here is called razor sharp eyeliner beta decay and shade push and hopefully this isn't a giant mistake kind of matches the bottom lashline which kind of brings it together you guys it's not very pigmented though this one this is annoying it's sort of watery cook it up like three times come on here we go that's better this is so retro this is surgical color that so much work I've had to build about like 30 times we should have done the lineup before the glitter because the glitter is making it look a little bit crooked um so there you go laughs heck I'm really obsessed with this eye makeup I know it's like really bright and probably not that wearable but there's something about it I just love it I'm going to use the ITAT lifted mascara now I'm going to use falsies today as well of course this mascara makes my lashes look slower fanned out in like curly and it's my lashes I'm going to use the Sango which is like this okay so the leash was still drying but there are the lashes on I think these ones look so pretty they kind of make your eyes look really kept i shaped you very almond okay let's move on it to the face now no idea what to match up with just like blue eye makeup I'm going to use those knives at Seaside at bronzer looks like that I'm just going to use it with a medium matte face brush just here at bronze my skin if you like blue looks so good me a bronze skin I know that's random but for some reason it's true same thing goes if you have a deeper skin tone like don't be afraid of blue because I feel like it looks incredible and now I'm going to contour with my TARDIS private glow and it bronze a brush and then that's my cheek color what goes with blue maybe like a pinky color this looks crazy but I'm going to use very pop by Clinique I'm just going to use a small amount just on my medium face brush again just like that to create it as a flash if I highlight I'm so excited I'm going to try out the iconic London illuminator and they do like my nails I feel like they're really pretty at the moment they see me two of these shades and these look so nice I did watch them by and tried them on yet we have the shade glow and shine I think I'm going to use shine today but I'll swatch them on my hand for you because they're like pretty impressive so they look like this and you can like do a little grappa room don't - swatches on my hands guys by the way I was playing with new makeup last night so that's how both of those shades look and if I just like do a little slightly spike look how bright these are this means the moment that bronze one is probably a little bit too dark for me or what I've got a lot of fake tan I think it'll be really pretty and the lighter one just like I think it's going to be perfect so let's try it out on the skin I'm going to use this Mac 164 brush and just do a few dots there like you don't need vegetable it's super super bright so just go slow and even build it up I'm going to use this brush you just leave blend to it sorry my camera just cut out but look how freaking amazing that is like this one little drop let's build it up this job will last you know laughs I swear you'll be able to like give this to your grandchildren to inherit so do another little a couple of drops I wander too much but I'm really having fun with this sexually Sibley and some of these I find so hard to blame but this one's really good actually matches my brow bone highlight slower perfectly as well okay so there's one side let's do the other side now so same process I'm just going to do a really small mouth and then cut distribute and then just dab it up and down to blend it you can use a sponge as well one more nice and use a little bit on my finger legs okay literally like this okay and I think I need to sit that with another highlighter like that is very Brad ready and I don't want to go too crazy they like loving highlighting my chin lately which is random I know but whatever floats your boat right if you did want to try any of this iconic London stuff which I've talked about the past a real life is brain I love like my favorite comment blending product as they're contour kit the cream contour gets the only one I love because it's so easy to blend if you don't want to try anything that's giving me a code it is Shannon keen and you'll get Kinston officer feel free yeah let's do it the lips I want to do like something pinky you will beat you or something I'm going to use the lip liner in legally pink by chichi first and then it's Ana lipstick I'm using a sweet experience by neck I look just so freakin dry I apologize and status to completed look you know why I actually think this look is way too bright I mean it's cool but it's crazy bright I don't know I think we need something a little bit less intense pink a little bit more subtle I'm going to do a little concoction of a bun too and Meraki this is Ubuntu which is just like an ode actually that issue looks quite nice do you think because this is like a pinky nude so it kind of it complements the blue and the pink and the cheeks alright logically like that I was going to mix a little bit of maraca which is like a peachy pink but I think I like it is is this is it they completed a blue lagoon look okay how do you think I did did you think it looks blue Laguna Sh I definitely think that is pretty good and thank you guys so much spear ruler thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this little

[Music] 
hey everyone so today I thought I would do a full face first impression but trying to use a full face of just drugstore makeup as much as I can anyway yesterday I filmed a huge by the way I work because I literally just woke up in Charlotte in Here I am I do have coffee I'm like waking up slowly yesterday I was filming my declutter putting away makeup kind of video and I saw I had heaps of new drugstore makeup so I thought I would use it we're going to start with this wet and wild at base primer cover all its promo helps your fine pores that fill fine lines brighten your complexion and even your skin tone it's brand-new you get 25 ml of product oh it's like this really thick almost like a moisturizing consistency it feels like a moisturizer when I go like this to accept even thicker they don't moisturize err this is giving me the creeps a little bit it really does kind of blur I don't know if you can see that on camera but in real life my skin looks really really smooth like it looks like I have no pores it feels so good it's filled in all of my pores and it looks so smooth and it kind of gave me a nice glow as well and it doesn't feel real heavy like professional or anything like that either pleasantly surprised that kind of skid me at first my floor would be real slippery but it's not real slippery it's definitely smooth but it's not like you you know like some silicone prime is like make your skin feel so just too over the top slippery so I'm just putting that away in my drawer that primary cuz I like it by the way I'm not a drugstore snob I think there are definitely some amazing drugstore products I just feel like it's more hit and miss in high-end brands I feel like high-end brands and more hits you know I like they get it right more often where I sometimes drugstore stuff is so so wrong but it's not to say like I said I think there are so many amazing drugstore products oh I hope I find some new amazing favorites today okay so I have a couple of different designer brands foundations and I thought I would do this foundation in this video because if I did a whole video all about it I think designer brands is mostly just like a New Zealand and perhaps Australian brand so it's not like a worldwide accessible kind of product so I've got a couple different shades here one of them is called the 24 hour foundation full coverage and then the other one is a glowing coverage so I'm just gonna use whichever one matches and both of these are vegan so I really hope it's good so this one here is in the shade light scent which looks so pretty good under trying on my beard Ted pale that's their 24 hour long wear the foundation and then the luminous one is in the shade of classic ivory which to me sounds like it would be paler but I don't know if it is paler because the bottle looks darker it's more orangey slightly like it looks like it would match me but I can tell by the undertone by the time I put it all over my face I definitely think it's too orange the other one's got more of a like yellow kind of undertone so I'm going to use that one today so yeah using the 24 hour long wear foundation let's do this and I'm going to use a flawless finish spongebuck so if you need to apply it today cuz it's just my favorite lately I haven't even been using makeup brushes oh the primer let me show you this close flaking a little you say that like I scratch my skin oh I got foundation on my nail but I like to scratch my skin and like these little flakes of primary came off whoo see how it looks once the foundations on top hopefully it kind of sit was it down a little um yeah sorry for the lighting it's super shadowy it's like real sunny outside it's quite early in the morning but hopefully you can still see what I'm doing if you're wondering why I like the sudden my face looks darker more in the shadows always lose because the side has more Sun people sometimes like to say that I could never fill in my high perhaps properly because what eyebrows darker than the other but it's because the side of my windows brighter than the side because I kind of sit to one side of the window almost so there you go that's why sometimes it looks you know a little off so those foundations are really easy to blend um the coverage is really good as you can say it's like completely covering up the rudeness with my veins so it's a little bit sticky when I'm using my sponge my sponge is kind of sticking to my face I don't know if that's the primer or the foundation okay gonna put a little more foundation just up on it my forehead I have to say it's kind of drying or more to a pinky finish so I'm glad I did not use the other color look it starts off quite yellow but then I don't know if it's apologizing a little bit or just drag down a little bit not like pink or orange but just a little bit loose yellow the Foundation's not blowing me away but it's also not bad like for a really affordable foundation this is much better than the affordable foundations I had you know a DX's to when I was a teenager okay on my nose and all my cheek the more I bling this in it's like peeling off my face I don't know what's going on with this I don't know what's the prime mold of that nation but like see here like it's just peeling off as I'm blending it okay this is weird I wonder if it's the primal the foundation that's really strange oh gosh it's got like none doubt on my cheek we completely missed this entire area it's got a really a beautiful finish it's really smooth my pores look so nicely blurred it's just that it's kind of peeled up in a couple spaces like where I've like blended on top of like when I've tried to layer it it's just like peeled off it's really hard to see on camera and it's kind of sitting down a little bit so it's not too bad but it's definitely a bit weird and worth mentioning if it looks a bit dodgy just here okay there's definitely a couple products that I may not have drugstore products for I think I've been your concealer either so I'm just going to use my trusty lights 20 no filter concealer buy a color pop just a little bit under my eyes so yeah anything I come across that I don't have which I think I've got most things here anything I don't have I'll just use a different drugstore product okay so for what powder I don't think I've tried this before you guys can correct me if I'm wrong babe don't remember trying it so this here is the Maybelline master fix sitting at powder and it's just like a loose powder it gives me like makeup forever vibes I may have tried this I don't remember this is open so maybe I'd to trap I like almost like her not remember actually looks for my videos to see if I do stood be anyway we're just gonna use this today because it's kind of like a first impression because I can't remember anything I've got such a bad memory I'm not usually a huge fan of loose powders by been using my Too Faced one a lot I don't know if I'm crazy but I feel like that just removed hates of coverage under my eyes like my under eye area looks really dark after that but on my face it looks fine and it feels so soft and it looks really meant it hasn't emphasised any lines or anything I'm gonna use that these extender brows silky fibers by designer brands this is not sponsored by designer brands by the way I just got seeing hip stuff from then like literally they're like proper like five is scary and I don't have any instructions and then to fill in my brows first hand I'm just going to use this I've never tried it it's the wind wild ultimate brow kit this is in the shade s Brown season mirror and closed I'm trying to figure out if those pops out oh my go away I think it's in the side it's so cool look at that the fresh start my brows I'm just going to sit down the powder and everything I don't think I've used this before so well this one's a brand new one but I remember buying it but I don't remember trying it and I don't know where it is so this is the problem when I try like hundreds of new products every yeah I can't remember what everyone tried well they usually can but I can't remember this is the wet and wild photo focus sitting spray so we're gonna try this this is croce free chair smells like nail polish remover or something feels really refreshing but it smells terrible I'm just brushing it through my brows and mix it with a little bit of that I think that Doc Brown will be too dark for my hair color okay so far so good it doesn't look patchy yeah I don't mind it it looks really nice and natural so it definitely isn't like a Holy Grail but I think for a drugstore you looking for a drugstore option it's not bad at all once again the cyber eye looks darker because of the lighting it's not actually darker trust me okay now for the terrifying but the extender brow let's simplify this I'm not sure how you're supposed to use this because I feel like it's just gonna go on dusty I don't know if it's doing anything but like it's making my brows darker like filling in the gaps Gherkin it's a literally flying everywhere just sit that down I'm just using a brow gel this one is by Milani it's the tinted fiber gel is someone you use a drugstore but I just feel like those fibers are gonna fall everywhere cuz they're like not sticking down with anything I definitely think they work like they made my eyebrows thicker but I don't know I just don't know how to stay put so I don't trust it so I'm using this I don't think it looks bad at all and you know how the primer looked a bit weird when I was about to put on my foundation like it was kind of flaking like you can't tell now I'm not quite sure what the deal with that is but it's obviously like still working fine before edge of my makeup I want to use this to contour blush and highlight so this is the rimmel london kate coral glow trio I did swatch it yesterday when I was doing my literal declutter video I'm gonna take a bronzer brush with the contour shade it's a very powdery powder but that does not bother me because it's going on really nicely I'm blending really nicely and it doesn't look patchy color is pretty good too like it's not too orange I do feel like it's got a little bit of a shimmer throw which is obviously quite odd they look so bad on that side though why that's really weird and I don't know what product is making this happen because this side looks fine that's okay a little bit patchy on that side but fine on that side so moving along I'm just gonna dip the same brush into the blush color which is really pretty these powders are very easy to blend quite like them and then the highlight shade which was really pretty also this is like right up my Elliot so not shimmery it just glows oh my god I love it that's exactly the kind of highlighter I love to a quite intense but it's just not shimmery okay I'm a big big fan of that highlighter love the color too it's just like a white gold kind of color that's so pretty okay so overall I think this is - not sure I have been here but apart from there like there was no other issue okay so for my eye makeup I'm gonna keep it really simple today I'm going to use this eye shadow I mean no eyeshadow eyeliner an eyeshadow base this is the LA girl intense stay auto line and this is very soft because I just took up the lid kind of dropped it on my hand in snapped off and it stained my skin I tried to wipe it off with water and it's not coming out so obviously it is a long way it's very soft which is a good thing in my opinion even though I like it broke I'm okay because that's saying to me that's creamy and with eyeliner I needed to be creamy I don't like stuff eyeliner so you can say that pigmentation I'm just gonna pray that it's easy to blend so don't screw up my makeup once it's on it's on it's smudging out a little bit but it definitely sits in place pretty quickly actually you know what I think that looks good I'm just using the edge of my sponge with whatever's left on it from earlier just to tidy up the edge love that color did I say what color it was I'm not sure it's in the shade blasting Brown so far I'm digging this like not bad not bad at all oh my gosh actual eyeliner I quite like the packaging too it's quite classy it doesn't look cheap or anything which is always nice I just like something that feels like it's kind of good quality I don't like something that it feels like it's just gonna break any second this actual packaging feels quite nice it's even go like a little grip on it like the Elizabeth Arden pencils which is really cool okay I'm kind of leaning in a different shape on this eye which is a fail hopefully we can pull it together I love this color it even looks pretty just like that for something that's quite like smoky like if you did taking the scar and stuff but I'm gonna do just so minimal eye shadow I'm definitely keeping this there's like heaps of colors too so I will definitely be using those in some tutorials in the future because I really like that formula hopefully it lasts really well in the waterline too because you know that's important as well okay the affordable drugstore like obviously this is not really drugstore because it's color pop it's an online brand but it's very affordable so I'm just going to use these I chose say I don't have any drugstore zeros I don't think anyways I just really wanna use this this is the I think I love you a priest powder eyeshadow palette so pretty I'm gonna take the Mets brownish color here and just pop that and to the crease this is blending like a dream I love color papaya shooters by hoping no one to dislike a couple of the formulas it was that the theme Rose appellate I did a first impression on and I was kind of like to some of the shimmery color oh my god this so blendy so smooth anyway I'm some of the shimmery colors I was like no that balloons out like a dream coming quite smoky on the lower lash line too wasn't meant to but it's happened you know how it is like oh yeah I'm gonna do natural makeup today no no your hands will not let you this is a firm blender brush by the way which is perfect for blowing out color into the crease and applying the color I love it just like this but I feel like I need to experiment with one of the shimmery colors I love this Laura like just a matte look oh love I'm gonna try this color here just something subtle it's like a woman Brown shimmer shade just taking on a pencil brush and that is really pigmented I don't know why I'm using of his brush tool but I just grabbed it was like they don't do I should really be using a pencil I mean I I should rush because this is gonna take oh yeah yeah this is stunning I like this shimmer better than the ones in the other palette I tried then just taking up my firm Linda brush again to buff out any edges cuz I want this look to be superb Linda I think really blended smoky eyes like this a very sick series so cream just I don't know her just all the teens from the eyes there goes the lighting but you can see those beautiful shades so lovely okay using another pencil brush I guess I'll just use this shade here there's not really another highlighter shade and I'm not blowing her alive I promise it's just this ugly lighting all of a sudden cuz glad came through here we go going back going back coming back I'm just gonna leave that like that wipe off my brush and then take this pale yellowish color for my brow bone I like this palette so far from those like four colors I just tried and definitely going to continue to try this there's this watch one of the more like foiled looking eyeshadows because those were the ones I had trouble with and the last palette so like this one which is really nicely oh my god they call is nice that was the coop it's like like molten bronzy Rose Goldy just beautiful I may have to do another tutorial using this at some stage kiss that's freaking it beautiful I'm gonna use another one of the eyeliners this one here is in the shade deepest Brown get it open I hate these like the little plastic sleeves I can never do it right they always snap so yeah deepest Brown let's see how it goes on at the waterline I feel like it first it was a little bit hard to put on but once I kind of like warmed it up a little bit it was perfect so even if you want to just say what it's brand new just put a little bit on your hand I think that last one went oh I'm so clean because I smash it on my hand like I see it I think it just needs a little bit of time and then it's so creamy and pigmented I look like a baby bird I'm missing oh look I'm just putting a little on my edge with lower lash line so I'm gonna smudge that down with that pencil brush and that first brown shade you definitely need smudge them quick because otherwise they sit in place and don't move which is good okay let me fix this like color balance cuz it looks really hideous okay this color harness a little bit more realistic now so you can see the eye makeup I'm going to do winged liner cuz I have a new eyeliner to try actually first I was me to try this let's just put on okay peel here how do i peel i need tweezers to open this this is one thing I hate about drugstore makeup I hate how it is like so I mean stickers all over the packaging I know that it sounds really peachy but it really annoys me when they come off and then they're all sticky and I believe it's molting though okay I'm gonna try using the little epic under it comes with it's a little funny little plasticky thing I'm gonna use the brunt so this is the Milani shade one the face oil I shine oh that's pretty the applicator works well super glue Marie it's like the Magnusson it means that make nificent middles by Stila and I'm gonna flip it over and use the pale fish I'm gonna mix the two pale colors together the pale pink in the pale yellow a little bit well that's bright okay here comes the lighting again and now I look bright orange yellow ooh Oh too much wow that's pigmented okay apparently I'm drinking it along the lower lash line a little now true pigmented should not be a concern I mean a complaint but I just need to be more careful next time obviously I'm just gonna blend it with my brush a little bit to dull it down so don't want to be that bright I want it to be like smoky it still looks good so I like this for sure everything that's good I like it a lot so like I would say I'm definitely doing winged liner have it this one here not just on animals liquid eyeliner by wet and wild bigger why not the applicator looks like my favorite type of applicator but I have to say when I pulled out the probe I'm gonna see if you can see this when I pull out the prior looks like real sticky no no it's not doing it now before it was like oh like stringy which was really weird liked ah so we'll see how this goes I love the applicator though the little firmer tip type of applicator these are my favorite but liquid eyeliner I just think they're very easy to use oh I've got fallout I don't even notice could be from oh it's kind of bad okay this must be from the color part because oh it's everywhere in there it's eyebrow fibers which actually it could be because they're kind of stringy looking I'm just going to pet them into my skin because I can't get them off look they're all over my nose looks like black kids and actually up close I just looked at my pores up close naturally it looks like the foundation has sunk into my pores look at this so at first it was going strong and now look foundations never do this on me I thought that was fallout on my nose it's actually just foundation in my pores holy crap my paws don't look that bad without makeup on whatsoever so literally this foundation is just sunk into every single pore on my face and it looks really bad oh my god I've never had this happen I don't think I've ever had this happen with any foundation oh my God look at that all around my nose it's just like something rotten could be a mixture of the prime end the foundation I have to try the primer with a different foundation that I know I like because I really liked the feeling of that primer God even like my mustache look at that oh my gosh it looked so good at first and now look at it and that's been all of like 30 minutes who I am other bursts I'm never using this foundation ever again okay moving along we're gonna have to just put up with pause I'm gonna wash this off later I'm just not gonna wear makeup to my appointments because that's actually making me feel so self-conscious it looks like I've got full of blackheads just sticking out of my face like seriously okay I just have to show you one more time like look at that one there that looks like a full-on blackhead and I promise you're like I was just marveling myself at how nice and clear and smooth and my nose was this morning like I had no blackheads or anything and I was like wow my skin looks so nice I used this really nice scrub and my paws were so clean and tight and I use like exfoliated liquid on my face I was like wow my skin is looking so good this is like a perfect base for makeup what the heck my paws don't normally look like that sorry I'm being so dramatic listen to me oh look a bit bleeding does this dry matter hope sir Oh God who's getting to the Corinthian more thick okay she thick okay this like literally little five is falling off of my eyebrows that's why I make up okay anybody using that again either it definitely works it's just me CAF now trying to Mitch it okay that one looks a little bit better than the other side it doesn't seem to be bleeding anymore I think the first time I went in maybe there was too much product on the brush and that's why it bleed a little bit cuz ya not having that problem now cuz I'm taking a little bit of the edge of like I'm taking the edge of the tip of the brush just wiping it off it's really easy to use the formula is uber uber super black I think the only thing I don't love about is how it doesn't dry completely man I think it's meat to be met like it's definitely not like a shiny finish but it's got a little bit of a shine to it but it's not like for drugs don't win like it's still pretty mitt a lot of drugs and ones I find is so shiny you know what I actually quite like this hopefully it lasts really well throughout the day it's a little dot up here a little dot here they can't get off he's just gonna stay this so I'm gonna keep this definitely just don't put on too much it once otherwise yeah it fills out a little bit but now that it's completely dried like I said it's got a tiny amount of shine it's not like the most met of matte liquid liners I've tried but you only think the next one might be a little bit more matte but like I still really like this the pigmentation is so dark hey mascara which one should I try I've got won it by winning mild I feel like I've used hate to wet and wild also got this Rimmel lash exhilarating endless grower complex and fiber mascara sounds creepy okay it doesn't look like a fiber mascara thank goodness I love fiber products like mic gimme brow is like a kind of fiber II product I'm pretty sure but I don't like just five is you know I like I like separate two fibers I don't mind it in progress so let's try this I like the wand by the way it's like a nice thin one not much product comes out on the wand now I just stare myself it's definitely a little bit yeah I don't know if you're gonna be able to see but my eyelashes look super thick okay yeah it's deeply clumpy you see I don't know if you can see oh the waterline eyeliner looks a little bit patchy it's not too bad like from far away it doesn't look pitch it's just really close this I'm remove mascara though makes your lashes super thick and really long I don't hate it it's not my favorite just cuz it's a little bit clumpy like to clumpy for my liking but I know some people like that look so if you like rather clumpy mascara you might like this like it's quite not drying for me a little bit just thick look at some thick formula I think I like it on my lower lashes better than my top lashes the brush is really good it's like a hot out comb so you can really like pre-elections with it like I can feel it working my nose is looking worse and worse and worse and also really close up the foundations kind of sealing it around my nose and like around my mouth like into fine lines like really small ones you can't really see them from far away but I think if you had like more wrinkle to skin like any fine lines or anything it'll like sink into those because I barely have like any fine lines around here but like I can see them with this foundation I don't normally see them so the mascara I'm on the fence about I don't hate it by doing it like I'm not in love it's like wiped pitch and flushes just here I can't hit the roots blonde eyelashes are the worst leave a comment down below if you have blonde eyelashes as well they are like honestly a curse I'm so jealous of people that have like natural black eyelashes I'm not even like a natural blonde like I just have blonde eyelashes sucks might give its mum to try like I don't hate it like I said I definitely would use it if it was the only mascara I had use it quite happily I just think that in my personal collection I have but ones that I prefer more so it's not much point me keeping it for myself I'm just gonna go over my waterline the eyeliner to try and make it a little bit more even actually I think I'm using the wrong color I think this is the one I used on my eyelid oh wow it looks good it's pretty eye makeup let's try some lessons I've never tried does the claim I don't think these are drugstore but I just want to try some new lashes today they buy iconic London I don't know the stars because they put the styles on the play stick on the outside so I ripped it off without realizing and now don't know which each citta called so I'm just going to show you and then you're gonna have to figure it out so I think we'll use these ones today would just see me natural see me dramatic like they're not very long but they're very thick these actually feel so similar to my party stick lashes which I ran over on my chair earlier okay I'm just using some ital lash glue Oh sometimes this glue stings my eyes I mean sometimes it doesn't it's so weird I like them they look very sexy you can see the difference I hope I take back what I said they're definitely not natural they actually look longer on your eye then I realized I'm looking at them and the box the other mascara is not too bad but you can definitely see us a bit clumpy but I'm gonna do lipliner from the same la what is that la girl I was gonna do read lips because I've got read on my top but it's have a say and look at what like this shade is this is a la girl lip fi style one swipe intense creamy color lipstick it's in the shade rave oh my gosh it's non-retractable weird i swatched a couple of these yesterday when I did my declutter and I didn't realize that they are non retractable so they've got this little clicky but once you pull it out you can't take it back so you need to be careful don't put out too much otherwise you're screwed okay so that's like a pinky red color so I'm gonna take a right read it look liner mmm umm this is the LA go ultimate lip pencil and it's in the shade a relentless read very close to the mecca color and I hate this freaking plastic seriously who wants to come my friend get rid of all this plastic I can't get it so let's try this excited because eyeliners are so creamy and I love creamy a lip line is all about that creamy life haven't done a red lip in a while I'm excited so yeah this is a bright pinky red like it's deeply a red but it's got pink undertones okay so it's definitely very creamy so it's not giving you a super sharp shop shop shop to find wine but you can only tell that really close up and I'm not too bothered on that if you do like a bit of a firmer lip liner to give you a sharp line that's not this product like if I want to shop a line out just ceil afterwards feel like I'm using a lot of product but it's cheap obviously it's not ideal you know what I'm saying if this was like a mech why not be like I like this I'm gonna keep these little items official you'll be saying these are round again okay so this shade is brave I think I see that already looks like this it's like a pinky color but because I'm putting on top of the reed it should look pretty read this is very creamy kind of smells bad like it smells a little bit like plastic cherry without being cheery it's not like strong I can only smell it when I apply it so that's good what just happened here Shannon well honestly I'm so tempted to get some look fellas not a lot not to make my lips much bigger I guess I kind of just want them to even out like this lip is so like round and then this one's like pointy because it's not full on the outer corner or is this one's really full on the outer corner and then this side is more fill at the top and this one's flare up the top so they're like opposites also I heard someone online getting it for dry lips which I have stashed dry lips I don't know if that's true like is that just an excuse like I say I got lip fillers because I have dry lips or does it actually help to wear straddlers that's what I want to know Hamish is like very anti me getting lip fillers you know it's my body I think from a boyfriend point of view he's worried that maybe they'll feel different or something like maybe my lips will feel hard or he's worried that I'll end up looking like one of those botched woman on Bravo or something I don't know probably what I end up doing it because I never do it's like me wanting a nose job I'm always like oh yeah I want to know this job that I'm like oh I actually quite like my nose and then I have a day where I'm like I freaking hate my nose so I might hold a nose job then the neat style of it again same with my lips really like today I'm hitting a day where I'm like I hate my looks but most days I'm like I like my lips you know okay anyway I'm just gonna go blow-dry my hair and come back I feel like this lighting sucks thank you guys so much for watching I think my product of the day probably the LA goal line is like the lip line is the eye line is I also loved the Rimmel contour little thingy even though for some reason on this side it was a bit dodgy I'm thinking maybe I didn't sit the foundation properly or something like that I love that color pop palette - beautiful calories and yes so there is the finished look there's lipsticks a little bit sticky weird thank you guys so much for watching it let me know what video you want to see next let me know if you enjoyed this video and if I should do some more because I can totally do more I'll just put aside in my drugstore stuff I'm like on the fence about this like the lipstick I like how pigmented and creamy it is but I don't really like the smell and I'm not a huge fan of products and like the slim line kind of packaging I just find them wrong misty I get them so filthy I don't find them as easy to control like with my lip shut I think it's my lip shape a canyon is a nicer line as I can with like a traditional lipstick shape where it's a little bit more pointy place thumbs up if you enjoyed it and if you and you here don't forget to subscribe I upload three videos a week most the time otherwise usually to awake yeah [Music] 
hey everyone so today I am doing my monthly favorites these are my January favorites and kind of like before that as well some of the things I'm going to show you how actually things I kind of wanted to show in my 2017 favorite but it was a little bit premature since I've been using them as like you know the last couple of months but anyway at least just straight and I've got loads of stuff to show you and like some total new holy grails like I'm in love first of all at the Steeler magnificent metal is glittering glow look what I shadow I want every single shade of this product because I'm obsessed I'm going to show you a few of my favorite you have seen me use these in about two or three of my tutorials and I just use them in my real life as well real life sound so 18 are like my everyday life off camera they are so pretty I like to use them just like all over the lid in the corner they are beautiful pigmented shimmery the loi they don't crease they don't fade I don't transfer they stay put and they're just so incredible so these definitely it deserve a huge shout out if you have not tried them yet and you love like glowy glittery products you need to these are like 10 out of 10 they're amazing so I'm going to swatch some so this one here is a smoldering it session holy crap like come on kiss a net , which is so pretty on the inner corner I love that one rose-gold it retro oh my god I think this is the one I wore on me is even my New Year's Eve it get ready with me video I'll put it down below this one a smokey storm which is the most perfect taupe color like holy crap look at that I am going to be a broken record in this video because and they're not finally something a little bit fun this is Sunset Cove I wore this to a festival and received a lot of compliments it's a lovely like light blue i likey pink kind of draw chrome color yes I will it list this makeup tutorial it down below next up is a foundation that you guys have seen at my first impression on this I'm sure I will link it down below also and down below I will also link my review and comparison of this foundation versus my wife cell fusion ink foundation which is like $100 more or something like that this is super affordable it is the weight and wild footer focused foundation and I have just been loving this and my first impression loads of you guys did agree loads if you guys went out and bought it it sold out in so many different places but a few of you guys did say that you hate it so you do need to look at reviews on this product for me it works super well it is so lightweight the coverage is really beautiful it's buildable and it doesn't fade on my face throughout the day which is a miracle yeah it's so cheap and the colors are amazing it doesn't oxidize or anything like that like it looks so good throughout the day so I'm very happy with this find once again check the down bar for my first impression and reviews and stuff next up is a eyeliner that I actually bought for my I think was my best sellers on mica was it o highest rated on mica I don't know I'll link it down below this is it the tomforde i define a pin and i am obsessed with this i've been using it pretty much almost every single time i've done it my liquid eyeliner since that video I've taken it traveling with me it's just so trustworthy like I know when I use this my eyeliner is gonna look good I am using it today it is just so easy to use it's so black like so pigmented and super pitch-black and net and it just lasts all day it doesn't crack fade it smudge anything it's just so good the only thing I don't like about it is it's double sided with the small side and for some reason on myself the small side bleeds however the normal side which is the side I use it looks like this with a longer brush tip this side doesn't bleed so I don't know what the deal is but it's fine I just use the side it is very expensive but I definitely can see myself repurchasing this because that's how much I like it the little brush is so easy to use nice notice that man don't think I've actually used on my channel but I've used it a couple of times in real life and I just had to mention it because it is pretty amazing this is the pocket princess chroma paint shadow pot by Tarte I like to apply this with my finger to get a really shimmery effect I was watching this again I used a brush like this one this one is dirty I need to clean it but this is the round eye brush are you something like this to buff it out so if I use this is dirty but you're getting if I use the brush you can really like feather it out and it still gives that bit of shine like look how soft that is and then if I use my finger it is like molten liquid and it's so shiny look at that if it wants to focus oh my god it's amazing so the way I use this is I simply take my finger and I put it all over my eyelid and then I take my round eye brush and buff out the edges into the crease even though it's got that kind of Sheen to it in the crease it still looked so amazing at Peter with a red lip and oh my goodness I was obsessed this stuff lasts all night it didn't crack or fade or crease or anything like that on me and the pigmentation like it's just so stunning I love the color and I believe it comes in different shades as well I need to check that yeah I love it I could stare at the swatch all day long look at that it's like the tiniest amount Tyrion is still only thing you're like it goes for miles nice top let's switch it out with some body flush skincare product I actually have a few skincare products and I am it so started with old dammit there's no makeup - anyway this is the tea me green tea a facial scrub holy moly I have been using this to death ever since I received it of being like on a bit of a exfoliating buzz lately like trying out lots of new facial exfoliator and this is definitely one of my favorites as many you say not just animals this is not sponsored I have been sponsored by tea me on my vlog channel this is not sponsored this is legit so this is how much I have used it so far I probably use it every second day sometimes every third day if I forget it is so good so my skin it gets really really gunky I have to exfoliate quite often because my dead skin cells just build up so quickly I end up getting blackheads my skin feels really rough and it just doesn't look great but it starts looking very dull so exfoliating obviously solves that problem this money here I love because it is so gentle but it's still like very hardcore if that makes any sense like it's so hydrating but it's still so scrappy at the same time like the texture you will not know what I mean until you try it yourself it's almost like a whipped kind of texture smells like matcha tea which I love oh so good Bo once I use this on my skin my skin feels so soft smooth and so hydrated it's like magic this hair is a body product back I've talked about this in the past actually but I just wanted to mention X I've been using it to death this past like month or so here in New Zealand it's summer and sometimes I just cannot be bothered fake tanning so I've been actually using this just alone I use it with my loving tan at tanning me and I just like buff it over my pale skin and I used the shade dark I think there's a dark one in this as well but I usually shade dark most often and it just gives my skin a fake tan look like it looks natural really but you know what I mean it gives my skin a 10 and it's instant and it washes off and it's also got the shimmer throw which makes your skin look super hydrated and just glowing I love this stuff I have used it in a video in the past HTI thing have you said in a couple of videos in the past but it's so legit I also use it on top of my like fake tan skin sometimes as well just to give like an extra boost of color I make my tank Dhaka gives me like a dish shimmer and hydration this one is actually a brand new bottle because of my one I'm using at the moment is in my luggage because I'm picking it for the motives I'm up to the Maldives next week probably by the time you see this video I may be the barrel back but this is how it looks it is a beautiful beautiful color and if I just put it here like usually I use a met like icy age because it's a little bit loose me see you can use your fingers if you long and it just gives you the most beautiful instant bronze and it's so pretty wait to make up quickly so this hat is by Charlotte Tilbury this is like a rediscovery I think I mentioned this in one of my favorites videos like a year or two ago but this is the full fat lashes mascara and it is so good I just we the salon like in my real life everyday life and it makes my lashes so I think curly and illuminated aluminized is that the word voluma nosed voluminous oh my gosh okay me like think of what the word is is that right I don't know anyway it does it all it's so good I love this mascara it's so black it's so beautiful it's so easy to use the formula is so perfect it's not too thick not too runny I'll show you at the wand just looks like this is a very standard wand but it works really really well obviously Charlotte Tilbury is a little bit more of an expensive at brand but if you're looking to try a new mascara I definitely recommend trying this why not being that loving it expect it's getting here quickly so just started using this I've used it about five times and I actually like to use it before I do my makeup so this is the touchid gold Camilla Camilla Camilla beauty oil no camellia camellia camellia beauty oil by touch it you can use this on the face body or here for deep hydration I don't know what it is about this oil versus like my rose hip oil in my ho ho but oil or my sunflower seed oil or anything like that it's just so good I've been loving using this before I do my makeup it just makes my skin it's so plump and hydrated and makes my makeup glide on top like I honestly don't know why it's better than the others but I just feel like it is better than the others just for hydration like I'm just try my fingers and oh my gosh first of all it smells amazing and it just soaks in it so quickly it's actually very very lightweight compared to the other wheels I just mentioned like it's very very liquidy and I just don't know like it just works it's so so hydrating plus the packaging is absolutely like adorable like look if you're looking to spend a bit more on your skin care like I definitely love this I'm going to continue to use it at night as well and I'll update you guys once I've used it all up what I thought of it final thoughts kind of thing next up is blush is it a surprise because I mean I've been using this blush in almost every single makeup tutorial lately for the last couple of months this is by busy at and it is the professional preview blush palette in the shade of two rose coral I want to buy all of the colors because this formula is just so incredible and the colors are so beautiful I think the only colors I haven't used yet at the two darkest ones because I kind of feel like I'd use them more in autumn winter here in New Zealand it is spring/summer so I've been using these two colors the most and then sometimes I'll mix them together obviously like the swatches I'm not gonna do them justice because they look so much better actually on the face but you can see the pinky color and the coral color plate especially this one I'm so obsessed with that before mural these are just so it soft and smooth easy to blend pigmented but not too over-the-top although you do need to be careful of the darker colors of course especially if you feel like I am the formula is just amazing these are very expensive but I feel like if you were a makeup artist this is gonna have almost anything you need especially since you can mix them together and also for like any skin tone it's really made me you fall in love with blush all over again I'm a huge huge fan of this so yeah I definitely want to try some more of the colors because I just can't get enough of this for the longest time I was either just using my clinic pop blushes or it's kind of like skipping blush and just using bronzer I'm taking those like every time I travel as well I love it so much and I take it with me when I travel that's how you know I like it and then the final product I'm going to talk to you about today is a face mask and I've used this about three times in this last month even though it looks very full obviously you only need a little bit at once so this is gonna last me a very long time it's got a many fingerprints on it anyway this is the origins a clear improvement active charcoal mask to clear pores and I am just so impressed with this for a choco mask like a lot of the time they're quite heavy feeling this one's quite thin and you put it on and it dries really really like thin like it doesn't feel to hit me when you wear it I know that doesn't really matter but I just like it it says on the back head active charcoal acts like a magnet to draw a deep tamale pore clog is the white china clay absorbs environmental toxins and then a little if this ELISA thing ELISA then dissolves impurities without all that stuff down their skin breathes a sigh of relief honestly when I use this I just genuinely feel like Mexican feels soft it looks clearer my paws on is obvious I get very huge pores down here this is like my problem area I get pimples and blackheads and I start getting more blackheads on my nose as I get older I just really think it works very very well I love origins face masks I don't think I've actually used one yet that I haven't liked but I just really really like this one so often when I've done a face mask I have reached for this one and actually the other one I've been reaching for a lot is the one that looks like this it's like the same brand in the same range it's like the face mask version but if you look in the website you'll see it I love that one too but yeah so I would mention that because I've really been enjoying it I might even use that later tonight because I'm just thoroughly enjoying it so those are all of my favorites for this month I hope you guys enjoyed the video and found something new to try let me know down below if you're interested in any of these products in which ones and let me know what your favorite product of the month is because as always I'm always looking for new stuff to try and if there's anything you think I should be trying you gotta let me know because the girls got to have a girl okay I will talk to you guys in my next video I have a really amazing day bye you 
everyone so today I am filming a check here Rudy with me just like an old-school relaxed Chetty using newer and older products no theme I love my chit chat get rid of the videos lately I've just been like fiend videos like top rated products or full face of new products like whatever it is so today I just want to come on here and try some stuff use some old favourites some new favorites chat with you guys like I already said I'm just repeating myself you get the idea so I'm gonna jump straight in and don't waste any time because knowing made this video already be eight years long sorry if you can hear the fan on it is so hot in here that I can't even function I wasn't actually going to film today but I just really felt like filming and chatting I don't know I'm in one of those moods so yeah the lighting was kind of terrible before I feel like it's getting a little bit better but see how it goes I'm gonna start out with these Scandinavia it's sitting spray well this is the primer spray oil control and saw the high I just want my makeup to stick on not sweet off I feel like my face because my aircon blow it away I love this okay so I'm just gonna start with primer um today this is the first one that was right next to me I've been loving this lately like normal it's one of my all-time favorite drugstore primers I've ever used sorry if I sound a bit tired kind of an and this morning I woke up by the way I tell you what it is this is the Maybelline master prime love this stuff woke up this morning and oh my gosh got hit in the face with Fifi there so if you're wondering when my eyes are betrayed I've not been crying I am not upset I'm in a very great mood I just AM like dying inside and outside and my eyes were like glued shut ever cup it was so bad and I sad nasally I sound yeah like I've just been crying my eyes out but I really have been I promise woke up like an hour and a half ago to be honest I'm still jet-lagged from a trip to the Maldives even though I got there four or five days ago I got back I'm still jet-lagged like I'm struggling the struggle is real and now for foundation I'm going to go to big story so when I was in the Maldives right before I wane I did my first impression on the huda beauty of foundation and really loved it I'll put my first impression it down below and so I took it some more days it actually ended up being way too pale for me decided to use like eight tons of bronzer which was such a fail but I broke out so badly while I was away and I put it down to at the time just travel the seawater cleaning out my skin and the plane and you know just the travel or the air conditioning and stuff however then I remembered people saying that this did break them out and then when I did my first impression I wrote know lots of people said that it did break them out so I'm not sure if it's this so today I'm gonna try this again and I'm gonna see if my skin it breaks I'm still kind of recovering and there's a more like scars but like my skin was so bad you guys like at the worst I've broken out in a long time so I'm going to with us today and then update you guys and see if I break out no in a few days we'll see like how it looks thing is slow I was breaking up before I started using as well as away but I did use it that one time for the first impression so I don't know if it's this or if it was the trebled so we're gonna test it because I really really really love this I want to buy a darker color but I mean I'm not gonna commit to a darker color until I know if it breaks me out or not because if it breaks me out I'm just gonna have to part with it keep you guys updated I thought it'd update you with that but other than that other than the uncertainty I'm like obsessed with it I hate the smell of it like I don't hang smell but it's just so strong that I wish it just didn't have a scene because it's foundation I feel like it doesn't need a scent I'm just using a flawless finish sponge-on this out hopefully those matches okay I didn't really get much of the ten when I was away my back is more tan than my front and then my face kind of got a ten coverage of this is just insane like it's really good coverage and it doesn't feel too heavy I hope I'm not one of the people that breaks up I have a feeling it might be this but we'll soon find out like if I break out in the next couple days some people did say in my vision version that the ingredients for this foundation are like really not good like they're very blocking ingredients so that's such a shame hopefully they bring out another foundation one day with like bitter ingredients cuz she's obviously got a neck for like you know the way the foundation sits and feels and looks it's just like the ingredients I guess it's like my perfect color as well like such a good color for me like it literally I've got a little bit of ten but once I put my powder on it should be okay oh I'm so hot right now oh my god I'm like so over heat right now and I'm actually off to Fiji next week with my mum cuz I'm taking her for a bit that she's never been to an island like that before which I booked that before I knew I was kind of motives so it's like I got back from the Maldives I have like a week in between which is now and then I'm off again oh it's really exciting but also like I feel like I'm just gonna sit in the pool the whole time and like stay away from the Sun because I'm just over the Sun although apparently there's a cyclone over there at the moment so hopefully we actually manage to get over there and hopefully everyone over there's okay I have no idea to be honest how bad or you know whatever it is cuz I know that it is cyclone season I'm pretty sure like with cyclones over there sometimes you know they're okay and then sometimes they're not okay so I have no idea what the situation is and I need to look that up before we go Fiji is one of my favorite places to go for it I've been a few times now I just love how close it is to New Zealand because nothing is close I'm using um shape tape by the way just cuz it was right next to me it's still not one of my favorites but I'm just like trying to fall in love with it some reason I don't know it's not really working yeah like I was saying like Noah Islands a close to New Zealand so Fiji is quite nice you know Fiji and raro on that but I think features is my favorite I'm like slowly dying my nose is so you're like runny and blocked at the same time right now I just oh hey favorite serious little words you guys should comment down below and let me know if you have like real bad hay fever I really need to try it honey trick you're supposed to eat like a tablespoon a day of local honey or something like that it gets your body used to the pollen or I don't know if that's how it would be I should really try that I'm going to use my under eye setting powder my summit bisque by b.i minerals with this Kat Von D brush this is like the exact same kind of brush is the jewel petal brush makes my beauty I don't even know what kind of look I'm doing today by the way like I'm just completely winging it like I just felt like chatting to you guys so I don't even know her like what I have in mind I'm getting a lot of requests just to do like a chill get ready with me so it's here and then over the rest of my face I'm going to use this powder by ever fix and that gu tweenty looks so yellow I know but like I don't know when you put it on it's not so bad so once man Hamish oh we were away we finished the American so TV shows I'm talking about now we finished the Americans which I loved I definitely recommend it I thought it was so good so I can't wait for the next season whenever that is and then we finished the unit bond is it Unabomber manhunt you know something like that the one about the bomber that was really good now we're watching the good doctor which reminds me hideout of Grey's Anatomy to be honest but it's pretty good and I'm kind of looking for something new to watch so if you guys have any recommendations please leave them below my favorite shows if a leg at the office you would say dickster there's a huge spider right at my window eating a be the one about the like dysfunctional family that are all like doing drugs and selling drugs and getting pregnant young and I can't remember coming down below if you know what I'm talking about you know it's like a UK version and a US version I'm sure it starts with O or something like that oh I can't even remember anyway Rick and me and Mason TV shows please because I'm running out of stuff to watch even if it's on Netflix okay new stuff I'm just gonna go straight to my eye makeup and then finish off my face later so I'll do my brows I'm losing like about so much crap inside my body right now my voice is going away now seriously when I woke up it was just like snot and I snot for days I'm sorry that's really TMI but seriously like it's just out of control okay for my brows today I'm going to use my brow and I'm going to use this brush which I've been using a lot lately wait no no this brush this is not the right brush what's the good brush this is an eye definer brush and I don't know why but I'm just loving it for my brows lately so I'm using shade three this is by benefit one of my favorite brow pricks it's not my favorite of all time I just like to kind of use the flat side of this brush to shape with my brows and it's really fast and I'm very lazy when it comes to eyebrows I don't have time to do the whole like concealer and all like sometimes I do it and I love the way it looks but if you want to sleep most I'm Way too lazy I like to focus more time on my eyeshadow and stuff my eyebrows hitters are like completely gone now so I've got like you know no steam so I used to just like copy my brow later and now it's completely different and I struggle you start using revitalash religiously because I always go on and off it and it definitely makes a difference with like how thick my eyebrows look like it grows new hairs and I keep forgetting to like you know carry it on I always remember to do my lashes but not my eyebrows I'm so lazy with my brows and I think it was because I had tattooed eyebrows so I didn't really care cuz they just looked full but now the taters are gone and I'm like oh yeah I was like completely butchered my brows today like I don't know what's happened I'm gonna use some concealer like I was just saying to be just kind of a live I've got to now because I screwed up okay seriously this is like into this is my NARS radiant creamy concealer and then on my eyebrows going to use the Urban Decay brow tamer this is quite a dark shade it's called I'm sure it's called like neutral brown or something like that gosh I need to go get my green juice Hamish made me a green juice and it's in the fridge oh gosh it can't be ungrateful he's been like making me green juice every day instead of like me drinking my coffees I think he's trying to tell me something then whenever I get a little bit like that like can you see where I've going in too far just a little tiny bit I just take a spoolie to rub it off okay so I've got my juice first of all if you wondering what the oil is on top it's flaxseed oil is so good um anyways I decided I'm going to do a look that I've been promising for a while that I kind of forgot about which is a recreation of my look I want VidCon Australia and the like super pink look using my shitting so the remix palette mostly the new side so yeah and look at this like the lighting it's don't get so bad because I can see the rain coming there was a little bit of rain before not God the struggle of my life like I hate the look of like ring lights and stuff like that on myself but natural lighting is still annoying so I'm starting off with the shade at bisti which is at this color right here and this is a firm blender brush and hopefully this works out okay because I just washed this so it might be kind of deaf which is kind of a fail I forgot to prime but that's fine I'm so bad with my short primer sometimes I swear now we go into it the shade baby girl with a flat eyeshadow brush it's a super bright but it's actually so wearable if you know how to pair it up with other colors which is kind of why I wanted to show you guys this tutorial I like you know you can copy me if you want to get some use out of the shade this eye look is very dramatic but it's so fun using a little bit of my brush at a time because I don't want to go overboard and then with the detail buff that nipple brush I'm gonna go in with stalker which is the very center color and this is gonna go on at the inner and outer corner and then it going back in with my firm Linda brush that I put the fish shade down with I'm going to start just buffing all those lines out they knit with a slim crease brush I'm gonna take this shade here and just put that right in the inner and outer see now starting to take its shape of course you might keep blending so I'm just going back in with the same brush once again that's the biggest trick with this look is just blend between each laya almost being a gemstone series look what kind of Jim Stern is the color though I don't know you guys will probably know better than I do because obviously we blended it away a little and there you go now I can't remember what I had on my bottom lash line so I'm gonna take the shape beastie which is that first color we used love this color so much this color looks so good just like all over thank you for all the support with the remix palette by the way it's gone so well I know does it keep selling out so yeah it's coming back all the time so if it ever sells out just keep an eye all the ways it's on EXO beauty or it's on altar oh I even remember what lipstick I was wearing that serendipity back before I could even talk about it ok and now I'm gonna flip over my palette to it the original side and I'm going to use at the shade holy grail to highlight my brow bone and then I'm just gonna whip a little bit of that just on there in a corner - just cuz my eyes are so tired looking right now now for my mascara I'm going to use a mascara that I've been promising to show you in a video since it came out if you were watching my snapchats and stuff while in the Maldives this is the bed go bang it by benefit that's why I winch the mold age they were launching this new mascara which is pretty cool it's got some really cool features and when I first heard it I was kind of like okay but then I tried it and it really is pretty good so I'm gonna talk a little bit about it I'm gonna show you how it works and I'm gonna compare it to another one of my favorite benefit mascara just so you can see the difference so the mascara zip you know if it currently has obviously they have B they're real which I don't even have on me right now for some reason it's like pretty sure it's one of the best-selling mascara I do hope that their real tinted primer which can be worn with it or alone if you've watched my videos you guys know I'm if it's s but this stuff actually want to put on both sides of my lashes right now so you can see it because it is one of my favorite products I love this any one time I always have like two of these open and it looks so good alone it just makes your eyelashes look like they're being freshly tinted at the salon and it's just so appreciate like if you love a good no makeup makeup look or like you want something light for the gym or for work you need this it's so perfect and it works really well underneath other mascaras just to make sure that your mascara looks nice and dark which I don't really have an issue with these in scars but just to make sure they stay nice and dark and go on really nicely and gives a little bit extra volume as well if you want to see how the new benefit mascara looks with outer primer you need to check out my Instagram pitch I'll show it to you Ashley that there is a before and after with only a one coat of the mascara with no prime ends nay it looks so good especially for like lengthening in my opinion I think it's just like super super super lengthening honestly I don't know why more people don't rave about this product it's seriously the bomb.com to people still say that I don't know anyway so there's that one and then the other two I have here obviously roller lash I've got a couple of in my collection right now because I go to new one I love it so much and then obviously the bed gallup bang which is the new mascara sore I'm gonna do one on each side I love both of these so much so I'll start with the one that I've already talked about on my channel before the roller lash this is one of my favorite curling mascara so if I want really curly lashes obviously is while I use revitalash so in my eyelashes are quite long already naturally but you know obviously what's mascara you're gonna get way more volume and length anyway then with my natural lashes still even with the revitalash so that's how roller lash looks you can see it goes volume and a lot of curl like this one's not as lengthening for me but it really like it goes with my lashes KO's them up makes them thick I just love the effect none of my other mascaras cool as well as this one so seriously this lighting dog I'm sorry I'm just gonna have it like pumped up for a bit because there's a giant storm cloud over top of my house and I've got a fluff on my nose and its really annoying man okay so bad girl bang this is what the it wand looks like you haven't seen any I'm sure you've seen a million people talking about this it actually is good you know like a big huge hyped up product like this comes out benefit stands people on trips and you know it's like this big huge deal I know for some people they could be very skeptical and say people are just saying that it's good because of the trip and everyone's posting about at the same time so of course naturally gonna be like is it actually good or is everyone lying genuinely like you'll be able to say for yourself I was pretty short with the results and I do have pros and cons about this product which I will share with you in one second this mascara has like some space technology I can't remember what it's called off the top of my head I'd have to look it up but basically it makes it super lightweight so you can like pile it on and your lashes don't fall your why should start feel heavy like it feels so lightweight and not full-on at all for me personally I feel like this is a very lengthening mascara on me I feel like it does thicken maybe not as much as roller lash although kind of looks similar I'm familiar this is just so lengthening and really makes my lashes stand out you saw the before and after on my Instagram for yourself like there's a huge difference between like mascara and no mascara so I don't know this when it first came out but basically I pull this out after the launch for the whole day like I put it on in the morning we actually went snorkeling and stuff and I was just being lazy and I'm not gonna take off my mascara or my makeup and then we went swimming in the pool and obviously like all of my makeup came off except for the mascara I am the kind of person completely honest like I'm the kind of person that does like an easier to remove mascara this hair stays put I think it's mean to last like 30 hours or 36 hours or something like that 36 hours and it's water-resistant I didn't even know that but it's true because I had this on for like three days straight because I couldn't even get it off because all I took with me on holiday was my face halo it was way too like stay put like to get off like it stayed there for days so if you do want something that's really long wear you will love this I still do like it but I find when I do wear this I have to use like one of those like oily makeup vomit removers to get it off otherwise it'll stay there for days and not come off like you can shower with it and it's still perfect it's nuts you can see how like huge my lashes are now I'm gonna do like one more little coat you do have to be careful with this and not to put on too much because it can start to look a little bit clumpy kind of good cuz you're only really do need like one or two layers instead of like really packing it on I'm gonna do my bottom lashes too so you can see overall I really do like this it's not the kind of thing I would wear day to day just because for me I like something easy to remove it's something I would wear if I was to go clubbing first to go on holiday if I was going to go somewhere where I was gonna fry because like it doesn't budge like a wedding or something like that special occasions and stuff like that but if you are the kind of person where you'll miss go like run you know transfers and stuff like that on a day-to-day basis at work if you're like in a really hot and steamy atmosphere you're in a humid atmosphere you'll probably really enjoy this one so like look at that so yeah I love both of these muskers roller lash would be like my go-to from benefit so like everyday and then the bag go bang for like special occasions like I said so that's how they look compared to each other so which one do you guys like better have you tried roller lash before have you tried the new mascara let me know what your thoughts are I'd love to hear from you and also just a quick mention thank you so much benefit for the trip honestly I'm so thankful I had these time in my life so relaxing and I just felt so privileged to be this thank you so much and of course like always though it's differently my honest opinions on the mascara and you can decide for yourself by looking at those before and afters and how they look you know what your thoughts are to be honest I'd probably just stick with one coat of the mascara cuz I like the way it looks better than with two but there's two coats next up I'm going to contour my face I'm going to use an old favorite which is it the Charlotte Tilbury film-star bronze &amp; Glow sculpt palette I'm going to use a contour fan at brush stuffs like falling everywhere because I've got no room on my desk I need to clean my room this afternoon cuz it's getting ridiculous again something like picking and unpacking and just chucking stuff around and it's really not good enough so I bet it keeping my beauty space clean like I seriously do one makeup look and it's a disaster zone hopefully you guys kind of hear my ear cord it's so loud right now it's like full of making a groaning noise I don't know why but oh well as long as it doesn't explode I'll be fine Terri's to conquer over these lashes these two I like sticking together which is really annoying me it's not the mascara it's just my actual eyelashes like all tangled up you guys ever get like that I need to use a little spooley all my life just before I do my mascara or something oh my god I just make my mascara into my I did and then affirm a full lash I'm gonna use my go-to at the moment because I just love it so much this is the busy at rose coral palette I bought the new Vizia I should repeal it you delish the other day I should have bought another blush palette because I know they've got a different color I'm mixing the two middle shades by the way I always mix them I don't know why I can't just sit over one I've got to do like two or three now I'm going to highlight like I said before with Holy Grail which is one of my Holy Grail shades of all the time what brush I use might use a shimmer tham brush my gosh my stomach is actually making the worst noises right now I really hope you can hear surely you can't but seriously like I wouldn't be surprised do you know what I almost see it I was almost like wow it matches my brow bone highlight perfectly but like dashing in I tell people I've got the memory of a goldfish sometimes I'm the kind of person where like I'll meet someone like four times and like people tell me who like what their name is and I still forget I'm so bad and you start doing that trick what's that movie House Bunny where she like goes like maybe it would work I don't know I'm so bad at remembering things like I swear I have to write down everything okay now to finish off the look I'm just gonna leave my lips just like that I don't think I need falsies today because those are intense I'm going to do my lips anyway show you what my lip line is because I actually have the final packaging now phages I was using the testers like my formula and my colors but just and like generic like it was just like a wooden pencil because they wouldn't be in source but now they are in my colored packaging instead of just a plain pencil so this is how the packaging looks I'm so excited I'm so happy with them so it's so exciting at these we'll be in New Zealand in the next month or so so I'll update you on social media and stuff we net there near and I'll also do a lip swatch video cuz when I asked you guys if you wanted one the response was overwhelming so this shade here is called Tracy I should have put lip balm on before those cuz my lips are so dry why is that heating up now it's on hot what they hit dude like what the heck I am NOT cold I'm even hotter now Thanks thanks for that okay so there is the lip pencil there are a ton of different shades this one once again is called Tracy they are very I'll talk about them briefly no cuz obviously I'll do a lip swatch video and talk about them but they're very very very creamy lip pencils are very pigmented and they stay put they're not transfer proof but they stay put so like like barely any comes off to your nose but you know like they aren't completely transfer proof that they stay on so even if you like cuz Oh like eat what do you bet they stay put I mean on top I'm going to use serendipity liquid lipstick this is the color I wore in the picture but I didn't wear a lip liner I'm using a lip liner because I wanted to be a little bit more bold and like purpley so just applying a little bit to the center so that is how we are looking I'm so excited about this look I love it I hope you guys love it too when I wore it at VidCon I got so many compliments I feel like I say that along some of my videos but seriously I guess just cuz it's so bright and bold it was very eye-catching and people were like wow cool makeup I don't know if though being sarcastic hopefully not but anyway I'm obsessed I love the look color I love the eye shadows hopefully you guys enjoyed this look and if you do recreate it please take me in your photos I would love to stalk you and yeah I guess I'll just talk to you guys in my next video by the way check out the down bar and I'll put some links to a bad girl bag and the other products and everything as well so loving this so far apart from I'm too lazy to remove it anyway long way people you will love it talk to you guys in my next video bye 
hey everyone so today I am doing a makeup look on the super sultry sexy smoky eye and it is inspired by an espresso martini which happens to be one of my favorites she has as part of the cocktail series and I also used only one brand for everything in this video which is a Clinique I am collaborating with clinic on this video and I'll be showing you one of my new favorite moisturizers so stay tuned for that also there'll be a bunch of many first impressions because heaps was definitely I haven't tried before so let's get started so I was lucky enough to receive not one but two huge boxes of pudding to make up I was so excited so yeah this is the look we're going for today as you saw in the intro it's just a really warm brown color cocktails obviously espresso you know coffee so to prep and prime my skin this is my new favorite moisturizer I've been using this for the past three or four weeks or so and then clinic reached out to me now so I wanted to feature it in a video so I was like hell yeah why not it's so so good it's called the Moisture Surge extended thirst relief moisturizer here's my one of the packaging as you can see I've used quite a bit of it I took this to LA with me recently because there's like a 12-hour flight and my skin it gets so dry on the plane this was my absolute sweet Haven I love the texture it's almost like jelly it's really like bouncy and it's sort of in your skin so so nicely and feels so refreshing and just makes your skin look solid Julie and glowy it keeps my skin feeling so hydrated all day I like to use it morning and night and I'll also use it on my shoulders neck and at the front of my chest it has hyaluronic acid in it which is a really naturally from any fine lines wrinkles dry skin but overall I just love the way it makes my skin feel it's really quite cooling it just moisturizes so well and I find it to be a really nice kind of space to put down before I do any and makeup it is seriously legit so once that was done it did I went in with my foundation and I'm using to be on perfecting it Foundation and concealer by clinic in two different shades to make my perfect shade I always keep a paler one and a darker one on me just so that it can match me no matter how pale or and i am i have used this foundation a few times in my videos and it really grow on me a lot it's really easily notice especially with a damp sponge so that's what I'm using today and it gives you such good coverage so I'm just applying it all over for a flawless base [Music] now for them under-eye circles you can just use that Foundation and layer it a little bit but I wanted to try a new one so I can do some first impression so I mentioned we trained to first I'm taking the line smoothing concealer under my eyes and in a kind of triangular shape I was so shocked with how much I ended up liking this can you see how you see this blended out and it's all about brightening and then I went in with the all about eyes concealer just for some extra coverage and in my opinion what we use it all over your face like no matter where you needed extra coverage because it really gave a lot of coverage so as you can see it helped to make my under eye circles super bright super concealed so I was pretty stoked with those new so I went in with the chubby stick now this used to be raved about on YouTube I don't think I've ever tried it before this is a brand new one it's in the shade at curvy contour super cute name and I applied a strap of this under each cheekbone around my temples under my jaw under my lip and on my nose and used it most Spanish to blend and my facials right now are in shock by how easy this was to blend out you can see it for yourself but you can see it with your own eyeballs I think on myself on my skin tone at the moment I would prefer something a little bit cooler in tone but the actual product itself is just a dream to work with so I was really really impressed with that first impression waves let me know if you guys have tried it down below in the comments and then what is contouring without highlighting so I'm using the chubby 6 buffing highlight by Clinique and same thing it was so easy to blend I think if you like natural highlighters you will absolutely love this because it gives a really nice natural Sheen it to the face especially if you don't wear a lot of pattern and same thing goes if you guys like natural blushes this is like one of the most natural blushes I've ever seen on myself I feel like this looks so natural and really sinks into the skin and it was super super easy to blend once again all of those some products are really really easy to blend me so I took a big fluffy brush in this transparent powder by Clinique just to set my makeup and I use this all over and then I took a smaller brush which is a small face brush and just applied a little bit over that concealer under my eyes to sit it in place just true it doesn't go anywhere or crease or do anything like that and then for the eyebrows I didn't have a patter so to use my own powder that I'm using this just browsing a brush on at brow mousse by Clinique and I actually quite like this it's a very flexible whole it's not a super harsh hold product and it's really mostly like the name would suggest and I really liked the color once it kind of set in it really gave my eyebrows a lot of dimension now onto the makeup I want something sultry sexy because that's what is brittle martini reminds me of and then i'm using the color inspiration of course so first i'm taking this black eyeliner by Clinique and running that close to my lashline and smudging it out i recommend doing this one at a time because by the time I got through one eye the other I had sit so it sits really quickly and then I'm taking these chubby eyeshadow sticks by Clinique in two different shades of brown these are a nice tint to the eye they're not super opaque so so good for those of you who maybe have more mature eyes or anything like that and you just want something really quick to slip on that has lots of moisture in it they're really easy to work with so I'm putting this one kind of three-quarters the way along my eye and blending it out it's slightly darker in the shade here this sheet here I'm kind of putting on top and into the crease and blending it out really nicely and these I should just give a really nice smolder you kind of a set to your eye makeup [Music] next up I'm taking this true bronze at bronzer in the sunkissed with a blender brush and popping it in the crease just to warm up my eye look a little bit I also put that underneath the lash line and then to finish off the eyeshadow and taking this clinic lid pops eyeshadow and cocoa pop and just popping that all over the eyelid just to set those creams and just give a little bit more color dimension I'm also as you can see going back in and smudging a little bit more of that black eyeliner out and I also put it on my waterline and on my tape line it just to darken up those lashes then I went in with some a liquid liner this is the pretty easy liquid liner and I have to say it definitely is really easy to use the brush tip is super flexible really tiny so I was able to get a really thin line and sharp wing I do wish it dragged more met though then this product here the bottom lash mascara I have used before this is out of my personal collection that I already had and it's drying out but I love this stuff so much I love the little wand it's super cute and works super well and then this mascara is the elect our mascara this was the first time I tried it I did really like it but I found it really hard to get off so if you like really long wearing mascara you'll like it but I don't really need that next up is a cream pop lip pop and this is kind of like the creamy foamy part of the espresso martini I'm using this on my brow bone and inner corner and I'm also going to use it to highlight but first I'm just quickly bronzing up my cheeks in temples that bronzer again and a fiber brush and then yeah going back in with a smaller face brush and just packing it on the cheekbones so that I can know then that first sultry look I always like to look quite flushed I don't know I think it's really creased so this is color pop blush these blushes are one of my all-time favorite blush formulas as you guys know if you watch my videos and then I'm using this matte lipstick in close pot and it's a really nice warm brownish reddish brown color it reminds me of coffee beans [Music] so there we have our final look I really love that thing it's super sexy appreciate wearable smokier just all of it and I feel like it really puts rise Nespresso machine you really nicely so hopefully you guys agree and hopefully you guys enjoyed this video once again at checkout clinic if you do have any skin concerns if you've got really dry skin I totally recommend that moisturizer I have been absolutely obsessed with it I'll put some links down below the product I used to know if you're interested thank you again for watching don't forget to thumbs up and requests down below in the comments I'll talk to you soon bye [Music] now 
hey everyone so it's been a long time since I did a first impression so that is what I'm doing today it's going to be on the bomb even-steven I was going to do the white cell one today but that'll be my next one I wanted to do this one first because I've been promising this for ages even-steven what foundation it's supposed to be like incredible coverage I haven't actually seen anyone talking about this personally I've only read what it says on the website you know what I mean so I'm really interested to give it a go I don't think I've tried a the bomb foundation before I'm trying to think so it should be quite interesting so this is how tiny it is like so small we may compare it to something that you guys don't have a home okay here's like a bigger highlighter and then at the even-steven like it's so tiny here it is next to a Ohio South foundation so n here you get thirteen point four mil which is under half the amount that you get in a liquid foundation on the bottom website it says with a light airy souffle light texture you've got a foundation that's truly wet a perfect completionist par for the course with this ultra pigmented formula just remember a little goes a long way available in eight long-lasting shades with a natural matte finish so we will see how this performs I've got four shades here I've got lighter than light light light medium and medium this here is a light medium which I think would be good for me what I've got fake tan on these colors are really weird so straight off the bed lighted in light it's not very like I am well aware I am NOT the palest skin tone out there and this is like almost too dark for me and then this is the light which they look almost the exact same I'm just gonna take a little and swatch it on my hand oh my god I don't think any of these are gonna match me today so lighter then why is that one it's also a little bit more like orange I guess and then that one there is light which is not very light I guess I'm just gonna have to try lighter than life because life is definitely gonna be too dark even though it's a way bitter undertone like look how dark that is oh my god this is off to a terrible start okay straight away this shade range is not great we're gonna put that out there straight away today I am going to prime half of my face I'm just going to use these Smashbox photo finish primer this is how drinking one so I'm just rubbing this into half of my face just so we can see if these any difference with a lot and cheaper tea and application and the way it looks this apartment feels so good right now okay so I have no idea how much product I need this is not going to match me I'm gonna have to bring it like all the way down my neck like I'm mostly just looking at this it looks very orange like looking not looking forward to this but I promised it I'm going to try and keep an open mind with the actual formula of it and try not to actually look at the color just like what I did with my fin to review so I've just taken a dab in the lid and I'm just gonna actually I'm going to start with the unprimed side okay the color doesn't look as bad blinged it out look at that like that looks okay like it's a little bit the wrong unders home for me if you compare it to my neck my neck is quite yellowy and this foundation's orangey pinky and it feels really easy to blend and it feels really lightweight which I'm quite surprised with because it said it was quite full coverage wow it really does just keep going this is the same amount of product it's actually get beautiful sorry if I have a lisp today I've got my Invisalign in and it's kind of tight okay I'm gonna take a little bit more down at my Troy and Nick a little and then a little on my forehead so on the unprimed side it's super easy to blend I'm using a flawless finish sponge-on this foundation this has been like my application tool of choice lately for any foundations be honest okay it's got a beautiful quite matte finish it's like almost completely matte let me show you close up look how beautiful that is it's so smooth I have so much dry skin around my nose because I've been blowing my nose like crazy for the last three days or so so you have to ignore that like Mexican normally isn't that dry so it's kind of showing up the dry skin I'm not surprised it's like a seriously bad dry skin basically like it's completely covered any pores like it doesn't emphasize any ports whatsoever that's just one layer and the coverage is really good you can still see some breakouts like here you can see a little bit of discoloration but like that's pretty good for like one super thin layer so a little bit really does go a long way we're gonna do the private aside now so I'm gonna take about the same amount which is about that I'm just gonna split around my face can you guys get the rain outside it's like flooding out back warned again I swear Palmerston North where I live in New Zealand his head rang on and off most days for like the past two months it's just really horrible I hate the rain so much so there was a tiny amount of product I feel like it gives you a really natural even at coverage of products like it doesn't really look like I'm wearing a lot of makeup look how pink that is though this is why I laugh when people try to tell me I've got um pink undertones just cuz I have redness in my chicks like look at that difference I've got zero fake tan on right now I'm gonna go in with another dab this time it's a little bit bigger and I'm gonna say how buildable this is it's so easy to blend I can't get over it it literally like blends itself like I'm not even trying I probably wouldn't normally bother building up this much cuz I liked the way it looked before but I'm just doing this for the video to see how flawless it gets with building I would still definitely say even if you do happen to have pink undertones if you are paler than me like this is not gonna work like this is still one line too dark for me it looks orange but the formula itself is so good so if you match one of the colours well like you're lucky I think what I've got fake tan on that light medium and medium shade would be good so I'll probably actually just end up donating this color like when I'm done with this video because it just I'm never gonna get anywhere out of this one like this color is just so off for me okay so to apply pretty much the same on both sides and looks very similar on both sides it has completely disguised my pores if you've got problem at paws like this just glides right over them it looks amazing perfect if you like a match kind of finish I don't mind the finish but I'm just gonna end up putting highlight or later anyway so it doesn't really matter to me I'm going to conceal my under eye area now okay so under my eyes I use the tight shape tape and then my Kat Von D petal powder and then for my powder I used a photo bomb by the balm and this is in it the shade at lighted in light even though it's quite matte which is like a telltale sign of makeup it really doesn't look heavy or it doesn't look real fake you know what I mean like it just looks airbrushed and perfect without looking too heavy so that's probably the best way I can put it let's do a quick flesh test it doesn't like appear to have flash back I'm just so pale that it looks kind of like flesh back but I think it it does look very perfect photos though okay so I'm gonna continue on with my day it is now 9:30 a.m. so we will see how it was throughout the day everyone so I'm joy my first stop in just to see how it's looking it's only been 2 hours so hopefully it looks good and it pretty much does the only place it's kind of cracked around the sides of my nose and I did notice this before I blew my nose I blew my nose just before and to be honest like almost none of it came off but yeah I do have this like cracking in the side of my nose if you can see this I'll zoom in so there's about the only change so far it kind of looks like it's starting to grip onto some dry skin on some old breakouts I have down here so I'm gonna have to keep an eye on it there so I think that one was already flaky from the beginning but this one definitely I'm gonna have to keep an eye on coverage is still amazing it looks really nice I like the way it looks once I've got my highlighter and everything on it is still very very bad so if you like a matte finish hopefully this goes well from now on because yeah it's a very matte matte matte finish hey everyone so it is now quarter past three so it's been almost 6 hours almost 6 hours so it is looking pretty much the same as last time like I said like you know I've had to blow my nose because I'm sick AF and I blow my nose a few more times and it's not actually looking at that bad like it's definitely worn off a bit but it doesn't look really obvious if that makes any sense at all those women in a second round the outside it does look like it's correct a little bit more that's kind of where it's faded the most when I've been blowing my nose as well as far as the coverage it still looks more or less the same it looks like it's faded a little bit through here looks like it stayed put a little bit better on the unprimed side like coverage wise down here doesn't look any more dry than in the last update so that's good and you know it's about the only change soldiers zoom in quickly so you can kind of see where it's rubbed off a little bit when I've been blowing my nose but it's not that bad considering I'm boy when I was very frequently so yeah that thought I'll see you again soon everyone the lighting is so bad at this point because it is 6:20 p.m. so it is known for nine hours is that I always get so confused with telling the time I am five years old anyways so it's been on for a decent amount of time and I have to say it's still looking pretty good I forgot to tell you before my last update I was sitting at the table like scratching my chin like this because it was a chi and it didn't even like wipe off my foundation like it's stay put it's pretty well like stuck on my face it hasn't faded any more than last time the side looks better than the side and I've been obviously blowing my nose even more and it still looks fine around my nose so so far it's going so good like my forehead looks perfect there is not a glimmer of any kind of oil on my face like it feels completely matte so this could be worth looking into for those of you with oily skin I will update you one more time in the next update and then we will wash off this makeup cuz I'm so over wearing makeup for the day honestly you guys I really wear makeup like more than five hours these days like the longest I'll wear it as if I go to like a Bao and go out or something like that and then I get home and wash it off hello you want something Mandarin I have to say the foundation still looks pretty good I'd say this ever so slightly a little bit more fading just here I was thinking about it and I think this is where I lean like when I was editing so I get it with my right hand I think I was like leaning like this so it could be my hand rubbing it off I'm not sure it got a little bit drier just on this dry patch just here the acne and so yeah it's a little bit flaky looking at this point by the way it is a 9:35 p.m. so it's been on for like 12 hours so I'd say a little bit of flakiness after 12 hours that's okay by me you know like that's a good day worth of foundation wearing on this side it looks like it's just starting to fade but I mean again 12 I always like it looked solid at 9 hours I think that's pretty amazing because this again like my most common problem is the fading down on my lower cheeks for whatever reason I don't know looks perfect on my forehead it's not oily whatsoever anywhere it feels completely mesh there is no shine like that isn't my highlighter it's just perfect did fade more around the news whereas blowing my nose to be expected and it's creased a little bit yeah most of it's just like rubbed off from tissues throughout the day so overall I'm actually pretty happy and I really really just can't believe how great it looked over my pause so I think the biggest con for this product is definitely the color selection like the color selection is garbage if you happen to fit into one of those like yo shades then I think it definitely is worth a try especially I think if you have normal to maybe slightly oily skin and it really did well staying matte throughout the day obviously I don't have exceptionally oily skin or anything like that but I mean it looks really good after the amount of time we did do some exercise this afternoon so yeah I'm pretty pretty impressed I'll put a link down below to where you can get it from how much it costs all of that kind of stuff I do feel like I used probably about half as much product as they normally would if I used a liquid foundation so I guess it would you know last around the same amount of time as like a jar of liquid foundation and I guess also it's quite good for travel because it is so small good for on-the-go like in your handbag or when you're traveling just to cut down space like it's tiny but you still get that amazing coverage in it I'm not usually like the hugest met fan but for some reason I just really liked the way that this one looked and it didn't feel drying or hippy or anything like that it felt like almost nothing on my skin it was only once I like see it with powder and everything that I could like feel it you know like it was so lightweight so easy to blend just so quick loved it with the sponge the flawless finish sponge-on yes so I'm glad that this foundation pulled through cuz at the beginning as you guys know I was kind of like Aaron this color is terrible it looks kind of weird but yeah they looked really flawless so let me know what you guys think definitely late looking now my nose looks ugly I'm blowing it but other than that like 12 hours that's not bad like considering how it looks and this is terrible lighting also my skin looks blue or something I don't know anyways if you enjoyed this video please put a thumbs up let me know what first impression you want to see next although I think it's gonna be the YSL one let me know if that's alright and yeah I'll talk to you guys in my next video 
hey everyone so today I'm doing a get ready with me which is going to include my makeup my hair and even my outfit so I hope you guys enjoy this one absolutely love this makeup I got so many compliments on it so I hope you guys like it too by the way I ever list because I've been you try and of my other line just FYI in this clip I had just woken up my hair was looking like a crap it was greasy it was dry it was just an absolute mess it was in need of some TLC for sure like look how dry and gross and crunchy looking my Enza it was definitely time for a bit of a pan position so you may have already seen me talking about this product on my social media or maybe on my vlog channel this is called the journey hair hydration mask it is vegan which I love cruelty free no animal testing Australian made and owned basically this is a treatment which strengthens and repairs your hair so you get longer healthier and shinier hair which I can vouch for I think this has just absolutely made my hair so it lovely and soft lately since I've been a loving it so much journey here wanted to see if I wanted to do a sponsored portion so here we are all opinions are my own and I'm going to show you exactly how I use it so I have started with towel-dried here I washed my hair twice you can get the soft journey haircut calm by the way that's what I'm showing you just there and then I've got now the shower towel dried my hair and I'm taking some of the hydration mask and applying that from the length to my ends and just massaging that in and then I'm taking a little bit more and putting some more in and then just kind of putting it up towards my scalp as well but really focusing most of it on the ends of course where the most damage has occurred once you've got that all in you just want to leave it on for at least 30 minutes before you rinse it off and you can also use it as a conditioner as well which I like to do throughout the week this mask contains aloe vera which has 20 amino acids that help to create building blocks for your hair and scalp enzymes that moisturize your hair to help promote growth and then it's also got vegetable proteins which strengthens your cuticles and helps to prevent further hair damage and it's all scientifically proven so while it the mask does its magic and my hair I am just applying a face mask and chilling out for the 30 minutes this is such a good Christmas gift idea by the way guys I really recommend it so it's 30 minutes like that I have washed and conditioned my hair and I'm just going to do my makeup while my hair kind of dries a little bit and I'll show you the finished product of my hair at the very end of the video so now I'm just moisturizing my skin with this glam blow moisturizer is super glowy and beautiful I'm obsessed with it like it makes my skin look amazing I think and then I'm just going to check some of this tinted it's like a fake tan lotion instant color thing just cuz I find it makes my skin look really nice and healthy and glowy as well just to match the makeup cuz I want a glowy amazing shiny makeup shiny well you know what I mean so for a stupid do.we foundation finish I'm mixing in these taut like highlighter drops I guess they are in with my foundation and just spreading it all out all over my face to create a nice even base for the rest of my makeup and I'm also using a little concealer on it in my face just where I want a bit more coverage like where I've got frickles and just to help brighten as well this is be at YSL all hours concealer under my eyes I'm using my current favorite concealer and I'm just using this to conceal my dark under-eye circles from watching too much Netflix late at night and blending that out really nicely I like this color too because it's super brightening and just once again makes me look nice and wide awake and healthy I think and then I'm contouring it with a cream color today I really like this color because it is super natural and it looks very undetectable it's a really good one to see it under my eyes and stick with that brightening theme I'm using well rested by bare minerals it helps to conceal a little bit better and brighten the eye area and then I'm just using it my Born This Way a powder just all over the rest of my face you see everything don't make it last all day yay and then I am sitting everything with a Singh spray I don't really recommend this one I've tried it a few more times now and it smells really crap I don't know I just it just smells really toxic anyway then I'm doing my eyebrows and using some highbrow as well just to brighten up the brow bone nice and bright theme of the day yay I don't know what is up with me today like I'm I'm just using the same word over and over again I guess what's new you know it took me so long to fill in my brows this day like obviously it is to that but seriously it was a mission so they probably not looking their best but I did my best it was one of those days okay one of those days I'm using this brow mascara which is really I wanted dark eyebrows today so just winging it and speaking of winging it I am winging out my eyeshadow today so I'm using some  our shields you could also just use tape to be honest you know just do what you want or you could do the eye makeup first and just use concealers get a nice sharp edge it's totally up to you just whatever works and then I'm taking this palette here and this muted Mildred muted purple at palette just pressing it all over the eyelid and blending it also just through the crease making sure it's nice and even I absolutely love that color so I'm using the brown now and I am winging it in basically I'm just building up the wing with darker and darker shades so starting with the lightest Brown winging it out blending it out well and I'm using a really small brush so I can get a lot of precision I guess and then using a darker Brown and winging it out again and basically this is what I'm doing it's pretty straightforward I got so many compliments on this look hamish loved it as well so hopefully you guys love it as much as we do and it was actually really really fast she also which is a bonus I was just like playing with my makeup as I went today you know this is just a get rid of me it was just me sitting down from the camera and playing around so then I'm taking a blender brush and just buffing out any harsh lines make it nice and seamless and then I took the brighter a color and put that on my inner corner just because I thought it looked cool I really like how it came out next up I am highlighting my brow bone with the brow bone a shade just a matte color you could do a shimmery Bravo if you like I was considering it but I ain't met and then I'm doing some lower lash line work just to you know balance out the makeup a little bit and then it to really and make the eyeshadow pop I'm taking Island glow which is the cold color on my finger and popping it in the middle just to really brighten up the eyes and I love this gold it's so so beautiful just make sure you blend at the edge as well so that it's really seamless and I'm also taking that color on the inner corner and then of course do some mascara and false lashes if you wish I'm using a Clinique mascara and putting it on top and bottom and then for my lashes I'm using it the feliner lashes which just kind of flew out of the outer edges and they have a transparent band so it really pretty even though I'm not too much eyeliner and like I said I was playing around today so I went in with a random light pink eyeliner and my wool line and I actually really liked it because it's not too pink it's just a really subtle shimmery color and it just helped to brighten up my eyes a little bit more as well so I was happy with that decision it was not a regret so that's always good and then I'm going to finish contouring just putting that where I put the cream earlier and this is just like a powder contour so just making it the cheekbones and everything it popped a little bit more cuz I need a little bit of a help to get rid of the potato shape face and then it going back and with the gold I am highlighting my cheekbones with this and this is a really intense highlighter and it is so pretty hopefully you guys like it as much as I do on the cheekbones you definitely have to try it out if you have this palette and then a while we're at it we'll use a pink or from an opponent as a blush just a little bit don't put on too much otherwise it is it's super bright and then on the lips I just wanted something to kind of complement everything else cause it was a lot of pink happening so I used a nice more V color this color is such a good one and I really really found it so it comfortable to wear on the lips so I am a big fan of this it's almost a little bit peachy which kind of complimented the bronze are in contour and everything on my face and the gold undertone of my eyeshadow and highlighter so now jumping back to my hair and I've actually seen so many compliments lately on my hair asking like what I use to keep it really nice and soft and shiny especially on my Instagram and this is it you guys like I am you know I'm not paid to say oh this is like the best thing ever videos but seriously it is really amazing like I am so happy they reached out to me because I'm obsessed I was able to blow-dry my hair so quickly after conditioning and using this as a Hamas all I have in my hair is a little bit of heat protectant and seriously it was just so fast to blow-dry I wasn't even using my blow-dry quick spray whatever it's called it was just a normal heat protectant and my hair just is so shiny afterwards like you can see for yourself it is amazing on their website also they offer a subscription service so you can sign up and get the mask conveniently sent to your home every month so you're he'll continue look just absolutely amazing I'm gonna show you a little before-and-after of my hair so you can see for yourself like it just makes my hair look and feel so much more nourished and soft and shiny and just has more life to it I guess so genuinely I'm really excited to continue to use this I've used it as a mask I think four times now I took it to Germany with me as well and use it as a moisturizing like conditioner I'm in love anyway moving along I'm sure you guys are sick of hearing me babble I am putting on my perfume make sure you guys my finished makeup look by the way look my hair sorry one more thing I haven't strained it or anything like this is just straight after blow-drying with that treatment okay moving along I'm now I'm gonna show you what I wore for the day if my out for the day the skirt is from Teahupoo my little denim jacket is from forever 21 as our these shoes like a live in Germany really liked this outfit despite the way it looks it was actually really comfortable and I just thought it was really cute I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you did please give it a thumbs up I love you guys so much check the down bar for links and I'll talk to you guys menus video bye [Music] 
hey everyone so it's been a long time since I did a first impression so that is what I'm doing today it's going to be on the bomb even-steven I was going to do the white cell one today but that'll be my next one I wanted to do this one first because I've been promising this for ages even-steven what foundation it's supposed to be like incredible coverage I haven't actually seen anyone talking about this personally I've only read what it says on the website you know what I mean so I'm really interested to give it a go I don't think I've tried a the bomb foundation before I'm trying to think so it should be quite interesting so this is how tiny it is like so small we may compare it to something that you guys don't have a home okay here's like a bigger highlighter and then at the even-steven like it's so tiny here it is next to a Ohio South foundation so n here you get thirteen point four mil which is under half the amount that you get in a liquid foundation on the bottom website it says with a light airy souffle light texture you've got a foundation that's truly wet a perfect completionist par for the course with this ultra pigmented formula just remember a little goes a long way available in eight long-lasting shades with a natural matte finish so we will see how this performs I've got four shades here I've got lighter than light light light medium and medium this here is a light medium which I think would be good for me what I've got fake tan on these colors are really weird so straight off the bed lighted in light it's not very like I am well aware I am NOT the palest skin tone out there and this is like almost too dark for me and then this is the light which they look almost the exact same I'm just gonna take a little and swatch it on my hand oh my god I don't think any of these are gonna match me today so lighter then why is that one it's also a little bit more like orange I guess and then that one there is light which is not very light I guess I'm just gonna have to try lighter than life because life is definitely gonna be too dark even though it's a way bitter undertone like look how dark that is oh my god this is off to a terrible start okay straight away this shade range is not great we're gonna put that out there straight away today I am going to prime half of my face I'm just going to use these Smashbox photo finish primer this is how drinking one so I'm just rubbing this into half of my face just so we can see if these any difference with a lot and cheaper tea and application and the way it looks this apartment feels so good right now okay so I have no idea how much product I need this is not going to match me I'm gonna have to bring it like all the way down my neck like I'm mostly just looking at this it looks very orange like looking not looking forward to this but I promised it I'm going to try and keep an open mind with the actual formula of it and try not to actually look at the color just like what I did with my fin to review so I've just taken a dab in the lid and I'm just gonna actually I'm going to start with the unprimed side okay the color doesn't look as bad blinged it out look at that like that looks okay like it's a little bit the wrong unders home for me if you compare it to my neck my neck is quite yellowy and this foundation's orangey pinky and it feels really easy to blend and it feels really lightweight which I'm quite surprised with because it said it was quite full coverage wow it really does just keep going this is the same amount of product it's actually get beautiful sorry if I have a lisp today I've got my Invisalign in and it's kind of tight okay I'm gonna take a little bit more down at my Troy and Nick a little and then a little on my forehead so on the unprimed side it's super easy to blend I'm using a flawless finish sponge-on this foundation this has been like my application tool of choice lately for any foundations be honest okay it's got a beautiful quite matte finish it's like almost completely matte let me show you close up look how beautiful that is it's so smooth I have so much dry skin around my nose because I've been blowing my nose like crazy for the last three days or so so you have to ignore that like Mexican normally isn't that dry so it's kind of showing up the dry skin I'm not surprised it's like a seriously bad dry skin basically like it's completely covered any pores like it doesn't emphasize any ports whatsoever that's just one layer and the coverage is really good you can still see some breakouts like here you can see a little bit of discoloration but like that's pretty good for like one super thin layer so a little bit really does go a long way we're gonna do the private aside now so I'm gonna take about the same amount which is about that I'm just gonna split around my face can you guys get the rain outside it's like flooding out back warned again I swear Palmerston North where I live in New Zealand his head

as if I go to like a Bao and go out or something like that and then I get home and wash it off hello you want something Mandarin I have to say the foundation still looks pretty good I'd say this ever so slightly a little bit more fading just here I was thinking about it and I think this is where I lean like when I was editing so I get it with my right hand I think I was like leaning like this so it could be my hand rubbing it off I'm not sure it got a little bit drier just on this dry patch just here the acne and so yeah it's a little bit flaky looking at this point by the way it is a 9:35 p.m. so it's been on for like 12 hours so I'd say a little bit of flakiness after 12 hours that's okay by me you know like that's a good day worth of foundation wearing on this side it looks like it's just starting to fade but I mean again 12 I always like it looked solid at 9 hours I think that's pretty amazing because this again like my most common problem is the fading down on my lower cheeks for whatever reason I don't know looks perfect on my forehead it's not oily whatsoever anywhere it feels completely mesh there is no shine like that isn't my highlighter it's just perfect did fade more around the news whereas blowing my nose to be expected and it's creased a little bit yeah most of it's just like rubbed off from tissues throughout the day so overall I'm actually pretty happy and I really really just can't believe how great it looked over my pause so I think the biggest con for this product is definitely the color selection like the color selection is garbage if you happen to fit into one of those like yo shades then I think it definitely is worth a try especially I think if you have normal to maybe slightly oily skin and it really did well staying matte throughout the day obviously I don't have exceptionally oily skin or anything like that but I mean it looks really good after the amount of time we did do some exercise this afternoon so yeah I'm pretty pretty impressed I'll put a link down below to where you can get it from how much it costs all of that kind of stuff I do feel like I used probably about half as much product as they normally would if I used a liquid foundation so I guess it would you know last around the same amount of time as like a jar of liquid foundation and I guess also it's quite good for travel because it is so small good for on-the-go like in your handbag or when you're traveling just to cut down space like it's tiny but you still get that amazing coverage in it I'm not usually like the hugest met fan but for some reason I just really liked the way that this one looked and it didn't feel drying or hippy or anything like that it felt like almost nothing on my skin it was only once I like see it with powder and everything that I could like feel it you know like it was so lightweight so easy to blend just so quick loved it with the sponge the flawless finish sponge-on yes so I'm glad that this foundation pulled through cuz at the beginning as you guys know I was kind of like Aaron this color is terrible it looks kind of weird but yeah they looked really flawless so let me know what you guys think definitely late looking now my nose looks ugly I'm blowing it but other than that like 12 hours that's not bad like considering how it looks and this is terrible lighting also my skin looks blue or something I don't know anyways if you enjoyed this video please put a thumbs up let me know what first impression you want to see next although I think it's gonna be the YSL one let me know if that's alright and yeah I'll talk to you guys in my next video 
hey everyone so today is my nighttime routine video I filmed this quickly the other night this is just a typical night at my house my life is not very eventful I spend most of the day working and usually at the end of the night / you know late afternoon I will be caught in the corner of the lounge it is hang videos on my computer browsing my annex a Facebook page playing with the dogs or that kind of thing and it's always late afternoon I realize I have not drinking enough water throughout the day so I'll often be seen scaling water all night I usually lose my concentration around like 5:30 at 6 so this is when I start playing around with the dogs and getting sidetracked by everything and I just start struggling I get really hungry it so it's usually time' to switch off the computer and it relax for the night make some food you know what I mean so I don't always like cook dinner me and Hamish love going out to eat but I've been trying to cook at home more often and this meal I'm going to show you is something I make quite often if you watch my vlog channel you guys know I make it for everyone like it's just one of my favorite meals ever first I'm just lighting up a candle this one is by crawlers it's called lust and it smells so incredible and I just find it really relaxing you know cooking food and just having that really lovely scent in the air sounds so cliche so now I'm just grabbing out my vegetables to prep dinner so I like to cut everything up first I'm just cutting up some pumpkin and other vegetables into little bite-sized pieces and I was like I'm gonna use this knife because it's really cute for the video but it's so blunt like seriously you can see me struggling like this was not safe so don't copy me and do what I did like use a sharp knife anyway I'm also using some cream wrap this is purple creamer oh boy I think sweet potato maybe in America you guys call it something like that and then I've got some orange at sweet potato / orange kumrah as well which is my personal favorite this is it here I'm just using about half of each vegetable I mean Hema sherry I usually make way too much but I was super hungry this day so I managed to eat it anyway I used a couple of little organic carrots as well you can pretty much use any vegetables you want like it really does not matter these are just some of my favorites I also really love to add in it onion you guys know if you watch my vlog channel how much I love onion so I do a whole one and I ate all by myself because Hamish doesn't like it I'm such an onion fan I know that's kind of gross to some people but huh red onion is like one of my favorite and then again like I'm obsessed with garlic man Hamish ate three whole garlic aged and I could have made more I just can't be bothered peeling it it's so boring peeling garlic this is the easy build stuff too and then I do a whole capsicum as well but I'm just putting this on the chopping board chopping it up so it's ready for later and because the oven is still preheating and I just put this to the side cuz we'll cook this in a grill it doesn't take too long oh look at Lois popping up in the background hello and then it just so it's really I'm going to chop up my halloumi now if you want to make this meal at vegan feel free to like completely skip this sometimes I don't add cheese but I just felt like halloumi today and this packet was open so we needed to use it anyway it's done me and Hamish you having three bits each and I'm just chopping it up so it's ready to go putting it aside and then I'm going to prep the veggies with some olive oil and some kipper and now I'm gonna pop it in the oven I think I put it on for like 15 minutes or so because the pieces of vegetables were like quite small and then I'm also going to put my quinoa so I'm using half a cup and making sure to rinse it out adding water and then I like to add some beef stock powder this is not real beef it's like a vegan beef tasting stock it tastes the exact same and so I just put in like half a teaspoon of that and then while all of the veggies are starting to cook I like to just sit down and often it at some of the vlog or some TV or something like that so if you love watching it daily vlogs make sure you head over to my vlog channel which is shining' so vlogs you can find it on YouTube really easily just type in Chile so vlogs and it'll pop right up and then after that like 15 to 20 minutes I just rotate the veggies Hamish came home he was working it so beauty all day shipping all of your Black Friday all it is and I like to chop up some cause lettuce which is my favorite with the salad and then grill up the halloumi and the capsicum in this little like press thing this literally takes like two to four minutes and I cooked up the quinoa while the roast videos were still in the oven so that it's cooled a little now and just sprinkling that over top of that veal lettuce as you can see I do lots of litters because I'm obsessed with lettuce I eat a lot of it and then the vegetables are all cut so I'm just going to pop some of them on each plate as well you can see how they're quite bite-sized I don't know I just like them really small like that because it makes them more fun to eat I like to mix up all the veggies it's so delicious and then that Papa and some cheese and I blooming that love olives I used to hate them with a passion and all of a sudden my taste buds change and I was all about olives like I don't know I'm obsessed with them for dressing me and Hamish love that both some a reduction and some aioli and we had done this pink in my stomach like right now so like let's go hey man I ain't never ate at the dining table we always ate watching at TV it's the only time we watch like a regular TV like daytime TV I have no idea what this show was but it was so cringy and so savage it was like a dating show and it was really brutal I was like what the heck is this so we watched that for a bit and then hey most of the dishes because I did most of the cooking tonight and I'm just playing with the dogs and relaxing letting the food settle before moving along it to our bedroom at scary forbid we spend most of the night and it bed literally just watching Netflix relaxing chilling chatting so first we're just straightening out the bed we always make our bed at night rather than the morning which I know is really weird like why not just make it when we wake up but we don't and the dogs always love to help so we play with them a little bit more of course before I get too comfy I like to get up and get ready I forbid it because otherwise I just could not be bothered removing my makeup when I'm really comfy so yeah doing that first I am pulling off my eyelashes I just wet my face with my face halo first and I'm putting my full slashes in it this little tray with some rose hip water micellar water rose micellar water and just covering the lashes and letting them soak overnight so that the lash glue comes off and they are nice and clean in the morning and then it using my face holo just to remove the rest of my makeup I love this thing and I like to just clean it with some detail like hand soap I'm after issues just here at Garrett of any bacteria in between deep cleans and then I like to deep clean my face especially when I've won a lot of makeup it's really important I like to put on it make Lin and then it used my face scrubby brush and I like the little rubber head this is my benedi planet when I have talked about a million times on YouTube and I like to just use this to get a nice deep clean and then I take a face cloth to rinse it off and wipe it off and I really massage the face cloth on at my lips to exfoliate my lips also and then it's time to exfoliate I use the smoothest skin at treatment which is like a little daily treatment and I like to put that all over my face and let that soak in and then follow with my moisturizer at night and you guys know how much I love this one as well I've talked about it a million times it's so hydrating and it makes my skin look so nice and I just love it I usually do this before I moisturize but I forgot I'm putting on some a trevally brow and revitalash also just to help my lashes and brows grow nice and strong and full and then of course one of the most important parts over your hygiene routine brushing it does beautiful teeth of yours you may have seen me briefly talking about this already but I've been using this for the past few weeks with Hamish with both got one each and I am just loving it so I'm working with vanity planet today which is the branch of this toothbrush it's called the elite sonic toothbrush to offer you guys are really a really good deal if you are interested in trying it out the toothbrush comes in at three different colors and it comes it with two brush heads plus one interdental brush so you can always have perfectly clean teeth and that blue light right there is a UV sanitizer which kills it 99% of germs and bacteria on the brush heads and I put both mine and Hamish azat brush head or replacements just in the same stand now another thing I love about this toothbrush is it comes at with three at different modes it's got clean dazzle and pulse the toothbrush runs for two minutes which is the recommended time to brush your teeth as I'm sure you guys know and it pauses in between and like each kind of area so you know how long to brush each area of your teeth for which is so handy and then after two minutes it just completely it turns right off so you know your vet brushed your teeth for long enough and me and Hamish just share one stand because each charge lasts like two weeks so we just switch it on every few days and take turns charging up our toothbrushes so if you want to try out this toothbrush it ends up being so so affordable you can get 75% off this toothbrush with the code shinning clean and the link down below so make sure you check it out next up lately I have been at placing my hair braiding my hair so first I just put in some split in Zermatt just to hydrate my ends and braid my hair and this just helps to stop knots because my hair has gotten so much longer I get a lot more not slightly so this just helps to get rid of it the possibility of knots and also gives my hair really nice wave in the morning I really like it I look so clumsy doing this as well it took me like three goes to get an even amount anyway then we are finally ready for bids so moving into bed I always give Louie lots of cuddles because he sleeps with us sometimes this will pop in as well but usually it's just us and Louie so we play with him and then we always turn on Netflix or something like that and watch a soma TV or some movies and how rude was this who asked about this notification I was like um excuse me comment down below and let me know your favorite show on Netflix at the moment we've just finished with this in a bit at this point obviously we were up to Episode five I thought it was so so good I wasn't sure about the in doing it but I really enjoyed it so that's what we were binging and once again skully more water always right before bed I try to drink at least two or three litres a day and we have a chat me and Hamish just hang out in bed like I said earlier going our phones we're gonna Instagram me and we'll do some snapchats quite often I love it Rita I love like the reddit app just browsing I just kind of like waste time I don't know I always like do so much during the day that at night I just waste time and relax and wind down so that's what I'm doing if you guys love snapchat and you want to follow me at my page is x/o shen with three a's and when me and Hamish a really fab it at night I have my little routine a rightful bed Hamish calls it like my little hippie routine like he's like this is so weird that I honestly think this works okay this house me like calm down and fall asleep so much faster so I'll list down below the products I use if you're interested I find them so so so calming I just chuckle this stuff on my pillow on my wrists on my neck like I've got all these different products I use but uh they smell so good too so yeah that's what I do right before bed and then it usually this puts me straight to sleep so it's time for lights off and snooze time I hope you guys enjoyed at this video please thumbs up if you did and feel free to leave me a comment and let me know if you do want a morning routine soon too and I'll chat here's my next video bye [Music] 
fluffy rue it what is going on I think Zeus must have been crawling around my friend makeup room because it's here everywhere hey everyone so today I am going to finally try out Winky Lux makeup already got my foundation on cuz I'm actually doing a little comparison between these two foundations which I'm pretty sure this video will be up well before this one so I'll link this video down below on a 1/2 side you know in there's an split face situation I just wanted to try out some of the face products before I finished that other videos so and here I'm going to try out the concealers and the powder and then we have eyes shadows and lipsticks and all sorts of fun stuff to try today so let's dive straight in first off they do have these little lip color correctors lemons Oh corrector sorbet character and then mint crudo so they're just colored the mint one is for red spots like purples and stuffy sorbet croutons for dark circles which I kind of want to try today I have like ubud dog so close but I still want to try it and then the other one I have here is the 11 - character which is for balancing and brightening which I'll probably donate this one so don't really need that so let's try out these sorbet corrector so as I tried to stuff it's been sitting in my collection for months probably and if you watch my pron boxing's they sing me a few things and then I think another company sent me a few things I'll link down below where you can get it from a few changes blows me away like it's the cutest packaging these in particular I have little stripes and then some of them have like these the eyes and they'll show you some more so in like the packaging is amazing like I'm gonna use the siRNA but look at that's so stunning I just love it and then the actual packaging for these little color correctors for the concealers are just white and then I've got a label on the back so we're using its sorbet this is my first impression I've never played with any of these products before so with this I'm just going to use a jewel petal brush it's very thick and creamy look at that you can see the texture on the brush probably won't need that much well it's just tip someone if you guys tried this brand before if you had you should comment down below and let me know what you thought of the products because I'm not gonna be able to try everything today obviously there's like multiple colors and multiple products it good like I would slay them and try more I'd love to know what your opinions are right their darkest area I need mostly I literally think I got like three out of sleep last night was so bad I couldn't honestly I was just lying there overthinking everything in my life the worst when that happens like I know that happens to so many different people it's like when I'm really stressed I was cut all asleep I'm just like oh let's think about something embarrassing that happen like 18 years ago okay so opinion on that product it is it so easy to blend it is very pigmented like you saw it and so creamy I feel like it's starting to sink into my under eye lines a little bit so we want to work quickly and state it down just to prevent the creasing and everything you know and then I have two concealers here it looks like this I've got light medium and light so I think I'll start with light because I want to have a really bright under-eye oh my god the actual packaging is so adorable that by the way do you like my new nails thank you yeah so yeah once again I am using at the shade light this is called the full coverage under-eye concealer and it comes in a little squeeze tube I have no idea how much we need it's probably way too much but let's just start with that I'm gonna use the same brush okay this is definitely not a texture I'm used to I don't know how to explain it it's like thick and like which feeling hold on let me wipe off my brush and we'll see if it blends better it's not like it's hard to blend it's just a very strange strange formula I feel like it didn't really cover that much either I wouldn't really call it a full look coverage like you know it's nothing on like shape tape or the nice creamy radiant concealer or anything like that like it's quite natural I really like the finish of it though it's a nice natural finish and it doesn't look as heavy as it feels like it's gonna be it's just so wet like it feels cold on your face when you apply it almost feels like an eye cream or something okay I just see it under my eyes and on my nose with my kit blondie at sitting powder my opinion on those products like I definitely like the way that corrective felt but to be honest I don't really reach for correct is it your read a you know it's kind of like a specialized thing if you are looking for a correct I think that one was so creamy and easy to blend the concealer I can't really see myself reaching for that to be honest and then next up we have a first powder so it comes with a little protective film a literal sponge and that's what the powder looks like so it's white packaging same as before and then at the box is so cute so this one here is medium I think and then the one I have here is light so I might just see what medium looks like because like might be a little bit too like it looks kind of orange like I'm not gonna lie like that color there so I'm using a powder brush but this by the way I should probably read to you what it says right this is called the diamond powder or girl's best friend and it says this lightweight foundation powder contains genuine crushed diamonds the ultimate coverage and glow special diamond technology illuminates skin while diffusing imperfections leaving a soft focus effect and shine free finish so I'm just going to start the small amount and just start tapping that on like I would normally use my powder I don't think it's making me go Orange so that's good oh yeah it gives you a very shiny finish like not shiny but like soft shimmer I guess I like the finish but it can look a little bit cakey like I feel like it's looking a little bit cakey on my forehead I like this I don't know if I'm in love but I definitely want to experiment with it some more and try it some more it's so weird because when i swatched on my finger it doesn't really look shiny but for some reason when i buff it into my skin it stops it's like it transforms into a shininess but it doesn't I don't know like look at that finish if you want like a Joey a glowy finish like it's almost like a highlighter like all over it's almost a little bit intense I don't mind it I'm just not used to it it's quite intense okay I'm actually loving a whole my skin is looking definitely not for you if you like a matte finish though of course so next up we have a brow pin so I've already taken it out of the box so I have no idea what color that says it doesn't actually say however it looks like a really nice color so this is how it looks it's like one of those little triangular shaped ones that make sense lightly goof proof by benefit or like my I think I've got one by Tom Ford or something like that on our Alec glass I've been using this one quite often lately so it's very similar to those friends this one does not have a spoolie on the other end but that's okay I love the packaging it's soap it's of cure it's very pigmented I like the color he used my alla gloss Bulli oh it does save us fully on the other end oh my gosh that was so conceal what I couldn't even see it there okay okay this is so incredibly creamy of no idea it's so impecca anted usually I go for a bit of a hotter eyebrow pencil just so you can get a more precise line but I can't deny like this is pretty good I'm just struggling a little bit with it because I feel like if you blend it too much it stuff's going quite catchy so like just trinket that balance of blending and strokes like it's kind of hug because it's so creamy okay I feel like it's not my favorite but if you like a creamier kind of formula I think you'll like it I just feel like it's nice too creamy for me I prefer something like I said a little bit harder my eyebrows are just being darker and darker as I try to fix them okay I'm gonna do the other eye and I'll be right back twelve seconds later okay so I set my brows with brow mascara and also put a little bit of I prime X now we are going to try the eye shadows which I'm kind of like the most excited about so first off we have a collab and this is the winky likes Matt SIA Natura shadow palette like natural with Noelle and the colors look like this there's like a bright gold green orange and a couple of like neutral warm Browns and then this one the packaging like is this is the cutest bloomin packaging your bed this is the kitchen pellet and it's got a little like diagram of the colors on the back and then these are the colors on the inside so I think I'm mostly gonna use this palette today so I want to do something quite natural like white I don't really feel like doing anything crazy today I just want to stop the formulas so maybe even like these colors like those ones they look so pretty so I'm just gonna dive straight in fifth things first I'm going to take a round eye brush and I'm gonna take this shade here which looks like a beautiful slightly warm medium brown that shade like a perfect transition shade from my skin tone and I'm using a round eye brush just to really buff this out but here some way I can feel it just to really buff this out so it looks really really seamless and blowing out and then I use a different brush to kind of build it up soon look how beautiful that color is it's very very soft and easy to blend not chalky and there's no fallout so far I just look at this pallets so Herbert a I'm also gonna take some of this and just like slip it underneath I really like the look of it and to make the eye that's totally up to you of course if you're like recreating this look even though it's going to be very simple okay so I like that color a lot I think that's so pretty like the perfect warm tone that's not too like to warm if that makes sense like it's a very nice wearable color next up I'm going to take a really small amount of that super dark brown which could be very risky this is a crease blender brush I just want to kind of put that now outer corner and like stuck learning that into the crease also the color looked patchy at first but I think it's just because I use like no product cuz as I build it up and just slowly build it up it's looking really pretty like really seamless I really like how that worked this palette is well like you can create a look with any of a side way or you could create a look with them going down as well or you can mix and match but it's actually laid out really nicely I'm just gonna go in with my round eye brush and mix together these two shades with listeth the die Brown I'm just going just to make sure it's nice and seamless nice top I'm taking a at crease detail brush and I'm not really interested in that light lilac color and then the one above it so I'm gonna start with the lilac and just a little bit of that on the inner corner it's really nice a fan of that that's a really pretty color and then I'm gonna take these same brush and it to this color just here wow that's unique it's almost like a light blue taupe okay this look it's no longer chill is all of a sudden very out-there there's such a cool color I've never seen a color like that we're very minimal fallout just like normal the normal amount when you're picking on eyeshadow that color there looks amazing but I don't want to use it today because then I'm doing a lip swatch video soon so I don't want to have like anything too crazy it already is a little bit anyway I really want to use that type one day though tarp teal is what I was supposed to say then I'm just wiping off my brush and going in that area this J just here oh my god something I should all my just to highlight the brow line you like this color isn't as pigmented but it is a very light color so you can barely see it on my let me just use this color if I use the palette I just use this to stay at Primark because it's very unnoticeable and then I'm just taking my crease blender into that Brown again these eyeshadows are so nice I really like them and I think those colors are so unique and too not just your typical palette that's got like your typical colors it's definitely got some unique stuff in there so I'm so impressed with that I am so excited to use this again okay neat stuff I don't have a Winky likes like mascara eyeliner anything like that I'm not sure if they do them I just don't have any so I'm going to do a quick wing it using my Tom Ford eyeliner which I mentioned in my monthly favorites is it up yet hopefully I'll link it below it is okay I did that thing where I started doing my eyeliner and it just got thicker and thicker and thicker and here we are so we're going thick here today and it's not even even and I just kept trying it kept getting thicker and thicker so I'm giving up now this is the shell victorie full-fat lashes mascara I really like this I mentioned in my favorites also it makes my lashes huge like with just one coat I'll show you a difference I could before it off - if you can see past this ugly thick a if eyeliner I'm gonna wear dramatic lashes today that kind of hopefully belling's out the liner I don't know if you can see the difference but anyway trust me it's amazing and then today I am reusing one of my faux mink lash is called the illusion by XO beauty I love these lectures so so much okay and then the next couple of products I have here actually first let's do this because this is a lip plumper and I want to try it out for a lipstick that packaging is probably like one of my most favorite out of all of the products look at how cute the size of the lemons it's sort of like vintage I love it ooh maybe you're supposed to use this after after you look today I just want to put some one now anyway so this is called the pucker up lip plumper by Winky Lux duh lip injections in a bottle one swipe and you can feel the tingle enhance your lips the end result is a sherry pout with the smell of delicious lemon cake sounds amazing so I'm just gonna wipe off my lips over this foundation pay is once again so adorable comes with a little flat applicator looks very similar to a so beauty lipsticks I love it it's a little bit coarse II like this shimmer you can feel it when you rub your lips together oh yeah that's tingly smells incredible like so good okay let's see if it works I'll continue so next up with a couple of these little like face things I think they like a cream does it seems like vault stripping balm this is in radiant pink smooth line melts and skin for a high impact illumination for the best result supplies fingers okay so this is normally something I would probably use before sitting my face with powder and then the other one I have is called bubbles so I'll show you both so bubbles is like a highlight shade and then the shade what's this one called radiant pink it's like a blush kind of shade oh yes it's so balmy and it's very like thin you can tell by looking at it when you apply it like it doesn't really have much pigment it's more like a shine I'm gonna go against what it says and use a little joy fiber brush this is a detail fiber brush bake so beauty because that's my favorite way to apply creamy products and I'm just going to gently buy a small amount of that over my cheek area my skin attorney looks glowy from that sitting powder I mean it's pretty but it doesn't really have any pigment it just looks a bit low E well it's kind of breaking up the foundation underneath so I'm just gonna stick that down what should I use okay this one's right in front of me I'm gonna use loosen to sit that on the cheekbone area I don't want it to like ruin my foundation I definitely think you're better off using that for you use your powder just so it doesn't like break it all up and then sit it afterwards with a powder that does look so so bold dog that's pretty and then I'm just going to use the same brush and just put on a little bit of blush just amazing there to lighter colors okay that looks better now my foundation doesn't look ruined anymore so yeah definitely need a powder with that product that is stunning it reminds me of the Mac they called I used to use them all the time on my channel you know the little like glowy creamy things I can't remember what they were called it's just completely vanished out of my head that is so so glowy and radiant the whole base just looks like glowing now so okay I need to contour because I look like a potato I'm just going to use my hardest pro glow at contour shade any almonds before and I have them all documented the lump it definitely feels like tingly but it doesn't feel like too much you know what I mean like it doesn't hurt I don't know if my lips look any different though they just look glassy a definitely my favorite so far I should repeal it and then I actually really like these little creamy things I just ya think you should do it before powder so it doesn't seep right look this is bubbles that is so cool I wish I use that one that's so Indian so it's like Silva it's like pink and silver at the same time oh my gosh I am so trying that soon oh my gosh okay now for lipstick this box is by far my favorite oh my gosh here we go so this box here oh my gosh this is by far my favorite it is so beautiful again quite like vintage looking in this shade in here is called a latte or a lot I don't know AUL AIT creamy dreamy fluffier ooh it what is going on I think Jesus must have been crawling around my friend makeup room cuz it's here everywhere okay the packaging they look like pills they're very unique and then this is what the inside looks like so this is like a brownish note like a pale at Brown II turned nerd I'm gonna show you what shades I have the next one I have here is in the shade parfait and it's like a deep berry pink and then we have it three that look like this in this box which is equally it's stunning boyishly I like that one more but this is still pretty these ones here called the ellipse the law so I've got poppy all the packaging is different on these ones they're gold and silver rather than rose gold and white so this is poppy it's like anymore but pink this is so pretty distantly looking like one of my faves next up we have a sleigh which is like a greige kind of brownish color quite cool maybe I could try that one on because it's quite different and then the last one I have here is in the shade meow this again is kind of like a brownish like pinkish Brown I should coop know which color I want to use should I just do this one I feel like it'll look cool with Mike mo I'm wearing once they take this hair towel off I feel like this whole look will look a lot nicer it's very all over the show right now so yeah once again I'm using at the lip velour and in its lay wow it's so creamy I thought it was gonna be really like like stiff well suddenly I don't know that is such a cool color I love the color is a very greyish color it's very cool 2000 years later because just went off entered my head and the friggin lighting is completely changed but regardless this look color what the camera looks so super cool so overall I definitely like the lipstick and the eyeshadow the best I love the highlighter once it's it I don't think I'd ever use it just alone because it is sort of slimy I feel like it's the kind of product you do need to like layer but it makes the highlighter like standing out like nobody's business and I definitely want to continue to test out the powder I do have to say I wouldn't enter the bathroom before when I was with my hair and my face does look a little bit more like pink / orange they're normal because I think that undertone is just a little bit off for me like it is quite an orange II get powder but the light color definitely looks a little bit better they say like that looks less virgin or mean so I might save this for when I've got paler skin I think the medium one I might just give away because it doesn't really work for me but this color hair looks a lot safer so hopefully when I've got you know least fake tan on or whatever this color will be okay because I do like the way my skin looks with the shimmer it does look at little bit cakey in some areas like I said overall like it looks really Julie and pretty so I am pretty impressed with that as well I don't really think there were any bad products they just weren't like my boyfriend's like the concealer like I don't know it was very light weight feeling and notice hi coverages I would like however if you're more of a natural makeup where you might really like that one and the eyebrow pencils same kind of thing like it was just creamier than what I prefer so if you like a creamier product you might really like that one for me I prefer something a little bit stiffer if it's in a pencil form just because I find it easier to get like a nice sharp line otherwise I feel like it can go quite like and in our to blended looking or something like that I mean they still look really good like the brows look really good so I'm still pretty stoked a lip color though like it feels so hydrating and lightweight it's not sticky it just looks amazing and it was really easy to apply I was kind of iffy about the packaging at first but it's completely fine like it's so easy to use and by the way when you buy the lipsticks the labels on the inside if you didn't know cuz I didn't know theirs at first so yeah I had heaps of fun trying out this brand I love trying out new brands if there are any other brands you want me to try out in a video like this just let me know I wanted to call this like a full face one brand tutorial obviously like I don't hit certain products so I can do a complete full face but I did what I could with the products I head once again I'll link the brand down below if you want to check them out I think the packaging is so so cool it is so unique and really different from like a lot of other brands on the market and the products are really nice like like the eyeshadows and stuff I definitely want to see if they've got some more pellets because I would be definitely keen to try out some more of those I love the colors so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video like I said and if you did please give a thumbs up and I'll talk to you guys in my next one you [Music] 
hello people so today I'm doing another cocktail words but I don't even know what cocktail I'm doing at the stage so should probably figure that out I really want to use the Jeffrey star and drogyny palette like I've just been wanting to use it for so long and I've gotten so many requests to do it I haven't done it since I'm talking the cocktail series I really want to do it like over I don't know let me see what I can find I'll link my previous cocktail looks down below especially if you like color you must check them out guys what is that am I tired rum I think it's like dark rum dark rum white room orange lime I mean we've got some rum kind of colors and orange and kind of colors just drop my phone and they and rashmi palette so maybe we could do something like this here's how it looks sometimes they're a little bit more orange sometimes they're a little bit more super super dark you know cocktails change all the time depends how people make them that one's got some pineapple juice in it so let's do something on my tires by it's a little bit green from the lime as well so maybe I'll do a little bit of green again I don't know so first up I'm going to do my eyebrows using the Urban Decay brow box this is in the shade at brown sugar and my eyebrow groomer brush by the way I've got my foundation on already if you couldn't guess I'm doing in your first impression today on the top step foundation I'm just using a mixture of the two colors in the burl box my lips are so freaking cry so I'm upon some lip balm as well I'm just being use this tight lip balm thing in the nude shade quench lip rescue the car cute and baby it is I love it please do through a really moisturizer and a little bit of it gimme brow shade three just in my brows to put the hairs in place a little bit of volume and then it to prime at my eyes today I'm going to use smashbox white base I am running out of clean brushes you guys this is not good currently taking applications for professional brush washers that I don't show myself kidding but also that would be good this sit here is a round I brush I'm just kind of patting it in as you can see it's not super white you can layer it up and make it whiter but it just kind of blinged out on my skin tone to like a pale pale pale color we're going to try something super random today so for the green I'm going to start with prima in my crease this could be a very bad bad idea I'm going to use a firm leaner brush so it's this color right here military it's a really nice like military army green connect khaki color so I'm just going to slip it straight in and then blend subscribe to the color of our mint that they put on sometimes with the lime even though I'm obviously a little bit brighter than this color but hey I don't care for really pretty color I love it I'm going all the way end to be in a corner area and you should really really like this color look cool just like all over the eyelid like just as like it's only makeup look with a little bit of a neutral brown in the crease it's quite unusual kind of green is a very wearable green and then now I'm going to take the shade a charm to represent the orange quite a yellowy orange but I might add a little bit of a brighter orange somewhere else in the look so let's just pet this straight on the seams of the eye oh my gosh that's so pigmented this is just an eyeshadow brush coats more orange on my eyes in in here looks more yellow in here and then on my eye goes morons you should orange like 20 times demony okay I'm just going to bring it in to CNN at it because I think I'm going to do a halo eye and use the dark rum color on the inner and outer so the dark rum colors obviously maybe some dominatrix mix with a tiny bit of finish I'm going to use this on a pencil brush that's so pigmented edges with four miles Wow so this one here is a tulip crease brush it's really packing on color as well but I'm just going to use it to blend these colors just take it a little bit of product or a brush as well to help I'm thinking on when I have to use a little bit of a neutral kind of brown in the crease just to help everything transition nicely bring there a little bit down here to these colors are just so beautiful to blend okay I'm still believe that this now we'll do the other side and make sure it matches before you do anything else honestly this pigment if you don't have this pigment at home obviously to choose whatever you have there's no rules you can use any similar colors or you could switch out the colors like okay do what you want how nice is this lip balm it just looks good I am going to just bring some of that finish and charm color mixed together sort of this one in this one not putting the fingers that you saw offering that a little bit in the crease not all the way just a little bit so that this is a little bit of gap in the middle I need to like conceal this because I've gone crazy some reason good one chin and I'm using the brush I use in my crease with the green color and I take a little bit of this one and I'm going to put that back in the crease just blend everything hopefully because this is a very strange color combo and I don't know how Santa works up trying out this is it you know what I really like how this is looking I know isn't that creepy but I know I know but we'll pull through on this look and now I just want to use a little bit of day Java which is like this most perfect shimmery warm kind of brown and then that kind of next to oh my god yes next to the orange like a little bit on the orange a little bit on the outer and inner corner this color is so nice I like this because the green is just kind of hinting through it's very low-key I mean it also kind of looks like I've got a bruise punch die but that's fine it's just what happened I'm just taking some charm my finger and just intensifying right on the middle I feel like we need to represent the orange juice some more especially for all of those super orange my tides out there that don't have a lot of Darkness so what I'm going to do is use a orange eyeliner I don't have an orange eyeliner I don't think orange lip liner because that's what I'm doing if you are trying this on please make sure it's like safe I don't want you getting pinkeye or anything on my Accord this my hair is what a blast I'm Eric and it's super orange orange juice represent now I'm going to go back in with my androgyny go in with charm again orangey color I'm going to run this all the way underneath then we're going to use a little bit of the brown as well I'm going quite here the under the eyes today I'm going out in public today although going bright I'm going to use this masquerade money by Juvia I'm going to use the shared Giza I think I think that's what this one's cool that one's mine oh I'm getting access to their really nice kind of almost like a silver color this can be the white rum I think it actually goes quite nicely with the slopes it's very subtle but still shiny I'm actually going to take some Beauty people eyeshadow this is in the shade sugar light five Beauty people it's cream round it's super shimmery with a foiled eyeshadow but it's also got a little bit of a kind of that peachy RNG undertone to it proof set on top of it inner corner I'm using a lip brush by the way which works really well does come product also going to bring it just in a little man just cuz I feel like very easy to say I'm going to take care of just this color just here orange was like gold in it shimmer on my little chillip crease brush we just put a little bit of that under here too it's a little bit more vibrant so here is the eye makeup you can see it the green just peeking through got this cream eyeliner Brown by Natasha Damona so then it's hash designer I want anything a winged liner brush like so beauty maybe use this eyeliner before so hopefully it is a goodie they must look quite nice because it'd be semi subtle since it's brown it's a little bit dried formula how I feel about it quite difficult to work with no need to lead your alone or something in there if you like wings lining you seriously need this brush it is so easy that from when the eyeliners spre getting not easy to draw odd so let's see how it likes steps because it's just so late sick needs to be a little bit more creamy now I'm going to use some it Chanel lid volume additional - Karen evil looks good - up eyelash glue my eyelashes which I do today so just what I'm going to use falsies anyway I'll stir myself oh god just scare myself me I ruin the whole eye I am going to use some soul mate lashes at today because the goal of the brown on them and they're quite traumatic they cannot Network a minute like is still dramatic but they're not like crazy I'm just using a gel latex free glue today and then just adding a little more mascara to blend the lecturers you see the difference hopefully so the new Tarte palette this one yeah you certainly get read with Matt don't know if it's a cute or not it was so much more like clumpy like I like the eye shows the contour colors they just let you put on your face it which is like it looks stuck and it's with powdery of weird and this one goes on like a dream so I don't know what the difference is but maybe the formulas different I don't overly am imagining it I'm not close to like this part of it as this formulation is just you know cheating that's the best I'm going to use a bronzer brush a two day this brush is still good especially if you like contouring use it for contouring at blush bronzer highlighter under eyes like everything it's the best alright let's clean up is amiss pretty stuck on matey we're just going to do out this but I'm worried about okay now for the blush I want to do something like yellowy orange II you know something like that okay I'm going to use a tapered fiber brush within decent by Urban Decay just a really pale kind of peachy orange color it's being washed out a little bit by make your methods but I'm going to use kind of a hippie hand this is such a beautiful color look it's a very flattering kind of peach and then just for a pop this is bang a fight over decay literally using the tiniest amount and then just adding a little bit of that on top optional of course I'm loving like heaps of blush lately if you don't like this much then don't do it I mean for highlighter not something high peachy I guess I'm going to use this this is by artist couture it's in the shade it double-take it's like a pale pinky peachy orange you can reflect I'm just going to use the same Mishima chill brush that been using under my eyes or god this dust so pigmented you should be so careful not to use like too much I'm just taking literally like you see this this brush if it will be by the way a little more oh god too much too much I think I need to mix it with a lighter champagne color to kind of bring it together with thee in a corner and stuff might use some at Mary Lu just like the very high point okay now to being it lips to finish off that our my file look I'm thinking just candy orange just because obviously by Kaiser very orange is because a disgusted meaning like look oh my gosh I just had a flashback when I went to Rarotonga recently they gave me a mai tai I go to my Fighter II strong and it almost killed me it was so freaking strong I could like barely even taste anything with like nail polish remover into you know what I'm going to take same lip liner would blast the neck how cool does that look okay they still a little bit allowed hung on the middle part of my lips which is bike so beauty just like a really hot kind of heartily orangey peachy color then I'm going to take this tumble dry let's take my Mac look this leg matches my lipstick this is my tie so I hope you guys enjoy this makeup tutorial this cocktail series is definitely making me like break out of my comfort zone and use more colors and stuff that's quite a challenge like still trying to make these colors look quite wearable you know what I mean I'm happy to leave the house like this sir me I've got no choice because I'm doing the first impressions I can't wipe off my makeup I have to go out today yeah but I will say she quite fun so if you have the androgyny palette in Diego you could also like to pair up this eye makeup look with just a nude or something like that like a brown and that would look really nice just to turn it down a little bit so yeah let's do your completed look I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did don't forget to give a thumbs up and if you made it to the end here the question of the day for you what is your favorite flavor of juice I love pineapple juice I love the pineapple juice like I love it so much that amazing day and I will talk to you soon bye [Music] 
hey everyone so today I am at doing a morning routine and this is a very realistic morning routine for me you guys requested it in my last evening routine video I did like a week or two ago so here we are my wake-up time is so inconsistent it's usually between maybe 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. I open up the curtains to help me wake up a bit better and hop on my phone and just scroll Instagram scroll my messages catch up on drinking some water and I usually like to hang out with the dogs cuz that the dogs have been sleeping with us lately well Lois always sleeps with us but this has been sleeping with us lately he's freaking out over my morning breath so then it is time to drag myself up and be productive if I procrastinate very much I won't end up going to the gym I go the German pretty much every weekday I try to go so I just hop up get changed and head it straight out the door to the gym and they actually did go the gym by the way how much come in and turn the camera back on and this is Zeus's reaction every time I get home his little tail does little flips he's so excited every time we go he's the cutest little thing so go to the gym for an hour to an hour and a half and then usually I'm starting my vlog if you guys watch my vlog channel you know how it is so that's what I'm doing here and then I don't have breakfast every day but when I do want some breakfast this is my go-to I should really have breakfast every day about I know lately I just haven't been bothered so I like to make a quick smoothie it's really like nutritional quick easy not too unhealthy not too heavy because I can feel a little bit sick in the morning if I have something super full on for breakfast I don't know about you guys and then I usually just add water and blend it up until it's nice and colorful so this is how today is when it turned out sometimes they're very green depending what I put a net but today it's pretty and purple which I love and then I like to use a middle straw I just bought these online while Hamish put them online I'm not sure where but you can just go glit people ask me all the time there's like a million different Erie tailors there to sell them so while I drink my smoothie have my breakfast I like to head to my computer and just start working away a little bit and today I was just working on a thumbnail I get lots of questions on you know how I edit my thumbnails I chat them together on Photoshop so I thought I would just show you a little sneak peek right here if I'm not doing a thumbnail I'll do my emails or I like it added a little bit of a video or just something like that just to start off my day by getting something get done and then once I finished my smoothie it's off to the bathroom brush my teeth which I know gross I don't drop the water Jumba I just don't otherwise if I miss around too much before going to the gym I won't go so I'll be like I can't be bothered anymore so I just get up and go so brushing my teeth and then I usually have some false lashes waiting for me to clean so I showed you that in the nighttime routine how I soaked them these lashes are the chic so in the morning all I have to do is clean the little bowl and then it pick off any excess of glue and then just wipe them down wipe off any excess mascara anything and they're ready to go again [Music] and then before I hop in the shower I like to put a little bit of dry shampoo in my hair if I'm not washing it that day like I wasn't today but I've been to the gym so I just want to refresh my hair a little bit I like to just put it in and let it kind of soak track my hair up in a bun before the shower I am a morning shower I love morning showers just because they make me feel wide awake and refreshed and especially after the gym of course like I don't want to be it's the wedding all day and I am a fast AF shower I usually take about 3 to 6 minutes or so depending what I'm doing in there so I'm first taking my face wash this is my all-time favorite and just applying a little bit of that to my face and especially after the gym sometimes my skin feels extra Gong Kieffer's my face sweats so I'm just using a face brush as well just to really deep clean and I like the silicone here I've said it a million times in my videos so I won't blobel on too much but I love this look on here because it's nice and gentle and doesn't spread it bacteria as much as the other brush heads do so I'm just doing that for about 30 to 40 seconds and then rinsing off my face and then every few days I'll use an exfoliator I'm loving this one at the moment it's so gentle but it foams up hard out and always goes up my nose in it I hate the feeling of stuff going up my nose like forum like foam cleans is so yeah you can see how much it phones but it's basically one of those little powdery exfoliate is they used to mesh on your wet face and it just kind of exfoliates really gently and you know cleans as well so this is nice after the gym for me as well the body wash I'm using at present is at this one here it's a minty flavor awesome to what do you want to say so I use a lot of and and just of course clean my entire body and then hopping out I like to stand in my towel and just do the rest of my skincare routine so studying with then revita brow and the revitalash I chuck that straight on my bare skin because it sucks in really nicely or I'll do it before my makeup but usually I remember to do it first thing in the morning I've been really good lately and then I'm using a equity treatment because while I was filming this I had a really bad like deep blind pimple and I find this one's quite good for blind pimples rather than the ones I used that dry out pimples since it doesn't have a head you know so just kind of put in that wherever I've got some breakouts while I'm there and then I use this oil I've been using this one lately can we get a really good go so I'll let you know what I think of it when I do my next empties video once it's all used up so popping on an oil and then of course once that's finished I like to do a little bit of a moisturizer especially one that has some SPF in it so the one that is my all-time favorite is this one here I love it so much so just putting a pump on at my face and my neck and my chest [Music] and after this I'm almost ready to go I like to just finish off by kind of fixing my hair I don't do much to my hair most days like if I'm just filming I kind of just leave it natural seems to look okay on camera I don't know sometimes I'll curl it but you know so I'm just kind of massaging out that dry schampoo brushing it and then I like to put in a little bit of serum as well just to smooth any ends that have gone a bit haywire during the night and that is literally my hair done so it's pretty much most days you know realistic I don't bother styling it what I'm just hanging out at home so then I like to go get change from the day I always look much fancier from the top half it's in the bottom half I'm just really casual shorts so heading into my Beauty room and then usually that's when I start filming and if I'm not filming I'm editing and that is literally at my morning routine I know it's not as glam that's the reality of it so I hope you guys enjoyed it and if you did please give it a thumbs up and I'll talk to you guys in my next video bye [Music] 
every one so I put together this really easy vampirish diminish devil look it was supposed to be a devil if you couldn't tell from the horns but you could use it any of those costumes to be honest it is really really pretty and glam while still being a little bit creepy with like the veining and the creepy lips the dark contacts which are totally optional of course yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this Halloween tutorial so starting out with my skin I'm taking a pale foundation and just applying that all over my face and I'm building it up through a pretty full of coverage I'm just using my flawless finished punch back so beauty to blend that out and then taking a really pale concealer under my eyes to conceal as well in a triangular shape using that same sponge to buff it out I still don't know how I feel about this concealer it's definitely not my favorite I don't really see the hype like it's not bad but I don't think it's like amazing I don't know anyway then I'm sitting it with a translucent powder just to make sure that it lasts all night or all day or whatever you're wearing this I don't know and then I'm doing my eyebrows so I'm starting out by just filling them in how I normally would so I'm using a brow pomade and a nice little thin brush this is an eyebrow groomer brush by XO beauty and try to make them quite sharp as well and quite well filled in so they're quite dark and then I'm taking a black eyeliner and just outlining the tail and like the middle of my eyebrow with that black eye shadow and I don't know I just think it looks really cool and creepy and kind of goes with the Halloween theme I guess next up you want a I should repel it with some eyeshadows that it kind of warm tones like Reds and stuff like that so the desert dust capela is absolutely perfect first I'm taking Musk on a fluffy blending brush and just buffing that all through the crease it's kind of like a grayish neutral so if you have like a grayish and neutral eyeshadow that'll be perfect and it just kind of goes with like the really pale skin I guess it makes it look a little bit creepier and then I'm taking the red color and buffing it through at the crease and enter an outer corner a little bit and just building that up and blending it out until it looks nice and even next up I am mixing it together these two shades on my finger one of them's quite glittery and I'm just pressing that all over the eyelid I did get a little bit of fallout so I just used a little shimmer fan brush to kind of sweep that away and worked fine and then I'm just going back in with that other grayish neutral color and putting that underneath my lash line just as a starter to kind of I don't know made my eyes pop a little bit more I guess and then what I'm doing is taking that black eye should I use before with a winged liner brush and just kind of winging out there in the corner I'm kind of just mapping it out we're going to use some of that gel eyeliner next which is this one right here black track by Mac is my favorite one because it just doesn't smudge and go everywhere once it's set so you can use it like on your waterline and stuff and it doesn't move it's so good so I'm just applying it to my waterline and filling in that little inner corner part and then I also use it to create a winged eyeliner [Music] see [Music] I wanted it to look a little smokier so I took a black eye sturgis today out of corner of my lower lash line to kind of buff it out and joins it up with the wing on the outer corner of my eye and then i'm taking it that red color again and intensifying the crease just because i decided once i at the eyeliner on i wanted it to look a lot more dramatic so that's what i'm doing here and then just using a nice big fluffy brush to continue to blend that out so it's nice and soft and I kind of still lift it quite vivid if there make sense so don't bleed too too much you want it to look bold still and then I am highlighting my brow bone this colors not really light enough for my skin tone beautiful medium skin tones but whatever you see anyway and I'm using this red eye shadow by Illamasqua and just buffing some of that it's really a beginning of my crease closest to like where my nose is like the inner corner of my eye just to really make the red pop like it's super bright this red I wanted over dramatic lashes for this look so just putting some glue my hand and then going straight onto my mascara while that kind of gets a little bit tacky so I'm using this gifted at mascara by higher on my top and bottom lashes check out that nice as mascara face yes I'm using these ones here Noelle faux mink lashes by huda beauty they're really really pretty so just popping those on and then cleaning up the mascara I messed up and then I used some of this red glitter bail it on my inner corner just because I thought it really looked cool like when my eyes were open I felt like there wasn't enough red happening so I just added this here and then I really loved it so I decide to put some on my eyelid too so I just messed it on there as well [Music] even though I want to look pale I still wanted to have a little bit of dimension on my face so I put on some of this really pale bronzer just to my nose chin forehead cheeks chin did I say that already probably you know and then I'm contouring and I'm using a couple of different colors to contour because I wanted my contour to be a very very dramatic and angular so you'll see I'm kind of bringing it down even further than normal down my face close to the edges of my mouth then I'm using another brush which is even thinner and that color from the huda beauty palette which is kind of grayish and yeah it's just making the contour like super amplified and super angular and then I kind of put my face front floored it to the mirror and just kind of like contoured out that like part of my lower cheek chin area you know does that make sense I hope so and then I'm using that red eye shadows of lush [Music] I am going dramatic from a highlighter so I'm using something stupid literally literally what I always a glitter aliy instead of glittery anyway something dramatic is my highlighter cuz why not it's holding and then I'm using a black lip pencil in a red lip pencil and you can totally just use black eyeliner if you prefer I just had this one so I thought I'd try it out and I'm just lining my lips first with that black and then I'm kind of winging it out on my outer corner of my lip and I'm really bad at lapatin any kind of like different shaped lip liner lipstick anything anything that is not just my natural lip line so don't worry if you're not that good at it just try your best I'm just doing my best here so I'm lining my entire lip and then going inside and on top of the black with the red and kind of blending that together and I'm not too worried about how it looks yet because next I'm gonna take a liquid lipstick this one's beaucoup de Beauty and it's in the shade icon it's like a deep kind of reddish terracotta ish color light muted read almost and I'm blending that on top and then I'm gonna take the red lip liner again and kind of blend into that and make it all blend together hopefully and that's kind of how I did it so yeah I really am not that good if I can do it you can do it I think it turned out decent like it's not perfect but I mean I think it's good enough and then I'm taking a lip topper on top of that so you can just use like a red lip gloss if you want a this one could feel this by her beauty and I'm just applying that straight on top when I think of devil costumes like the typical devil costumes I always think of like latex and like liver liver so I thought I did gloss to kind of mimic that you know idea I guess and then I'm using concealer to tidy up the lips because I always make mistakes with stuff like this next I'm adding my contacts these ones I just picked up off pinkyparadise they're just black red looks really cool as well just FYI and that's how it looks without the veining so you can keep it like that if you want but I thought I'd add veining just because I felt like it I did a veining tutorial and another one of my videos for Halloween I'll link it below it's actually way better than this like I did a way better than this so you can copy that one if you want I'll link it below like I said but yeah basically just using a watered-down gel liner and just dragging it down my eyes and dabbing it out with my fingers and then I use a little bit of all white eyeshadow mixed with water just to kind of you know make it balance out the sides make it bounce another slice this is amazing you know what I mean give it some dimension yeah [Music] and do you have it like I said this is perfect for like a demon log or even a vampire look if you're dressing up as a vampire it's perfect that's the completed look it is so easy you guys it took me like an hour to do I hope it was simple enough for you guys to follow as well I do like to do more simple tutorials sometimes because those the ones that you guys actually like to recreate most of the time you know there's no special effects needed or anything like that it's so easy so make sure you thumbs up this video if you did enjoy it and I will talk to you guys in my next video bye [Music] 
hey everyone so I am finally doing my other gym freestyle liquid lipstick swatch video if you're wondering why I had the more sticks in a Kiley box it's because I put them aside so I remembered to do this video because I've been promising it sort of month and I can't put it off because Jeffrey start keep releasing new colors so I'll get dimmer frigate ellipse or two anyway he just releases new colors left right and center and I can't keep up so I've ended up with a ton of colors to swatch for you guys today these ones that you can see behind me I have already swatched before so I'll link the video down below for my most viewed lip swatch video a like two million views so this let's swatch video has by far been the most requested lip swatch video visit in the history of people requesting me to do stuff to be honest it is the worst timing because I have dry winter lips right now that the lighting is quite good today for a lip swatch video I'm just taking advantage because I put this off for too long and I'm pretty sure there are a few new shades at the moment but I don't have them so this is just happening can I believe some of them were limited edition so they may not be available in a more but I'll swatch them anywhere so I'm going to try and go any somewhat logical order so I'm going to start with the lighter shades and go to the darker brighter shades this one here is called it druglord and as you can see it is just a white color I personally don't wear this color but it is perfect for Halloween does color can be a little bit tricky to work with you need to kind of build it up a little bit so is white so you need to get a really nice even layer can't take myself seriously with this lip color on there are definitely people out there that can pull off colors like this and I am NOT one of them but regardless that is druglord are I paler next up I'm going to do in my favorite shade this is I'm nude this is my go-to nude color that I wear all the time so that is how I'm nude looks on the lips they do drive down Matt of course and it's just the perfect kind of pinky nude on my skin tone in my opinion and it pretty much goes with any makeup look so once again that is I'm note next up let's do in those each so that is how new Beach Phillips it's a orange soda kind of move very very peachy I actually really like it with this eye makeup I'm going to do mannequin this color goes on extra extra smooth this is a terrible application but that's how American look I have an actually one that's one much and I really like it as a very Brown at based notice a little bit darker than I'm nude I think it's really flattering I love it the eye makeup once again any types of warm I makeup I think your looks perfect once again it's called mannequin next up let's do daddy I believe this is the one from the many anyway clip who I've never actually tried this on before so far so good so daddy is just a really dark nude brown it colors very neutral looking I think this is a flattering I really like it so yes once again that is called daddy I don't know if it's just me but I really hate saying the word Getty daddy not then next up I'm going to throw a call the one in Hibbs is a very light color this is Queen B I think this is one of the ones we have supposed to put it in the fridge and shake it up because there is such a bright light color can look a little bit streaky ignoring that the color is really fun it's not really the kind of thing I would wear personally a but for a special occasion Halloween maybe I don't know if you like to rock this kind of color or the power to you once again that that is called queen bee my lips are literally starting to bleed next up is another one of those very it like white faced pale creamy colors this is virginity this one's definitely going on a lot better than the yellow and the white I actually really like this color they're not this wearable but I would definitely wear it it's quite unique it's like a pale pale lilac pink I think it's really pretty I would totally wear this so your once again it is called as virginity make sure take look a little bit yellow but not too bad nice that I'm doing surgit arias this is a perfectly kind of mauve color this color goes on it sort of so evenly and that is how it looks this color is so beautiful in actually really wearable as well so once again that is called Sagittarius I think this is so pretty next up is Scorpio which is a little bit darker than Sagittarius so that's how Scorpio looks this is such a beautiful color as well maybe with some different eye makeup I would wear this with a really cool toned smoky eye with some taupe and even a little bit of purple or something it would look super cool or just a really natural eye look with lots of lashes so once again that is called Scorpio next up I'm going to do this East which is another similar shade you think this is a little bit lighter than Scorpio maybe a little bit Pinker not like pink pink but less grey okay I've never actually worn this before but this is another favorite this is so flattering it's super xanpe really sexy just like a really deep more kind of color it's very unique it's like grey or purplish pinkish or vicious so so you need this once again it's called it deceased it is very similar to Sagittarius but steady chariot which is the bottom one as you can see it's a little bit more purpley next up I'm going to do the shade androgyny so this is androgyny as you can see it's got a little bit more of a very kind of undertone they're so beautiful I even love it with this I makeup perfect like full makeup right here so pretty once again that is androgyny it is much warmer than the previous shades next up let's do rose Mehta this is a pinky color it's a very wearable pink so that is Rose madder that's perfect every day at pinky color it's quite muted it's really beautiful so pretty with this eye makeup as well it's almost like a slightly peachy pink like a warm pink that muted once again that is called Rose madder next up we have Gemini which is a similar color to Rose met a bit a little bit more nude a little bit darker as well I think so if that is Gemini this would look incredible on dark skin tones it's just like a deep peachy Brown neutral color I'm terrible at this sometimes I swear but anyway it's pretty and it's called Gemini next up is the shade Leo my star sign terrible application but that is Leo is the most beautiful medium brown shade I am obsessed with this and need to wear this more often it's quite warm as well definitely a fan once again then put Leo next that I'm going to do dull parts this is another pink a very very cool pink so that is how dull parts looks dull puffs looks very muted cool toned pinky color got like a hint of more than it but it's definitely a pink I think it looks really pretty with the warm makeup as well so once again that is called dull pops new stuff I'm going to do I'm sure this is a really beautiful kind of warm pinky peachy deeper color so there we have I'm shocked doesn't actually a really unique color as well it's somewhere in between like a ridge of pink like it's quite a deep color quite muted I feel like this would look absolutely perfect on some other super porcelain skin it would look really like captivating I don't know anyway success I'm Chuck next up let's do what melon soda this color is so fun it is definitely a watermelon pink so there's one melon soda super bright super vibrant just the perfect kind of warm pink color once again is called watermelon soda next up let's do dream half which is a kind of metallic cliff I show you up close it's got a little bit of a shimmer through I don't often wear metallic colors but this one is really beautiful it's quite a Barbie kind of pink so that is dream house on my lips it's quite fun for summer or like a party or something like that very very Barbie once again it's called ring house next up is another really really really bright pink I'd even say this messages message heist oh no oh I've never actually tried this one on before and it's really sick maybe it's just not mixed up proper okay no this one is like salsa I don't know if this is faulty or if this is actually what the color does I think this might be a faulty one it feels so sick not as my others I like this anyway that's how the color looks it's a really pretty color it's really deep very kind of hot pink you guys can see for yourself it's pretty I just don't think I will get much wear out of this because it does not seem to perform properly next up is a kind of orange e bronzer you shade this is called pussy-whipped once again this is more of a metallic shimmery kind of finish this reminds me so much of that Kylie Jenner color my remember was called but you know the one that she looks quite cool with this eye makeup once again at that is called a pussy-whipped next up is flamethrower and never actually worn this and so excited this looks legit I love orange this is so beautiful it's a look amazing on so many different skin tones as well people are always so scared to go for orange but honestly it is one of my favorite colors to wear it is so flattering and one of the colors I get the most compliments on so check out an orange if you have not got want to read this one here is once again called bit slips flamethrower if you haven't already please thumbs up this video thumbs up for the pain I'm so excited for this one too this is pumpkin pie this is a more muted deeper orange e shade you'll see it's a little bit of a shimmer through it too if you look really really closely I don't even know if you guys will be able to see you can kind of see it it's a very subtle shimmer you can't seem to see it on the lip it's just like in the truth I don't know my same things there's my terracotta color I love these warm at rusty orange colors so much if you guys watch my lip swatch videos you know that so yeah this is like a terracotta kind of orangey browny color once again it's called it pumpkin pie next up we have it checkmate this looks like a kind of orangey red color that's so pretty sort of a vibrant so pretty this is definitely a must-have how pretty is that they look so nice the warm I make up as well and I think any skin tone could pull this off once again it's called checkmate next up I'm going to do rich blood this has a very slight kind of Sheen to it too like pumpkin pies it except this one's like a pinky kind of Sheen very hard to tell you can kind of see the shimmer bitter once it's on this formula again is very dry I don't know if it's supposed to be like there if I've got a dud or what it's not as dry as whatever one but yes not as liquid as normal but we got there in the end okay so that there is rich blood not the best application I would probably need to use it look line up with the spikes that's quite dry so I can't get a nice crisp line of the actual color itself is so stunning this is like the perfect Christmas color super festive and it makes my teeth look so ridiculously white once again it called it rich blood next up is designer blood this is like in-between a brown and a deep red and this who loved it the application is terrible but can we appreciate how amazing this looks I love it and I love it with this I make up so much oh my god it's the favorite for sure that Unicorn flash that other dark red that you free hairs that is one of my favorite colors of all time designer blood new face by the way any that I'm not watching in this video check the other video in the downbar because then that way nice watch keeps those ones in the background like I said in the beginning like unicorn blood unicorn blood is washed in the other video oh I forgot to tell you what this one's calm it's called a ho ho ho I was too busy listening to my music in the background a dreaming once again this color seems to be very sick if I compare this to your rich blood it is a little bit more muted I would say ho ho ho's on the top of rich blood is on the bottom but they are so freakin similar so that is how ho ho ho looks a little bit shimmery as well nice that we have it no tea no shade this is another kind of metallic color it's like a purpley color that formula is to die for this one's sort of pigmented this is very unique it's very vampy special that's quite cool this eye makeup as well so yeah once again that is no tea no shade I'm not sure if I would really wear this that often personally but I definitely can appreciate the color it's cool stuff we have dominatrix this is a personal favorite of mine is a super super dark brown so that is dominatrix this is just such a sexy color I love it with warm I makeup like what I'm wearing today is just such a beautiful shade so yes once again dominatrix I have no joke gone through an entire packet of these removing things there are just so many colors we're on to our last four and they are all greens which I know green but they are actually really cool so the first one I have here is at breakfast at tiffany's this is like kind of like a blue really it's like a tiffany blue you cannot deny that it is eye-catching so yeah once again that is called at breakfast at tiffany's definitely not the kind of color I would personally go for in a day-to-day basis but again if you like to rock this kind of color or the power to you for me this is something I probably will on Halloween or something like that it is so ridiculously bright like holy crap next up let's do duty money I am obsessed with this color it's basically like that kind of money green color like a khaki light pistol green I am obsessed with the shade not something I would necessarily wear all the time but it's just super cool in terms of colors probably want to be most wearable weird colors you know what I mean I love it so much it's such a cool color so yeah once again that is called duty money I don't even want to take this off right now I'm so obsessed with it next up is kind of like a darker version it's quite a dull green at Calder crocodile tears like Peter Pan superstar as greens go is so wearable that's really cool this kind of eye makeup I think out of any strange color like you know these kind of greens are the most wearable to me anyway I just think they're easy enough to pair up with a really warm smoky eye they pack a punch they are bold they're a statement a bit quite cold so at the end that is at crocodile tears the last shape we have here is mistletoe this is a little bit brighter than the previous color so there we have mistletoe and that is the final shade quite a cool green as well it's definitely more of a like colorful green if that makes sense like it's a lot brighter the previous two are definitely more wearable this is such a cool color as well I think I am a sea fan of green wants to and they just would like it bronzer and stuff it's just easier to wear so that completes my lip swatch video for the Jeffrey Stowell all liquid lipstick I hope you guys enjoyed it hope it was helpful I can't believe how many requests I received to do this video so thank you for questing it let me know your favorite color is down below it love to hear from you and I will talk to you guys in my next video bye [Music] in 
hey everyone so today my mail I received the face halo which if you are not familiar with the face halo holy Morello is involved in the company and it's basically a makeup remover list makeup remover it's like a makeup told that you can just use wet with water you don't need to use any other product and it will remove all of your makeup I have seen it Chloe use this and it looks amazing but I'm going to try it for myself today and I'm actually going to compare it to a makeup remover bomb and we can see which one it does a better job Chloe is a friend of mine so I don't want you guys to think I'm being biased or anything like that so I'm going to try and do this in real time as well so you guys can see like honestly what it's like obviously I'm always honest but just in case you guys think that just because she's my friend I'm going to lie to you that's not the case I'm really gonna try it out and see if it's any good so as you can see I have a full face of makeup on today I'm going to do one side with the face halo and one side with makeup remover so this is how it comes at package they were kind enough to see me a couple of little packages of faith halos put a little tear top let's have a look inside I have not obviously this is a first impression I have not tried at this before that I have tried other microfiber makeup remover towelettes and things and I do like them but I've never actually like tested out a microfiber makeup remover versus just like a bomb because this is how I have been removing my makeup recently with the stuff clean at zero purity if it's instead of skin and it's by Pinilla car basically it's just an oil like i'll show you how i use it soon and it removes all of your makeup i also recently tried the Clinique one which was amazing and I've tried heaps of other brands but this is just the one I'm using now so this is how the faith halo looks and in here you get three and then there is a beautiful photo of Chloe Murillo on the inside so it says using face halo it's got like a little howitzer add water remove makeup wash and reuse face halo works with either cold or warm water the water lessons you'll make up allowing the halo tech fiber strands which are 100% times finer than a human hair reach deep into your pores to remove and trap makeup so the idea is that they get into each little port and really scoop out or the junk off that makeup and remove it all your skin enjoys a healthy and invigorating clean and half the time so apparently it's faster see how using only water with Halo tip fibers can pierce other removal methods dub-dub-dub doll face halo comb / the halo effect it's just clipper and so simple no need to rub or scrub it simply wet and gently wipe off your makeup you may be surprised at how much makeup comes off on your face halo this is because the halo tech fibers hold onto it and ensure that nothing goes back onto your face the heavier eye makeup rehydrate your face halo while with water and hold it on the eyes or eyelashes for an extra five to ten seconds and then to wash the face halo once you've used it it says you can wash it with white or light colors and it will be fresh and ready to use for around two hundred wash cycles Wow so you can use why these two hundred times I guess that's pretty good I hope this works because imagine how much money you would save on not playing makeup remover Plus that means at least plastic waste it's just more like environmentally friendly you're only using water plus you're only using water on your skin which I'm guessing has to be more gentle than using like a product on your skin I don't know I'm just assuming okay let's give it a go I'm actually going to use this on this side of my face first because I'm really excited to try it out once again you get three and it's in this circle shape there's obviously at two sides so if I show you up close this is what it looks like and it feels a really really plush and soft it almost feels like wool like similar texture so this is the part we will do in real time so I'm just going to dunk the faith halo I don't really know how much what do we need so this is just like an experiment for all of us at Mass hold a lot of water because that's just like it doubled in weight it's really heavy all of a sudden got my towel just in case it starts to drip down my clothes okay so I'm going to hold it on my eye makeup for a few seconds to do and then okay that was like no pressure I already removed some stuff literally like that was no pressure I just wanted to whip my lifespan so I can peel them off okay I'm gonna do a gentle circular motion on my cheeks I'm not pressing hard at all I don't know if you can tell like I'll press hard so you can see how my face looks now if I press cutely like you can see it's working okay real time you guys and you're just doing like half of my face legit my eye makeup I mean my eye makeup my eyeliner is waterproof by the way so we'll be able to see how it works on a waterproof I'm just doing little gentle circular motions on my eyebrows it's almost removed everything I'm just gonna like flipped around okay gentle gentle motions on my eyes literally like I don't know if you can tell how gene - I'm being I know I'm repeating myself a lot but I just want to emphasize okay already compared to because I've used the makeup eraser which I used to love um this is definitely less if it like you don't have to rub as hard as you did with the makeup eraser which was another microfiber make it remove a thing remove the waterproof eyeliner that's blue let's try to get the glue off the only thing is not doing so well with is the eyelash glue let's try holding it I might actually have to like go and pick that off but I mean it removed all of my eyeliner there you go underneath I'm gonna bend it in half now I just squeeze water into my eye okay don't do that how this it was just water and not friggin makeup remover okay honestly how easy was that okay look product my lips are stained because I was wearing a hot pink lipstick earlier so let's see if I can get the staining off it's definitely like coming off sorry if this is like really awkward to watch by the way I always find like if my videos I edited a lot there like blank spaces are really awkward so I was talking while I was doing that obviously and that was still so quick feel like if I was just doing that without talking at the end of the night I could do both sides in my face that did not take long there was no effort it was so gentle and my skin does not feel irritated my I just don't feel irritated they don't feel dry a lot of the time when I remove my makeup I feel really like dry afterwards and I have to use hate some moisturizer but my skin feels so soft okay keep my reaction in mind because I do love this stuff too so let's see how it compares cuz like I said I've never done a side-by-side comparison with a product like this this is by far cross my heart way better than the last ones I've used it just works a lot more gently for some reason I don't know why it just works better I don't have to rub as hard which is always good because rubbing your face can cause premature aging we don't want that do we okay as you can see I really like this I've used up most of it so basically I take a little Noble I'm gonna have to peel off my lashes before I use this because I want to be able to reuse my lashes so what you do with this stuff is you just massage it and it breaks up all of the product it definitely feels like it doesn't hurt my eyes but it's a little bit more irritating on my eyes then the face halo was just the product obviously getting in your eyes you can feel it there it doesn't sting or anything but you can feel it already I definitely think this is more effort so that's what you do make sure it's all mixed together and then what I do I'm wetting my fingers take a little bit of water and mix it in there I feel like this is not removing that eyeliner I told you this was a super waterproof it's then you make a roller wheel one to the first impression if it's up already all link it down below otherwise keep an eye up it was so hard to get off my hand I hit on my hand earlier and I heard you use so much product to get it off come on okay now I'm taking my stained and makeup removing face cloth and then basically what I do is I just wipe it off so this is definitely more harsh on my skin like the face cloth is more hash it feels more hash it's not as soft as you can see my eye makeup is not coming off very easy the side removes the mascara is so easily I've got cloudy visions I've got it make a remover in my light now so as you can see this still does an amazing job like I said I love this so I'm not trying to bag on it and each time I wipe my eye more mascara it's coming off okay so there we have it both of these sides look really clean so now I'm gonna do one more test I'm going to take some my seller type water this is the Eisenberg lotion pure effect it removes makeup really well and I'm gonna take some clean little thingies I've got a similar amount of liquid on both sides I'm just going to see which side has more residue on it make our residue okay both sides have a little so this site is obviously the what's the stuff called clean it's newer stuff and then this side is the face halo so there's a little bit on both side still I'm gonna go in with the other side of my face halo and just one more time just gently go go I'm gonna go for my whole face and we'll see if there's any residue left after this I feel like this removed my staining on my lips bitter too even now you can see it works so I go look at that it removed all of the staining off my lips so cool gonna do my eyes again I don't know if it looks like I'm being harsh but I'm not I promise I removed it a little bit of mascara that was left over on that side this side looks pretty clean again apart from that lash glue that does not want to come out we've just steamed it out in the shower okay taking fresh little thingy thingies with some spray you go that's basically it completely clean it's like an Emma so slight tint but honestly that's barely anything I can honestly say I'd never get that result from just using my clean at zero usually I need to follow up with a cleanser to get every little remnant off my skin this just genuinely make my skin feel like really clean like I don't know you have to try it to know what I mean so does it work definitely look at that you guys to let for yourself here you go just got summer swatches on my arm here that I forgot to wipe off the floor did it Kim K double your contour swatch so let's see it works I am definitely going to use these from now on I'll put more information about them down below like how much they cost and everything I don't have that information on me I'll have to do some research yeah Chloe in the face hallo team well done this is genuinely awesome and so much more portable as well than some others I've seen some of them analyst really like a tea towel like they huge this is so much more user friendly I like how you can kind of fold it in half and get around a little tough areas under your eyes and stuff like that I hope you guys enjoyed this review video and I hope it made sense I hope you guys could see for yourselves how well it worked if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and if there's anything else you want me to review as always leave a comment down below question of the day what is your current makeup removing routine what do you use to remove your makeup have a fantastic day and I'll talk to you again very soon [Music] [Music] 
hey everyone so today's tutorial is so freakin easy I can't even it like emphasize how easy this is and it looks really really cool feature evenings a little DIY spiders that I made by myself I put up a photo on my Instagram you guys seem to really really love it and it's so easy like I said it just like this devil look and go check it out if you haven't seen it already jumpin it straight in I started with this shoe a primer it's an anti blemish primer because I had so many breakouts this day so just massaging that into my skin before I start with the base and for my base I'm going to use a flawless finish sponge-on I'm using my Laura Mercier SIL cream oil-free foundation which is like super full coverage to help cover up all of that discoloration acne scarring blah blah blah you get the gist [Music] and then I'm going into concealer and concealing my dark under-eye circles this is like my favorite at the moment I'm lemon obsessed with that so good and so cheap so good and I'm just using the same sponge to blend it that out also I'm going for a really flawless kind of sixty kind of vibe with this look and then you know the creepiness kind of comes in with the little spiders and then it's sitting out of my eyes and I had to freeze this because what the heck is the space that's the most revolting thing I've ever seen in my life anyway um so here's to my pet face play the play a little bit with powder I can't even talk right now I'm sorry I don't know why I'm like this and then I'm using some bronzer and I'm just using this over my cheeks this one here is tart Park F princess it's matte and it's really really warm so it's just going to warm up making pollution using on my cheeks my forehead a little bit on my nose and chin just to bronze up my complexion because I felt really flat and then I'm contouring with the Natasha - no no contour palette and I'm not sure how I feel about this like it works but I don't know if it's really the right understood for my skin it looks a little bit orange like you can kind of see but anyways moving along and one in my eyebrows to look nice and fleeky so I'm using it the kabrel with my eyebrow groomer brush and then I also used a little bit of gimme brow right on top to sit them down in place so they lasted all day and looked perfect and amazing yay [Music] I make ups really easy and you'll be able to deal with whatever you have at home so I am using a dark base I just use this one because it was super dark doesn't need to be a dark navy blue like this one you could use black or dark purple or something or even like a black eyeliner and just bring that all over my eyelid and blending that out with a round eye brush just so that it's nice and dark and deep for that I should just go on top of and don't do that if you can help it because it'll ruin your life anyway I'm doing that on both eyes and then yeah I'm gonna go in with some at neutral eye shadows so I'm just gonna take my shinny soy pellets the remix whoo out today whoo and I'm taking it the middle brown color just in the creased warm up to look a little bit and create a bit of a gradient effect doing that on both eyes and this is a crease at blender brush aka one of my favorite blending brushes of all time makes a beauty and then I'm taking the darker color and once again building that up just so there is a gradient and then once that's done we're gonna go into it the darkest color in the palette which is called a silhouette which looks like a beer well you can use black eyeshadow if you don't have this palette you can just use whatever you have at home like I'm sure all of you all have colors similar to this and then I'm just blending that out as well so there's a kind of gradient effect of the blackish color going into the Browns you know pretty simple and then I'm taking clarity and I'm just highlighting my brow bone with set and then blending one more time to make sure all the colors are nice and seamless next to each other and then I'm going to take the more shimmery color which is called a Holy Grail and I'm just going to highlight the highest point of my brow bone and also those inner corners just to brushing up my eyes a little bit since it's so dark and they're not with that same color I'm going for an intense highlight today so on my detail fiber brush I'm applying that to my cheekbones and on the center of my nose and chin and stuff like that too just to make my skin absolutely shine to the gods and then seeing spray and then I'm taking the purple color and running there underneath my lash line I don't know what it is but when I think of Halloween and witches they're in spiders and things like that I always think of like dark purple and this kind of purple shade you know and then I'm using the darker color on the outer corner of my lower lash line by the way and glitter and if you don't have these glitters like you could just use some other glitters that you have just make sure they are I say if these ones are isafe I'm just kind of blending them and just packing them on the lid a little bit just in a random spot in the middle I don't know what I was aiming for I just did it and I liked it so there we go even if you don't have glitter you can just skip the step if you want it's not really like necessary if you know what I mean [Music] and they're next up we're doing wind eyeliner and I'm using the mix liquid black eyeliner this one is a brand new tube love brand new makeup feels I'm just doing it huge wing and you want to be a little bit flat out like don't go too high up if they make things towards your eyebrow like go straight up because we're gonna hang a whip off one side so yeah and that's why I want it to be quite big as well so there's plenty of space to do it so what I'm doing is I'm using a black eyeshadow just to map out where I want the wibbit to be just because black eye shows a little bit easier to like fix in black eyeliner you know and then I'm going to just basically trace that with the black liquid eyeliner and then shade it in a little bit with my black eyeshadow yeah that's what I'm doing here [Music] and then I'm using a little bit of silver just to do some little wood dots just to make it look a little bit more glam and fun you skip that step if you don't like the way it looks but I really like the way it looks and then further little spiders you want some individual lashes or old it lashes you can cut up and I'm just doing a little like a couple of dots on my face for the spiders head and body or whatever and then just slamming down some individual lashes that's how easy it is and I'm just making sure that I'm kind of putting them so they're bouncing off my face you want to obviously put them so that they look like legs dangling this is how the lash looks and my spiders have more than eight legs but it's fine because I'm not gonna be that fussy that's up to you they still look pretty awesome and I got so many compliments on them and Hamish thought they looked really cool and I sent photos to my friends and they were like oh my god of those actually spiders before they looked at them closely and zoomed in

Hey guys so today well I am filming this it is Valentine's Day and I was super and organized this year We're not really unorganized I've been traveling a lot So it just didn't pan out for me to do like a Valentine's Day tutorial unfortunately because I didn't pretty much every year so I thought I would do like a little get ready with me for Valentine's Day on what makeup I'm going to wear tonight and it's just gonna be like simple romantic makeup that you guys can recreate with any kind of like date night or Party or whenever you want to wear it to be honest because who cares it's just makeup you can wear it wherever you like so yeah, I already got my foundation on cuz I just did my Mixing all my foundations to you the video I'll link it down below if you want to watch it and then I just did my eyebrows save a little bit of time and one more thing if you're wondering about the If you're wondering about the what are you suit, I'm wearing it's a bodysuit, I got lots of questions I think I weren't in my turquoise makeup tutorial Maybe recently I'll link that down below loads of you guys are asking where it's from I can't remember But the label on the back says reverse It's the brain reverse, which therefore means it's probably from one of those like Australian boutiques. I would guess anyway I'm going to start now, so I'm gonna use my Natasha - no no I should or base I've been neglecting up my eye shadow bases lately. I just completely forget about them So it's time to whip them out again because they really do make a difference with I should or really Makes them more like pigmented and stick better. I'm just using my sponge to blend And I think I'm gonna do like pink and go today, so I'm wearing gold I'm not wearing this outfit tonight, but I'll probably wear something Maybe like a black dress or a pink dress or something like that with some gold jewellery I'm going to use my shaniek so at pellit and I'm first gonna take the shake clarity Which is just this one here to set the base down and this is a flat top. I brush my gosh It's so hot in here I need the aircon on some one way, but I'm just like literally gonna sweat all my makeup off if I don't do it And then I'm going to take the shade Beastie which is this one just here Doing it all the way cuz I think I might do like a half cut crease like a really soft cut crease line nothing too Dramatic just something really you know romantic inspired and soft looking This is a thermic blender brush by EXO Beauty that I'm using I'm just adding one more layer right into the deepest part of the crease just to make it clear bold and Then right in the deepest part crease also. I'm gonna take the shade at stalker. I'm just using a little bit of the spearing way Just to deepen it up a little right in that deep part, and then I'm actually gonna take that same color So just taking stalker once again, if you're wondering what my foundation doesn't match me perfectly it's cuz it doesn't because like I said I did that and mixing with my foundations to get the video and Naturally all my foundations of different colors because I fake tan and this is just the color that Decided to come out. I just love pink on my eyes lately like obviously was my palette I'm gonna be using this all the time in real Life and I do use all the time in are alive, and I always go specially for shake be stay like sometimes I just chuck that all over There's a one I should I look that's so nice and then I'm gonna take my same brush I think I'm gonna do some vamp it by the way. This is a shitter brushed by muck Jacobs is sheeting a bit which I haven't kind of shock dip no no I like and Mike Jacobs at brush Can you see it? It's like shooting up the top and like method disappointing, but I do like the brush other than that. I just I don't know come on I Don't even know well. I got this for free. I don't know how much this cost but I imagine it's no cheap it's my Jacobs I Love this color so much Especially if you have blue or green eyes gonna make them well in brown because it's kind of like that purpley red So it really suits off brown eyes so basically any eye color can wear it um Blue eyes, I just love it with a blue and green This is just a round Eye
Brush i'm just using the kind of clean up, and I just used a little bit of concealer as well Now for a soft cut crease i'm not gonna use concealer i'm gonna use this gold god is magnificent Middle glitter and glow liquid eyeshadow put Stila i'm gonna use it on a crease Detail brush the hardest part for me is getting the to ice match because my eyes are completely different shapes like The size more hooded now just to tone it down the gold a little bit. I still want it to look gold I'm standing use gold, but I'm just going to use at the shade Dreamgirl on top of this color Just to make it a little bit more peach, and if you don't have it that Stila eyeshadow you can always just use concealer or like whatever else you have Gonna tone down the glitter a little bit. I'm okay with that. I don't want it to look too crazy I want it to be quite subtle when like Romantic like I've said a million times This is a really nice joke her feet as well so when you turn your head is going Peach to gold and then I'm just going to leave at the very end apart completely golden so you can see the difference It's just a little bit more subtle and peachy like rose gold alloys and then I've just wiped off my crease detail brush I'm gonna take the shade Island glow, which is this one it just here. I'm just gonna pop that on my inner corner Underneath just a little bit and on the rest of underneath my lash line. I'm gonna take bisti again and just a little bit and then Hamish loves be in a corner being really light and Bright, and this sparkly, so I'm using this call me Chichi metallic foil eyeshadow it's like a light nerd gold. I'm gonna put that right on it in a corner To make him happy. I love this look towards his all-time favorite and then lastly I'm just going to put a little bit of that Island glow shade on my brow bone as well Okay next up these are coming out soon. The lip line is by XO beauty they're on their way to New Zealand at the moment, so I'm hoping to launch like mid next month I don't know. I'll keep you updated on social media. We'll see it. Just depends. How everything pans out I'm going to use one a billet mine is is a I pencil do so at your own risk? These are only Tested to be lip safe they've not been tested for the eyes, but I've done it a couple of times And I just like the color so this one here is called Kelly. I need a sharpener. I'm sorry slick with sharpening things I probably should have done like automatic lip pencils and at the same time. I prefer being able to sharpen something even though I'm lazy with sharpening. I just love like being able to get a nice shot line I really like sharpening my automatic lens plus was an automatic mine. You often get way less formula like this product I mean like these ones here, which I love by Kat Von D. This one's called lovecraft It's actually nuts not make sure they have similar. It's a little lighter Pinker, but anyway lovecraft these have 0.25 grams of product these ones here. I have 1 point 1 gram. I believe where is it? Yeah, 1 point 1 gram, so like this is like a third of what's in here like And they cost so much, but anyway. I'm just saying I know it looks kind of like I am fiction right now But once we do the mascara be absolutely fine can't find my favorite eyeliner like liquid eyeliner So I'm just gonna use black trick I met which is my favorite tight line one, but I wanted to use my Tom Ford one I don't know where it is, so I'm just gonna do a thin line. This is a Eyeliner brush I was like is this called the ultra flying because the old one used to be gold anyway I have to ever mind me Eyeliner brush, babe so beauty it's kind of dry, but I don't have any juror line left I need to get some more, so I'm not doing a wing today. I just want to do like Thin line of eyeliner to blend up my falsies because I'm gonna wear falsies of course also putting it in my tight line Which looks really creepy? By the way, I start the worst hayfever. I woke up this morning and my eyes were like glued shut together Hey when I was washing my eyes like because they were just full of like hey the gunk like three of my life Just fell out as well, okay, so now we are ready for mascara and falsies so no mice brother Lou I'm talking too quick when I do my mascara first, and I'm using backup bag Which I really like it's just really hard to get off I'm not worrying about putting too much on. I just want to cover my lashes to make them like one thing I like about this mascara is it's so black so I'm just covering my lashes to make sure that there's no gray showing Smilers just look great about her put mascara on there and when you've got falsies on sometimes It looks really bad because you've got the really black falsies, and then your natural lashes kind of gray underneath And it just looks kind of off So I'm undecided how I feel about this mascara on the bottom that lashes because I've got such long lashes And I feel like this mascara is quite lengthening so sometimes it makes them too long BOCES I am naturally going to use hold once again Cupid which look like things these are new pair so excited I actually lost my old ones they were still amazing. I think I took them in my late travel makeup bag or the Seas and Don't know where they are they must have like blowing onto the grounds and then to run away But they cleaner or something at the hotel I don't know which makes me cry because these like you can literally use these like 30 times if you're really careful I mean my most used pair of currently God I've probably won about 12 times, which would be the Thunder I feel like he's the Thunder the most But the cupid is so beautiful because they are so Flattery like look how soft those ends are they're just so fluffy I love them and they're called Cupid which is just perfect for today. I feel like that's so good You know I don't know oh these are coming out soon. If not already by the time you watch this video the lip balms They're amazing. I've got foundation all over my lips not a good look ah My friend Kelly said that she normally and I'm in a wot lip balm She used this wakes up in the morning was like crusty lips She said she used that one before beard woke up the next morning and her lips were so soft legit. They're amazing what moms you guys I love it loads of different lip balms you guys see me use different look up the lip balms all the Time of my videos despite the fed that I've had my own for a while like behind the scenes I can really shown you guys Too much like I love it chapstick. I love her boy I love like the make it look bombs like this hates a lip balms I love but obviously like I love my ones too And I've got some pretty unique things out so make sure you check them out on exploit beauty in this super cheap, too It's just like a fun little add-on for the website And I always think like you know if you're super close to free shipping And you need to spend like you know a teen will box or something like the good little add-on products to have on there Okay, I'm just gonna slap them on these are not close enough to my lash line right now I will move them when it glows a bit more tacky because the glue is just taking forever to dry and I'm patient So this is what I do sometimes, and then I just squeeze them together win the glue dries down okay? I'm gonna have to clean that when I soak them see how I got a little bit of lash glue on that one string and It stuck like two or three together so one wing So just sticking them on I Love how fluttery these are and then just squeezing them down so that they're Closer to my lash line now I am going to it contour with a bronzer brush and my Charlotte Tilbury Film-star bronze &amp; Glow palette have a pimple no Jake so annoying To highlight, I'm going to take the shade Island glow again from my palette And then just because I want an overall like glow all over my face I'm going to take a share powder brush and loosen my excellent Beauty I actually wanted to use Aurora, but I think it's in my triple make a big I'm just gonna dust this like every whim this kind of brush. It just supplies like the more sheer amount of product You could use this brush with any highlighter. Just to like give it glow. I don't know if you can even see on camera it's definitely something you can notice in real life, but Maybe on camera it might be quite subtle just kids are really nicely filter across your whole face It's kind of like the hourglass um powders, man. I feel like I should do some blush I'm gonna use a different blush today. Not my Vizier palette. I'm going to use Havana by Benefit and some medium face brush. Sorry the lighting just turned to garbage You know it's my video. What did you expect such a pretty bright little expensive brush blush? I don't know why I don't use it more. It's so stunning I'm just like doing out really slowly because it's quite pigmented, so I'm doing lots of layers until I Like how it looks okay, and then for my lips. I'm going to take Kelly again. Oh, that's like school That's like why is it so sticky, but that's right a collection of my look Just over during my lips a little bit as always so that was Kelly lino And then I'm going to use a deep kind of hopefully pinky Tone on my lips just cuz if you like all of the time for Valentine's Day I do like light pink or nude or whatever I want to do something more bold But still very like 60 looking and for me like when I do think of 60 like makeup I think of a deep bold lip muted color. I guess like that's what I think of so I'm using Auto ha luxe liquid lipstick by EXO beauty you could use any Date bold color of your choice. You don't have to use this. I'm just using a small amount And then just making sure my lip line is nice and sharp Obviously you can always do something at kiss proof as well if you're planning on doing A lot of kissing on your date, this one is not kiss proof it does transfer because it's a creamy finish But I really like that creamy finish cuz it looks really nice and hydrating and makes your lips look more kissable rather than having like About hold dry lips so strike down a little bit more matte then it looks now though. It's like a creamy matte so um Yeah, it's getting there and this is it the finished look. I love it so much I think it's so pretty so romantic. I'm sure I'm probably done like oh if I was gonna say I'm sure I've probably done like a similar look in the past But I don't know if I've done really like golden pink in this kind of style. I love it. If there's any other I just noticed a bit like mascara fall out if there's any other like combinations or certain colors from the chantix eye palette like any certain color like avocado or Terracotta like whatever you can just like comment down below and let me know which colors You want to see me use if you do have the palette I get requests every single day You know people saying please use your palette more I already use it so much in my videos obviously you guys still want looks so just let me know What kind of looks you want me to do and I'll link down below mai-chan XO palette playlist Which has a ton of makeup tutorials, you can create using that single pellet?

hey everyone so today I am at doing my first impression on the new white cell all alleys foundation why do I sound so nasal II thought you should action and Jase I'm also gonna try out the primer that way cells seem to me as well this is the all ours private and then I also got Cynthia all hours concealer so I'm gonna try out all of them but mostly focusing on the foundation of course cuz this is the part I'm most excited about I love the packaging first of all I did have someone contact me from YSL I think it was can't remember like why sell the PR company or something and they did say that this is not replacing the fusion ink so fusion ink apparently is still around maybe in New Zealand Australia maybe not in America I don't know how it's working it's hard to get I know that much but anyway this is new and I'm excited to try it because I have a good track record of enjoying why sell foundation so I'm hoping that I like this one too this one is in the shade of B 30 if you're wondering and it comes with 25 mil which is less than average usually you get about 30 mil so I'm not sure if you need less product or what their deal is so we're just going to try it out so it says a full coverage foundation that provides uninterrupted or flawless wear it sounds amazing it looks like it comes in about 22 shades and it is soft matte SPF 20 which is perfect for daytime medium it's a full coverage it works on all skin types and its water proof apparently it's non cakey it doesn't look dry it doesn't flake or fade its transfer proof oil-free non pore clogging whoo sounds good it kind of looks like they have some really good pale shades but not so much medium and darker shades but of course these are just internet swatches you'd have to have a look at them in store but just going from that doesn't look promising okay so first I'm going to start with the primer shake shake shake okay so I'm going to prime half my face like normal so whoa it's ready well the Sun is coming out right now right now really oh that feels so silky smooth feels so lightweight okay so far so good it just feels really moisturizing and silky smooth doesn't it feel heavy it feels so light weight so if don't like heavy Primus this one feels a very very watery and snow of course we will see how it performs okay and then obviously I'll do the concealer afterwards okay the packaging I love I think it looks really classy really good and then it's got a little pump in the inside so I'm gonna start on the prime side why not that's one pump right there that's a full pump so let's just see how far that goes out of interest and I will just use a a flat face brush today it's the first one I found just gonna spread it with my finger first so it doesn't clump up in my brush the color looks pretty good I do have a fresh layer of fake tan on just one layer so it's not super dark but of course the bronzer is still on the fake tan so I think this color be perfect by the looks of it this is the same car using some other myself foundations and which really well the I think this color will be okay once I don't have the fresh layer of fake tan on okay straight away I noticed while I'm blending it it looks a little bit streaky as they keep blending of course it sorts itself out it's just kind of like initially she looks a little bit orange compared to my other foundations in the shade I'm not sure why I feel like it looks a little bit patchy maybe okay that's not enough to cover my whole face I'm doing one more pub I'm just gonna distribute this where I need a little more looks like oxidizes a little bit not too much though it's not like the Rihanna one which I still like move actually is that a few times since my first impression the Fenty one you can check that out on my channel this foundation formula feels quite moisturizing I wouldn't call it like  heavy but it's kind of like it's got like a moisturizer almost kind of consistency like it feels kind of like moisturizer when you touch it I don't know sponge would work well with this also because as you blend it because of their kind of like moisturizer consistency excuse me it kind of like like I see goes a little bit streaky at first but then of course as you keep blending it does stop being streaky it's only when you're first blending it so it's not like an issue I'm just letting you guys know I think a sponge would be faster to apply this I'm very biased towards my just lately I'm loving my sponges so the coverage is definitely medium buildable it's covered up the frickles on my forehead it pretty well you can still see them peeking through this isn't blended probably because I've done this side of my face yet but you can see a couple of my huge frickles there it's covered up the redness very well some reason it looks slightly patchy to me but I might just need to blend it a bit more it's not the easiest foundation I've ever worked with but and saying that it looks beautiful and the color looks pretty good now that I've blended it down my neck a little bit it's not too orange I had differently think oxidize to give us so slightly but it was literally like half the shade it wasn't anything crazy like it would have just been it drying down so that's how it looks and that was two pumps which is kind of normal for me I always use heaps of foundation I don't know if it's because I've got a fat head or what I like the finish it's a soft matte finish like it said like it's kind of got a little bit of a glow to it's definitely not dewy but it's not completely flat on your skin like it looks really flattering it does not emphasize my pores at what so it very glides over them really nicely so we'll see how it compares on the non-prime side also and I have some extremely dry skin on my chin right now like just down here earth hit break house like seriously so dry I can't even explain to you and it's not gripping onto it yet but we'll see how that goes throughout the day okay I think it's time to do the other side now so I'm just gonna start with one pump once again feel like it goes further on the non-prime side like I feel like I need a list product on this side no no that's my imagination or what but we'll just keep blending and find out if it looks good that they're pretty much covered everything that time I feel like it didn't go streaky on the side either like that side it kind of went streaky as I blinged it but the side was way easier to know if it's the primer or don't know I swear like with most foundations when I do first impressions like the non-prime side always looks really good not always but most the time looks really good I don't know if primers are a gimmick or what like I love using Brahmans I like the one of my favorite products to use just cuz they feel really nice and hydrating I don't know oh keep using them okay so up close you can see it's quite dark so you can hopefully see all the imperfections on my skin although the foundation did cover most of them and on both sides like you can't see my pores really at all its glided straight over them but my skin still looks like skin like you can still see my skin texture but it doesn't look bad or emphasize it just looks nice like my skin still looks like skin tastes if that makes any sense so again on this side I do have heaps of dry skin so we'll see how that goes throughout the day I love the finish I feel like the Sun was so much easy to blend and I needed at least product and it covered really well swear sometimes this side of my face gets a little bit more read so that could be the difference I'm not too sure right now so this whole looks from a little bit further away I think it's really pretty it's definitely medium to full coverage but it does bitter on my discoloration my read nose on my face did my freak was you can still see a few freckles but I don't mind and I want to try out the concealer now and see how that works so this is the all hours at concealer and I have the shade 2 here you get 5 ml product I love the packaging once again reminds me of my extra beauty liquid lipsticks ok see a little door foot wand we're going to first put some of this well it's a very small wand it's a very precise wand I'm just gonna put it in a triangular shape under my eyes this is not too much product but we're soon gonna find out oh he's good concealer heavy I love concealer we're gonna blame this out with a tool pedal brush I like to use a nice big pedal brush like this just cuz it's nice and quick I'm just gonna tip it and then I'm gonna bring that same concealer on top of my eyelid as you can see unless I here I have a lot of veining because my eyelid Stern is really delicate and thin so I always have to conceal it when I wear my makeup this is blending out so easy and it looks really nice if you like it covered up the discoloration really well and it feels so lightweight it doesn't feel heavy it feels like I'm not wearing concealer so so far I'm feeling impressed looks really good it looks airbrushed next side this is the prime side you can see how well it covers up that discoloration man so far so good this is like one of the most lightweight concealers of this amount of coverage I've even used I think I'd compare it to like the bee Emeril's sturm concealer in terms of its consistency like it's so lightweight and it feels quite moisturizing the color works really well for me feel like it's settling into my creases a little bit so far I'm feeling it very positive the foundation at first I was a little bit iffy about but now that it's completely on it looks so beautiful it looks airbrushed I feel like it's got a beautiful finish nice coverage I just want to see how it wears out my earring is covered in foundation I just want to see how it whizzed throughout the day obviously and see how it goes so I'm gonna quickly set my foundation now this is well rested bipm minerals and then I'm going to use Born This Way just all over the rest of my face I've been loving this lately Ashley feel like the foundation has it gotten quite a bit darker than when I first applied it it still looks okay I feel like my face is a shade darker than my body right now I still feel like I can pull it off like I could just bronze up my chest a little bit so yeah we'll see how it weighs throughout the day I'm gonna add any see you spray or anything like that I'm gonna do a quick flash test and then I'm going to hit off considering this foundation is SPF 20 I really don't think that the flesh back is that bad to be honest like there's a little bit of it but it's not like glowing pale white face or anything like that like it's just a little bit lighter okay so it is almost 10 a.m. so we're just going to say it's 10 a.m. it's like hordes chained I'll see you guys do you know what I just ate termina noodles and my lipstick still it's amazing it's number 41 of the Sephora creamy lip stain or whatever they're called so my foundation is still looking pretty good it is now 3:30 so it's only been on for like five hours five and a half hours I think that is I've got the exposure quite dark right now so you can see everything on my skin as far as my paws and everything go they look so good like so smooth I'm not oily whatsoever which is good because I have nor dry skin the only thing that looks like it's changed as it looks a little bit heavy and flaky around my dry flaky skin which I kind of covered before like I said I know how it would be over dry skin but then again I did add concealer this so it could be the concealer the actual foundation like on my forehead on my cheeks a hasn't faded it hasn't cracked it hasn't creased or anything into any fine lines I had some fine lines up here sometimes and like when I go out there kind of makes it look like it's kind of sidled there but once it relaxes like it's still looks really good so yes so far so good apart from the dry skin area this is the only area that I'm not happy with around my nose it kind of looks like it's borderline starting to melt so keep an eye on that for the next update and yeah I'll see you then hey guys so it is now 602 p.m. so it has been on for eight hours I believe and it's still looking really really good it hasn't faded still I don't feel like it's melted any more than last time around my nose in fact it basically looks the exact same is the last update there's nothing else to really say it wasn't greased it hasn't gone anymore dry and flaky look a little bit orange in this lighting but I think it's just a little bit dark even around my mouth where I've eaten it hasn't really faded that much at all it hasn't faded on the lower part of my cheek where it normally fades by now it's looking really really good so yeah I guess I'll just see you again in a few more hours and we'll see how it's looking hey guys so it is now at 10:00 p.m. so it's been on for 12 hours and we can see it just here and just here there is some dry flaky skin there that the foundation or concealer has stuck on to I've been itching my nose a little bit and it's only faded minimally Sony just starting now it's just it went to expression lines which is not bad I feel like it has not faded on my cheeks yeah it's my biggest problem is usually you see all my redness through here by the end of the day and it's completely fine also it hasn't seemed to have melted much more at all in the last couple of updates and I've been like cry laughing hits the reason I've got like the scar down my eyes and Eilish just fell off and i was wiping under my eyes and it still looks pretty good apart from obviously the black smudges but like its stay put doesn't feel oily at all although at this point a little bit is it transferring on to my finger but after 12 hours like I'm so happy with how this looks I think it looked really flawless all day I kept catching myself in the mirror and thinking it looked really good so you know that it's like a good sign even in like bed lighting I was I still looks good like it really helped to camouflage my imperfections like pores and uneven skin tone and stuff like that like it did a good job so I am pretty happy with it I'll definitely continue to try it out as for the primer I don't really know if it does much I'm definitely going to continue using it just cuz it felt really nice and hydrating a lightweight so I'll keep trying it and see how it goes it's for the concealer I loved the way it applied I liked the coverage and everything but it did crease a little bit I think if I got much use out of it I'd probably just use it like on my actual face I don't know I like under my eyesight it didn't look terrible but it did crease of it and a lot of my other concealers don't crease that badly I think it's because it is so liquidy and thin and lightweight that it kind of just settled into those fine lines you don't really have fine lines I reckon you should try it because it is such a nice formula but I just starting or I don't know I have to keep trying out I'll give you guys an update if you have a lot of you know problems under your eyes like bed skin Taoiseach saggy skin or like creased skin I would just not even go there like it'll just sink into all lines ah okay so I am pretty happy pretty happy with this foundation I'm really excited to try it out with like a sponge next time I feel like it will apply even Vita it doesn't apply badly with a brush I just feel like it was a little bit extra if it cuz of that kind of thickish kind of not sticky I don't know how to describe the texture like I said it's kind of like a moisturizer you just have to try it out yourself to know what I mean I think a sponge would probably apply it quicker is it it is in the fusion ink I couldn't really say because it's so different the fusion ink is more like liquidy it's kind of velvety finished this one's definitely more of like a liquid foundation typical texture it's a little bit heavier but it still doesn't feel heavy on your skin I'd say the coverage is probably a bit better than the fusion ink even though the fusion ink coverage is like beautiful embeddable like this one was a little bit full of coverage Lee so yeah there's my review I hope this video helped you guys out if you have tried this foundation in leave your review down below along with your skin type so we can all kind of share information about this product do keep in mind like I said it's only 25 mils so it's a little bit less than normal so you're paying a lot for this foundation and then you get 25 mil instead of 30 and I feel like I don't use less of this versus my other foundation so you'll probably use it up a little bit quicker not a lot but it's still worth mentioning so yeah let me know if you think you're going to it try it as well and yeah so as you guys in my next video [Music] [Music] 
everyone so today's declutter is mimic lipstick so I have a whole lot here I actually have more in my purse I'm just gonna leave those there because obviously you know I like them and they kind of did for a reason these ones over in this corner some of these are not matte copiously some of them are MEK in here like these ones are actually Mac funds and then all of these ones there's a couple over there but yeah there's some others as well so I'm not sure if I'll go through these in this video we'll see how we go with just all of the MEK lipsticks because as you can see there are attainment there are some floating around yeah most of mine have a little clear cap on them so I can see the colors so I'll link where I got those down below if I can find them and then any that I am going to declutter if they are during dateable you know I'm going to take off the cap and replace it with just the normal caps and then any that are like kind of well you suppose just give to my friends because they won't care and then if there are any really old ones of course those go straight in the bin if they are expired or just have a weird texture or wet smell or anything like that so that's what's happening today I'm hoping to color this down quite a lot we'll see what happens I do find myself neglecting my MAC lipsticks quite a lot because there are just so many to choose from just like all of my lipsticks which is what I'm going to go through them all there's just so many in here that I never want to go into the drawer because it's too intimidating and there's too many choices when I don't know what to pick so I always go with like the same colors so I really need to cull it down a little bit and yeah let's see what happens okay so I'm gonna start all the way over this side so you can see in the past of kind of like organizing them into like dark eCos here and then nerds and then they go up to raids and stuff over on the side over here I'm going to start with all the ones with the clear lids and then go through at the ones they're brand-new or the ones with the black lids afterwards so I really don't know how I'm going to do this like so many of the colors look really similar so I guess I'm gonna swatch actually let me get some baby wipes pretty and my face halo so that we can remove the swatches I can swatch them for you okay so the first shade we have here is a met called it deep love these lids get tight sometimes so this one's brand new i'm swatching them on my hand so even if i donate them obviously they can just sterilize them oh there is a nice brown I'm gonna just take out all of these bucks and lipsticks and place these just needs me on the ground so they can kind of organize the ones that I'm like you know and like figure out what I'm gonna keep okay so here is a media I'm gonna compare the other shades okay so this one here is a glaze shitake I'm actually going to donate that one it is cuz I can already tell them I'm gonna really love that shade I showed you close up so you can kind of see what it is it's like a frosted brownish color it's just not something I would reach for at all next up we have amplified tribalist this looks like it was part of a Christmas collection and it's brand-new once again so we can peer I definitely like this shade of bitter this one's more of like a purpley kind of undertone and it is a lot creamier obviously it's a really beautiful shade but I'm just not as in love with it as that first one which again is called deep love that is such a nice color okay let's try this is a sample so it means I got seem to it from Mac that's white doesn't have the proper label on the bottom this is the fall 2014 oh is this one of the was it Rihanna lipsticks I'm going to donate that again it's not my kind of color okay we've got a the Ariana Grande okay we've got Viva Glam Ariana Grande which is a matte let's compare it to these colors here okay this one's a lot more purple that reminds me so much of my lipstick bike so beauty and wabi-sabi it's so so similar so I think I'll donate that even though it is a stunning shade obviously like I go up that color next up I have runner which is a matte oh my gosh this looks so nice this looks like a deep red kind of color so hard for you guys to see the true colors through the camera so hopefully the swatches are helping oh yes there is a deep muted red look at that need stay right there okay next up we have a boyfriend stealer which is a cream machine this is a muted kind of purple color all of these colors are going to look very similar tomorrow it's kind of catchy I'm gonna get rid of that one I feel like I would like it a lot more if it was like a mere I'm actually gonna put the camera so it's coming in from above because I think the lighting might be better let's try it okay I've actually changed the entire direction of at the camera so hopefully you can see those colors better now so that very top one is that first brown eye swatch which is called deep love so we can see those colors so I've donated most of those next up we have it this shade here called it's in so I think I usually have sin in not limited edition and packaging a shorter so I've got Sydnee here I'm gonna swatch the one that seemed not limited-edition because it has already been used I love that color so I'm gonna keep that it's a little bit deeper than that other red I'm keeping which again that other rate is called runner so I'm keeping these to rid of shades and then I will donate at the Elimination Edition one okay I'm just kind of grabbing out a bunch of the colors they look way darker the shade here is called it smoked purple I used to love this color back in the day I must have a couple of them because this ones I'm used either that or I repurchase it because I lost it or something so here's what smoked purple looks like it's just like a deep purple color I'm actually doneita I just don't think I really reach for it that often I need to be semi cuts right here because there are so many colors next up we have cyber which used to be one of my favorites back in the day this one's well used so that'll probably go more in like the friends pile that's what it looks like I don't think I'm gonna keep that either okay we've got koalas surprised and this is a lighter purple color it's a creamy finish hmm kind of reminds me of ribble except a little bit more pink might get rid of that one we have the gambit Easter I think Valley I don't know if that's how you pronounce it this isn't it the shade Jean it's a mess oh oh I really like that that's more of like a purpley version of some of those reader colors I have kit I just love that finish as well that's beautiful next up I have diva antics okay this looks like a deep kind of riddle so well it's very similar to the other color you know what I think I prefer this one so I'm gonna keep this one and then donate Eugene I have dark side that's so pretty it's very similar to that other color isn't it but it's a lot more muted I might keep that why not actually let me just keep Darkseid and then I'll donate diva antics because to be completely fair oh my gosh they all look the same in the tubes but they look so different on my skin but look at that they look the exact same anyway to be fair I need to be more cutthroat with these really dark shades because I don't reach for the super dark shades as often as like pics and notes and oranges and things so this is definitely one area I need to be very hard on all right so heaps of these ones are more like deep reds and things this one here is a metallic called silver spoon oh gosh there's such a cool color but when am I ever going to use something like that I'm gonna put that aside actually you know what my hairdresser will love that for her competition photos okay we've got met diva I can't remember if I really swatch neither I feel like it sounds familiar there's my hip in like I've got a few double ups I'm pretty sure so I might end up talking you have to say I might a couple of times by accident that color is beautiful I don't know if I already decluttered one or not but I want to keep it okay next we have Rouge sell-on Rouge sorry this is another sample I think this was a Christmas color and that is a really pinky pinky red so I'm going to keep that for now I'm just gonna isolate him just here we have hoax these lids are really tight sometimes this isn't amplified what does this look like okay I'm gonna donate that when I don't like it as much as the other one we have royally a righteous which is an amplified oh this one's all melted oh that's like a brown note I love it I'm gonna keep it we have a cream shame heavier pitting oh that's a very like kind of buildable kind of color sorry I don't know if you saw me apply that but I really like it it's quite unique but I don't know if I'll reach for it so maybe I'll donate that one this is a brush a raid Ruby war which I love so I don't even need to swatch that right now I'm just keep it plus I might have one that I've already used and he had somewhere so I just want to keep it fresh just in case this is Cardinal this is a session oh this looks pretty this is like a deep rage well it's like an orange you read I love it and it's very different to those other aids so that can stay and then we have Russian red which is another favorite of mine I'll swatch a few just so you can see it because this one is used already and it's kind of like a more vibrant version of the last color so I'm going to keep it this my hair it's called D for danger this is a like deep pink oh that's so nice is this it looks matte it's got a sample label so I don't know what finished is it looks pretty mint to me though and it's again different those other ones which is good and you start we have photo which is a session this looks like a brownish kind of color I need to clean my hand once again kind of looks like a muted oh not sure about the finish but I love the color that can go on the maybe pile as well I'm putting my maybe ones down here no okay this is another rage and this is in the shade of Charlotte it's a match and then it's just a really bright bright red sorry I keep going out of camera oh my gosh such fail I just want to see how that can pinch to Ruby woo so this is Ruby woo now you know why I prefer it to Ruby woo so Ruby working but now I'm just gonna compare it to Cardinal quickly okay so that's Cardinal at the top I'm gonna get rid of Cardinal as well because yeah I prefer that Charlotte shade now we have this spring 2014 I think Rihanna color this is another shimmery shade from what I can see I'm just gonna donate that hopefully it's still okay cuz isn't been used at all so I wouldn't know I don't want to swatch it okay we've got this Viva Glam Terry GP hints and - that's what it says on here oh it smell today if I'm gonna just get that away make a macro just deep pot it or something so this keeps for those months from at this lava corner so out of all of those I've catch nine and I have donated slash got rid off 18 so that's not bad okay now I'm going to pick around the reds and purples and everything and from this end just here so I'm not sure if you can see about what some purpley kind of colors down in this back corner I'm gonna start where where what's this one fashion revival which is a met just because this is like a deeper purple I'm going to donate that I have a really dark purple right here called pure heroin which I'm just gonna donate this color here is Ripple so I'm gonna keep Ribble it's a really nice kind of similar to that last color to be honest like very similar so I'm glad I didn't keep that one ripple is this money here it's like a purpley pinkish kind of color it's really fun now I'm gonna swatch pink poodle which is a glaze formula so it's like a share obviously with glaze being the key word I'm gonna donate that I'm not a big fan of that color we have up the amp which is another kind of purplish shade I love that I'm gonna keep that one it's like a nice muted purple quite wearable to be honest for a pimple and then we've got this amplified and viola show which I think I'm gonna donate it's just a little bit brighter than that previous shade it's this one just here and it's got a more like miss hella key you kind of creamy finish so that can be donated next up I have it the shade heroin which is matte and this is a really dark purple oh it's mine actually it's dark when you put it on your hand I'm gonna keep no I'm gonna donate it because I like the other one bit of stuff and then I have fled up fabulous which is a retro matte and I love this color I feel like I've got another one somewhere I do so I've got the sample so this one's brand new I'm going to donate the brand new one I'll show you what this looks like it's a beautiful like purplish pink it's way more pink than purple though if you compare it to the other shades but oh I love that colors so nice okay so now what else we've got heavenly hybrid which is a luster my hands getting a little bit stained which is not ideal it's a beautiful color that I'm gonna donate that one I don't think I really need it holy crap you guys I'm doing so freaking well so well I've got twelve now so far okay moving along next up I have a girl about town which is another kind of right - pink that's bill about town right there I actually really like this shade it's a really nice kind of warmish undertone it's actually a really flattering a pink for something that's like a bright pink if you know what I mean if you compare it to flat out fabulous flat out fabulous of course as match whereas girl that town is more creamy and flat out fabulous looks a little bit more purplish that's still being a pink just going to swatch this this is lilac which is from it the Kelly Osbourne at collection it's a bloody beautiful color I'm gonna keep it why not and then we have a glaze called perfect this looks quite shimmery let me do it so you can see oh you can feel even see their color it's like nothing I'm just gonna donate that I'm gonna donate selling Rouge which I was still indecisive about in the beginning because I've kept quite a few other Reds and we're just about to go through more reads now actually let me swatch it to smash off okay so I am playing back the color called salon Rouge from when I was doing the other side just because this is one of the ones I was indecisive about and we are now gonna go into some more Reds so that's that one there swatched okay now I'm going to swatch barbecue which is a match let's shade it just here this looks like a really nice bright orange eread kind of reminds me of more enjoy Mac which is one of my favorites yes we've got the full 2015 Viva Glam this looks like another orange II kind of rude oh my god okay I like that even better than the last one it's a little bit brighter so gonna keep that one and donate barbecue next up we have set in toxic tail oh my gosh this looks nice keeping that so it compared to it the color above it as you can hopefully see it's a little bit more peach yeah it's got ever so slightly a little bit more pinky kind of undertones to it and thin it the other ones but it's differently still an orangey peachy color there's such a nice color you guys oh my god it I love it okay then we have lady danger which is another favorite but let's compare it to these shades okay so it's a little bit darker you know what I might donate that because we're gonna have too many orange ear in soon then we have met dangerous which is another one I'm gonna donate that looks the same right like it's not that much different beautiful color boy I love orangey roots that's why I created limerence fakes my beauty because I just love colors like this so next is cream Sheen at pretty boy that's a lot creamy I'm gonna donate that one because it's a very similar color to the one I love this one I can't read what it's called but it's a lot more sheer so I might as well just skip on that one next we have dreaming Dalia so there's more of a like sheer kind of formula to it I actually really love that for something that's a little bit more sheer and wearable it's a really beautiful light orangey color so I'm gonna keep that next up we have Vegas fault oh my gosh this is one of my favorites too wait I'm sure it another one of these I wouldn't have a clue where it is okay I love that color that's it right there keeping it like I see it I'm gonna end up with too many oranges you know what I'm gonna donate dreaming Dalia cuz I've got some other lipsticks there specifically like sheer colors and I think I've got one similar to that anyway at least be honest oh I probably got shades similar to all of these okay I ended up just watching oranges so that was irrelevant but we'll do it again soon so this one here is called true red it's the patroller Rinku collection okay it looks just like all the others time to get cutthroat next we've got neon orange which is an amplified okay I'm gonna keep that just because that is a much more orange e undertone than any of those other ones I kept although let me just compare it quickly two more inches one of my favourite oranges okay I'm just gonna keep Marg cuz marge is a little bit more orange again and then we have so sure'd which is a matte this one's like more muted by the looks of it that's what it looks like just there I love it I do love it it's kind of like a terracotta orange color like it's halfway between a muted terracotta and halfway between a bright orange okay time to clean off my hand I should have really started with the nodes so my hands didn't get so stained but oh well so again i'm swatching the red that i'm contemplating keeping it's a very pinkish red okay now we have opera sorry if the music's really loud in the background by the way I feel like I've got another color like that one and then we have this amplified in Ruby is a beautiful creamy red like true red color I don't think I need it I love it though but I don't think I need it then we have steam heat which is a set in and there is a lighter kind of read I'm going to keep that one I really like that one then we have cockney which is a luster this one looks like it's kind of developed little bubbles of pigment around the outside of it I don't know if you can see I've annoyed her if you can see it but um it seems to apply fine it's just a luster like a kind of semi sheer formula I'm gonna give her but we have sparks of romance which is a match it's pretty bad I don't think I need it it's that top one it just there then we have Victoriana ooh it's a very pure true red also I don't think I need it and then that's a hot pink we have the race with the MEK RiRi were mmm I'm gonna donate it love the packaging though we have a true Ridge so many Reds they're all just don't listen that's a very bright true route I'm gonna keep that cuz I love bright reds and then I'm gonna donate steam heat which is that one because I feel like they're very similar that one in that one so don't eat one of those okay the next one is five-alarm which is a luster I don't think I really like losses that much so I'm just thinking over that and then we have a met in Chile this looks so nice yes I love that color it's right there I feel like another one that I've kept is quite similar though let me just yeah I'm just going to compare it to the one I kept called it royally at righteous or righteous now that's different a game look so they're both very different gonna keep both okay let's move into some of these bright pinks so first yeah I have a flower skirt which is a cream Shane I'm gonna donate that I just aren't really ready for colors like that really like it's just like a bright pink I don't know I can't do another one that was kind of similar this one is completely destroyed this was Kelly yum-yum Jimmy behind not to everyone waiting for this and I'm just completely melted like I don't know if you can see in there like so sad so that's probably rubbish this one here is called it yield to love and is a cream Shane oh I really like that color it's a really nice Muse head like yeah dull pink next up is show orchid which is an amplified this is quite a popular show I'm gonna get rid of bear it's kind of metallic don't really go for that next up is another show okay and then we have met embraced me which is a very similar color just a little bit more muted and more matte I'm

though just pulling out all of the rest of the necklace sex and we'll go through all these you thought it was over oh well I thought it was over I didn't realize that so many left I'm actually just not gonna have any fake tan lift on my hand after this like seriously you can already see like it's kind of ending okay so these ones here are they what they called they the mineralized or these the mineralized no these are the mineralized I kind of people which ones these are like this weird packaging I'm just gonna have a quick lot samosa I think I might just end up donating all these ones they never reach for them and the colors all look quite similar to the other one so yeah I'm just not really sure what's this one this one here is called pink fringe which is a set in I'm thinking it's kind of similar to little butter I'm just gonna swatch the little butter next to it it's very similar just a little bit less peach but I don't think I need it I love the color though it's a cool color that you need this is called wood rose mmm oh my gosh this okay I'm just kind of going fast through the limited edition cuz I don't think I'm gonna keep most of this oh my gosh that's cool though what's this called Darling Clementine although I've kept so many oranges it sounds like I'm throwing my lipsticks but I promise I'm not it's just like a huge pile of them so they're pleasuring against each other every time I put one down retro Rouge what's this oh I love that that's staying okay I'm seeing it rid of these cuz yeah I don't usually use that shape now you save some of these ones which I would rave about but again lie just don't really use this shaker often these the problem with and these Xin Supremes you know what I'm just gonna donate all of these ones and then the mineralize yeah I'm just gonna donate all these wow there's so many oh wait there's a couple more mech ones the back here what are these slimline ones no okay so now I'm going to organize these into the section here and joy it kind of unlike you know order it really annoys me that they weren't fit into like a perfect square but anyways I think that is a drastic improvement on how many I had before or the opposite of improvement if you like crying at the fact that I'm throwing out so many necklaces not throwing them at you know what I mean so out of all over those I get one two three four five six so there's 60 here I believe if my calculations are correct and I started out with I think at least about 350 or so because both of these trees because both of these trades were stacked and then there were a ton that just lying around as well so I think that's a very good improvement I hope you guys enjoyed this declutter video let me know if I made any mistakes and you think that I threw out some colors they definitely should have kept like which ones were your favorite let me know what your favorite Mac lipstick is down below as well I would love to hear from you so once again all of the leftovers any that are like pretty well at used will be going to my friends family and then any new ones that are quite nice wearable shades I'm going to donate to look good feel better and then any that are pretty new and really crazy colors like super crazy colors I think I'm gonna give them to my hair salon so that they can use them for their photo shoots and stuff because at least then they'll be really useful I'm not sure if the charities will want super bright crazy colors although I have donated some crazy lip colors like Mette liquid lipsticks in the past but anyways and then next time we need to declutter all of them all of them and like all the ones on the ground that I took out from just there yeah I've got so many more lipsticks I need to declutter then I've got all of the ones down under there as well my little good ones that I showed you guys in one of my recently cladding decluttering okay any more recent decluttering is like there's just so many lipsticks so I've got plenty of space in here now hope you guys enjoyed this video like I said these lipsticks here will go to some lovely at new homes any of the ones they did not swatch whatsoever I might even put in to make giveaway pile which I still have not done giveaways and ages I'm so sorry I literally have two suitcases like I'm serious suitcases full of makeup for you guys so stay tuned for giveaways also I do need to do some of the image remind this I just chucked that little net for now because I took the load off my one anyways irrelevant thank you guys so much for watching once again and I will talk to you guys again really soon baby you 
hey everyone it so today I'm doing another declutter putting away my makeup cleaning up kind of video I've got all of this stuff on the floor from my previous unboxing this is after I've already done most of the recycling and after I've already put away a bit of it so I thought I'd let you guys join in for the risk because is so much here to go through lots of stuff a giveaway so I've got all of this stuff up here too so I don't know how much we're gonna get through today but we're going to clean some the donation pile is looking at very healthy this is a massive mess of box and it is at least half full this is my previous to and some of it will go to giveaways and stuff like that so there's a lot in here you guys it doesn't look so big it doesn't look as much on camera but trust me so instead of it dividing everything into little piles this time I think I'm just gonna kind of go through each box of stuff go through the stuff on the ground just like as I go and then I'll kind of organize it while I go tell you what I'm decluttering as I go so by the introverts have some piles of stuff to actually put away into my drawers I might actually start up here with these these are what I normally use to use for putting things and then I wanted to use some videos like first impressions and everything so these heaps of stuff in there that I have not used because I just kind of stopped doing there and I want to do that again so that when I get new makeup in the mail I can put the stuff I really want to use it or first impressions straight in there so what I'm filming I can just go through that stuff and know exactly what I'm using and I also used to put stuff in there that you guys were requesting to see too so I didn't forget cuz I often forget like you guys don't because I'm doing so many videos and there's so many products so sometimes I'm like oh yeah I can do a review on that and then everyone's cane in the knife just forget it and don't do it so I put stuff in here hopefully I'll remember okay so these up here oh there's some baby wipes under here where are they over there anyway so these are from that corner there's stuff there I wanted to use in videos new staff etc etc for whatever reason I put them in here to try out so I'm gonna go through this first okay so up here it looks like I've just put a ton of samples put some nerve I got my coffee at the moment - I might split this video up - by the way because my last one was like 40 minutes long or something like that well my bathroom declutter one was and the one before that was like half now along with something so I know you guys love long videos but I might split it you know into 30 or 40 minute sections if this ends up being a couple hours long okay something is definitely leaked in here cause it reeks of perfume oh my God look at this this is a little bite lipstick and it's completely destroyed oh yes most strong of perfume oh there's a lighter in here okay these are contacts which I cannot use because they are my old prescription honestly like most of this is just like samples that's all covered and like alcohol these are my simple perfumes by the way which I love I used to use them for treble a lot this one looks like it's leaking to be on my second tube ahead any leak but obviously I've been sitting here for ages so they must have just like I don't know I don't know it's gonna get rid of most of this because they're really old samples and they're all just samples moving right along they have a mini barrel which I'll just chuck in the donate pile up straight away oh my gosh in a minute I bought this in Vegas I think yeah cuz I've used it quite a bit I love this mask it is B I'm actually used in awhile power-mad jewel cleanse treatment so it dries into like a mud it's like a mud mask and then when you wit it turns into like an oily kind of texture really cleans your skin so good I'm gonna keep that for treble it smells like pits the best what's up is one of my favorite highlighters ever it's a little baby mini might actually keep that for my trip we'll make it back also okay what do we have here beach spray waves I donate with this huge heat protectant spray by GHD which all donate we have a Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer I think I'll donate that I don't use tinted moisturizer too often and I have a couple in my drawer already I know and then we've got this josie maran argan oil so i'll donate that so that so many freaking skin care oils at the moment you have a fast response eye cream by Mac might donate it and then I've got these kaylynn tinted lip balms I actually really like the texture of these basically it's like a little lip brush and then you undo it and it's like this kind of lip it's almost like a lip liner and a jaw like a little mu C kind of texture I don't know I might just keep a couple might keep this one because I really like muted red look this one is in the shade becareful these three as well because I really like the look at those colors so we've got fiercer sunburst and natural really like those colors I'll just show you here I think I got these off in white em which I did a couple of sponsorships for a while back so you just wait a little bit lovely now donate these shades which is still beautiful but I just don't think I'd wear them it's often as the other ones the other ones are a little bit more wearable this one's velvet rose a deep root and then whoops and then this one's a pink one called acid pink next up okay we have my tremolo which I'll keep which you just put perfume into triple whip this is perfect because I'm packing for Germany tomorrow so this is gonna come in very handy I have the ellipse sleeping mask which I bought from care now I need to try this I think you just put it on like a lip balm before you go to sleep this such an awkward angle for my arm line where okay I've got the terracotta girl on this is like a fake tan for your face I'm gonna keep it the first time I use it I wasn't sold on it but I do want to try it again just because I spent a lot of money on it and I feel like the colour was really nice it was just a little bit streaky so I want to experiment with different ways of application maybe using a sponge or something like that okay we've got this makeup revolution ultra strobe bomb which I'll donate and then I've got this absolute New York Pro contour palette a win wild one do you know what the only reason I want to donate these is cuz I hate how huge they are it's the same with like the do freestyle highlighters and products like that I just don't like packaging that's too huge because it doesn't fit in my drawers nicely I like to have all of my powders lined up like this like you've seen however like you have two ladies flat and then you can't get like they stack so you can't see each one and it just really frustrates me I know that sounds really pity but that's the reason I don't really like big big big packaging I should have pellets and stuff like that it's completely fine that's different but face products I just can't do it so I'm just gonna donate all of those we have another tray below just here mostly empty this one I don't give it to Hamish because he really wanted one and I remember I ordered one for a minute and nobody came so there goes that there was like a year ago so it's probably a bit too late to climb on there okay we've got the look last minute the glam ariana grande which is a beautiful shimmery pink color I want to keep it because it's so freakin pretty but I'll probably never wear it so we'll donate that we've got this phase and makeup shop rainbow glow highlight powder I have a couple of the other ones from this girl who sent them to me and they're so beautiful because they're more wearable this one's a rainbow one so obviously it's a little bit more crazy but look at that Pigman differently shake her out she's so sweet fees and makeup shop calm I just don't know if I'll wear this one so I might donate this one because I think some people have so much fun with this it's just not wearable for me and I've got some other ones that I like better these are the bear 'some lip tint packs and these are in here so I really wanted to test them out for a video I don't really think I need all of them it but at the same time I don't know what color I want to use it for a video so for now I am just going to keep these in here so I can finally do that video because I'm dying to try it I love like tint product and I thought in the video I could try out the Maybelline brow tints also cuz remember I asked you guys if you wanted to see that and you said yes so okay in here is some pellets that I've been wanting to try holy crap how long have these been doubtful like this is the problem like the strobe is so intimidating to me it was just a message on it we've got the Urban Decay Naked illuminated trio looks like this I've dinged it with my fingernail clearly this is so beautiful I don't know if I really need it probably don't the highlighters are very glittery which you guys know I don't go for that very often so I'm going to donate that to someone who will enjoy it more than myself we've got the naked ultimate basis whoa okay there needs to be reglued look at that patches and that's really satisfy the glue pitter it's probably a myth like a machine that does it very beautiful colors but I've already got all of the other naked palettes so I probably don't really need this too I love these two colors will donate that to it got a couple of these of ice pellets these are the lipstick pellets I believe yes it's like that pretty colors but I don't really use lipstick colors that often and if I do I use my shinnok's oil one so you know probably don't really need any more moving along to the next one okay so a lot of stuff in here is stuff I wanted to use in videos but buy or fret palette which is like a Z palette kind of situation and this highlighter called Beverly Hills which I'll keep those pop them up for the air oh my god meeting like me um okay and yeah oh yeah I wanted to try these by Kylie I've got the Kylie highlighter this is in the shade French vanilla which is a really nice like white gold um I'm gonna put this up here you using a video at some stage I'm gonna try it and this my hair is called a cotton candy cream which looks stunning this is so la vallee you say it I actually really like the look of these highlighters they don't look too shimmery let you buff them out and they really melt into your skin which is the look I love like the EXO Beauty highlighters like it looks like glowing from within rather than you know just Sparkle sitting on top of your skin like it's sorry pretty so I'm gonna keep both of those and try them on my skin yet as far as I can remember I really like filming these videos now because that mess in my room like I've seen it before but it kind of gives me like anxiety like I can't keep my room clean cuz Peggy's just keep coming in faster than what I can do to the clean and recycle like I can't wait more packages than I can actually recycle and get rid of the rubbish and faster then I have enough time to actually open them go through them organize them so there's just this influx of mess but filming these videos relaxes me and I find it so fun kind of going through all the products and swatching them and talking to you guys so I hope you guys enjoy these videos because it's kind of like the better part of getting seems a lot of stuff which I know it sounds like the most PT a complaint like I'm not really complaining because I'm really thankful they get sent this makeup because one I love makeup and I love filming makeup videos da inter even if it's not their intention like I get to donate heaps of stuff to people that can put it to good use which is really nice so yeah I'm really thankful for the packages it sounds like I'm complaining about the dumbest stuff but you know it's just very overwhelming mentally like to try and cope with so much stuff like I am NOT the kind of person that likes to hoard things I like to throw things away I'm not a very sentimental person I don't keep souvenirs and keepsakes and stuff very often so just having so much stuff in my face is just quite full-on for me okay moving a lot I know that sounds to you because I shot so much and everything but as I shop I get rid of so much stuff all the time so like new stuff is coming in I'm constantly getting rid of old stuff but at the moment there's just too much new stuff and then you don't want to like not get the PR packages because you might miss out on something that you genuinely need or want for a video for a review for whatever so you can't just be like oh everyone stops enemy PR next thing everyone's a option and you haven't done a review on blah blah blah and it's like yes because I don't have it my memory coach Scott Falls so you know it's a catch-22 I'm just dealing with this the best way I can there's so much stuff yes I need an assistant but it's easier sibling home okay Tanya burr cosmetics this is the Hollywood I palette which is super pretty but I'm going to donate it I just have not touched it so here we have some metallic lipsticks we have heaps of these color pop matte lipsticks okay I think we're just gonna have to swatch few of them I'm gonna get rid of this patch out that came in a subscription service I love the color though it's a really nice color I'm gonna donate the metallic I kind of bought them when I was feeling adventurous but then um you know the phase went away you know when you like buy things you like yeah I'm gonna wear that and then you just you know you're not going to I have the Laura Lee palette did I even use this I think I might have done a tutorial once on this I'm sure I did it's a really pretty pellet do I still need it I've got colors very similar to that I might donate it what about this one yeah again I have colors just like that makeup revolution highlight um donate we've got this gorge on money I tent and a really dark smoky blue which donate and then we've got this one as well which is just basically a brighter blue version we have some eyeliners by Urban Decay this one's really fun because it's like such an acid yellowish green color I'm gonna keep that one this is in the shade I can't even find it you know what I might keep them cuz they're quite unique colors and I feel like they might come in quite handy for like a tutorial or something okay I've got these Oh Fred what are these are they like items I don't know I'm just gonna donating I suppose watch this one they're like eye paints but evading Sally's I've like never seen these before I'm just gonna donate it this might keep these for like a drugstore makeup tutorial I think I used that one before and I really liked it so I'm gonna put these away too okay we've got this is really cool this is a marvelous Moxie hypnotist lip gloss oh it's a bit dirty let me wipe it down it's just like holographic kind of which I think this might come in quite handy can you guys even see it looks so much better in real life then on this camera right now this might come in handy for my cocktail series so I'm actually just gonna okay we've got this Rimmel London little coral glow how do I open this contour and highlight pal I'm just gonna watch it and see what the pigmentations like I might keep that and give that a go as well pop that oh yeah actually you know what I'm gonna put any things here so that I can remember to do a drugstore makeup strew using some of these products I've got my lip venom plumping paste by buxom is it I'll do up I always get them confused I don't know why I'm going to keep that because it's super intense and it actually works I've got this city colour rosy shades I'm just no donate okay looking at these and trying to decide which of these colours I actually really like the look of this is a lip gloss by nice that is a really pretty gloss for treble I'm gonna keep that I'm gonna throw this away because it's got so much crap on the page and can't get it off okay we've got this Milani adorable matte liquid lipstick I'm pretty sure oh yeah there we go a more matte lip cream I really like that color I'm gonna keep that one I might keep this shade here which is bumble

Jeffrey stop makeup apart from the highlighters I'm not big on the highlighters I love the eyeshadows and the lipsticks liquid lipstick but every time I use them I get cold every name under the Sun because the owner of the company is so well known and so controversial and it's just really disappointing because I love the makeup and when I talk about the makeup I'm talking about the makeup not the person but of course I can see why people don't like see it that way so I'm just gonna donate this because I can't use it next up is MEK hot in naughty lash I'm so certain I've used this but it was so long ago there I bet this is dried out or like just old so I might just have to chuck it away and then same with this one the false lashes I really like stay at hot in naughty by the way I can't remember if I liked this one but yes these are both really old so I should probably throw them out next up just a single Sephora color which I'm gonna keep I love these the Sephora lip cream so good what's in here these are all the makeup geek colors by the looks of it which I did a lip swatch video on both of these I believe so if you search any clown makeup geek lip swatches will come up

through this this one here is called Trailblazer really like the formula of these they kind of like a mercy kind of texture I'm gonna keep that one cuz it's quite unique I'm gonna get rid of these two

seen these in my big haul as well these are from serendipity of if I can get them in my ear to show you that's how they look I love them so freakin much and considering how long but now they're not too heavy like they're I feel - pulley yeah they do irritate my ears but so with it and I think that's it sort of light now I'm going to rip it wasn't it boring what's in my bag video usually a lot of youtubers especially Beauty youtubers have like all this makeup and stuff in their bag and I don't really but all I need on a day-to-day basis is like lip balm and I'm happy I've got my lipstick in

always talked to you guys again in my next video bye [Music] 
hey everyone so today I am joking video I've been putting off for the longest time and I don't even know why I'm gonna be trying on a ton of different false eyelash styles to show you how they all look on my eyes and so you can kind of compare each pair so all of these eyelashes are by extra beauty and EXO videos my own brand these are all of my own lashes and to do one of these videos ages ago and I chase me I live it here the other day and it has got so many views like I had no idea it's got 1.1 million views so yeah well I should do a updated one with all the styles including the new faux mink lashes every single pair of my lashes are completely cruelty free it all began or synthetic they are in my eyes very affordable fast New Zealanders so I'll put a link to my website down below if you want to check out my products also if you're wondering what's on my lips it is serendipity by EXO Beauty as well the lux liquid lipstick I love this color so much I'm wearing it on top of Mari a lip pencil which is out very soon also so get excited and I will be doing this all in a voiceover format because there are so many different styles to choose from so yeah let's hop in so to start this video off I'm starting with the foaming lashes which are the newest like additions to my website this is the box they come in it's nice and sturdy so you can store your lashes back in there because you can reuse them a lot of times like suggested 15 to 20 uses with proper care so the first ones I'm trying on a thunder these are nice and dramatic most of the foam inks are there like for the glue I'm at Queens out there I love them the Thunder style are very fluffy and they've got a lot of crossover here so you get maximum volume maximum fluff Erin kind of like a winged out shape so they're really fluttering and kind of elongate the eye shape next is exotic and these ones will probably scare a lot of people off these are the most dramatic lashes on my entire website they are perfect if you just really want to stand out if you want lots of lashes even for drag makeup they're perfect they're just for anyone that was like the most maximum lashes possible they're crazy big they also feature a cluster design which is super eye-catching so that's the SOT a clash next up we have it Cupid which are fluffiest and most wispy pair of faux mink lashes these ones are so 3d and so fluffy and they are very romantic-looking I called them Cupid because they just reminded me of like date night basically they are so fluffy so delicate and just so soft looking and they really just frame your eyes beautifully when you want a lot of volume next up on the list are the illusion faux mink lashes these ones feature longer and shorter strands which really frame the eyes beautifully they are so interesting to look at and just I don't know that I love the cluster effect these ones are pretty wearable in my opinion and I love it the cluster effect because it means you can see or I should are easily behind the lashes but they're still super dramatic and super volumizing of course next up is a fantasy and fantasy is probably one of the best-selling styles of the faux mink lashes these ones are so gorgeous and feature clusters and Criss crosses lots of fluffy Ness lots of 3d these ones again are really perfect when you're wearing lots of eyeshadow because you can see past them nice and easily they're very lightweight looking but there's still dramatic at the same time if that makes any sense I'm sure you guys can see what I mean just by looking at them they're very flirty very fun and so pretty number six is the final style these are Panther and these ones are a very cation spied shape and they come in little clusters these are so dramatic they give so much volume but I love how they taper in it towards the inner corners so there's still wearable in my opinion they are just so fluffy like a look at those clusters they are beautiful these are definitely one of my favorites so at once again those are called Panther now moving on to the rest of the lashes I'm going to start with the party stack which a lot of these you can buy as single pairs of lashes as well so make sure you check the shop if you like the look of one pair more than the others and starting with this top pair called the hero and these ones are exclusive to the party stick obviously when you buy a 5 piece set of lashes you are getting a discount rather than buying them all separately as well by the way that's how we've kind of priced them so it's like a value pack basically here I really beautiful very thick at the root and then kind of feather out to nice fine tea better tips they look very uniform and very very pretty next up we have it the wild one these are actually one of my personal favorite pairs because they look so nice once they're on they give you a very doe-eyed effect they are very kind of creative sorts of lashes they aren't just here every day lash they really turn your look into something it's super pretty I really like them what I want my eyelashes to look nice and unique or when I want to amp up a simple look like what I'm wearing today I think they're just so flirty and super cute next up we have at the center and these ones are so popular they're one of our best sellers they are super thick at the root and then they kind of crisscross over and they're very thin and tapered at the end so they give you a lot of volume and they look really wispy at the same time they are so nice with any makeup look especially if you're going for something a little bit more dramatic like a smokey eye or a thick winged eyeliner like I'm wearing here they're super cool the next style in the party stacker called the brave and these ones are very it chunky they've got nice big clusters and then lots of thin that kind of tapered ends as well so they give you that clustered effect they also had some Criss crosses so you get a lot of volume with these ones and I just think they're really cool these again are definitely one of our best-selling lashes and I just love them with eyeliner like today well I think they look super cervical so that one of my favorites as well next up we have the rebel and these are very similar to the previous pair the brave except they have a lot more clusters so they look super cool and almost a little bit spiky they are very eye-catching very dramatic and I love the way they look they are definitely for those of you who like a very glam look and to be honest I even sometimes wear these lashes with no eyeliner you just have to make sure to apply them nice and close to your lash line but they give you a really cool extra effect and then while I have at those lashes the rebel on I'm going to show you the understated which are our only lower pier on the website at the moment but they are so cool they give you a lot of volume and I've got little Criss crosses in the inner corner and chunks on the outer corner to give you that really nice like Bambi Joe wide dolly effect I love love love these I love every single time I wear them and they are super comfortable to wear I've got a nice clear lash band next up I'm going to try on all of the styles from the five piece dramatic state and all of these can be purchased individually so we're staying with the top here which are called the glamour Easter these are one of our bestsellers and they're just the perfect long everyday lash if you just want nice long lashes that aren't too dramatic these are perfect but they still add like a little hint of dramatic to your look obviously because they're so long and full they're really good to add volume and they're just perfect they're not too over-the-top or anything like that like if the last ones were too over-the-top for you thus it would be good for you next up are the Wonder lust and these are a little bit more crisscross see and have it a little bit more volume at than the previous pair so they just stay a little bit more dramatic a little bit more full these ones are very very popular as well just because they do give so much volume without looking at too heavy or feeling too heavy on your eyes I love the way these ones look they remind me of how my lashes personally like when I get lash extensions so they're definitely a favor and next pair we have are called the prima donna and these give you a sort of a doe-eyed effect as well they're kind of like a cat eye shape because they're full OTT on the outer half and a little bit less full on the inner half they're quite spiky and they give you that really pretty dull eye effect I can't stress how gorgeous this pair out when you wear no liner they just amplify your natural lashes and just look so stunning next up we have the gold digger these ones have it some thicker clusters right in the inner center part they give you that really nice wide eye effect and I love how fluttery and soft and wispy these ones are these are one of my all-time favorite pairs they look so voluminous like when you look down they're just so thick and they look amazing with or without eyeliner I just loved them so much and then the last set here which of course you can buy singly as well these are probably my all-time favorites if you can see they've got a black and brown at blend and they come in little clusters these are called the soulmate and they look so thick so gorgeous and that hint of brown is barely noticeable when you put them on but it just helps to amplify your eye color it really makes your eye color stand out these lashes are so and amazing definitely a personal favorite and these up we have our cluster lash style called the chic they come on in invisible bands so you can wear them with or without eyeliner and these are definitely a bestseller they give you a very beautiful eye effect almost like a doll or I feel like I keep saying that but seriously they just make your eyes look so pretty I love the cluster effect if you suck at putting on individual lashes as well like I do they're perfect they give it loads of volume next up we have at the fango lash these ones were actually named by one of my viewers and they are another kind of spiky effect like the prima donna except all the way across they give you a really nice kind of separated look with lots of volume and lots of length and I love the curl on these ones they are stunning like I just feel like they look very eye-catching they're less worse being more clustered so they just look super thick and fun next up let's do another set so these are at the naturals and they are all available individually also so the first pair called the girl-next-door these are very very natural you have to excuse my bad application I took off my liner so you could see them the best at this point I had a lot of lash glue all over me so yeah anyways these are very pretty that they come in tiny little clusters that they're very lightweight and very flirty and fun and perfect for everyday wear or if you have it sparse lashes and you just need to thicken up your lashes a little bit for everyday next up are at the innocent which is super crisscross in there like a shorter version of the Wonder less so more suitable just for everyday if you don't want too much length but you want massive volume these are so fine the little hairs are so thin and they look so fluffy and beautiful on it has a black lash band but it is so thin that you can still wear these lashes with no liner I just absolutely love how thick and fluffy they make my lashes next up I'm skipping over to the arias these are so pretty they are quite long but they're more clustered so they don't look as intense they're perfect for everyday when you don't want anything to stand out too much they have a nice thick clusters with thinner strands to look really nice and fluffy and they just look so perfect they're one of my favorites just for like an everyday natural kind of look I just think this is so pretty I don't know I love them so much the bottom pier hair called the romantic they're kind of similar to the glamour East except these ones are more wispy I guess and less clustered up and down like they're kind of fanned out more and these ones are definitely a best-seller I love these on prides I did the most romantic beautiful flirty looking lashes ever they don't look like too much they don't look too overboard they just really compliment your eyes and make your lashes look nice in fact like you've just had fresh lash extensions or something like that and then going back to the stunner these are like 2/3 lashes they're like half lashes but a little bit longer so you put them on the outer half of your eye and my lashes look plumped up and glue so they would normally look a little bit nicer than this but you can see with little lashes on that outer corner and they are so curly these are a best-seller for brides also we get a lot of makeup artists buying these for their braids because they're so easy to wear so comfortable and they just give the perfect amount of outer volume and curl to just look really pretty and romantic another half lash style we have I called the flirt these are basically similar to the innocent except cut in half and these ones are so pretty on the outer corner to add heaps of volume and kind of wispy nacelles the strands are so thin and delicate they just make your lashes look nice and fluffy I'm a huge fan of these ones I get a lot of compliments every single time I wear them because they look natural but give you a little bit of umph and then the final pair of half lashes we have are called the flower child these ones a cluster E and crisscross see they're kind of similar to the faux mink lashes in fantasy except they are a little bit more lightweight and shorter so perfect for everyday wear they give it such a pretty effect really nice and clustered and wispy like I said and would normally look better when I don't have lash glue all through my lashes bigger and then at the final pair I'm trying on today is called the feline another bestseller these start out nice and thin on the inner corner and then taper out to longer and thicker lashes on the outer corner to give you that really feline inspired kind of I shape like really almond and beautiful these are really nice and wispy and soft and give you heaps of volume a bit of length and just you know they just make your eyelashes look great okay so there is all of these styles thank you for bearing with me I know there was a lot of them to put on it took me four hours to film it so I hope I hope it helped you guys out my eyes are burning like literally I need to go drench my eyelashes and revitalash now and pick out all of the glue because there is a lot of glue in here sorry if my eye makeup didn't look the best and some of those shots obviously I was removing but they they make on and removing them and putting them back on and my eyes are so red and sore right now so thank you guys so much for the support as always I hope you guys enjoyed this video you know I'll see you guys in the next one bye [Music] [Music] 
hey everyone so today I am doing a chick arrhythmia cocktail series look okay so this one has been highly requested from the very beginning of my series it is sex on the beach so scandalous but not really at all it's literally a vodka orange juice cranberry juice and peach net so that's not like I'm doing today because you guys want to see it super bright and fun that kind of like coral pink and orange so we're going to do something crazy bright I might even do bright lips as well and I want a nice bright skin I want a nice highlighted skin I want to hide these freakin under-eye circles as you can hear I'm still sick and my skin is parched my under-eye circles are horrendous I don't know if you can see this I've got friggin veining everywhere it's just I just really want to cover everything up right now and my hair is so greasy so I was like instead of washing my hair I'm just going to put it in a bun so yeah that happened today I'm going to use my Urban Decay self adjusting it complexion primer I'm sure for the toilet set on my skin for a moment just to adjust this neutrals can look so pretty with this so you have just adjusted to my skin tone bom-bom-bom bom-bom calm I don't think it once is that any more but whatever okay so today I am going to also be featuring it benefits new collection of concealers which I'm really excited about it amazing things so far this is the boying bling bling Mansell you have this debate whether it's boring or boring so I was just a boy or a skater house here is this I'm like it's just with this super secure so there it has relaunch this boring collection like the concealers it edited that the new concealer as well new packaging everything so in this cute little case that doesn't suit me there are three of the new for concealers so the one that I'm missing is called the airbrush concealer it's got sheer to medium coverage so I feel like this would be really nice to lay out on top of or underneath your foundation just to even out your skin tone add a little bit more coverage where you need it it says that blur smooth can still it's your real life retouch can still and retouch unevenness that fine lines and under-eye circles so that one sounds also let me know if you want me to do a little bit of a video on and I can in the future in like another chit chat goea listening easier and then the other three I have here I've got the hydrating concealer which is perfect for ends of the eyes especially for people like me that had really dry under eye circles also good if you've got really dry patches of skin so maybe like you've got some acne that it's like killing up and it's a little bit dry really good for stuff like that so I'll probably use it just over these marks because the skin here is super super dry and then the next one I have is the industrial-strength concealer so this is really good for acne scarring it's really good for really dark under-eye circles this one's like full full coverage and then we have it the brightening concealer which of course is going to be so good and your eyes to brighten I love a good bright under eye apparently this one is color correcting as well so it's got melon undertones which will help to brighten up both dark and the terms of your under eye circles so quickly that's what I do my foundation I'm actually going to apply the brightening concealer oh my gosh look how freaking cute the message again I love it I love benefits packaging but it's like the top of a pizza look at a razor so doesn't me a shade at three hopefully it's okay for me I've got no fake tan on right now but we'll make it work okay so here's how it looks as you can see it has a really oranjee undertone but that's because it helps to counteract those really bluish purplish undertones of dark eye circles which I have so it's the perfect time to put it to the test let's do one side and I'll show you a before and after oh so creamy do you see how well that just glide it on I'm going to put on top as well because I have a lot of veins as you can see oh my gosh that difference already first impression looks so creamy and obviously because it does have that kind of orangey undertone it is a good idea to follow up with a different concealer or foundation whatever you want to use on top just to help hide the color and it will layer really nicely so I'm also going to put it over top of this vino here because it's very blue okay now I'm going to pop on my foundation and then we'll do a little bit more concealing and play with the other ones so really excited I am using covergirl Jade 105 really sick gorgeous because I'm Paley if right now this is like my favorite foundations especially when I've got fair skin because I love the color it's like so perfect so okay so I'm just going to pop it all over I'm not really wearing the badge marks or use some concealer down there now I'm going to use is the boying hydrating concealer now this one is a more sheer coverage it's very hydrating so this is what it looks like I'm just going to twirl it out a little so there outside like a bomb and it's really hydrating so I'm actually going to use this just over these pimples it's got crazy for a moment but I'll blend it out in a second and I can't say if I want to use this one or the boy industrial-strength concealer under my eyes this one's full coverage so this will really cover up anything XD scarring uneven skin tone oh my gosh it's so cute still the packaging and your eyes like everything maybe I'll use it under my eyes so it's just blending out the hydrating bling you know what I could probably actually layer a little bit of this one on top of it because it is a little bit more sheer so this is Shane 3 once again the industrial-strength concealer I'm just going to apply it directly it with my sponge just for a little bit more control be honest I could probably has done it with a lighter shade but this would be good when I have fake tan on there at the moment clearly don't so that's okay we'll make it work also going to use this RLI nose where I get a whole lot of redness actually I'm going to put it on my nose too I'll do one side so you can see the difference just pushing this underneath oh wow this shoe is really smooth I was Warwick sits quite a sec full coverage concealer but it doesn't actually look circa once it's on especially with the sponge it doesn't look you bit oh my gosh she looks so flawless look a bit so there's the dress that we put a little bit more on top of my eyelid they covered up that other product really nicely as well they look so nice together so flawless okay I should probably stop now before I get too carried away so these are out on July the 7th and you Dylan oh it really improves with a flawless most good looks right now okay next up let's sit our safe so I'm going to use a big powder brush and the stay matte powder by Rimmel just pull over to set this you might want glowing skin and this is a match powder I'm going to be adding it a whole lot of highlighter and things later so it's done and then just it under my eyes I'm just going to use a little bit of my it bare mineral some of this with a shimmery lip brush I am genuinely impressed you guys all of these thoughts opinions and everything are my own I'm not being told what to say right now these are my own opinions and I think it looks friggin flawless especially considering like my skin is so dry right now and it still doesn't look like too heavy or anything like that okay next up I am going to go straight onto my eyebrows I'm going to use in my favorite brow product at the moment this is Cabral by benefit and this is in at the shade 3 and it was just so easy to use and so creamy like I'm obsessed with it this was in my makeup bag from when I went to LA recently for VidCon I'll put a link down below my blog channel I've got some VidCon vlogs up at the moment just obsessed everytime I use this I'm just like how this is so good you guys or do you know how much I love this okay then I've got my shape 3 gimme brow which is my favorite brow mascara is brow day seriously I feel like I need to contour quickly because my face looks really round with my hair office okay I'm like using way too many benefit products in the z-row but it's just a coincidence because I really wanted to use this I talked about this and my unboxing I said that I tried it out at Sully Joe's house and I really liked it and especially when I'm like you know like I am right now it's a really good color I love the original hoola so this is her low-light I'm going to kind of start contouring with this but I'm going to contour with my top one which I love but I'm just going to kind of start contouring and bronzing because this will give my skin a really nice color and I feel like it will flatter the bright colors are going to be using really nicely because bright colors especially like neons when you set them off with a nice bronzer just makes them pop this bronzer just looks so pretty I love it okay now we're going to use the angled brush again the Tarte Pro glow contour color got color okay so six on the beach let's find some eyeshadows I think I'm going to use that new BH because palette because there are some bright AF colors in there so we're going to go real pink heavy with a bit of orange for the orange juice from the orange slices and stuff like that we have this BH Cosmetics take me to Brazil palette which is so fun it's crazy super bright and then I might grab out my Z colors and play around with some other single colors I'm starting with - hi shadow no no I base and I'm just going to pop this all over just so that my I should have really stick to it my face is like definitely way too dark bit so I'm not actually leaving the house today so I don't care note to self not to do the tea roots Claus pose today in marriages I'm going to start with a thermal in the brush and Spring Break by carroty looks like a vest it's a really bright clear coral like electric color and I'm going to go straight in woo to the crease so this is like the perfect mix of orange and pink to start with you can set your base before you start if you like but I find that's one really easy to blend on top off now I'm going to go and with this kind of like dull orange color I'm going to begin with that one so it's from the BH take me to Brazil palette and I'm going to allocate you really bright Wow this repented suppress that on the eyelid they're stunning I'm just going back in with that spring break or whatever it was called just blending out each which colors are so pretty here then I'm going to take the yellow of color so this one actually a basically put that like this and then I'm going to mix the yellowy orange and Boop this orange which is super bright you can't really see it on camera it's so bright and put that and the orange colors are not as pigmented as the other one it's a little bit powdery compared to it and once again I'm going with that first crease color and just blending I look nice and so I'm going to take a sponge with whatever boying is lift on there the industrial-strength one and I'm just going to clean up you know what I'm going to leave the lower lash line there I'm just going to so I'll use a little bit of a kind of brown color to choose any Brown I don't know just took a random one out of my Z palette I'm going to take that yellowy color again the yellowy orange and just kind of put that just here unto the tear duct this colors are really nice going to peachy golden reflect it so I think I look really nice on the inner corner it's called I'm speechless by makeup geek just going to put it right on it and a part of the eye in the corner ah perfect we click over the top of that you go over it a little he's a little bit on my browbone I really love how this eye makeup looks like it's so minimal but not like it's bright but you know the main life is quite minimalism like there's not much happening it's just like a couple of colors blended together really nicely and I think it looks really fluttering with the bronzed skin but I don't why do you like that I really just like how it's looking so I'm going to do lecture this mascara and maybe some nude water lightened this is honey dude by color pop for my lashes I'm using these which are from the

hey everyone so today as you can see from the title I'm doing a new at gemstone it series look and if the time I was thinking it away and if my earrings are give it away I'm doing a read look today I asked you guys on Twitter walls like keeping in mind the response on my last video which look you wanted next and it's always a red one so many of you guys want to see a red gemstone serious look on it Twitter a lot of you guys recommended got it it's red it is the January birthstone we're in January so it kind of fits I'm not saying I'm gonna do this every month but I do like the idea of like you know doing the gemstone to mesh the month but I don't think I'll be doing the gemstone series oh yeah so you know but while it's hue might as well give it a go so I was considering merging together garnet Andrew because ruby is a really really highly requested one also but they are very different so this has got it right here as you can see it's rich but more importantly often seems to have a little bit of a oranjee undertone almost like these earrings like it's definitely a true read a little bit orangey quite often whereas Ruby seems to be more of their very true bright rate sometimes a little bit more pinky so you know maybe I'll do Ruby later after I've done a few other looks in between try to do something completely different just it's a little challenge because I do love bright red eye shadow it's one of those colors it's just like crazy and I think it's so fun to play with so let's dive in so what are you some kind of like Pluto in this look oh also one more thing I do want to try out this again today the big ultimate coverage completion cream I'll see if I like it better with sitting spray and stuff because I did a first impression which I will link down below I was just like yeah it looked quite like he being cakey so I want to try with a sponge today and I had my mic in once again let's improve at the sound quality okay how's that better for some reason my last couple of videos I filmed without a mic like I forgot to plug it in I don't know if you guys can notice the difference but I can sounds like so much worse without a mic I'm so used to like the crisp sound now sorry this video is gonna be a bit long I made shitty mood this is one of the first videos I'm filming in 2018 even though it doesn't seem like it for you guys cuz i pre filmed for primer today I'm going to take my joy anti blemish primer it's just like a clear primer with salicylic acid in it yeah which helps to treat pimples apparently alright let's give this a go I'm quite pale at the moment just go figure out what shade I am because I don't know them off my heart yet and of course it's all like this dark bottle or an older shell I'm gonna quickly a sprint with my Glen glow glow sealer and this is just my pick flow beauty flawless finish sponge-on one pump all over my face this time instead of two like in the other video so Rick and you only need one pump all over but I reckon that's gonna be a lie just starting out with this foundation it stood another pump maybe it's just because the product isn't spread of area evenly maybe I don't know just going to use some of my lasting perfection concealer just where the Foundation's not sitting well on my nose and then of course to conceal under my eyes wow I am pale look like a vampire freaking it love this concealer I always forget about it and then every time I go back to it I'm just like oh then I'm just sitting under my eyes really quickly using my Kat Von D sitting powder the look at brightening one and then before I sit the rest to my face I'm just gonna do my eyebrows real quick might use this cuz I'm use it in a while my makeup forever shade 20 a brow liner I'm just doing this before my powder so that if I miss up I can conceal it easily honestly this foundation I thought it would look so much better with a sponge but it doesn't I don't know what I'm doing wrong oh my gosh so me and Hamish started getting into black Murray like everyone was like going on about how amazing it was we started watching one episode ages ago I think I fell asleep or something then Holmes turned it off and then we just forgot to go back to it because we binge watched up to season 3 episode 4 in one day or one afternoon I should say and yeah we've continued and I'm obsessed with it so thanks for the recommendations and if you haven't seen it go see it what have I just done to my brow I don't care if it's missing because we're tidying it up what's gonna steal oh just like that and I'll make them look a little bit natural a little bit natural a little bit more natural in us again because at the moment of course they look quite blocky this is just something I've done a couple of times in my everyday life when I'm feeding it doing my brows I don't use this every day because it takes a little bit long compared to my benefit brows but um I do like the effect what I want something quite dramatic I'm gonna use a little bit of that gimme brow I'm pretty sure is still not out yet which annoys me I'm just being a rebel and using it anyway and then it taking my trusty brow turns and shade to just stick up a little bit more dimension since it's such a dark color amantha pada I'm using my the bomb flutter bomb what priests light powder foundation stuff in a big powder brush I just don't love this foundation like I just don't look at my skin and think wow you know what I mean it's quite dull hopefully I feel better about it once I you know put on highlighter and stuff well is there something quiet like vampy maybe slightly gothic inspired or something like that today I don't know why I just feel like it I'm gonna go in with the shade a min from this poly hair this is called the saint and sinner I showed pellet by kit one day so it is that right there this is so hard to do backwards just to even out my eyelids you know who I've been watching lately as Nicole conciliar well I've been on air watching following her on Twitter and she did a double what cut crease last week was it this way I can't mean that gonna page me do a double cut crease cuz it looked really cool I don't know if I can even do that though like I'm already bad at cut creases do you guys reckon I can do something like this I don't even know yeah but it's beautiful I mean let's just wing it so I need a transition shade I might start with a straight up orange let's just see how this goes so I'm gonna go in with the shade divil which is that bright and orange right there just like kind of above the crease I already hate my base makeup so you know if this entire video turns into a disaster that's fine I'm not expecting a miracle but if we can pull it through it'll be epic we'll see it's a learning curve guys I'm not perfect and I'm not a makeup artist not a professional makeup artist not trained I don't know what T if I'm doing half the time I just play with makeup and show you how I do it trolland you're here I'm gonna take some of this middle shade from the Natasha Jamuna holiday at palette eros number two I'm gonna pretty much go on top of that just deepen it up a bit these eyeshadows bling so good I'm like slapping it on not even being careful and yet they just buff out so even and then for a little bit more rid hopefully this orange eco lines Nathe will kind of throw the rate of an orange taking this read which is called fuchsia I think from with the other holiday palette Joya you should see how this goes putting that right kind of where we're gonna be cutting I don't really know what shape I'm going for on the outer corner I'm just gonna decide late it this is totally experimental I'm like loving the color tones though I'm just sticking up right where I'm gonna cut it is also it's the darkest area I might even do like a dark burgundy it was something just to really define it I'm gonna take the tiniest amount of crucifix which is like a dark brown because I want the cut crease to be above my natural crease okay let's just give this a go let's try and cut something so I'm just going in with some that concealer again so kind of cutting out my actual crease and I'm gonna go above that my battery's dying I'm just using a lip brush to get the detail like a nice sharp line I feel like this is one of those makeup looks that it's gonna look so much better with you I shut them open you guys know what I mean right some makeup looks just like when your eyes are open I think what's good okay now I guess I new work on the lid and then kind of clean up in between afterwards I'm gonna go straight back and knit to it this collab there's got to be an easier way I'm gonna same as we've just done on my show and drawn a freaking line in between I'm going to take this color which is like a ridah SH orangish shimmer maybe on my finger and I probably should have done my makeup before my foundation may you live in your learn you'd think I wouldn't by now they're right whatever do you guys remember that United States of what it was on the road back you know it's still kind of fun I feel I want to clean it up it could be kind of cool before I do everything else cuz I want to kind of blend it like what they call is done see how our eyeliner kind of blends into the dike at a corner and then if you look at these you know you get all their multi-dimensional like the dark light coming through so you like the bottom corners and stuff I'm gonna use some black track by Mac lining it up with the outer corner I'm taking it some of this color here which is called it cherry cola just by makeup geek this is a look brush blending out there out of eyeliner I feel like we need to darken that top cut crease part I don't even know what's happening right now I'm just taking what it was on this brush from which I put on my crease I made on my lid and I'm gonna put it just through that top up before I recut it I can't honestly I don't know I don't know so if I go like that it looks okay and then I go out there that's like what I'm gonna persevere this is even got it colored anymore kind of I'm gonna take the color was that stigmata this one in the corner yeah that's like the perfect color you know press some of that on top too that was honestly way better than that pink turned red like you know it goes with the garnet thing better and then I'm gonna take a summit glitter this is a firecracker size three yeah by lit cosmetics this is just a wild ride I don't know what's happening I'm just gonna wish I put it in here and for no reason in particular I just feel like trying out this color here on my iniquity umbrella and this car so creamy I'm sorry but this is the most freaking it delicious color I've ever seen oh my god well that was an absolute wild ride from start to finish we're not even done this is exhausting mr. right I wanna in SEMA diamonds what is this okay I think it's just black creamy it's the bomb by the way this is a really nice black eyeliner okay just before I do my eyelashes like my scar and stuff I just want to do bronzer cause I feel like a pillow man okay which brings uh I need something to make me glow like I just feel so Potato Head right now looks so mad I was gonna save this for a woo first impression earlier like full face first impression but I might just use this now this is the pocket princess chisel pellet buy taught first gonna take the shade crown which is like a shimmery at brown color bronzer it's probably gonna be way too dark for my complexion but I mean it's not exactly a mint makeup day anyway that blends up so nice got this smell good I'm not digging the pale skin so I'm just putting a crap-ton of this long and I'm taking the enhance shade just using it to blend on my forehead which is like a yellow color just to make sure it's nice and seamless oh it's adding some coverage yes here we go we're getting them now guys and then I'm taking the shade angle will showed your princess cut no princess cut looks a little bit gray oh damn that's a lot more pigmented then I thought it was okay this is just a bronzer brush damn this might be one of those videos where I just can't make it work and they're not on the same brush I'm gonna take a tiny bit of this blush here from the Vizia palette just on the back of my cheek I'm just gonna take some of my Lauri gala baked boy frosting cuz my neck is old early so if i old can be it to my face now that i've bronzed do you guys ever just have a moment where you just chuck on makeup and try something new and you just feel weird over to like it once I'm done I mean done yet so we'll see we'll see it's always once I do my lashes I feel like that's when you can see the effect do you know I mean it's looking a little bit more uniform now quickly I'm going to do something that could ruin this entire look more than a Diaz hey I'm trying something new okay I need it stop being so hard on myself it's not even their bird it's just like I'm not used to this and again it's one of those looks that probably looks so much better just in like photography you know I like when I'm not like moving around when I'm just like posing I want to do bold looks I'm just going all at oranjee vampy read lips anyway the thing that could ruin it all I'm gonna try this is the highlighter on my cheekbones it is shimmery and yes and we all know how I feel about that some reason it's calling me literally I can see the glitter on this brush but let's go this is a small face brush oh my gosh I feel that I've had the worst hay fever for like the last forgeting three months it's glittery but I am feeling it today I'm going all out there's no stopping me damn girl damn damn Daniel does anyone still say that probably not feels so old and then I'm gonna go in with the same brush beckons max would be highlighter wherever the heck I put it and then I'm gonna use this with a denser brush for more of a glow on my forehead and chin I'm just kind of going over the same areas just to kind of blend it in a bit so what's super Chloe's good I'm pretty much putting it everywhere I don't regret that decision I'm gonna do the lips and then the eyelashes because I feel like the lashes it's gonna sit it off blushes is you know what I mean um so how are we going pretty good it's like looking Morgana as I give me a completion there is a layer dust on all of my colour-pop lipsticks because I never use them so should I use one of these don't even know if half of these colors are strong stop look at this color poison that could be cool first I want to line my lips by the way this is XO beauty what planet-- coming the shake Kelly let's try out this poison color this is definitely off Sting's yeah that needs to be Bend okay I'm gonna stop right there because otherwise I'm gonna spear this is project chimps this would've been good Dibble Halloween makeup I might reused some lashes I've got some of my bathroom I clean this morning okay I'm using that gigi hadid lash sensational okay now it seems to be coming together a little bit bit of it still I wouldn't give a wear this makeup out of the house would you guys with something like this out of the house let me know down below I'm like I'm fine like with a bold lip crazy colorful eyeshadow even a colored lip like Green locals at my god go out but this terrifies me it's always good to try new things though by the way thank you so much all of your amazing feedback on my past few videos I am just so hippy like I just feel like I don't know I've just been noticing a lot more positive comments and stuff not like I knew be used to get positive comments cuz I do notice your guys comments I just mean in general like it just seems to be more so just people like wow I really like the content and stuff which seriously means so much to me when you're a creator and you're filming these videos like even if you like them you're not quite sure what other people feel about them but I've had such good feedback on a few of my previous videos like my New Year's Eve get ready with me my gigi hadid video I like you guys have just given me such amazing feedback on there on Twitter and Instagram and stuff so I just wanted to say I really appreciate it I'm just so glad that you guys are enjoying the videos as always coming down below let me know what you want to see next what do you want to see more of so my next videos are going to be some more first impressions a first impression that's Brody filmed and it's such a good foundation in my opinion also I'm going to be filming maybe later this week my lowest rated mica products and I'm going to do the Sephora one after that and then I think I'll do like ultra MPD Bay like it's similar kind of thing with like trying out the abyss rated and lowest rated products I've also got a video trying out weird like viral stuff which is coming soon I'm just finalizing that soon as well so I'm excited there's so much cool stuff happening shows you these ones I've won this pair literally so many times it's not even funny oh they look crazy how I just placed them I haven't let's tuck those I'm just trying to decide like these ones my other thought is thunder those are probably a little bit better with this looks it gives that cat eye effect since there's this wing so these are Thunder booming clashes thanks for beauty I've got my old ones I've used a million times in here but that's what they look like new you can seriously use these so many times I've used mine so many so many times already they just last and last all I do is I soak them overnight in my cellar water and that loosens all the glue mascara dirt and then I just clean them in the morning like peel off the glue and tissue them off sometimes I'll rinse them under water just to get all of them most sell her off and they're good to go again that's good because you don't have to reassure them you just slap them on so I'm just placing them on that's why I made these boxes so sturdy so they can really store your lashes safely and its really good for travel too because the Box doesn't get squashed I'm happy I tried it out I'm really happy I heard this inspires you guys to try something new I know it sounds so cheesy but seriously it's pretty fun you know if you're just hanging out a Friday night got nothing to do try something your there's only one way you can get bitter at things and that's by trying so I do actually quite like it but again probably a little bit too terrified to like go out of the house like this this is so ironic I know but I'm really not big about being like the center of attention so if I wear makeup that I'm not used to and I don't feel like myself I feel like I'm standing out even though I'm probably not but you know what I mean whereas even if I'm wearing like rainbow eye shadow just because I've kind of learned to accept color like I love colored I share now as you guys may have picked up like you know in the last couple years I've done so many colorful looks I mean usually it's just like one or two colors at a time that you know what I mean I can go out and I just feel normal like I feel like myself however something like this just because I'm not used to wearing it I'm like excuse me anyways that glitter is kind of creasing on my eyelid but we're just gonna leave it alone otherwise I will never finish this video and you'll be watching me there is yeah I kind of like it I know it's not perfect but it's so fun so if you enjoyed this video as always please give me a thumbs up I'd really appreciate it does help me reach more people I really really really really love this look colored so so stunning I've not actually worn this one before I

stippling brush I'm just gonna open a couple the only thing of some cheaper brushes sometimes you get them and they're like good quality but just not as dense as I was like but then again brushes they're art super dense have their uses as well yeah this feels really not dense so probably wouldn't use it for foundation but it would be good for blush or bronzer I'll open up one of the eye brushes maybe the blending brush cuz everyone needs a good blending brush I like the kind of color combo that I've done the black and the gold what's really nice they remind me of the way like professional paint brushes look I don't mean that in a bad way I mean that in a good way like they've got that really artist this actually feels really good it feels soft it feels dense is a couple of

builder uh-uh okay so it's a little bit more like flimsy it's a buildable cheek brush so it's kind of similar to like camel into the share powder brush if you've got you co PD it feels quite similar just smaller and weird shape it's kind of like an angled brush can you say I don't know this is like buzzing me up it's so soft what is this this scuse me I said like a oh that's weird it feels really it feels like something that comes out of the sea I really want to open those chips but I'm supposed to be being good today because you stay almost a whole bag or friggin biscuits by myself more stuff

this was in two parts as you could tell there was a lot of stuff so I think one video would have been it would have taken me like three days to get it so it was just a little bit easier breaking it into two I know you guys love long videos you got two long videos this way instead of one extra long video but yeah it just would have taken me way too long to edit so I wanted to make it a little bit easier for me to eat it by doing two so yeah once again thanks for watching and I'll talk to you guys [Music] [Music] 
hey everyone so today I am going to trap the Gigi Hadid Maybelline at collection I hope I said her name right I may exceed Butch's everything I'm quite excited about this I do really like Maybelline it is a brand I feel like for a drugstore brand I like most of this stuff I do find drugstore brands more hit or miss then high-end brains I've said that my videos before with high-end brands I often find there's a bit more consistency in the quality however like some drugstore brands I feel like you know there's some really good stuff and really terrible awful staff Maybelline is one of the brands where I feel like more often than not their products are really good so I'm actually really excited to try this collection and watch anyone's video is about it yet so hopefully I like it I'm going to try and basically try like most of the stuff so here's like a little close-up over what was included in this little PR pic this is not sponsored by the way of course all of these opinions are my own and always even if it's sponsored you know my own opinion we've got some like illuminators liquid illuminators tinted primers we have a I contour palette actually two of them we've got mascara more mascara we've got heaps of lipsticks we've got lip pencils and I pencils even a brush and then we've got this like giant palette as well so I'm just gonna dive in oh look and there's these kinds of eyeshadows so first impression on the actual packaging the box is a holographic which I am obsessed with I love love love the boxes and then the actual packaging is like a beige color just like Kim K who pick aw beauty line like it's a very similar kind of pinky beige color these little compacts hair I like a paper packaging like a contour and then at these ones here are a plastic the lipsticks are plastic they feel quite and I'll talk more about it so inside the Gypsy the pellet it looks like this you get a mascara concealed on lip balm blush highlight and bronzers and brushes so I don't think there's any foundations so I'll just use a different foundation I'm gonna start with a primer noir I'll start with the illuminator and then go in with the primer so I'm gonna start with let's just do this one since the first one grab liquid strobe illuminate and iridescent I like the packaging of beads it's like the original Maybelline at primatech Jiang which I love Maybelline practiced so much so this is what it looks like it looks like a white color and then I wrapped it in between my fingers can you see that pink glow please try to look it feels so nice and moisturizing I'm just gonna open the other one for fun this one here is in the shade gold and that's the color of gold bit of a medium in the darker skin tones but let's chuck some on to see what it looks like whoa well I'm definitely glowing now so I think I'll donate the gold one but I like the pink one the gold ones just a little bit too dark my skin tone as you can clearly say although I've got stuff will fake tan on right now next I'm gonna try the tinted Primus so there is a medium date and I'll light medium of course I will go for the light medium and turn it the other one doesn't Riggs may tented primer it's like a base oh it doesn't look very light does it but it's just tinted but seriously like look at Doc that it is okay sorry about how does that watch it well I mean it's like standard medium at least that's not light this is not just oh my god why does this waste heaven to me I just took my towel and rocked most of it off because that was just hideous okay don't like that we'll be getting rid of that one turn so sorry 5 get this one now let's just check on some foundation because it was good coverage though I like if it actually matches your skin tone a bit it's flaking you and why do I don't like it look Gunn will flake you in like rusty I'm just gonna use a Maybelline a foundation at today let my favourites is the matte and poreless this is in the shade 120 [Music] I actually need to look good today because I mean I think I filmed a video and I was like I'm dying Russia not grocery shopping Christmas shopping today and I didn't because I just didn't want to so that's actually it today's job so hopefully my makeup turns out semi decent so I don't look like a clown face walking around then whoa oh my god that like tinted prime it's got a little stuff in my heel on it orange let's try this little jits it a pic and try at the concealer I just don't know how I feel about like lip balms in the same area is Pat is let's put some of this long I'm gonna mix them together I can barely feel it the color is beautiful but they don't feel very hydrating I'm using the lightest color concealer on a concealer brush it's very bombing you know the main like it feels really slippery I'm going to apply it directly with my sponge well that brush it goes on a bit streaky because yeah it's lip balm me and I don't know that it's just strange but it's really brightening and smooth looking coverage is not amazing it's definitely bitter just to kind of brighten and it's creasing a little bit so the makeup does kind of sink well into my skin looks really nice so you can kind of see the highlighter peeking through underneath on my cheek barn I'm gonna take a little bit more of the highlighter on my sponge and just apply them on top of the foundation so see how it works on top looks very similar it's really nice it really does like kind of sink into a skin the concealer is just like 50/50 I don't think it's like an amazing concealer it does the job kind of but it does crease a bit and the coverage is not incredible I like the look of the lip balm bits definitely not like a hydrating lip balm it's just slippery okay sorry I just did I'm a powder and I did in my brows so we're gonna move straight on again this politcal and the sponsor terrifies the living crap out of me it looks so so dark it does look matte which is good but we'll go to go I don't know if you're supposed to contour with this by the way this palette we've obviously I'll try out the eyeshadow soon and the highlight of it so far I'm just like numeric because it's just so big and bulky like look how huge this is were you even gonna put this may be a gift for like a younger teenager or something that's just starting how to makeup it could be cool but like other than that I don't think I've ever reach for it so I'm literally taking this smallest amount and I'm just gonna keep building up until I get corn stalks I'm so scared of the color just looks so dark so far so good it looks a little bit warm once I've blended it out though it's probably a bit of a bronzing not contouring so let's just scrap that and I'm just going to pop some of it around my cheeks and forehead my nose it's very warm looks so much warmer than it looks in the pan I don't like the shape of the powder because I keep accidentally dipping into the blush is it so narrower to get your brush in there especially if you were using a bigger bronzer brush okay I'm just me use some of that blush now I really like the blush the color is beautiful I'm just gonna take my shapeshifter palette by urban decay I know this is not Maybelline but I just want to contour with something a little bit cooler so I'm using that cool train there this is a face to find a brush and then wiping off my face to finite I'm going to use it the highlighter when here it looks quite glittery but hopefully it's not too bad it looks like a beautiful color well it's quite chunky though it's beautiful it's dimly shimmery but I still like it it's very blinding this looks so orange because of the birds underneath we're just gonna have to move past that okay so there are these are two pellets right here one will purpley pink and then one more peachy and golden then these don't really excite me very much at all it's almost like they were going for like the Urban Decay vibes it looks like you get stuff all product I'd have to confirm that but they look really small and just like me I might throw at the end and then I'll try so thigh shows up from here - it's gonna start off with this little pellet head this is the eye contour pellet and it's in at the shade warm I'm using the highlighter shade it's just like a matte color you can barely see it on my skin tone but it seems to perform nicely it's quite pigmented easy to blend let's try color we can actually see I'm gonna go in with maybe the skull is seeking from the top it's like a really warm peachy color it's how it looks in the brush this is a crease blend a brush I'm going in with no eye primer I just want to see how they look it's a beautiful color that's really easy to blend as well I like it and then I'm gonna go into maybe the next one over just kind of in the same area kind of goes with my outfit today I'm quite proud now I'm gonna go into this palette here this palette is called the eyeshadow palette and at the shade warm also I'm gonna use the gold I know this isn't very revolutionary it's quite pigmented on my brush let's put on the eye using my finger it's better it's not likely most pigmented shimmer in the world but it is a pretty color let's try this color here mixed with a little tear of that one such as Musa they're putting nothing on my eye I mean it goes on my finger but it's like not transferring from brush to eye well it's a little bit chalky I don't like this I don't think this palettes is good regardless I'm just putting that on the outer corner and into the crease I regret doing that this is just a fluffy blending brush by the way to buff out the edges I'm just gonna do the same on the other eye lower to make it match seriously it's like Billy they're like this is just a waste of time and when you're back in it so this palette here and just take hours to make sure if these - I'm just gonna pop them out of the eye and then I'm gonna go back into this giant palette and go in with the highlighter shade put some of this may in a corner I'm running so I'm like underneath the lower lash line at the front or just good I'm gonna put a little bit with my brother and just to make it glow this color is nice surprisingly I like this one the best I think it's just I don't know and I want me to look at but it is a good neutral palette if you're looking for a drugstore neutral palette do you think it works pretty good okay now eyeliner so I'm going to put on the more nude eyeliner I will try this out this is a gel eyeliner in the shade I actually don't know where the shade name is anyway it's the nude one oh I really like that it's very creamy and then we have a liquid eyeliner too so this is the liquid eyeliner in the shade black looks like this which is really interesting like a really longer felt tip it's not as flexible as I thought it might be it's kind of stiff feel like it's kind of dragging on my eye a little bit like it's kind of hot to yours so we got there in the end it is very black I like the way it's really even I just don't like the application let me see if I can bend on my look it seems to be into my hand maybe I just need to like warm it up a bit and then tracking wait look how black that is it does bleed a little bit on my hand but look how doc okay it's a little bit more flexible now yeah it's definitely better now my eyeliner is a little bit crooked as always but I'm on the fence about this like once I bent it on my hand and warmed it up a little bit it did apply a look at it so I'll continue to try this one I really like the way it's like it's just so black and then we have it turn the sky so I might as well just try one on each eye one of them is like a fiber mascara and then the other one is just a lash sensational which is it just the same as this one because this one here is one of my favorite mascara so try the lash sensational one at first maybe it's just like a limited edition packaging let's see which I really like the packaging so this is it the way the wand works I love this mascara so much it's one of my favorite drugstore ones at the moment you guys wouldn't see me use the original lash sensational a million times I make tutorials lately it's very wet cuz it's like brand new so it's a little bit clumpy than normal it's a little bit me say usually it's not this bad I think it's just cuz yeah it's like super fresh that's a bit dry it's a little easier to work with regardless that's just one coat so you can see how nice and long it makes my lashes look super black now let's try out this one here the Gigi Hadid with their true name can't find it looks like this it's just oh here we go with the fiber mascara so let's do the fibers first where is there how you do it have instructions okay so step one apply black mascara stick to apply white fibers and they enter reapply the black got it okay so here's oh here's what the it wand it looks like can be it's the other side like look how it's not as lengthening and it's not as curling but let's see how it goes with the five is I'm just gonna put this on my bottom lashes with no fibers so the five is look like caution three looks like this holy dang oh my god so it's all just immediately fell into my eyeball they're still just sitting in my eyeball yeah so apparently you need to like wipe them all off before you go in let me just put on some mascara on top of this right now so I can like trick them oh my god that hurts so much this is coming from so late so used to having stuff in there I cuz I used to wait contacts so like you know I can get makeup on my eye and kind of not flinch but that just hurt I felt awful this is there's any difference oh my motherhood not with it don't even go there don't care even if you're careful it's not with the rescue I can still feel so many of my eyes I just can't find them and I cannot see them hundred and ten cent not worth it Ashley I love this highlighted I don't know I guess I'm that's been a bold mood today definitely shows up all of you in the fiction so as you can say but me I feel like the alleged sensational is like a little blacker as well I'm just gonna go and with some of this to just kind of Mitch I like saw there are six different colors hit and my little collection is a couple of nerds reads a pinky color a deep purple this one is cold at Torah hey you're doing looks like this it does feel a little bit tacky but it is pretty so this is Torah it's really lovely and pigmented it's got like a see me shine finish and then this one's Nicole which is a beautiful pinky nerd we have Aaron which is like a deep like purplish smoky color we have Lonnie which is a deep rage so you can see a little isn't so creamy I like Maybelline lipstick we have a kick H AI R and that is a brighter light of more orange based red and then the last one we have is Austin which is a super bright bright orange II red color I don't know which color to wear with like this as well there's like a little bit of like a muted written here maybe I'll wear this color hey kid  it how do you pronounce this I'm assuming it's a name I've never come across that one my eye hurts so much I'm taking the matching lip pencil Oh looks so pink okay I'm changing my mind cuz that color was way to rape like pink almost then I go in with Austin and state I really like this lip liner it's so pretty and then I'm going in with the emitting lipstick in Austin it's better it's pretty I just want to compare it to elements for those of you who own my brand so luminance is more matte that's what it looks like I know that straight away Bose launched it the turn of it did very similar I think um this color here is a little bit will mutate what's bleeding a little bit thought so that is the completed look I love the makeup look but there were definitely some hits and misses in this video if you guys have tried this collection let me know what your thoughts are down below and what your favorite products are from the collection I would say I definitely obviously I love the lash sensational but it's just obviously I'd love miss it edition packaging I really like the eyeliner although I need to reapply it because cried half of it out I really like the urge isn't strobe liquid I love it the highlight it in this big pack I just start really like you know I just certain find this convenient it's just huge and there's a few things in here I don't like I love the blush though so I love the blush the highlighter the eye shadow was good the lip balms Everage the concealers average and I do really like this mascara so you guys see ya probably will for like someone just start out with makeup love the lipstick apart from it does bleed a little bit so just be careful with that and surprisingly I did like the eye contour palette I do not write the tinted primer for my skin tone I don't great this little pellet at all I just find it wasn't very pigmented whatsoever the bronze is okay but I mean man and the eyeliner I definitely want to keep trying because I don't know I like I think it's a really nice formula it's just little bit tricky to work with so I think we just need a little bit of practice this lip color makes my teeth look super white which I'm a fan of see that is my first impression and tutorial my accent thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up it's always and I will swatch you guys - we're fine [Music] 
that's strong hey everyone it's so some of you guys may recognize it this wrapping paper and my previous highest rated makeup video it was on a Sephora makeup so today I am at doing nikka makeup if you're not from New Zealand or Australia you may not know but basically Micka is like our version of Sephora it stocks all of those high-end brands like two-faced Urban Decay you know all of them so I went online and I bought all of the top rated makeup to join another one of these videos with and I am going to be doing a lower rated version as well lots of you guys did want to see that in the last video for the Sephora one so in early next year I will be doing Lois treated me curb this is the best sellers this time rather than a top rated I did bestsellers because some of you guys requested that like people did like the way it last time it some people were like oh it's not fair I don't know we'll just try it this way and you guys can tell me what you prefer so I'm on it the maker beauty.com Oh indeed website I'll put a link down below for you I love maker it's one of my favorite brands for like favorite shots I should say it's not really a brand or their they have their and makeup but you know what I mean I haven't literally just like got there from the Germans showered and everything and I'm just like so like scatterbrained I have like this gigantic coffee with me because I'm just like I cannot think I think I've like Wednesday Isis or something okay anyway so I'm excited about the bestseller right now because it is one of my favorites this is the Too Faced hangover replenishing face primer if you've never seen this before you obviously have not been hanging around my channel for very long but this is what the packaging looks like and it's basically just a really moisturizing primer that kind of smells like coconut and I love for it to find this prime is so nice just because it really helps to give my skin a nice hydrated base for my makeup and by the way I have normal to dehydrated skin at the moment it's feeling a wall plus I have a giant blind which is really annoying this seller foundation is another favorite of mine like I feel like a lot of the best sellers on those roads I I love I don't know this might be like the one reason the top rated makeup might be a bitter I guess testing video because for bit sellers like I feel like I've got most of them and enjoy a lot of them whereas the top rated because they're done on user reviews it's a little bit different you know I don't know you guys tell me once again like this is best Ellis last was top rated which do you like better so the top rated foundation or maker born this way foundation by two phase which is definitely a top favorite of mine I actually take this traveling a lot its colors who know about like a fresh-baked head on so like it might be a little bit too tight but we'll just wing it I usually use it with a sponge but today I'm going to use a round face brush because I haven't whipped my sponge and I'm feeling lazy you guys know how it is it is like the worst feeling when you sit down ready to do your makeup you're all ready to go like sit up done and then you realize you have not wet your sponge and you if you get up again it's just the most annoying thing of a first-world problem by the way the shade I'm using is natural beige I love this foundation so much it's definitely one of my favorites because it's got like milk motorable a medium buildable coverage and it just looks so flawless it doesn't it seem to make my dry areas too much and it just I don't know I just we have so well throughout the day there definitely obviously some things in here I haven't tried by the way okay so I think that looks too dark by the way the true face foundation this is New Zealand Dollars so obviously for those of you and the USA you can get all these brains on sephora.com I'll link that down below as well for you guys but for New Zealanders this costs $62 and then Australia will be another different price I'm sure and the primer is 50 dollars I believe concealer one of my favorite beauty products I don't know why but I'm just like such a concealer junkie my drawers full again I need to do a whole nother decluttering series be selling it concealers another one of my I would say like old favorites because I haven't really been using it lately but is the Born This Way concealer by Too Faced and it costs $43 I know RIPD New Zealanders but anyway to be honest I like by the way my shades light to be honest a lot of these products when you buy them from America and get them shipped all the way over and Ford and it really means that they won't miss the same price anyway so that's why do you like to shop personally I've been shopping on make it personally quite a lot lately there's some Christmas shopping on there for my friends as well so this is kind of a recent thing in the last couple of years all of these brands are finally accessible to us New Zealanders because for so long like we couldn't even get brands like Urban Decay or anything like that so I'm just so happy I'm just going to use a dual petal brush under my eyes makes a beauty so the skin seal I really like it because it is nice and hydrating personally I find it very hydrating I just love the way it blends out and sits on my skin it's not like the fullest coverage foundation I mean concealer in it in the world but it really does help to concealers under-eye circles in Brighton like you can say so I'm a fan of this this used to be like my all-time favorite color pop came along and stole the show okay on to something I'm pretty sure I've never tried before so I'm excited for this these are really loud play going over my house it'll literally sound like it's about to crash well you know in the airplanes are so loud so loud you're like is that kind of like just bombed my house right now like I'm really terrified if it's watching Breaking Bad so this is the did I say the Urban Decay Naked skin and medium light neutral look how cute the same comes in this little bag which to beyond myself throw away but it's still cute I can't remember I've tried this before I feel like I've got a vague memory of trying it but maybe not under maybe it was something else this is what the product looks like it comes with Amara sponge you know the product in this cost $65 so I'm gonna go straight and I'm not gonna use the sponge then never use them I'm gonna use my powder brush color looks very nice quite powdery but a mica with that look at that like the difference like it really does like mattify but it doesn't look too heavy and it gives a little bit of coverage you might just use a different pattern to my eyes because it's quite dark like I would say like it looks dark at all then here like it kind of transforms I don't know do you guys see what I mean I feel like my face is way darker they may nickle the sencence using this it's quite okay there you go so if you're buying this I don't know it just seems to apply so much darker like kind of orange I like the way it looks they start like the color I don't know I look orange hey if it's supposed to be a neutral shade don't know how I feel about that for $65 actually just gonna use my well Rhys dude I'm not sure if you can get this off maker you could have a look just because I need some brightness on my eyes cuz I am orange right now like I swear to know oxidize I don't know if it acts and ice but it's just not a great color even oh god Wow okay yeah I'm probably not gonna keep the Urban Decay powder Finn oh I bought this by the way because this was new on the website so let me know if you want a first impression I'm so intrigued I love nice foundations so kind of looking forward to it but first I think I'll do maybe BH Cosmetics first impression and I've got another what does it win wild I think it's like a contouring section on the website but I know contour now has just gone to the bronzer section commit with milk chocolate Soleil so this is the Too Faced milk with chocolate Soleil lights medium matte bronzer I've also got the dark one I almost should use the darker one cuz I'm orange right now but I just don't want to make the orange worse so we're just going to try this color first it is $47 I'm using a medium face brush first just to kind of put it around my face where I want to bronze I love this bronzer it used to be one of my holy grows I haven't actually used it in a while every time I use that I love it definitely agree that this should be a bit seller yeah this is like quite pale on my skin home I'm just going to do a couple of layers to conquer I might just use my shapeshifter palette by urban decay they've been using lately cuz you can get that off mica so they gave me like a subtle bronze look it's really beautiful it smells amazing and then this is the urban decay shapeshifter pellet and just using a bronzer brush so this is not a big seller but I just can't find their contouring section I don't have like any idea what do you this man I really don't like the powder it's literally just like orange on me is anyone else tried out let me know if the same thing happened to you because that color did not look this color in the packaging and I know for a fact it is not the foundation because I use the foundation all the time and this doesn't happen so I'm just really confused okay so we have contoured I look dramatically pale on my I feel like the powder is oxidized even more let me know if you guys agree I just feel like I look orange if even compared to before like not the bronzer just like in general like even look under my nose and stuff where I haven't put any bronzer like it's so dark I'm just gonna have to like set like this so you can't see my body I'd be interested to say like if you guys have experienced oxidization from that powder as well or if it's just reacting badly with perhaps the makeup the foundation I don't know so I'm gonna go straight to my eyebrows now so the top-rated brow products like I mean the big fella came up with this hourglass arch brow sculpting pencil it costs fifty four dollars which okay but I loss is interpreted yeah just have you never tried this before so this is like a definite best impression once again it looks just like the how do i okay so you twist it from the top looks just like the benefit the goof proof this one it's got another cycle it's got a little it's fully on the other in which I always love I love a good spoolie and I bought the shade arch where no that's what it's called Oh ash okay at least my teeth look nice and white with this orange foundation this is my Donald Trump makeup tutorial I love it the benefit version of this so I hope I like this one because it's expensive ativ I like the color it seems to be quite easier to draw on the color is like a gray kind of turn it's going on really nicely but I don't think it's any better than like my benefit or anything like that I'm just going to turn it around and brush through let me know what you guys think of these brows could be it's my normal browser y bydd our same so I'm using like the little triangular tip to kind of draw in little brushstrokes now let's turn it around to get like a little bit more filling action like two on the bottom for some reason this eyebrows is so much easier to fill in it takes like half the amount of time it's so rude and I don't know what's happening with this because this was the best seller when I purchase I literally purchases stuff like two weeks ago if that so it hasn't been long this is being bumped down to the third like brow mascara so I don't know what's happened now I co london sprout gel is the Acela which is actually one of my all-time favorites this is the one that came up when I purchased this is the Bobbi at brown natural brow shaper for $54 I got the shade it's late and it's like a grayish kind of tone I don't know if you guys can like see on here the brush is like semi big it's not too big though but it's not like as small as gimme brow or anything it's still easy to use and the color comes off a really strong like it just made my girls gray hopefully it dries down some products do go on quite huh it's still ugly it's working good dog it's really sticking my hair brow here brows make your brows it feels a little bit wet but nothing uncomfortable let's just let that dry and we'll see how it goes I'm going to prime my eyelids now I'm pretty sure the top-rated basella will be Urban Decay let's guess yep of course it is which is actually not one of my favorites but I'll use it so image canny original primer potion I don't actually know where my original color is like just the clear web but I do have sin and the white one right here these cost $36 I'm going to use sin today I don't hate this like it's definitely not like bad I just have others I'd like a little bit better this is a nice shimmery color as you can see it is beautiful like I can't deny that I just don't find it like up to the hype I don't know do you guys want to see a video where I try like products and see if I think with the high because I could totally do that soon that's pretty okay now let's see what I shows we have here can I get over my orange skin look at that that's not okay even look at the foundation my place just likes watch this foundation color like there is no like that powder though looks so light by itself but on top of that foundation just do not work well okay so I'm going I art I already know the top rated I should appellate this we're just so random my two-faced and then the best-selling this is good a bit weird eye makeup look you guys I her like just I should I'm actually going to use a few of these because I have these too so I'm gonna use the top - like highest rated I actually bought like all of the colors of the Magnificent Mitchell's glitter and glow eyeshadows oh my god I used one the other day in my amethyst look and blew me away like so beautiful I was a big fan of the originals just didn't like how they would dry out so what heaps of colors here I don't know what kind of look I'm gonna go for I'm also gonna use the Urban Decay eyeshadows because I keep them loved them by the way like I love the single eye shows babe okay these hair range from 37 to 38 dollars the stealer and then the Urban Decay single ratios are $34 and then if I show you the top rated eyeshadow palette is the glitter bomb by true face which is this right here this goes for $72 I've tried this once and I was not like a massive fan but we'll try it again cuz yeah literally I tried it once and these are the colors so I guess I'm gonna have to do something with at least you know some kind of color like this I really like that rosy color I need to do something a little bit different though like I've been doing so many pinky look slightly like I've grabbed out a few eyeshadows Urban Decay I've got virgin Secret Service look and then the third one is T's I'm going to start with virgin I'm just using it on a concealer brush cuz why not let me sue me when I start on the stand why it's so Orange I think it's just a powder with the foundation because as I said usually the foundation does not do this on my skin and if I've definitely used it with that primer before so who knows what's happening okay these eyeshadows are beautiful virgin is one of my favorite colors I believe it's in the original makeup palette is it I love on the inner corner but we'll just wait and see what we've done that in a corner before I put anything there so that's that and then I'm just going to go in with tears this is what he's looks like it's just a really nice kind of cool tone neutral color that's perfect for in the crease I'm going to use it on a fluffy a blender brush and oh my god I've got the worst grinding pain right now I got Botox ready in if you've watched my blogs you know hasn't kicked in just yet maybe that's why keep eating you guys I've been really headachy lately I think that's cuz I've been grinding again okay this is gonna be very shimmery because that friggin face I put on I'll have my lid with shimmery I hate it when I have a shimmery crease most of the time sometimes I don't mind it but much the time I'm not here for that I want Matt that was my own fault oh look how beautiful that blends out I love these eyeshadows differently recommend their but I mean it's probably a bit of value for you if you buy an Urban Decay eye palette rather than the singles and then next up I'm taking secret service which is darker and a little bit more warm I'm taking this on a chilly crease brush I'm just applying it in the outer part of the crease out of corner like out of a oh wait look okay so the liquid eyeliner that was obviously top-rated I know what's gonna me hello - it's this headband this was obviously the top-rated liquid eyeliner and look at the color I got I remember thinking I was like I've tried the black I won't spoiler alert it yet but talk about it soon so obviously got a different color try this is amber I'm just gonna swatch on my hand so we know kind of what color scheme to go for it's an orange color by the way the eyebrow gel from Bobbi Brown to dry to nothing so that's good but it's definitely not like my favorite I feel like it's live little clumps can you see that so probably not gonna keep using that one here are some of the colors over these I got and then there's also that like purplish blue one that I used in my emesis tutorial so if you wanna go check it out so which kiloliter might just use like a couple I don't know it let's stop at this one because I'm really I'm this up this is smoldering it's sitting I'm gonna apply it straight to my eye I love these I'm just applying that up to the crease kind of like a beige with some like silver and gold like it's a little bit next like champagne and then I'll probably put that glitter bottom pillow on top of this because I just don't know where else to put it I can't get over how hideous my foundation looks and then I'm going to take the glitter bomb that pellet and I'm actually going to take that that one I'm a short shader brush this is kind of like a grey with pink reflect I don't know if this is gonna look good but I'm gonna kind of put that on the Attic almost half just joining up with that color in the outer corner well it's quite cool I definitely don't write this though like it's just chunky and like I don't know I I'm not a big fan of this palette so if you're wondering if you should buy this I definitely think just like buy some blue school it is if you want something glittery because they're quite chalky I'm just going to run a little bit of this shade underneath my eyes teeth I think I picked up a new pencil eyeliners for the waterline that was a fail I always feel so fancy when I have triple in the brushes in my head I'm like I am orange okay so the top rated eyeliners are the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencils which is $36 have some of them while the business selling liquid eyeliner has now changed to the urban decay razor shop which I have those and if they have $40 and then the one I bought is the Stila stay all day which is $34 so I'm gonna see if I've got the Urban Decay one because I way prefer okay these ones like I just find them so liquidy personally I'm not a huge fan of them like they're like a pin tomorrow I don't see what the hype is about where is the eraser shop if you guys following me you would have seen me talk about them a million times I'm gonna go in with a brown so this shade here is in its snakebite which is such a cool name I'm gonna do is see me thick kind of wing just to make it stand out I've had these eyeliners for ages and they're still going strong and I do actually really like the black one too and I really like the applicator is a nice little brush tip which is my preference using the bit Sela eyeliner I've plenty of days which one should I use looks pretty this is in the shade of mushroom some of them aren't as pigmented as others but overall like I find them quite creamy and pretty and they seem to last a really long time as well I'm gonna take a little bit of veg in on my little concealer brush which is actually a big concealer brush but we're gonna try and put a little bit right on it and I'm cool now to brighten and then we take a little bit of the kitten just on here it's selling mascara is another all-time favorite of mine bitter than 6x2 face $35 I think the $18 is like the sample size this is one of my favorite mascaras if you guys been watching me for a while your props know I just love half thick it makes my lashes I'm a big fan I love the formula - it's so creamy this one's getting a little bit Drydocks I have hit open for quite a while like no much produce coming out on the wand but I still love it let me know if you want me to do a top rated Omega like stuff that you use erase it high because usually those ones work out like those perhaps I haven't actually tried ok I'm gonna use my pen the lashes I think it's so beauty lashes for make such good reviews on these so far thanks guys I've seen your pictures on Instagram oh my god my stomach just made the loudest grumble I hope you couldn't hear it these are the exotic lashes I just pulled one exotic lash out and one pant the last shot so we're not using pet the wheezing exotic because I screwed up there's like eight different friggin lashes in here they're all clean by the way I've just got like speaks of mascara in there because I'm a duty this is why I need to put them back in the boxes I actually have been meaning to I just haven't gotten around to it because I washed all of these in bulk the other day I always find it harder to put lashes on this side of my eye and I don't know why just gonna wait for them to dry a little bit more cuz this glue is still slippery and then I'll pinch them with my natural lashes hello orange face I hate this powder I hate it so much I love in decay but you guys have a like pinch your eyelid doing this because I have and it is the worst okay moving along lips do you flush did I didn't buy a blush do I already own the top-rated blush okay yeah I already on the top rate of blush the top rate of blush is the nas blushes which I have so many different ones I literally I think got like 20 of them so that forty seven dollars which in my opinion is not a bad price because the quality is 10 out of 10 I mean we might as well stitch off the orange even more with some orange blush like why don't Sophia is actually a beautiful color not joking this is Gina detail fiber brush cuz I don't want to put on too much I'm just gonna apply a little bit of that on my cheeks love this color look at that I'm sorry I'm just I'm not mad I'm just disappointed and then the highlighter I actually bought this ages ago so I kind of laughed when it came up it's like the top rated highlighter $54 this is the Urban Decay Naked illuminated shimmering body powder and face powder shimmering that basically goes away the reason I don't love this but it's the highest I mean bestseller so it's what we're using I got the shade aura I could not remember what shade I bought years ago or whenever it came out I can't remember it was a while ago one reason I do not like this is because the packaging is so bulky it doesn't like fit nicely and my storage it's gonna brush like I just wish they'd completely get rid of this everyone's got their own brushes you know this is the color orange again yay and it's just so clear they even like when you go like this you can hear the grit it's so like I don't know why people like this it's blitter and things such a hater I'm sorry I needed to calm down and stop being so sassy so this is how it looks I mean it looks pretty right but just close-up there's so much glitter and I'm just not a fan of it it's kind of like a joy chrome like the cars a shoe really pretty let me take that back I really like this color but I still don't like the formula and it really accentuates everything I just don't think it's worth the money either like it's expensive so the lipstick I bought is this melted long-wear liquefied lipstick which I have tried these before you know what do I buy the wrong one was this free I think this was free because the one next coming up is the best seller I wasn't a huge fan of this I did try this in like a mini Instagram tutorial it's not Ashley up yet but it'll be up at some stage $33.00 by Too Faced it's the high shine liquid lipsticks which is just like a gloss and I just find them so heavy and sticky about I'll use it I'll show you what it looks like and then let's look at the lip liner okay what are you for Steven glide on lip pencil it by owns hey is the lip liner which I really like them they go for 36 bullets okay honestly I just went through my drawer and cannot seem to find them I don't know if I've already put them in my donation pile the new ones obviously excited to get sent like the whole range or like if I just can't find him so the next piece Ella I'm not lying like just because I don't want to use it I genuinely can't find it so I'm gonna use the Urban Decay vice lipsticks I have quite a few there's a hundred and ten shades to choose from thirty one dollars a pop which for New Zealand standards is not bad at all especially for like high-end of course okay so I scraped one of the first lip liners I thought might work then I have this is nineteen ninety three opened okay this is the top rated best seller by the way keep you in mind I'm not sure if this sellers are the same across New Zealand Australia websites I'm going off the New Zealand website I love these lip liners I've never actually used the shade they're creamy they stay put they are a bit pricey but I like them and then at the neck head which is a cream it finish open decay it's not very naked looking you think naked would be like a nude but it's kind of like a pink I do like these lipsticks they're nice I don't reach for them a lot but they definitely nice and that is a really pretty color so I've tried to blend it up with the lip liner a little bit and then it's eating spray all-night sitting spray by overlay which is one of my favorites I love the eye makeup my favourite products would definitely have to be like the little stealer products pretty much loved most things my biggest disappointment would definitely be a highlighter the glitter bomb pellet and the urban decay powder and I also wasn't a huge fan of the bra mascara just because of how it kind of went a little bit pitchy and my eyebrows once it dried it like looked really weird and dark so I definitely don't think I'll be reusing any of these products so i will donate these you know what you think i will definitely be revisiting and this i makeup look I'm like so happy with this eye makeup I think with a different face though so in my creases and so shimmery it look a little bit nicer but anyways if you enjoyed this makeup look please give me a thumbs up I would really appreciate it and I will toast you guys on my next video [Music] 
hello everyone it's a miserable rainy day outside Perth so I thought today I would do a tidy up declutter organization etc video if you guys like this video don't forget to thumbs up cuz I can definitely do some more as you can see there is everywhere so what I'm a first winter is literally just organized everything it's like categories and then I'm gonna go through it D claudus figure out why I'm keeping what I'm donating what I need to throw away Exeter etc some of this is makeup some of its like haircare 10 like this all sorts of stuff here some of its brand new from packages from unboxings I've done on my channel I'll link my previous unboxing it down below and then and some of its just my makeup that I've orange for ages that I have been traveling with dumped out of my travel makeup bag to repack etcetera etcetera so there is just so much stuff all over the show we're just gonna go through it all take it all out to sort it out put it away hopefully this video is interesting also god dammit recycling and everything so I've got a recycling bin over in that direction and then I have this nice big box head fit stuff to donate so hopefully we can fill this up somewhat as well it also put stuff in here for giveaways for you guys as well I haven't done a giveaway in a while I need to my apologies I've been actually meaning to do it there life is just been you know eventful lately so all of these can be donated they're all the wrong colour for May they've got the colour pot no filter concealers actually what am i doing I'm supposed to just be organizing everything alright let's do this it's like rubbish everywhere as well I am such a mess okay so I know it kind of looks like I have it just randomly touch things everywhere but there is kind of like a reason I've put stuff in certain places so this general area has lips I've got some I show palettes brushes over there concealers brow products random bits there some cheek products like highlighters bronzers blushes over here primers foundations etc here some eye primers we've got some powders down here we've got some eyeliners and mascaras here some single eye shadows and like glitters and stuff down here and this box are a bunch of liquid lipsticks as well which I'll need to go through my entire disc is covered in makeup as well so if you guys enjoy this video let me know and I'll do some more as I clean up the rest of my room this is literally just the stuff that's been on the ground I know that it sounds so like disrespectful to my makeup that sounds kind of funny yeah it always just kind of happens I do not have enough space to do what I do I am constantly pulling you makeup out of my drawers and doing it so quickly and filming so much and traveling so much that I never put stuff away as I go cuz I'm just lazy and it takes ages so all the makeups like in good condition everything it's all safe it's just Missy and it's in like huge piles and I can't find anything so it's time to put it away in its rightful place okay so I'm just gonna go through all of the stuff section by section I guess um you know divide it all up into piles of stuff I need to put away my drawers and this stuff I am donating getting rid of decluttering or whatever the deal is so starting with some powders here we have the smooth operator Amazonian clay finishing powder I'm going to donate this because I really like the new Too Faced translucent powder so I don't really need like multiples of transverse and loose powder when I already have some of my drawer as well so this is going to go in the donate box and then same thing I've already got heaps of loose powder so I will donate these two as well these are the pixi by petra quick fix powders i have my cover effects pressed powder i think i'm just going to get rid of this one a joking i am such an idiot okay definitely getting rid of that now i'm just going to carefully pick up these pieces of frigging powder good one sham as I was saying I think it's time to put this in an empties video because that's falling truly used I have my summer bisque beer minerals concealer like powder concealer definitely keeping this it's a favorite and then I have three Studio Fix Patties these are one of my favorite pressed powders to use I've got C 30 C 3 C 2 I might put this in my empties pile as well to talk about in an empties video cuz I'm really like fussy when my powders get like this with this just like a small wringer on the outside I just hate it because you can't yell like an even coat on your brush so you get rid of that this one's still nice and full and then this one here is also pretty full I have hit pan but I'll keep those we'll jump to some eye products just here so this mascara here was in my travel makeup

oh and up here why is that mascara smudging today hello my favorite people today I am doing a very highly requested video so you know the other day I uploaded my first impression on at the Witten wild of photo focus Foundation and I said how I think it's like a really good trip for the YSL foundation which is one of my all-time favorites so today I'm going to actually be comparing it the two and a half face to toriel we're not tutorial like first impression I guess and I'll also swatch all the shades I have on me so you can see what they look like I've only got like a small amount of fake tan on right now so I might have to you're like custom mix it colored to make it look really good I just want to show you like how they compare and then we will do a weird test and see if they last like the same amount of time or if one's better than the other and yeah that's pretty much it so before I prime I'm just going to swatch h1 here so the fusion ink foundation by YSL I feel like it might be discontinued in some countries and then it's still around and others because you can still get this from 5 minutes if you live in New Zealand that's where I heard you buy one so I wanted to get a lighter shade and it was ridiculously expensive but for me it was worth it because I really love this stuff and it lasts forever like I've used it some of these two absolute death and they're still like quite a lot less so for me you know I could justify the price so on a farm is this foundation is 101 New Zealand Dollars and then you can also get the wet and wild a photo focused foundation from finest for $12 $99 or something like that so $12.99 New Zealand Dollars versus 101 New Zealand Dollars like that is an extreme difference you could buy like nine or something instead of one of these not like you need nine but anyway so I'm just gonna swatch each one up on it my skin and you can see what the colors look like so this is a firstly wet and wild this is in the shade soft ivory make sure you shake this one more up - I really like this in my first impressions some of you guys said the same thing as me like it was amazing and then some of you said it did not work for you so make sure you check out my first impression and look up other reviews of course this shade here is bronze beige the darker one these have such good undertones as well I'll link my first impression to both of these foundations down below and pretty sure I've got one on the - and then I have three shades of the fusion ink foundation by YSL as you can see they've got very similar applicators so the shade here is the 10 next is B 30 as you can see those colors are very similar as well like this one's probably a hint darker in the wife's a version and then at the last one I have here is B D 40 so both of these shades are definitely ones I use when I'm faked and this one here actually looks more similar to the wind wild shade look how like some all of those under strands are as well it's one thing I love about this YSL foundation is the Antron is so beautiful like it just matches really lovely even if it's like a little bit light or a little bit dark that I'm just one is just so perfect that I can easily make it work so those are all the shades i'll also write them and order down below i'm just in case you're interested if you have a similar skin tone to me all I think it's gonna be similar to one of these shades I don't know I just thought it would be helpful maybe so fullest first impressions obviously going to be first impression is not really a first impression but it's obviously going to be a little bit different than normal I am going to prime my entire face because I already know that I like both of these foundations better with a piranha today I'm going to use my J what jelly peck primer I've already moisturized my skin like after I got out of the shell is you can see my hair is dry and currently hits the hair towel but I'm just applying this jae-won jelly pick all over this is quite a sticky primer which works well with these formulas because they're so watery it really helps them to kind of stick in place and really yeah just adhere to your face rather they move around and got a streak here okay we're all that primed and ready to go so I'm going to first go in to maybe the side of my face with the YSL and then at the side of my face with the wet and wild so I might have to mix a couple of shades together I'm starting with BD 40 and I like to layer this foundation so usually do two coats because it's quite buildable but this foundation I use sponges brushes just like whatever they all seem to work just as well as each other so this is a flat face brush by EXO beauty and I just like to kind of stipple it first and then connect blend this color actually looks not bad with my half-baked head skin I think I'm slightly got a bit of a natural tan underneath my fake tan at the moment summer here in New Zealand so I'm not as pale as I'm still pale but you know not a spell is not this foundation you can often kind of say my frickles and everything through I still love the way it looks like actually I don't even think I need another layer like look at that it's so beautiful this foundation so easy to blame I mean it really does last well of me normally hopefully it does today as well soon find out anyway when I do my updates later sometimes it's it's a little bit funny on my nose so I usually have to like put a little bit of concealer over it but other than that I just love the way it looks it's so velvety smooth and it looks so natural even though the coverage is really good it doesn't look like I'm wearing a really heavy cakey base I even got my friend instace who like doesn't really wear makeup because she just wanted something natural they should just check home with their fingers they don't really worry about it because it's so lightweight in fuss-free you know so now let's compare it to bronze beige by why I mean when one came out tongue-tied like why is that wet and wild like it kind of I don't know I'm just donated so a little stick and then I'm just going to wipe off my brush and use the same brush and I apply it the exact same way so the weight a wild foundation I've been using a lot lately since I did that first impression or probably well I don't even know how many times I've used it but been using it just in my day to day life and I really like it the shades definitely a little bit darker isn't it I have to put a little bit of the pale when on so it would look like completely different on both sides of my face look at that look it's so stunning I definitely recommend a primer with this foundation it seems to like go on nicer and not gostrey here you can't make it work without one if you don't like primer this one seems to sit decently on my nose but sometimes like depends how exfoliated my face is sometimes I still need to kind of sit it down with a bit of concealer to stop it from looking crap so I'm just going to go in with a little bit more product but just so you can see like the coverage with one pass it's still amazing obviously it's gonna add more coverage since I have to use a bit more product just to lighten it up but you can see how each side looks very similar actually before I lighten it up let me just zoom you in so you can see the texture so here's the Weiss outside like it still looks like skin it's so beautiful and then the wit mild side which is just as beautiful like I think it's so good for the price it's a really good job so just using some of the shade in that soft ivory to lighten this side up a little bit because it looks like quite dramatically different like both sides of my face right now okay now we are looking a little bit more even side to side and it's kind of interesting just so you can see how buildable it is like look how full coverage that is now I almost feel like I should add a little bit more on the other side just to make it look even because the sides like less coverage now so I want it to be a fair review so we'll do one more layer of it the way itself so it's completely fair okay so now I'm going to go do my concealer and powder and stuff off-camera and I'll pop back just so you can see how it looks finished and then we will see how it goes throughout the day twelve seconds later okay I'm back so I've set my foundation and see under my eyes I'm actually using it different powder today so this looks a little bit different to how I would normally wear it normally I use a matte powder but today I'm trying out some Witwicky let's make up in a different video what she'll say soon and this is like a diamond powder it's got like a little bit of shimmer through it so it's a little bit shimmery but I mean it's still gonna show us how the foundation is going to last throughout the day and you can kind of get an idea of how it looks so now the battle is on we'll see which side looks the best by the end of the day so before I head off like obviously I'll show you how this looks by the end of the day and we'll see which side looks better by the end of the day I just want to compare each product so you know what you're getting so with the win while you get 30ml which is one fluid ounce it is cruelty free and then the YSL you're getting at 25 mil which is 0.8 for fluid ounce so you actually get more with the YSL one I feel like each side of your face you're using a very similar you know a matter product between different brands so it's not like you have to use way more of this one then this one like it's very similar the actual packaging obviously the way I was always gonna be a little bit nicer this is in a glass bottle with a plastic lid it's a little bit of tequila Dyke it feels quite like plasticy but why is someone I don't really necessarily love the way look it works you kind of pull it off and then you have to unscrew it and then you have your little dip stick thing the wet and wild one you just unscrew and then you have your little stick the stick on the white sell one is definitely quite a lot larger I usually think I prefer the YSL stick it's a little bit easier to use and get more of an even at distribution of product across your face rather than this one it's like a little pointy thing and it kind of doesn't really meta but this one's just easier also even though the Whitmore one doesn't look as impressive as the way cell it's a lot smaller to chuck in your triple makeup bag or whatever like the way someone's differently a lot large n takes up more room the whitmark was definitely heavier than the away cell if they're Medus to you so it is currently 11 a.m. I will come and talk to you guys later on I'll show you how it wears throughout the day and we'll see which side wins regardless seriously these are such good troops the finish is like almost identical three hours later hey guys so it's only been about three hours Bethel I would show you an update real quick I just did a lip swatch video so I've actually got like cakey concealer right around my lip line so ignore that but you can see it the rest of my makeup this is the YSL side and the witam wild side so both sides are looking amazing and a very similar as well like the texture of my skin the way it's sitting on my face it looks almost identical on both sides hey guys so my foundation has smudged a little bit everyone on my foundation my mascara under my eye but we'll just pretend like that it's not happening or end up here why is my mascara smudging today anyway I'm about to go to the gym so you know it's gonna put this to the test I don't normally wear this to the gym so I don't really know how it's gonna perform so I thought I'd better come on now just so you can see how they're both wearing they were both very amazing as I already know like I love both of these foundations but as you can see like they still look identical they're still amazing droops for each other so I will just come back in a bit and I'll let you guys know how it is after the gym before I go to bed and stuff to be honest once they get back from the gym and walk the dogs and everything I'll probably be ready to shower it off no matter what time it is but anyway I'll see you soon thousand years later hey guys so this is where I'm gonna in the video it's 8:30 got back from the chair made some dinner there's a pimple oh my gosh so painful it's like raging right now look at that and you go take off my makeup so this is where I'm ending it the video as you can see like look how amazing that looks didn't have like an uber sweetie of workout session today because I decide not to do cardio I just did like just weight training today which still made me sweet but not as much as if I am going him on the elliptical list so keep that in mind I don't know how it lasts through it like hard out switching but it still lasted through a little bit of sweating it's a little bit faded like in my mustache area where I sweat the most but I mean it still looks okay this foundation is amazing I love it is the wire Sal and there's the wind wild you could even argue that the wet and wild lasted a little bit bitter who do you guys think let me know what you thought of this video and let me know if you want more videos like this whenever I think I found jubes if you've not tried it yeah I definitely suggest giving it a go I guess if it doesn't end up working out for you at least it's only like what five to twelve dollars depending where you live it's not too bad but of course just check some reviews on Google check the comments in my previous Witten wild first impression cuz heaps of people wrote reviews on there thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up let me know what you want to see for my next videos because I will be pre filming in the next couple of weeks because I am off to well I'm off to the Maldives first and then I go off to Fiji after that so I'm pre filming a few videos let me know what you want to see and I'll talk to you guys soon you 
everyone so today I am doing a first impression on the taut clay sticks foundation I hold this recently in a giant PR unboxing all the link it down below if you want to watch it I on both spoke Sergey parcels and it was a huge and it's a long video so if you feel like sitting down and watching something yeah check out the link down below yeah I got sent this giant like book for foundations which are these they asked you guys if you wanted me to do a first impression and what's pieces yes sir so this video is this so first I'm going to prime half my face it away and what this will do is just allow us to see if there is any difference with the application longevity you know the drill I'm going to use this today because this is first time I grabbed this is the master prime that by Maybelline blur and smooth which happens to be one of my favorite primer is I'm just going to take a bit of this on a one those I forgot to tie back my hair on one side of my face but my finisher looks quite nice on my cheeks very smooth but these are not the business so hopefully this foundation has nice coverage of the acne I have moisturize this morning but my skin still feels so dehydrated so that has been tight for the day normal to dehydrated so it's quick and concentrated on the go or you know it makes you full coverage we mean so full coverage good multitasking can feel correct contour cover killed broken hearts good fear it's got no bad stuff and that well-balanced Amazonian clay is a skin that balancing at powerhouse and knows how to smooth meta fire or hydrate depending on your skin type so that's perfect for me today because I need a little bit of hydration and also a little smoothing won't hurt because it's Mexicans a little bit league congested here's what's inside two and one liquid to powder formula micro encapsulation powders burst with body heat to absorb excess oil weird time release pigments keep skin balanced comfortable cake free and flawless 12-hour Powell to set up you can skip your Cal today good cousin Andy Denis so first press start with this I'll just show you the packaging take it seems really nice it's just a gold and brown it's got this like a wooden a little cap on the top which is kind of random but it's cute and then on the bottom you've got your shade name you get 9:00 at grams the product made in the USA and I believe it is peer free so that's the next time as well I'm just going to grab some colors that sound like they're going to be okay medium neutral it looks pretty good kind of orange you may be next up we have medium sand or this looks nice that's better already medium at beige which that also looks really good it's like that first ones a lot more orange on my skin tone and then we have light medium neutral which this would be a really good color for me when I've got a little bit less they panel might be a little medium beige today let's try to shade oh I've got the brush that they sent me to use with this it's just like an angled kabuki brush though use this today this is how it looks and if you have already got an angle to bigger brush or just compare it oh this is dirty it is kind of embarrassing but that's how they look next to each other just in case you're wondering if you should have missed if you've really got some kind of angled brush they're very similar at the top when it's just a little bit shorter so with the same size it's just shorter and a density feels the same to be honest I'll put the cost to these that down below alright let's get down to business as don't lay around what is that I'm stressed out the unprimed side I'm gonna do a few dots or stripes and then using this brush here I'm just going to start blending feels really soft and smooth it reminds me of Steve Makeup Forever HD foundation like texture of it really easy to blend obviously I'm definitely going to need more than that because that just give me like a tint of color but it hasn't really tough it anything that's try this forehead bit yeah the moment that's like a very light coverage it feels really nice to blame this very effortless like I feel like you could even use your fingers if you wanted to it feels really lightweight I can't even feel it on my skin that you also can barely see it so I mean let's try building it up a little okay round two I'm going to do three on my cheek a little bit on my nose and another one on musclehead I'm just going to like pet in a little bit more this time and see if this helps just brushes like stabbing me okay now we're getting somewhere maybe it was the way I was swiping it the first time maybe I need to dab the dabbing just do better you know the color is really good for my feet 10 is borderline slightly orange on me but I mean I definitely think I can get away with it with the c10 and of course you can highlight and contour with this but I'm not going to do that today try that in a different video so I end up liking it I just want to try it like for foundations for this video I don't want to get confused and carried away so on the at Nanak prime side it blends out flawlessly it actually looks really beautiful it glides straight over all of my paws down here let you came and see them and over this giant breakout is consumed it really well that you can still see if there is a huge breakout like it's done very very well for itself very proud to look so smooth it looks super smooth the texture just looks airbrushed I'm really impressed so far so let's try it on the prime side now to do three again one on my nose and a little my forehead and then dab it up honestly I actually do think that working in two layers works better because just doing one way I like this like it's still sharing out and not super full coverage and a little bit patchy so I'm just going to like buff it out a little bit like I did the last time like how you strokes instead of giving and they'll go over with another layer and jab it in to get a higher coverage because yeah it's looking very patchy I don't think it's the primer I just think it's the application so do a little bit of like swiping blending buff it in a little and then build up the coverage a little on any areas we need it it's definitely applying nicely on top of the primer like it's easy to blend out and everything and it still looks beautiful like the finish the way it just glides over my pores and problem areas and everything it looks really nice so just going to do a couple more Deb's feel like this would look really good if you used a sponge as well like I blend out really nice the way I applied it on the side my face works so much better than what I tried to do on the side oh it feels really soft to the touch too I would call this a medium buildable coverage I wouldn't just say it's like full coverage you can get a full coverage but this was one pass like to me it's not a full coverage personally even now you can still see that my pinks or third time like you and on my nose that you can still see a few of my freckles let's do one more little co2 room so I think quite a lot of products the finish is so nice so I don't know how I feel yet they can see one of my eyes let's light neutral by Urban Decay just going to attempt to use the same brush this brush is like kind of getting very spiky on my face like it's kind of stabby honestly I feel like it looks better on the young prime side so just looks like a white patch here I think it's the way I tried to apply it like I dabbed it straight away or just like set the product in and then stuck it to the primer and when Picchi and I don't know really because I did the first layer on the side by buffing that like gave it a nice even layer even though it's very light coverage and then I kind of built up on top of it and I just worked better some reason the side not so much so that's how I would probably use it in the future you buff it all over my face and then just build coverage where I need it it worked a lot faster and use less product as well okay now just going quickly to analyze the summer bisque then for my powder today I'm going to use this one here this is a warm light or a 7 by bare minerals the bare Pro powder and I'm really loving it the finish this foundation is giving me one says see it with a bit of powder this pimple is definitely showing it a little bit still but it looks a lot better than it to the beginning when I do make a bottom look so good it didn't grip on to any of the powder like it doesn't look cakey or really I can see it's kind of gripping onto the super flaky skin just up here if you can see so we'll keep an eye on that throughout the day but um yeah I'm going to continue now to do my makeup and I'll come back later and let you know what I think of it it's the day comes on currently km so I'll see you soon hey guys quick update so is now child 30 so it's been a couple of hours and this is how the makeups looking it's very good so far parts imitate there is definitely gripping onto dry skin around my chin which I'm bummed about because it said that you know it's hydrating and whatever but it's still making my skin look really flaky still looks like really full-coverage it's beautiful but you would hope so some sort of being like 12 hours it has an emphasized any pores on either side of my face there's no creasing or anything like that so I will commit a few more hours and update you then hopefully it continues looking good it looks good right now hey guys quick update so here's how my skin is clean now it is now at 3 p.m. just about to race nothing at my nails fixed so it hasn't really changed at all it has not faded which is good has it seemed to grasp onto any more dry skin at this point so I'll have to keep an eye on it I do have to say looks a little bit dry and cakey around my nostrils I have a melted like it normally does normally foundations like melt around my nostrils for some reason but this one kind of going all crazy and cakey looking I don't know if you guys with and be able to see what I'm talking about I also look a little bit shiny on my forehead which is interesting because it's not hot today and I don't get really like pretty much ever so I'll keep it on there also yeah it still looks really good and I feel like especially if I could use a bit of a sitting spray looks by the way I just added another layer of 810 if you wondering why all of a sudden my body is a lot darker oh come back and update you again very soon hopefully it holds out because I really liked wet lips so it had been a little bit run my mouth with it probably from me changing my lip color TBH hey guys at the end of the day now I wouldn't got my nails done and then I got home at like 5:30 and then I went straight to my grandparents for dinner and then I really it just got back so I would have normally done an extra little check back between this time unfortunately this will be the last one at the end of the night and is now at 9:30 now the good thing is it's initially it changed that much since my last update which was that what was it like 3:30 I think it was 9:30 how long is it it's like 11 and a half hours so it still net perfect coverage and whatever for 12 hours and this is how it looks pretty much after 12 hours nearly so as you can see I'm really impressed cuz it barely faded like especially the side at the side it looks perfect the unprimed side actually looks better so there you go the only thing I'd like to say is that it definitely climb onto some dry areas I'll zoom you in can you see this like it looks dry and chunky over my dry skin where I break out all down here and I've got a bit of lipstick just yeah stick is not doing this I just ate like 20 pounds of ice cream my makeup is failing right now you've got free mascara going everywhere but let's just pretend that's not happening other than that like the coverage is still really really nice and its really smooth it's just around the nostril and the chin or a little bit dodgy kind of wiped off half of the examination on my nose I did have to blow my nose a few times I've got like really bad hope is some reason it does this you look a little bit oily on my nose and just in here or my forehead you see I'm just like kick some powder I feel like I'm a war there and the way I apply it on the Simon face no primer and just used it some with setting spray it would look even better it's going to take a little bit of powder yes it just needed a little bit more fine it's weird like I don't usually get oily like I say but some reason I did a little bit with this product which it specifically said that it would tame oil and hydrate your skin and yet my dry skin is very dry still and they my skin got oily which is really strange I don't know I think if you have like normal skin this could be really good I don't know how it would be on super oily skin like I don't know I don't have super oily skin but on me it got a little Willy look how good it looks after I just Metta fighters a little bit looks like brand new like it's a little bit tighter than certain areas maybe where I've like touched my face and then around my mouth where I've removed my lipstick and Asian and stuff but I'm just ruling precise this time especially hasn't faded at all that's really good in my book so do I like it I do like it it's not my favorite foundation but I definitely think I will continue to use this because it is really fast in easy to use and it does look really nice and it's really lightweight like I don't always do this but it didn't really feel like guys wearing a lot of makeup throughout the day that wasn't super cute and feel cakey is quite lightweight and those nice to wear so I'll continue to experiment with it if you guys have tried this even know what using it down below and comment question of the day let me know what your favorite foundation at the moment is I'd love to know and I need to find some new foundation as well to do some more first impressions I do have like three or four that I need to do a first impressions on but you know me I love doing these videos so thinking of is anything you've got your eye on yeah if you enjoyed this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and we'll talk to you guys in my next year [Music] 
hey guys so as soon as I received it the new color Bible color and you I had to tutorial I'm like it freaking upset with that top pinky color oh my god like what it's so freaking pretty it's like pink and gold I just wanted to do a church area tree with me using the palette I'm still obsessed with it I didn't actually get my hands on the original one that this is a new one it's bigger it's got the most beautiful colors so I'm really really excited a video if you could not tell already and I thought I would keep in theme with my little like cocktail thing I'm doing at the moment I've wanted to do something based on champagne so it is like visit cocktails here the blushing bride and that's like peach snaps and champagne which is kind of like the whole pinky peachy vibe and the golden vibe national this bottle of champagne like it's so bit beautiful and then there was some moet as well look at the colors I just feel like I don't know need to be pink lemonade champagne like just the color themes these drinks I'm like yeah okay let's do this this is going to be a very pinky golden pretty look so I chose my browsing in shade CH do my eyebrows by the way my foundation is already done that because I'm doing a 15-percent do my gosh I can't even say my marriage so far away I love the stuff I'm just going to use my billion dollar brows concealer because I accidentally screwed up the cyber I was so much thicker than the other one I'm sonic gimme brow and shade at three okay the brows I'm having a weird eyebrow so today's some reason they don't look the same as they normally do I'm going to use the Smashbox lid primer Cynthia white one all over mileage so this base is the way but it's not super opaque way just kind of helps to make the colors on top pop a little if you want something like super opaque and white you need to use next jumbo eye pencil in milk that is the best but I really like this formula just for like a casual easy to work with kind of thing okay pink champagne we are going to start with just color just here and that is going to be our crease color by the way this is a creases blender brush I'll do make favor I brush at the moment it's so easy to use I'm going right into the inner corner so this lecture is going to be variable index I want to be quite like a romantic to go with the vibes of like champagne you know I'll just be like flirty and romantic so everything is going to be soon as the blenders and now next thing together this color and this color okay going right on top in the clues it's got that going to pinky tone to it just really building up that color I'm also going to run those colors underneath quite heavy but again is very blended now I'm taking a fluffy of blender brush and going to buff out the edges on the outer edge now I'm going to take this color right down end on that crease blending brush again but I'm going to use a tiny tiny amount and it's going to go like on the cutter part of my crease this is out of half I would say and blend it down there do these eyeshadows are a dream I love BH Cosmetics all so there you go if you're engaged cosmetics purchasing my palette the cutters as well okay because it's legit I'm sure you guys probably already own the Carli bybel color I know it's one of the most popular colors on a BH Cosmetics which is why I'm kind of like why do I neither owned this before I just realize I've got next creasing and my eyes with those okay so we're looking at beautiful so far but now we need to add in our touches of the gold and pink and make this pink champagne because this so far is very pinky purpley we don't want too much purple man knock it back a bit so first I'm going to start with that beautiful color that is this with and I'm going to use a neck 283 brush the sucks it looks really cool it's like quite unique and I'm going to pickle oh I'm a trauma center this brochure is probably not the best thing to use with this formula because it's not super dense but anyway you get the idea look at that color this color though Oh Megan is now I'm taking this pink color to make the look way more pink I think this is actually a highlighter I'm using on my eye shadow brush and applying that right in here and also on my inner corner it's so pretty and then on top of my tech when I'm using at this color here which is like a white gold kind of color just really makes it pop oh there's so pigmented you guys on my brow bone I'm going to use the shade just here and then I'm going to use a little bit white gold commission recolor right on top we need a little more gold so I'm going to take this color just here just using the same brush by the way and I'm going to pick that just like in between these two colors that's nice just adding a little bit of warmth and a little bit just here just chucking colors on and then on the Attic when I'm going to take at this color to tear when you use a firm at blender brush actually I might mix it with that too so there we have it the eye makeup super shimmering and pretty and love that these colors are so pretty I'm going to add a little bit like pink without the top row just underneath in the middle of my eye okay before I do it all of my eyeliner and everything I just want to work on my face a little definitely going to do eyeliner I think I'm gonna do like rose gold in each heart rose gold ones and substitutes with how it looks I really need to try it out on my eyes so for the eyes they turned out a little bit darker than I was envisioning I guess because obviously this is like a pink champagne look which is very light and bright and bubbly so make it the rest of the face very light and bright obviously I'm Savannah bronze in hot water and they make the lips the blush the highlight and everything so first I'll contour using my tastic / blue pro glow and a domed contour brush so setting outside this and like take lenses for a walk it's so beautiful I know to be cold so you hate that so misleading by the way don't - like city is hit hot here tie what I'm ponytail extinction thing I'm wearing I know it just not match but whatever like cut off the top of my head you can't really tell such a sorry I'm not actually going to bronze I'll just keep it with the contouring so might splash got the swims I might be a little bit too peach this one's better Trimble by Illamasqua going to use a sheer powder brush to build it up I don't want to put on too much at once because it could look terrible things stuck my baby years so I've been smoother there and then of course to highlight I'll use something out of the Holly Bible palette and I'm going to start with this pinky one and then I add a little bit the light pink I'm going to use a shim at fan brush this pink highlighter so it creates got like gold for a bit good that it's a perfect color there are very shimmering intense highlighters so if you like that you'll love this I'm going to use a little bit lighter thing just on top yeah I'm going to wait five down my eye makeup till I do my lips so that let's do it so the eyeliner I was talking about my ties this one at Isis Pro a little liner and rose gold it looks so pretty so I feel like this was perfect it's like pinky and golden look how pretty that is so you have like blended all those colors on the letters which it looks like a nice gradient of color light is no harsh lines or anything as I've liked rotate my head you can see those pinks and golds and it's just so pretty and then let the little glitter on just for fun the glitter is on it the other end it's good for it like on the middle the glitter link doesn't even show up what is this the other side's amazing that this slightly doesn't do anything and whatever I'm going to use some but lower lashes today these are for beauty understated and then on the top I'm going to use to go next door but first of course I need mess I'm going to use roller lash today by benefit but why is it one I live so long pieces so to balance out the fact that everything on my face right now is super soft apart my eyebrows I'm going to do dramatic dark lashes that the lashes I'm using on top is still short ash gathering natural lashes so it's not all too over-the-top but it's super least a bit electro matter here so there isn't my lashes before falsies unless you're just going to add a little more volume so hopefully you can see the difference this is so much thicker so it's just like thickening up those lashes they're also really good lashes if you have like no natural lashes really short natural lashes really straight natural lashes or not much lid space like how to dye and stuff like that and now I'm just using a little black track my tight line just to just to cover up out really light sister actually know why I put that on my waterline - it's quite like that super black liner look for matte lips today I'm going to use the benefit they're real double the lip in lust eros which is one of my favorite ones so like that's not pale enough so I'm going to prom some that stand that by OCC okay this is way too bright okay I found this color here called pouch by Smashbox I'm thinking this is still too pink it almost needs to be a little bit peachy and maybe is through the goal eight days I chose my can't side what look colors with okay this one here is Brigitte by Laura Mercier quite sure is probably a bit of pink books now if I go in with legally pink they cheat you just to brighten it a little bit that it she looks bigger and realized it doesn't do your some reason so we are finished it would be a pink champagne kind of look a little bit of gold a little bit of rose gold the Pink's if you have the Carli bybel palette make sure you give it a go send me a picture I would love to see it give me a set on like Twitter or Instagram you can tweet me yeah I love the palette Kali did amazing as a way here's a close up a bit the eye makeup and the lips and this makeup look is so fresh so radiant so glowy so quite wearable I think and if you didn't like the bright pink lip you could always just do note or something like that whatever you feel comfortable with it totally up to you if you enjoyed this look please give me a thumbs up I will touch you again at very sir bye [Music] 
hello everyone so first of all I just want to start off this video by saying yeah I am very orange today I know I just did the top rated and make a video I'll link it down below if you missed it and it oxidized like hick but it's okay cuz I'm gonna be removing my makeup in this video basically I decided to hop on the wish bandwagon I've gotten so many requests to review stuff off wish now if you didn't know what wish was I thought it was like super scare me where's my phone like I don't know too much about it I kind of just Dovan but as far as I can tell it is pretty much an app or website of course not I just got the app you can sit in the middle right there you go on here and I've just got like all this really cheap stuff so I think it's pretty much like Aliexpress eBay that kind of thing and it's one of those websites we buy stuff and sometimes it's just like a terrible disaster other times you buy stuff and it's like Hello bargain amazing cheap great so I thought I would buy five different products on this website and try it out for you to see if they are gimmicky or really really good I've still got some stuff on the way so I'm gonna do another video but pretty much what I got is a breeding system for your face I'll go through each one separately and tell you how much each one cost and everything this is kind of gross but I'm kind of excited about it this is like an S well like to get your earwax out this gives me a lot but we're gonna try it this is a feet mask and then I also got these hair curlers which came like this and then I also got a face mask little applicator so we're gonna try all of these things I'll let you know what's good and what's not I'm just going to print this product first so I couldn't read this I went on the wish app to see what I actually had to do with it because I can't read Chinese go figure I wish I could that would be handy but so this cost me two dollies I think American dollars with two dollars shipping thing it took only about a week and a half to arrive which wasn't too bad and it scares the crap out of me I'll show you what it looks like before I actually show you the description and like stop because it's really creepy like this creeps me out so much I'm highly No I'm doing it for the tube so it's supposed to basically peel your skin off flag is this healthy ooh what is this over I just swiped this is like obviously customer pictures it just gives me a lot so I don't know if they don't give me a beautiful fake cuz honestly my feet are gross I have gross feet okay I do not take care of my feet I don't moisturize them my feet could definitely do with some refreshment okay description what you do is first you need to soak your feet 14 swimming it so I'm just going to do that while I try the rest of this stuff I've got my little foot spy ready and I'm just going to soak my feet while I do you know while I try the rest of the things and then what you do is you clean and dry your feet take the product out of here put it on but we'll do that soon and then you leave it on for 45 minutes and then after about three to five days your old foot waste will fall off so I'll obviously film that if it happens we'll see if it happens we'll see how it looks I'll tell you all about it in another update so that's the end of this video oh gosh that's really loud so yeah my feet are currently soaking in warm water we will come back to that soon next up I'm going to do these so I've heard actually quite good things about this I'm kind of excited these are called soft foam indie twist curls tall DIY they were free but you had to pay $5 shipping so there were five dollars and basically what you do if you look at this picture is you just pop them in your here and leave them for a while and it's supposed to curl your hair with no heat and no damage so I have actually just filled up this bottle this is not heat styling treatment this is literally just water and I'm going to dampen my hair a little bit just cuz I think it'll make them come out bitter we're gonna put the men may leave them on throughout this video and then later on today I'll take them out and we'll see what they look like so I'm just gonna brush my at first my face is so orange right now this is what it allows expectation versus reality moments this is obviously my first time using it first impression they feel like mini versions of those like pull the tube things that you'd swim with as a kid like the noodles you know so I'm just gonna dampen my hair just a little bit I'm gonna brush the bird this could be it hasta I might end up with like the most hideous looking hair but it's just a risk we're gonna take it would be a good idea to do this whole beat if they work out loud that is and then you could like leave it in overnight I have no instructions so I'm just gonna start at one end and then just twist my hair around and then I guess just bend it is that how you do it beats me so I'm just like wrapping from the very top of the little noodle I'm gonna call them noodles and then twisting my hair well around and they're not kind of bend it so secure oh I just got stabbed by that one I think there's like a wire net and it really could lift ahold of Mac I can't be careful oh yeah this sort shot these plastic that's like stabbing me jeez girl what's happening with this one I'm sorry I'm in color I'm just gonna bend it in hope that it tastes 2018 trained for you're here I'm just gonna grab random sections I think and hope that I have enough noodles okay so we are all done this one's annoying me is like super dangly okay Nick stuff before I take off my makeups to the hair removal thing I am going to try out the ear wax thing Matt swab so this cost nothing it was free and the shipping was $4 you do get quite a lot of the little twisty things which I'm assuming you could like clean off and like spray with some like alcohol or something to clean it off I don't know oh here it is it says please do not reuse or wash spiral tips so don't listen to me I guess that is kind of curse please turn only a direction indicated by the handle or a serious injury may result in the installation picture it like shows it in this little tray can you say that but I didn't get a tray I just got like a little bag full of things so I hope these are legit it was some things on this website which I definitely would not recommend you guys try like it's like I don't know just like hot out stuff that I would probably just leave to the professionals like laser hair removal at home from Aliexpress that cost like five dollars okay I just don't think that's a good idea I thought for some reason and it makes thinks that it's not but I thought it would be hard but it's like a Scylla on a rubbery tip and then it shows you which way to twist so I'm gonna try this and this is revolting I'm gonna show you what comes out so I'm just gonna insert it okay what way do I go this way my PS things like flipping out there's nothing nada okay let's try the other end maybe I just don't hit me awakes I don't know this sounds bad but I'm kind of pushing it right in and still not going too deep which is really good it doesn't hurt at all I kinda literally go like the most minimal amount of stuff off here I don't I think it kind of works I just don't think I have any gay legs like like this is gross Bo just show you're like oh you can't even say anything that's like only a couple of little flakes but I might just have clean is I don't know okay how much to try it and I'll update your because he always haze wakes he is I'm kind of disappointed okay next up I'm going to try this sleek face and body hair threading system it looks like some kind of medieval contraption for torture we'll give it a go this cost $1 70 and the shipping was $2.00 so 3 dollars 72 off my makeup this lashes I can't wait to get this for an orange miss off my skin I have straight-up like glitter herpes on my face right now so in the little package it comes with the tool and it also comes with some it refills by the looks of it they look like this in this tiny little case and then inside there are also some instructions which I'm definitely going to read it says you need to replace the 3 that comes in it straight away it says it's got regular strength for short fine here and extra strength for normal to heavy hair removal I'm gonna quite sure how to tell the difference like all this reads look the exact same to me ok so you release it ok I see so if you look at the ends they've got like these little balls on so you need to like pinch that and then you just pull it off pretty easy and then there's like a little loop down the bottom so I think this is like the same idea it's the region except instead of using your fingers to like a winds the product around it's a tool ok I did it so that's how it should look it needs to be firm to the touch so you just dial it you turn the dial it should make it tighter yet does so that's quite tight now to enhance the movement of sleek on skin apply some facial powder so you pretty much just go like that and whip it on so let's try it let's see if it works I'm nervous I mean I like my face so it shouldn't be too bad but I'm still nervous okay so that seems to hold your skin taut I can't feel a thing it's literally not doing anything it's like I can feel the Rope like rubbing my skin and it is it removing ngata and I've got it so tight literally and my face is hairy trust me crap trauma nothing okay that was disappointing I wonder if this is like a fake vision or something stat3 literally it was just like okay next up we are going at to try this face mask applicator which I'm so excited about I feel like this might be like something really cool cuz I usually use a brush to apply which obviously it's not hard to clean it out look it's really not but this just would look easier to clean to me you know you just have to kind of wipe it off so this cost $1 70 they reckon it usually goes for $22 what a joke and the shipping it cost two dollars so three dollars 70 once again so it comes in different colors I obviously it got the pink one and it looks like this it's nice and flexible it feels ok quality it's just like eBay brush quality like a little bit tacky but does the job and say I'm going to be applying my aura manuka honey at mass by Antipodes and this is one of my favorite mass in each in this in a favorites video it's a really good fan media it's really gin too it's hydrating but it has that manuka honey in it which helps to kill bacteria so i'm going to apply it rather than with my fingers i'm going to use the little brush it smells good this is actually really easy to use obviously you're getting a few lines because it's got a shop edge it's a little bit hard to use over the nose it's not as flexible in that area it's probably better for like cheeks and stuff like this would be so good with like a clay mask it's got all of my hair whoo I mean I wouldn't pay $22 for it if that's what they think it goes for normally hell no but for a few doll it is like I think it's really handy and then I'm just using a tissue to wipe it off done you know sometimes when you've got like your long acrylic nails and you just don't want to get all of the face mask up and Smith you know it can be a little bit of a hassle like washing under your nails like trying to get all of the clay masks especially claimed us because they just like stick to your skin and all the little chunks get in there and this I feel like you know so easy okay now my feet have been soaking for about half an hour we are going to dry them off and try this weird foot mask you guys can't judge my feet okay like I know they're gross but just leave me alone see my feet like the heels are just really dry that seems kind of flaking off um so scrub them before I put the foot thing on but you know like in front of my feet are quite nice and soft but it's just my heels like it really really dry heels in yummy fate ten so this delicious foot mask went for a dollar 70 and the shipping it cost two dollars so open up with you your little upside down which is random oh it's bubbling I'm actually really nervous for this I'm not gonna lie I hope that's good but what the heat this is so weird it looks like this smells kind of like melted vanilla ice cream okay do you just like put your foot in there I'm just gonna go grab some old socks to put on top because I don't really want to walk around the carpet with Dex it's like dripping wet I swear this is like not what's advertised cuz it's saying all this stuff about a red bag I never got a red bag it's these you have to cut the seal where his mind's like open the things I do for you guys I'm just gonna like put the song it feels gross yeah so here's how it looks all over my hands so I'm gonna go wash my hands and wash off my face mask and a bit and I'm just gonna come back in a few hours I was takeout to hear things and see if they would put things I'll take off after 45 minutes to an hour because that's what it says here and I'll update you with how they it feels when I do my hair segment hey guys so these have been in for about five hours now just being ears hang and working and everything and I thought I would it come out and see how they look but first a little update on that foot mask they definitely like feel okay like they don't feel that much softer maybe a little bit softer but there is not a dramatic difference yet my feet literally like look at the exact same right now so I will film as soon as they start peeling if they do and in a week from now if they don't peel I'll obviously come back at the end of this video and let you know like yeah what happened or what didn't happen moving along to D here I'm so nervous so hopefully this has not like given me a terrible hairstyle okay so I'm just oh my god oh my god that's so curly so they definitely worked there was only like five hours to so I imagine if you lift these overnight you're gonna get even more like holding power probably like they'll probably last longer I probably shouldn't have brushed it now it's going frizzy okay let me just take them all out and then I'll figure out what to style them like that makes sense and I definitely think next time I try these I probably take biggest sections so that the hair wasn't as curly and maybe even not curl up to the roof because my hair is like extremely curly right now this is so out of it so do they work yeah they do like I hate this part I would straighten that I feel like these would be really fun if you were like you know younger like if you're a mum this could be a really cute thing to bio like young at teenage daughter or something like that especially because there's no heat involved B I definitely would recommend not curling up to the entire room unless you want that like super like eighty is it curly hair look play some water will help to kind of flexing it down a little bit maybe so do they work yes I definitely think the best things out of it this video so far have been the face mask Britta I really liked it and these so yeah hey guys so quick update look how much these have dropped I like wit my roots which is fine but like heaps of its dropped out which is kind of good like I like the side better now there's still some really tight ones down the bottom maybe because my hair was widowed I've only had the mouth like half an hour and they've dropped ah what yeah I definitely like how it looks now but I think you might want to use like hairspray with these just a tip hey guys so it has literally being probably like three weeks since I filmed that previous poll video the foot peel there was nothing to document nothing happened it was just a big waste of time the only thing that did happen which I'm not sure if it's related is I got this disgusting massive blister on the back of my heel that was just painful that wouldn't pop but I was going to the Jumbo lot so it was probably just my sneakers there was no action it to be seen so I wouldn't bother with that personally I just didn't find it worked tried this with Hamish and it didn't really work I'm gonna try it one more time I haven't claimed my ears out in a couple weeks and literally there's like dust on this I think because it's so flexible which is really good cause it's gene tool but I just don't think it's different off to really scoop anything out I don't know have any of you guys had better luck with this little device then I have so you pretty much the winner out of this entire video I would say it's the little silicon face mask brush I still use this I think this is really good it's quick simple easy it gets the job done it's nice and fast to clean it's not like a normal brush we have to like wash it properly you just have to wipe this off or rinse it off it just works it's a simple effective tool that costs stuff or money so I didn't lie recommend this if you enjoyed this video please let me know because I'll totally do some more if you've got like certain things you want me to try like totally just send me the links on Twitter and I'll see what I can do thank you guys so much for watching hope you enjoyed it and I'll talk to you guys in my next video by the way I like this makeup look down below you 
hey everyone so today I am doing a Christmas inspired look if you could not tell like I mean this screams Christmas to me okay I've even got like the read no snitch I'm just so happy right now I am so excited for Christmas you guys so I really wanted to do something different for Christmas this year I think I will still do another tutorial altar for some other Christmas looks so I did something crazy since obviously the last few years I usually just do like gold looks you know read lips just the typical kind of thing and someone on my Twitter suggested candy cane I make up info so if you guys want to see how I created this look it was a struggle trust me but hopefully you guys can learn from my mistakes then just keep watching okay so I already have my eyebrows on a muffin i strong cuz I'm doing a first impression on this foundation here which will be up at some stage I just really wanted to join Christmas video like I know it's quite early but I don't even Kim just so excited for Christmas this year and I don't even know why I just am so yeah browser on to save a bit of time Foundation has done so I'm gonna go straight into my eye makeup first so using the lid primer base mesh box I'm going to mumble my legs I don't even know just getting out of my mouth I'm gonna use my new Marvel brushes today I already used one of them of course to put on my foundation so these are them and then this is the one I used to put on my foundation today I just used a spot cleaner to clean the foundation off you can see they clean up really good even though they have the white hairs and they have a beautiful marble a very soft marble pattern and silver writing completely beginner so yeah they're up now I know some of you guys been waiting patiently phrase I love them so much and there's so bloomin soft light you guys have no idea I love them I always have the link takes o beauty down below so first I'm just using that I've let this sit for too long this is the round eye brush also I'm not sure about this foundation like it feels quite dry and just like I just don't think it works with my skin tone really well which does not happen very often as you guys know like I usually love most foundations on my skintone like my skin tone quite lucky I've got quite normal skin most the time so like most things just work I'm using the cinema secrets and then just buffing it off on my towel down here so cleans up perfect and then I'm just gonna go into my very next palette and use it the shade yeah I'll just use clarity just to sit that down so if you think my eyelids look cakey it's because of the foundation like it's just gripping onto my skin really weird I mean I'm wearing old day we'll see how it is by the end of the day the first impression will obviously be to come so hopefully I have good news and then I'm just gonna take my contour shade that I'm gonna be using in my crease and I'm keeping the eye makeup very very simple because I'm doing it crazy I went out like you guys already know cuz I'm doing the intro at the front of this video this makeup doesn't turn into a butt disaster what's a butt disaster it's not I think I was thinking in my head like a bot lord of a disaster but that just came out with this brush here the round eye brush is actually one of my favourites for a transition shade because it really blows out the color and makes it so soft it's really good for blowing out any shade it's not like ina brush you use to pick on color it's just like so soft like if you like a soft crease so I'm doing that first and then I make sure go take another one of these brushes I'm going to try and show you every single one of theirs so this here is the trill up crease brush this one gives a little bit more color payoff so I'm just buffing the color into like the out of a kind of area in the crease just cuz I still mice to be nice and defined of course if you like the crease blend a brush this one's very similar it's just a little bit more pointed it's the same kind of results so if you like the crease blender you'll absolutely love this I know the crease blender is what about like bestsellers at the moment and they're not going to just buff some of that under my eyes because my concealer is creasing so so much friggin makeup on under there just wait for the videos wait for the first impression and you'll see and then I'm actually going to use a little bit of gold because we are doing a Christmassy look so I'm just going to use the shade Island glow the eye shadow brush I'm just putting a really tiny amount of this long because I don't want it to take over the look like I just want it to be in the background that eyeliner needs to stand up I'm going to put a little bit on that inner corner while I'm here and there's another couple eye brushes so I'll be using this one which is the winter liner brush which is one of my Holy Grail like eyeliner brushes and then we've also got a fluffy blender brush which is of course just perfect for buffing out any edges or creating a soft look that comes in at two oh you said they we will find out okay I'm so nervous for this sorry I got the in spoke because you guys I sit on Twitter I was like what do you want to see for Christmas and I got all of the you know regular requests for Christmas like gold and red and green and stuff so someone said dude the candy cane makeup but also the heck is that obviously it's a thing I searched up on Pinterest I'm gonna show you and it came up with all these amazing looks oh I wouldn't know I have a clue like that top one like I would not have a clue who begin this trend okay it's coming out with like Halloween ones but like you know it's just so much of it and I think it's so creative and so fun like that one there like the eyeliner so yeah I'm gonna do something like this today shout out to whoever thought of this idea like awesome I just don't know who it is but I'm gonna try it and do a little tutorial I guess for you guys hopefully fix that because this is my first time trying anything like this so first what I'm going to do is just go straight in with a white eyeliner so be singing it pure white chroma line by Nick so once again this is the winged eyeliner brush and it's just the perfect course you don't have to use my brushes guys I feel bad promoting my own brush this in my videos sometimes like you can literally use just whatever brushes you want night and just use your mind cuz I love my name because lots of you guys do buy them and like I want to know about them so if you don't care just ignore me like I'm not trying to force you this I my line is a little bit dry so we're just gonna do our best oh god so chunky it's like thick on my brush do I have my jawline this eyeliner is so tried out I'm doing my best okay okay I'm gonna go in with a pure white eyeshadow on top and see if that will help just even it out a bit so the one I have here is called White Lies by makeup geek you can use any what I show you one or hopefully or I want always a little bit better than mine because what I've dry now I'm gonna take my black eyeliner I put this was my top of what eyeliner that is not here it is okay I'm gonna take my Tom Ford eyeliner and just try to do a really thin that's line just across my lash line so I wanna wear falsies okay so there's the base done so basically I'm just keeping it my white eyeliner here so I can fix any mistakes like I did my eyeliner a little stick so I just went back into the white I line it and just kind of went over it to tidy it up it looks good from far away just don't look too close because then you can see all the little cracks and I under hair I'm going to conceal that later and I'll like tidy up the lines afterwards as well so oh my gosh is he here I've no idea if these are i safe just to disclaimer but I'm gonna be using it these at Smashbox liquid lipsticks the jeffree star ones are eye safe I just really like these colors so we've got the always on metallic match in kale my lab and then we have the always on metallic match in maneater so I'm gonna do a little candy cane pattern so I'm taking my little winged liner brush so I think I'll just stick a Ridge in just in case you've never seen a candy cane before like I'm doing this kind of color thing and I can always tie up the black afterwards too if I mess that up it might even be easy to use a really fine on a liner brush like I've got these eyeliner brush acidic so beauty okay y'all nicely I'm gonna have to tidy this up after it's kind of hard to do when your eyes shut keep drawing it in the wrong place life doesn't wait thicker than I was going to but hopefully we can pull it together you could probably just do the black last like Liz beyond tasks I'm just covering it now to try and match it just do your best I guess but you could leave it like this too if you don't want to do a green I have to say I'm loving the metallic look like it's real shiny I might do a little bit more on the inner corner and we'll just see how it goes first so now the green I just wiped off my brush so this time I'm trying to do a really thin lines okay now to try and clean this up look I'm scared mostly guys just do your best I'm not perfect at this and if you're not it's okay and if you are I'm jealous of you no I'm pretty happy with that so now I'm just gonna touch up the black and I'm thinking of outlining it's in black too but I'm just really nervous I might do this off camera because otherwise I'm gonna screw it up I'm just going to literally do the thinnest line I can all around the outside guys I used my favorite Tom flawed eye line I use the small side on the side and look how much it bleeds versus the long say if you don't know what I mean it's the double sided so the small brush tip it's just like bleed and I'm really annoyed because it was looking so good I thought I'd try it out and it just blade everywhere so I'm just going on with some concealer this is such an experimental video but hopefully I'm a showing you how I fix my mistake so I'll help you guys if you do anything similar and we can only do a piste my first time trying something like this I'm actually pretty proud of it hope they don't screw it up when I do my lashes and mascara next thing I'll friggin smudge it or something the side different you know way worse but this side looks okay so we'll just pause on this side okay so I'm just gonna commit and finish the eye makeup now so that you know it's out of the way because this is the hardest part and in the race too simple I'm gonna use the wire Sal what even is this volume effect faux sills this I'm gonna try my very best not to smudge this all over the eye makeup I think I might use something like the Sheik today for my lashes like something quite get piece so that you can see the eye makeup like the eyeliner still because if you use something like a lash that's too dramatic it might just cover it you know and then just before I do my bottom mascara I'm gonna put gold mine eyeliner by Urban Decay in my bloodline hopefully this looks good oh it's barely even pigmented when I draw my like hand you can see it really well bow in the waterline it's not really transferring very good Isis still kind of brightened up my eyes though I heard you slip them out of the boats but this is what they look like the Sheik they're like clusters this one went on good please please please let the sea can I be the same oh my god I did it I'm just going to bronze up my skin where's the bronzer i'm using luminous bronze light by hourglass and got this foundation is separating all over my skin and then just using that same contour color I used at the beginning just striking that on looks crazy right and then you just keep blending oh it's a blend upward to create a really shot contour line and then for my highlight I'm just going to use it the same palette and I'm gonna take the shade no I want something kind of golden so maybe mmm that one just like literally matches my skin torn I'm gonna mix it with a bit of the shade on top of that the paler one and then blush you guys are gonna get so stuck with me using this exact same lunch pail a little time that's gonna be this one here the Vizia rose coral blush palette I'm just gonna take the tiniest amount that middle color will go too much okay and then you could just do nude lips or red lips I'm gonna try on this on the lips the same color I used on my eyes just for something ooh BRR Christmas this looks incredible even without a lipliner and then I'm just gonna let that dry a little and then clean up the edges because it's a little bit more slack I probably should have used a lip liner just to go shop line but I mean look how even that is this is just an eye to find a brush by the way like so beauty I really like it's the lips okay so apart from at my foundation I'm obsessed with how this makeup turned out I'm so happy so hopefully you guys enjoyed watching the process and hopefully you guys that try it out for Christmas and take me in your photos because I think this is the cutest thing ever if you don't have a green liquid lipstick you could always just use eyeshadow and if you don't have white eyeliner or you can just go ahead and do like red liquid lipstick and then you could just use a white eyeshadow to do some stretch you might just need a few layers but I'm sure you guys can pull it off if I can do this anyone can do this I'm not that good at like lapa I are that kind of thing so like seriously give it a go I think it's so cute I really want to do this for Christmas so yeah hopefully this video helped you guys out if you did enjoy it please give it a thumbs up and please feel free to comment down below I'd really

to wash my very first youtube tutorial and recreate it today and obviously it's going to look a lot better I hope then the first time let's see if we got my uploads and go to oldest so the first Youtube tutorial is this one oh my gosh that Tom nailed our [Music] I'm song yes what are these photos that even me conspiracy thread oh my goodness glamorous that twist when you're alert I included a light cut crease and falsies I hope you enjoy I still type like that smiley face think is because okay so anyway one color Oh Jas that was like my favorite color when I first are doing makeup tutorials was so cheap I think I got my like eBay neutrals with the twist peach in gold well unless I never even my foundational can we just talk about the quality of this video also it's all squashed into a square pretty sure my camera back then didn't have a widescreen capabilities to film in a square shape and everything is like super squash my face is like hopefully found different I look like the Senate eyebrows the dark here and is all about that nude lip life as you can see so today to put my skin I'm going to use the tight brighterdayz sorry if I'm a little bit a little Lisp every now I'm going to get a tray and it's so like types or beers were that's why they work yeah this is one of them and my list is coming back a little bit but that's okay and then I'm also going to use some primer oil by Smashbox okay now it's going to let it soak in a little bit before you begin that playing the foundation on top today I'm going to use is this condition this liner right here so I system pressure on this and I was kind of disappointed because like I don't really notice until such people started pointing it out but and the video is looked a little bit like patchy or something like that people were like you're lying you're saying that it's good and it's really not it's like so catchy it's like how very fall over on me honestly was a medium buildable like I mentioned in the video and in real life it was not paid gee I don't know if it was like lighting or what I'm perhaps I definitely looked a little bit better that's one dish using a primer oil today it's not like super sticky or anything like that be using this it's just like the perfect daytime foundations me at the moment it's your Chia sort of depiction solid foundation in the shade perfect cinnamon and it's probably a little bit too dark for me so I've got a turtleneck oddly cattail let's apply this all over my face and then I'm just going to use this flat face brush to see a tortoise shower and leaned it up so they should just look so good on my skin and it looks so good in photos like the name is very accurate to me like every time I take selfies in this my skin just glows and looks so smooth I'm really impressed with it if you did see that video you were quite convinced again I recommend you know if you still were interested like search some more reviews because I don't know if you like my video at lips some of you guys down I feel really bad about that I feel like nothing is going to cover this at the moment because it's so fresh I don't know why I decided to pop it I was just in such a bad mood when I saw it on my face I was like and it's again Ceylon today I'm going to use to shave porcelain and the LA girl Pro conceal it's going to go under my eyes so I'm also going to highlight my face a little bit with it just to create a little bit of dimension so it's so crap when you go like that but then when you blend it's so beautiful I love this concealer so much I'm just using a petal face brush I'm going to use a little bit of the Cuban apply on digital skin enhancer in ethics or 3 just to my elderts which lies just on my finger just try can cover this Nestea here honestly I feel I was fighting a losing battle here now I am going to use that the emeralds well rested under my eyes a little with a small face brush and then for my powder oh my gosh over here at storage - holy crap so my part is today I'm going to use this and it's free no sebum Y no sleep in mineral powder honestly I can't give this Fluffles my favorite it's really driving me nuts so this powder it kind of take heaps and just swipe it on now I'm going to use sculpt from the tarsus pro palette just to contour and this is just a bronzer brush by the way ok now let's quickly do the eyebrows today I'm going to use my Urban Decay brow box this is in the shade brown sugar with a eyebrow from a brush even though we're like it's so called the in makeup is doesn't cooperate let the makeups actually like cold

loves Elijah roof we're just going to take a pill pinkie club that village I'm going to use this color here which has a little bit of a shimmer to it Kaleem buy in associatively Hills I cannot get over how funny it is watching myself back then and like I am just talking to the camera so strange I don't know how to describe it that just a white like my mannerisms are so weird it's probably cuz I'm so nervous you know I wasn't being myself because I was so scared of putting myself out there and not really know like reserved and strange some spoon there all over the lids like EXO has told me to do this is like a pinky peach cheer connection recolor I'm listening for like My Chemical Romance the pet craft did you see that blending technique yes apparently I took a slightly darker color on

applying my crease color okay what color is what color am I using I'm missing it and I'm not good I'm just wearing the same color you know suck it you want with it it's a little crazy education and I'll try and I'm going to take this color because it's similar to the last color used on the outer corner this is prepared by makeup geek and I'm going to do as I say with my impression it does work obviously that's why I recommend distort the blending brushes are much thinner okay started from the bottom now we're here I'm going to use a blender brush now can I just take a blending brush put it

with razor look lighter by colour-pop I'm actually going to use this like opaque I'm just kind of using it to give my lips a little dimension my lip line is so like not there's no me I would have been

makeup look is not that clever or revolutionary but I just really wanted to recreate my first makeup tutorial you can kind of see the colors better in the very beginning of the club slightly I probably could have done a little bit less of a wing but no look and the question of the day today is how did you find my YouTube videos like how did you find me I'd love to know I will talk to you guys in my next video bye [Music] 
hey everyone so today I am doing a tutorial this is a two and one on this makeup look and at this hair tutorial I'm so excited to share both of these looks with you at first I wasn't too sure on this makeup it's supposed to be Dimond inspired I was inspired by those kind of holographic flicks the blue the purple the grays the silvers the Claire and it kind of came out with this logo kind of ended up looking a little bit more opal than I would have liked but hey this is my diamond look love it or leave it I'm going to show you guys that my makeup in the first half of the tutorial and then in the second half I'm gonna show you how I get nice light kind of Missy textured waves using my Nurmi silhouette hair straightener so I hope you guys enjoy this video first off to start I'm just going to moisturize my skin because I was feeling a little bit dull and this moisturizer smells like heaven on earth you guys need to go smell it it is in critical it is the best thing of life so I'm just putting that on and then moisturizing my lips also with this lip oil by Anika I hope I pronounced that right I really like this one it's super hydrating and doesn't feel too heavy on my lips and they're not what I'm gonna do nice is just prep in my eyes I'm using a little bit of revitalash on my brows and on my eyelashes and that's just gonna help them grow nice and long and once that's dry I mean it's going onto the step here which is putting some concealer over my eyelids and eyebrow area just to kind of conceal on my thin eighth eyelids I've got so much veining so I have to conceal and prime and everything so I'm just slapping this on and prepping my eyebrows I'm going to be using the chi chi's soft brown brow pomade today I've been loving this again lately it's so good and affordable as well for us New Zealand Australians and then of course you want to see our eyebrows so they stay in place all day long I'm using the brown timer by Urban Decay today I really like this one as well and then I am priming the eyelids cuz once again I've got so much discoloration it's almost impossible to cover half the time without using like a million layers so I'm just doing my best and then what I'm gonna do is just take a white eyeshadow and kind of sit that whole base down just so that the other colors look quite pale on top you could also use a white base if you want I kind of wish I did I was really experimenting with this look if you could not tell like while you watch this you'll be like what they hit you doing because I kind of go back and forth a lot because I just had no idea what I was doing but I really like how it turned out and now that I'm watching it back at the time I was like I don't know if this is good or not but I think it turned out really cool so if you look at a diamond where the edges of a diamond die usually it's a little bit darker of a silver kind of gray color where the cuts are so this is kind of what I was doing to reflect that kind of time you know I'm using a darker gray in the crease and then I wanted to use some pale light shimmery like purpley or bluish tones just to reflect that kind of color that the diamond puts out when the light hits it basically so just some urges ink colors and then I'm using this glitter here to kind of show the shimmer of a diamond in the glove and the glimmer and it's kind of like clear looking glitter I popped it all over my eyelid even up on my brow bone in crease just cuz I want to just hold really glimmery and shimmery and out there overall I just wanted to look to look really shimmery and glowy and shiny so yeah I'm using this waterproof like sitting thing from Anastasia Beverly Hills just cause it's nice and thin to put all over the eyelid and then the look was very like fairy like I just wanted to warm it up a little bit so I popped a little bit of my bronzer just through the crease there next up for the eyeliner I went with a silvery kind of grey at color you could also use something metallic if you want but I thought it might be a little bit too much this is where I went back and forth a little bit I started just with the gray then I went glittery and then I went grey and then I put white on it but you'll see what I'm doing so I'm starting off with the grey and then what I'm doing here is just highlighting my brow bone with a really shimmery white color just to kind of tie the look together a little bit more and then I edited out the part where I put glitter on the eyeliner because it was just way too much like too much glitter so I just covered it up again and they're not went in with a white eyeliner and mixed it with the gray to make it like a lighter gray and sort of like an ombre effect I don't know I just kind of thought it looked better than just the gray you guys can tell me what you think also a really dark gray could have looked cool but I felt like the white was more diamond deer you know and then I decided to go into my base because the eye makeup was just throwing me off because it was so out there I needed to even out my skin tone so I could see where I was at with the eye makeup so doing a really full at coverage base eye I feel like this makes my eye makeup look so much nicer like when I think it's looking really bad because as soon as I did this I was like okay it's not so bad I got a little bit of confidence you know it's just a very light and crazy makeup look I don't even know if you guys will actually ever wear this makeup look I just thought it was really fun and it could be really cool for like a white Christmas look as well so just sitting down at my concealer and my foundation got some loose powders here just buffing that all over until it's all sets or lasts all day long and then another thing I wanted to do to balance out that really pale I makeup was just add some bronzer to my face and contour and stuff obviously so I'm just using this pack Everitt princess bronze it's the same one I used in my crease and then I'm using my TARDIS Pro glow it just to contour and one side of my face looks really unblended phages but don't worry I fixed it and also the camera the lighting is just me he looks so much worse than is any way I'm doing it some lashes as well these ones have I heard a beauty I'll link everything down below I loved these with this look they're very fairy like like this look would also be amazing for Halloween for like a farrier and angel or something like that but anyways and then I'm using some silver eyeliner onto the bottom I wanted to add some drama into the bottom just to balance out the makeup look so I'm going really thick and then I decided to do those kind of like tears you know the glittery tears so I'm just going in a triangular shape kind of under my eye with that eyeliner and they're not what I am doing is using that waterproofing gel stuff by Anasazi Beverly Hills again and putting that right on top and then up piling on some glitter and I put heaps on my inner corner as well like just under my inner corner just cuz this glitter looks so freaking it pretty it's so nice I love it I thought maybe black mascara might be too full on for the lower lashes so I'm using a tinted primer by benefit I love this stuff it looks so pretty and I did push my false lashes and relations together with a lash curler by this point as you will see in this next clip and next I'm going in to do winter highlighter palette defy her to beauty and I'm taking that cream shade and just applying it on the cheekbones this is really pretty it's almost like a really soft holographic kind of effect but to be honest once you blend it in it just kind of looks creamy but the colors that a diamond kind of show on a surface when it goes in the light is like so holographic and beautiful and shiny that I wanted to create that on cheeks I'm covering it with this Chanel highlighter I think it's limited edition but you could use anything that's pale and slightly colored this looks so unblended on this side of my face but I do fix it trust me I'm going with a blush just a light pink to kind of complement everything and blending that in and then yeah that's the it face pretty much done I do change my lipstick later but anyway this is what I was wearing while I did my hair so I thought I'd show you anyway this is one of those tinted lip gloss things by Pony effect and it's in the shade one second desire I believe it's really pretty pink I just feel like it might've been a little bit too much with this makeup so I change it later anyways so I took out my hair this is how it is looking so yeah not the best it kind of just needs a brush but I felt like doing it tousled kind of messy waves so I'm using my nume silhouette straightener it's a flatiron with ceramic plates ceramic stone is really good for fine to average hair thickness and it's really safe to use on it dry here as well or dyed hair like my own and I just had to show you this one because this is my old one I've had this one for three or four years now and I love it so much so I'm excited to try then you learn anyway let's get started so I just went in chucked on a jacket I thought it looks good but now I look back and I'm like no did not I'm unboxing this I also sprayed at some heat protections on my hair so this is the new one as you can see it's a little bit fancy looking I love the texture on the handle just turn it on you can see the light switches on I'm going to brush through my hair so it's nice and pricked and ready it to curl this straightener is so easy to curl your hair with it just slides straight through and it literally works in one stroke like you'll see so what I did was I divided my hair into two pots bottom in top and then it's flooded at the back into two parts of left and right and I'm just curling away from my face as I'm starting a little bit down from my hair shaft just to keep the length of my hair if I curl from to higher obviously shortens the length of my hair a little bit so I stop maybe a third the way down and then I'm only going it to almost the ends I'm not curling the very ends I'm leaving them straight and I just find that this makes it look a little bit Messier and more textured and wavy rather than full-on like glam and curls because I wanted it to look white if it you can see how fast this is I'm literally killing each piece of hair once I'm just sliding it through nice and gently and taking it out and it is done this entire hairstyle takes me like five to ten minutes like if there it's so quick basically like my old pink new me here I and I would take with me every time I traveled over the states because obviously this does have a little us like I just use an adapter here in New Zealand but I take it with me when I travel and it's still quick and easy and it makes my hair so shiny and beautiful looking I'm a big big fan so that's that side done and I'm switching to the other side doing the exact same thing i cropped most of it out since it is literally the exact same thing and then what you want to do basically after this is take down the top section and do the exact same thing it is so fast and easier and because the straightener has those little like kind of curled of sides if you have a look at the actual strainer it's all like curl do you see what I mean it's got like curved edges that it's a bit of way to put it curved edges and it makes it really really nice and smooth to do and obviously it's really good at straightening as well but yet I just felt like doing curls with it today and shout out to new me they have it given me a coupon code for you guys it is Schoeneck so new me it'll get you 20% off everything on the website I highly recommend their curling irons as well I own so many and I still use them to this day I've owned them for three to four years each and they're all going completely strong they're amazing quality this is sponsored by new me but as you can tell I'm a huge fan of their products and really stand by them and recommend them to all of my friends as well so I hope you guys enjoy it the coupon code I'm not making money off the coupon code by the way it's just a coupon code for you guys because I love you once I'm finished curling my hair I like to shake it out with my fingers and then what I do is I take random chunks of the very top section and I just curl those away from my face as well and this just gives a little bit more texture cos I'm curling right from the root so to just give a little bit more variation to those curls that they don't all look super uniform or anything and yeah I just take random chunks so yeah that's all I'm doing and then we are pretty much done we're just going to style a little bit with some products this is optional for a textured look I recommend trying out salt spray at dry shampoo or even this kind of stuff I'm using this one here is by joy coat and it's called the hair shake the taste and what's the other end I can't remember the other brand anyway there's heaps of different products like those they're basically texturizing it sprays or powders like spray powders and I just sprinkle it and will spray it in to my mid-length and then test a lit with my fingers and then finally to finish the hair I'm using a new mean sealer just in the inks to smooth those down and then like I said I changed my lip color to a nude this is Mac myth by the way just because I felt like the pink was just too loud and then I added a diamond necklace this is how what my hair looks by the way it's not real diamonds obviously I'm not that bougie um yeah this is a finished look and I actually really like how it came together now that I look at it so I'm happy and I hope you guys enjoyed it as well

hey everyone so today I am doing my 2017 favorites just a bunch of stuffed is a mixture of high-end and drugstore stuff that I have just really been loving this year in stuff that stood out to me while I was like choosing the products obviously there has been like literally probably hundreds of products that I have loved this yet so I kind of just narrowed it down to like a few of the things that as I said really stood out so I'm just gonna jump straight in and show you guys what I have picked out for you first of all a primer so I ended up going it with the Too Faced hangover primer it was kind of between this in the Mike Jacobs coconut primer whatever it's called I find them so so similar so I went with this one this is like literally almost empty I've got another one as well it's silicon free it's got coconut water in it probiotic based ingredients in skin revive is I just find it so hydrating it's like the perfect mix of almost like a moisturizer and a primer in one and it just makes it much beautiful base for my foundation to go on top of it hydrates it smooths and my makeup just looks really good on top of it almost every single time no matter what kind of product I use on top of it it just seems to work so I love this so much I love the smell of it if you don't like coconut you won't like it but I can't get enough it smells so fresh and just delicious foundations I have a couple here so it was really hard for me to figure out which is my favorite foundation of the year because literally I have loved probably like 20 different foundations and tried so many this year so the way I kind of thought about it was which are the ones I take with me every time I travel because I've done a lot of traveling this year and it came down to these two I may have mentioned this last year as well this is the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous foundation I'm obsessed with this it's a drugstore brand it's affordable and it is so good I love the coverage it's kind of like a medium buildable coverage and it just glides on blends out and looks so perfect I'm a huge fan of it then the other one is the clinic beyond perfecting which was kind of ironic because when I did my first impression on this I was kind of like on the fence about it I think from memory however the more I used it the more I fell in love and I actually enjoyed mixing these together as well this is obviously a diet shade but when I travel because I often fake tan or just like take two different shades and mix together or a this and this and mix them together to create my custom kind of shade this is gold and neutral and then this one is at 0.5 breeze it's just such a full coverage and it just looks beautiful on the skin and lasts all day long the only thing about this one is sometimes it creeps on to drier areas whereas this one doesn't is much so especially when I go to colder climates like when I went to Italy and everything I like this one because it's just quite hydrating almost but concealer I have it too once again so first of all the nice soft matte complete concealer I have two shades vanilla which is this one and it custard and if I show you inside light you can see like I love this stuff or you can't even really tell but there's like a big ditch in there I use this with my flawless finish the punch makes a beauty this color I use it under my eyes and it is so lightweight like thin so smooth it doesn't crease it's amazing coverage and then the custard shade I use on my actual face so it's good under the eyes it's good to cover blemishes wrinkles discoloration like I'm obsessed with this concealer I think it's even better than my liquid radiant creamy concealer which I used to rave about I love love love love love love this and then the other concealer is kind of like a new concealer favorite and you guys make it sit but this is just blow me out of the water lately this is color pop no filter concealer and I use the shade fear this is just so brightening out of my eyes it's amazing coverage it blends out so so well and it is like so cheap as well so I've been telling all my friends do I buy it I'm obsessed with this it's just as good as like my Urban Decay Naked am I born this way and like all of those brands so that's why it's just one of my favorites cuz it's so cheap and it's so good if a sitting powder under the eyes this blew me away you guys know I was obsessed with my well rested which I still do you H lose it today but I actually think this one's bitter it's a little bit smoother at the eyes it is a locket powder by Kat Von D I use the shade petal and it's so brightening so smoothing it literally makes my under eye you're gonna look like a newborn babies but it's so good and I've used it to dance and they still like half if they can't a lift if you can say this like this so much product in here at last ever every time I use it I'm just like whoa good conceal a day it just makes my eye area looks so smooth and amazing whereas I find like whoa as much as I love it sometimes I can look quite cakey so this one is no cake anywhere I love it and then for my pressed pad and my favorite one of the year this is no surprise this is actually a new one because I've used up a few of them this is the pressed mineral foundation by coverfx I think it's super i'm comparable to like Mac Studio Fix powder and stuff like that it's so full coverage but you can apply a little bit just to sit your foundation and it just lasts all day it doesn't look patchy just a little too heavy does not do cakey it's just my go-to sitting powder there's not much to say about it I really love it lasts forever - favorite bronzer has definitely been at my hourglass bronzer which is so shocking for me because I like hourglass stuff but I've never been like a hot out junkie of how glass like some people are this is so good this is the yridian bronze light bronzer and basically it is just the perfect color of my skin tone and it's got a little bit of like a shimmer through it but it doesn't look shimmery when you put it on it just looks glowy and makes my complexion it glow well it's gonna meet with her I'm fear or faked and it's just my favorite and I've used this so much you can definitely see its flattened out a little bit but this so much product lift and yeah like I feel like this is gonna last me forever I love it well I shouldn't really use they much blush this year to be honest if you watch my tutorials you may have noticed but every time I did kind of want the blush for the most part usually I gravitate straight towards my clinic new tube tops and you know peach Pop's melon pops the pop blush range this one is no pop it's one of my favorites I just love these because they're nice and buildable or really subtle kind of glowy they're just my favorite formulas so that I chalk that in there to highlight this is cheating kind of my favorites are definitely at my own of course the XO Beauty highlight pad is this one is loosen this one's Aurora and loosens like a little bit more golden Aurora's a little bit more like pinky champagne it looks similar in this lighting but I promise they're not these like literally like you have to put them on your face to understand like they just make you absolutely glow from within I'm obsessed I'm gonna talk about them too much because they're like people think it's cheating but anyway if you like a good natural kind of look like nothing too glittery or shimmery but something that's still with beans and looks super glowy this is perfect and then at my favorite contour powders of course my heart proclo pellet and this color right here I've used it to death and there's still a crypt other products left I love this so much hopefully you can buy this as a single at some stage I don't think you can at the moment it's my favorite color for contouring it is the perfect undertone for me and then also the rest of the palette I just love it I haven't actually tried this really but the highlight is they are very intense highlighters they're very shimmery but if I'm feeling like I want something really intense for clubbing or something like that at night I'll often just reach for these because I always have this palette with me anyway for their contour color if I'm like traveling or anything I love this so much I wish it was like smaller but it's not too bad like it's quite thick brows benefit brows I've been loving these I feel like I've also loved the brow Zing's that overall I feel like that these are the products I've used the most don't know if this is still on recall but regardless a two niche NYX is my all-time favorite so it could brow and gimme brow this is like a pomade but it's so buildable and you can go for like a natural look or a dramatic like it cut out fleeky eyebrow look and then the gimme brow is just the perfect brow mascara with like a little bit of fiber in it to make your brows look really nice and dark and really voluminous and everything like these are just my babies I take them every time I travel mascara I loved also saw a mini mascaras but one that really stood out to me this year was the alleged sensational you can say this one's a brand new this one here is actually the same mascara it's just the Gigi Hadid version I just wanted to show you the wand so this is what the one that looks like I just find that this mascara makes my lashes super black I'm actually wearing it here today super cold super long super thick just love it to pieces I went through a couple of tubes of this I'm a big fan loved it and just Maybelline mascaras in general like I feel like most of the time I'm a big fan of them I just find Maybelline mascara is like really safe you know and this one is definitely a big favorite of mine Cydia spray is the glam glow glow cita which is super random I feel like most people would say like urban decay and stuff like that which I still die over those like I love them but this one just really stood out to me this year because it's a little bit different it's more of like an oily kind of sitting spray so it makes you absolutely glow I also love the mist it puts out it's such a fine mist and it smells like lollies you can see I this like every time I show this to you on camera I feel like it's going down down down so I use it so often in my everyday life on videos when I travel goes everywhere with me puts them on it smells so good like this is so good I love love love this if you have dry skin or normal skin definitely give it a go I shed ours this is so cheating once again but I'm just gonna briefly say my remix maleficence oh and the original of course before this came out although I've been working on this for a very very long time so I've actually been using this like you know behind the scenes in my everyday life even before it launched with Qualis yeah I just love these colors I use them basically every single time I do my makeup even if it's just like one color I use it all the time and the new side I've been using it to death in the last few months I'm obsessed and so many of you guys have it given such amazing feedback on this so I just want to thank you guys so much from the bottom of my heart I'm so happy you guys like it and then for lips like nothing really stood out to me other than my own lipsticks but as far as like other lipsticks gosh just been trying so many new things this year like so many different ones I didn't really love like Kylie I loved some of my neck liquid lipstick so I love some of my like oh this is just too many to mention like color pop so many so I just thought I would show you like one of my go-to lip line is first so in general this range urban decay 24/7 lip pencils I loved him I do find him quite expensive but they are so so so good it's so creamy and pigmented and it's actually why I'm wearing it today this color here is naked I'm wearing it underneath miraculous stick which looks just like this bike so beauty it is a creamy finish and here it's gonna look super bright but I just put on top of that kind of dull up around it base and this is exactly how it comes out I love my lipstick so much I poured so much of my heart and soul into these we've sold so so meaning of them and the feedback has been amazing so again another shout out anyone that support EXO Beauty this year thank you guys so much I hope you guys all love your lipsticks and stay tuned because there are more coming very early next year and maybe even pencils too and other stuff yay I'm

hey everyone so I am back with another decluttering series dan from today I'm going to be decluttering my entire collection once again because it has built up since the last little series I did I will link my previous decluttering playlist down below you guys loved it definitely check out the other ones if you don't know what they're all about I'll just quickly run down what I'm gonna do I'm basically just gonna go through all of my drawers and get rid of heaps of stuff I'm not necessarily just throwing it away I'm either giving its family and friends if it's something I've used a bit you know that I can't donate but something that's new I like to donate it or if it's near new and can be easily sanitized I will donate it and then anything that's just revolting and old that just goes straight in the bin and I do also put stuff aside for you guys think of ways a bet all that stuff is brand new and amazing so follow me on Instagram if you want to into some amazing giveaways I like to do decluttering as frequently because my makeup collection grows so quickly I get very overwhelmed with the amount of makeup I have in my drawers I find it so much easier to try new things when there's not a million new things to try it just gets a bit like over the top decluttering is just a good way to figure out what I have it figure out what I love and what I should get rid of so hopefully you guys enjoy this series once again let's dive in so today we are finally going through this huge a liquid lipstick drawer you can't even see like what they called little like dividers I've got in here because this is for me piled in piled in piled on top so I think the first task is going to be just removing everything out and then kind of reintroducing things in and I really want to call it down the colors because I have so many similar colors I just think I need to really you know decide which colors I want to keep and get rid of something because it's just too many it's too overwhelming I don't actually go into this draw anymore because I just don't even know what I'm looking for anymore like it's just so much you know I mean okay so I'm just going to take all of these out and put them at to the side of me and then yeah we'll filter them back in okay so I've completely emptied out all of the shelving I've got my little shelf open just here so I'm going to check and even I definitely know I want to keep straight back in here and then we will organize them last and then I'm gonna maybe pile over next to me over here somewhere and then I've got this box here for ones that I'm getting rid of naturally since these are look products most of these are either gonna get thrown away or give in to family and friends I know there are differently some really old ones in here that I'll probably just have to throw away but yeah that's pretty much where we're at any brand-new ones they don't want I'll definitely donate because it's just nice you have to give back so yeah let's just get started so straight away like I see these the NIH's liquid lipsticks I just found these very very runny and I don't know they just were really hot to use for me so I'm gonna give that to a friend and then my Jeffrey start like crazy colored liquid lipsticks I'm going it to get rid of those also I'm gonna keep a couple of my favorite ones but other than that I'm just gonna get rid of the rest I really love the formula don't really use them on my channel I definitely want to keep my dose of colors sand liquid lipstick this is such a nice like beige kind of color it's actually running out a little bit I probably need to get a new one I don't even know if they make it anymore anyway I really like that so that you can just go sit in it now we'll put it away in a bit what's this one pinky promise this is a really stunning color but I don't know if I really need it it's very similar to an ineffable bike so beauty might just give that to a friend I definitely want to keep this this is a Stila stay all day liquid lipstick I haven't got the chance to use it yet its own Ruby no it's like the most beautiful super dark red so we'll keep that I've got so so many Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipsticks in here I need to go through them I'm gonna keep some of my Smashbox liquid lipsticks these are really really good you guys but there are a lot of colors here so I'll just choose my favorite ones oh my god look at that that's so pretty this one here is in the shade out loud I love this by the way my next decluttering will start back at the foundations like last time I just wanted to do this drawer first because I've promised you guys and a few different videos that I was going to do my liquid lipsticks needs because it was just like you know there's just so many so that's why I'm doing it today we've got a retro matte by Mac this is in the shade carniverous oh that's stunning I'm gonna keep that one see this is the thing like I'm gonna get closer so similar this is Heather's by Anastasio Beverly Hills I'm gonna swatch every color and sometimes I'll just speed up the footage when I'm not really talking just cuz you guys like you know the sound of the click clicks and all that stuff you guys always say that these are almost identical so I'm gonna keep them Mac one actually I love these Sephora luster mattes I'm gonna keep that this lip gloss I might get rid of the lip glosses I just don't use them you know oh my god that's so pretty this is the Too Faced melted met in the shade wine not it's actually quite unique it's like a very purpley deep color I love it I might just keep this gloss though because this is a butterscotch by in size of people Hills a nice nerd it's such a nice color to it it's stripped by color pot I'm just gonna end up keeping most of these anti oh my gosh you guys I love that love love this color go for girly by Mac this is so old but I'm gonna keep it I think it smells okay okay actually try it on my lips if it's grossly and I'll check it out that I think it's alright usually you know when it's going off as it really rancid like plastic smells so should be fine men is just so much so basically I'm just gonna like keep fast-forwarding through all of this just like just for this one because it is like this so much stuff and then I'll talk you through the ones I'm keeping at the end so you guys can just kind of watch you know listen to it if you want to fast-forward that's fine by me okay so we have filled up an entire huge box right here so um we're doing pretty well I think it's good we've still got a whole nother pile on the other side so I'm going to do that one next oh my god okay so this is what I am liquid right there I'm pretty proud of myself so now I'm going to organize them into like the brands the you know formula and all that kind of thing and I didn't keep many glosses because I just don't really reach for glosses they're often I just kept like a few kind of like essential glosses and ones I like and then for liquid lipsticks I definitely have a type you can see like a general color kind of hair so I may filter it out a little bit more may not we'll see how many I've got left of us still a lot like tons I'll get rid of some more but this is a good starting point and then I do actually have heaps of liquid lipsticks up on my shelf that I'll do in a later date like at a later date video you know what I mean so if I'm missing any color is like they'll definitely still be here look what keeps a color pop Clinique Sephora collection Kylie cosmetics dry cosmetics and some other brands just yeah up on my shelf so this isn't all of it but yeah so far this has made a huge dent so now I'm going to organize and fast-forward again okay so my Jeffrey's Tywin's I'm just keeping for personal years I'm gonna kind of like order them can you even see hold up stop ordering them a little bit by color I've got these at 3 concept eyes I wanted to like actually open them see if I like them these are well this is the shade lose I'll usage what even is this oh it's like a bright coral color that's quite cool and then there's one more in here somewhere where is it this one here is in the shade vanity Oh needs to be shaken it's a really nice peach shade oh my gosh this lighting nutter it's cloudy outside once again that you can see it just there by the way these are my makeup pence so they covered in stains please don't be too burst out let me know if you guys have a pair of makeup pens too I actually have like five pizza that's besides the point so I'm keeping it some of the always on liquid lipsticks by Smashbox I really really like these this one's a metallic matte and it's like this awesome lilac color then I have a darker Brown and a light beige nude it's not really a dark brown it's like a medium brown and this metallic red which I used last year this is called maneater loved that one and I've got this one too what's this one called true grit that's like a darker darker brown I really like the formula of dam so I want to keep a fear and then I have some of my old what are these called be legendary long wear lip lacquers I really like these as well and a couple of like more coral shades look how cool this color is this one here is called Slaton yes slight head nice and then I have my dose of colors shades I can't brick a kit stone and sand I think there might be another one in here yeah is this one too which is called Merlot there's really really old so off to check the formula of those like on my lips oh my god why are you doing this to me okay and then I kept some of my mounted mats by Too Faced so I have here filling myself I've got why not wholly shake and granny panties I think there's a couple more as well this one here called it suck it it may not seem like it but I have it seriously it cut down on my Anasazi believed Hills liquid lipsticks I actually had like 50 of them or something like that so I'm just got a handful of them there I'm just putting these in random places for now until we are done and then I will properly organize them kept a few of these I haven't actually tried them yet I don't think or maybe I tried one I can't remember maybelline vivid matte liquids just a pink one and berry one and then I like more and then I have some of my favorite kiss me shades I really like these with stains and narrow this down now so like it's looking a little bit more easy to manage its face some Kylie liquid lipsticks the rest of them actually and my storage up up there like I said so they'll come back down here when I organize all of those ones as well and I have a bunch of color pop okay so as far as the losses at guard I've got one drugstore one here the L'Oreal Paris lip gloss in the shade 103 protest wing so I'm going to put the glosses probably up in that corner but first I just want to go through my ones that like like just like wanna hear what you can't see yet so I pretty much kept most not all of them but most of my Kat Von D colors so mister deck these in the corner I'm gonna go from like darker colors to lighter ones I'm gonna get rid of that one of these ones cuz I just hate how there's like one hanger go over to the edge here sore at these two shades a Ludwig and a philia I to be honest they look so similar so I'm just gonna get rid of one so we have a 21 of those left next up I'm going to do my BH Cosmetics liquid lipsticks I've got most of those live cuz I love them so much feel like these are all the same color princess cha-cha-cha-cha okay so told them it's a lot I'm just gonna keep one of them I'm just gonna keep it shot I'm pretty sure I've got another one somewhere there's like an odd number there too but sure I do next I'm just gonna move all of my kiss new idols up here about two Cosmo double ups this happens a lot when I start getting sent like doubles are I like by some get sent the same ones so it's no check the actual shade there they go and then I have my color pop shades so I've just kept some kind of nice nude some of them are different formulas some of them are ultra men and some of them I like the settin ones and then these ones all look similar but that the next lingerie in today would have like half of those and then I have my herd of beauties which I'm just gonna put up here too and then I'm going to put my neck ones up here I have some more hood of beauty at liquid lipsticks just here they put the lips jobs and these are liquid mask rush and trophy wife already have trophy wife so put that Nick give away with something I mean I have all of these lip blends cully's so I'm just and then I have some of these chichi liquid lipsticks which I haven't even tried yet so I wanted to keep a few shades um I'm just gonna keep all of these ones Thor's true look very similar organizing bicolor is actually going out the window because the more I look at these the more I kind of want to keep them all random because it makes my I focus on different colors that it sounds really weird but like when they're all in order like these ones how they're all the same they just confuse me whereas when they're all over the show like I go towards certain colors and it's easier for me to separate them so I'm gonna just do it like that got my four one by the way what making so beauty lipsticks very different draw so we'll get to that at some stage although I'm not really good decluttering those my couple of those Kylie ones racially lip glosses so that's good I've got a couple of em indicating vise shapes here and I have a couple of it drugs mimic shades the rest of them are up in my shelf at the top these colors are kind of similar they are somewhat the same color apparently and then I'll move over my Maybelline vivid matte liquid and have a couple of ziwei colors once again most of measure way up and at the Shelf so we'll get to those at some other stage and then I may switch and swap some of the colors like put those ones there for now but who knows my mellow liquid lipsticks I love it love love these I'm just gonna fill up like one drawer and I have a couple of these makeup geek plush liquid lipsticks and then it's some stale ones as well and then some single random ones that I just like like colors from each thing so I've got like a top one I make a Max Pony effect this is a buxom liquid lipstick so they can all just kind of chill down here somewhere a couple of my pretty amazing but bare minerals which are probably due to be thrown out so and to be honest but they can state if now okay now I'm gonna move over everything's on the corner that you can't see down here just over to this side and that's what we left with I am so proud of myself and look what I just spied these are all new shades I was gonna do a lip swatch videos there's so many more of the BH Cosmetics moans I love them so anyway I just thought I'd show you a little overview so this is what I'm left with I did get rid of like so mini and it doesn't mean that I don't like what I got rid of like this brands in here I thought there's rubbish I couldn't see the actual lip gloss but there's a lip gloss in there anyway there are so many brands in here a bloomin adore and love and colors I love but I just really had to college because I was getting way too overwhelmed like I've said a million times and it was just too much so just because you see all of these brands in here and colors and things that does not mean that I don't like them anymore anything some of the stuff I do really likes to but I'm just trying to try it new things or you know just downsizing in general so this is what I am left with I'll just go over it once I started to so I've got heaps of kept one day at the back just cuz I really do like them and I like the colors so I got rid of maybe like a third and then it kept the rest which are the ones you can see there and then surprisingly I actually kept a lot of lip line ones and they're not ones I usually reach for and have used them a few times in my videos but I don't know I don't normally go for them so I kept lots of them so I want to try them somewhat and I just love love love the colors so yeah I really like those and there's some really cool like bright pinks and stuff and some really deep tones that I don't often wear that I really want to try and get into a little bit more and then of course May - Christmas got a couple of fun colors in there name some of my neck once I got rid of quite a lot of those also but I get some really cool muted shades some like corals and oranges and nerds like really different nurse like real orangey colors and really gray and brown colors that I don't see a lot in other brands and Kylie I've got so many more Kylie hiding away so often moved them around later some of my Sephora collection and some really bright shades like in here is mellow which I adore the chichi ones like I said that I want to try some next lingerie which I'll probably narrow those down a little bit more later on in life because I feel like there's so many nerds but it's okay for now I mean some kiss me up back still I because I love those daily colors by darn with them enough so I'm gonna give them a bit of chance and then some Smashbox and then some of my favorite colors from jeffree star cosmetics that I just want to wear like in real life and get use out of them and then I have some of my favorite shades from Anastasia Beverly Hills so there's still a ton of different colors I feel like there were a lot of nerds left look at that lighting so in a way I feel like there's a lot of notes left I did also keep some really fun like purpley shades I kept like there's like a blue somewhere where is it okay cool that one is this one is called teal with it I've got some Browns I've got like tons of different breeds tons of different pinks obviously tons of different nodes I've got heaps of dark colors I've got some corals so I'm pretty well covered anyway I've still got all of my lip suits to go through later on in the series as well so I'll find some more really cool colors then as well I recently did my MAC lipsticks which I'll link down below if you want to watch that declutter and I have some really good versatile colors there so I feel like I've still got every color I could give it of a need for a tutorial it's kind of scary for me like letting go of a lot of makeup for that reason I don't want to be stuck one day when I'm recreating a look or I've got something in mind for it to Drew and then all of a sudden I don't have the right color but I mean I'm pretty sure I have a bit of everything in here still like there's definitely a lot of stuff so hopefully that's all good I've got so much space now to play with by the way these are the glosses I just talked about them quickly so most of these I'm matte liquid lipsticks or creamy matte liquid lipstick I kept my buxom lip glosses in four shades so I got rid of a few I got rid of most of my Anastasia Beverly Hills kept a couple of nerds I don't really wear lip gloss unless it is transparent like translucent what nude or pink so I only kept a few of my all-time favorites it keeps in this house you don't own away and I kept a drugstore one I really like and then a couple of these bytes ones which super delicious as well because you I just don't often go for those no go for something share I usually do like is share liquid lipstick weight something like this one which is like a tent hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and if you did please thumbs up sorry there wasn't as much likes watching and talking and this one I was mostly just like that ASMR like super relaxing you know noses and just lots of reorganizing and chucking stuff away

to America recently got back I'm just putting like the same placement a body shot on my nose because this is going to so dry I just got back from the states and what I learned is in the state my glands were really swollen I saw these got worse and worse and by the last day I was sort of sick I've been so sick I'm on antibiotics so hopefully I'll be better soon and it's just been the worst worst timing I'm just going to use some of their Too Faced hangover primer because that's how I feel is and I'm not hungover I just feel like my skin is so dull and dehydrated right now because I'm sick and be honest I haven't been drinking enough water I have been looking after myself at all I have been company ting I have been not exercising I have been not drinking water I just been light in this black hole of just just like so over everything but every time I put on makeup amazing feels so much business so pretty much I already filmed this video so there was another thing that just went completely horribly wrong because basically you know I'm launching my highlighters and I'm so busy this month you go through it so many videos planned some collaborations with companies and some new stuff and bringing out which you guys has no idea about and I'm so excited to launch it but you know I just got all this stuff on and then I film this launch video and actually really happy with it because it was a very honest Qi check it Riddhi with me it was a really good life update I let you guys know what's happening it was very emotional and I feel like that was really important because I want you guys to realize that you're not alone and anything you're going through like you're not alone and I not feels like you're alone I feel alone sometimes and I really wanted to chat to you guys as well because we're not all lost oh that sounds so corny but it's true so I found this really deep to check it rid of me and watch video for my highlighter zone it just made me so happy like by the time I actually got around to putting the highlighter on my face it was just so much more at peace and just I was so much happier my makeup is like therapeutics managed heading to you guys like well I'm by myself in my bedroom and it was just around a really good video and I hit watch but you are done and I was so happy because as I said I'm so busy this month and I was going to get it ready I was going to edit it last time I clicked on the video in none of the sound recorded whatsoever and I literally just cried like I cried and cried like nothing in my life right now is going right like I don't think life can get much worse at this point and so putting on makeup just makes me feel so much better and I want to talk to you guys about what's happening in my life and the highlight is I'm so excited about like so excited cyst with Dan like I've been working on me since the same time as I started working on my lipsticks and liquid lipsticks so a really long time and it took a while to get them exactly how I wanted them I'm just so excited and I'm going to show you a couple other things so no feet down I'm going to use a Mac Jake is remarkable and ivory light I might have to mix a little bit of my darker color in looks very pale so what are our new brushes this is one of many one of many these are my new brushes I love him so much they're adorable I showed my friends on Sedona and they would obsess this so saw fears no I can't I know you'll be thinking what the heck but let me get to that in a second so these are called nipple brushes this is called the large buffer nipple brush and gm0 circuitry so basically this is to apply product also the detail work so I'll explain soon anyways you knowing that you're using a round top brush you don't want to put the foundation strange the brush because it kind of like sucks in so this one is one of many ways your users like pop the product on the nipple and then once you put some pressure on the brush then the bullet Zing's straighted and then you can buff another level edge you can also use it to get into deep areas like a rubber nose right under the eyes and the brush is going to come in a few different sizes the foundation probably was not ideal to use today while my skin is super drive it well so mix in a little bit of the darker color photo yeah these brushes is you can see a pink light pink and then like a copper barrel there's just a cuticle thing do it look at him so cute huh so what else has been happening okay I know I look pale if right now but we're going to do some cream contouring so that's why I lift my foundation a little bit paler because by the time I add my cream contour to like bronze up my face a little bit if they make sense when I try the shade from the pro glow tightest palette can be used it so I'm taking the medium buffer I would like to go a little bit above with my actual like hollows are just because by the time I winter it will come down a little so I'm just using the little nipple yeah now I'm just going to apply more pressure and blend I'm going to use heart-shaped tape and fear under eyes and still under size on this I think it's okay I'm not as obsessed with it as a lot of other people are I think and then I've just wiped off my medium buffer and I'm going to uses to use it a little nipple to get right in underneath so pretty much these brushes are just really good if you like to be able to do stupid detailed you can use them to really carve out so like it was nice sharp line something and under my eyes I'm going to use the summer bisque powder by BM arrows to set and this is a shimmery lip brush I'm going to use the sandstorm they met Thailand by Rimmel I got back from the states and my family member and Hospice which is basically you know where people go to die my family member to talk about this on my channels before has terminal cancer but because of their age they couldn't do the test because it's in her pancreas they couldn't do the weapons procedure it was too dangerous and everything sort of a lot dies she's hit bypass surgeries and all sorts of stuff they basically can't test the cells so there's a all the stuff anyway and they can't tell how long she's got left or like anything like that so like I don't know I guess I was living and lombardaso I know like they could be wrong to know that like you know like maybe she's got a while to live like she was so herself in the most she had like this stroke thing happen in her spine so she can't walk like she's in a wheelchair this is sense pretty much my birthday last year I'm just all of this crap has happened it's just broken me and all of my other family members apart it's just so horrible because this person is basically someone who raised me I'm so close with and it's just like seeing such a strong and happy person reduced to this where I came back from America and she couldn't even talk to me it's so messed up I saw her right before I left and I gave her hosting curses and you know told how much I loved her and she was okay she was at home like she wasn't okay you're still dying but she was at home and this has been really hard so I like the past few days me and my family have just been there you know that's all we can do and I think she definitely understands us like she talks sometimes just not often I think she's just so I don't know if this is the end I don't know anything the doctors don't know either like no one knows what's going on all he knows like she's not talking I would just keep me on powder because I'm like sad I'm just like packing on the powder right now so it's middle of May you go pro blow now so yeah I definitely think she's aware and understands like I'll go blow kisses and she blows she goes back to me I've never experiences before I've never faced anyone close to me going through cancer so that's very naive and I didn't really know what to expect or anything so it's been really hard and I just don't want her to be in pain before like she was happy and cheery and lovely and talkative even though she was in a wheelchair and stuff even though she had cancer even though all of these horrible things in here but she's still o strong I'll never take that away it's just horrible and it's hard to adjust to I'd like because I just talked to her yeah whether she's asleep or awake or and I told her I was like you thought because she's obviously been filled in with every aspect of my life I'm very close with her and you know she's known that and what hell does make up for ages and she's just obsessed like she is just so proud and I said when watching the highlighters next week and then she literally label it up a little bit like I think she was just so proud I like told her about some other stuff that we're working on and you know just chatting like just chatting about normal things because other than like this other than my job I don't know what else to talk about because what else I've been doing lately is just being at home crying and being angry like I've been so angry it's horrible I feel so bad for him ish by me I just don't know how to comp it's like I made the crying or I'm angry damn it Shannon I'm feeling better this makeup like putting on makeup literally like Tom's me down I know I'm not the only one like it makes me feel more human I don't actually care about the end products just the process of putting thought it makes me feel so much beauty anyway I want to blow my nose but it's going to ruin my makeup okay and I know for a fact I will not be the only one going through this right now so Cindy hopes Jenny I'll start dealers dealing with it okay now I'm going to take the sweet tea baked bronzer by Too Faced and a did fiber brush it's going to use this bronze on my cheeks a little bit and bring a little bit more color into my face you know what like in real life my foundation actually matches pretty good it's just the cameras making it look flushed out so you know if that's what's been happening in my life right now one of the most dearest love of my life is dying and I can't do anything about it and just honestly everything that suits against ma'am Sobers am so stressed I have a meet up soon which I'll share more information about on my social media so go check that out I think I probably have a post up there you know it's in Australia Canberra and I was like talking my manager like should I be doing this like she's like look we can cancel it then I was thinking about us wish to change always comes to meetups with me and he was like Shannon you so happy when you do meetups like I think you should do it and it's finally Australia if anything happens we can fly right back and it's only for a few days mother's like yeah you're right because honestly like as much as I get like really nervous to meet people like I really do I'm so shy and so awkward and I just I'm bad at small talk and stuff but when I do these meetups I and just on such a high after so it's so happy and I love it so much that you love meeting you guys so I thought you know what I'm going to do it and it's going to be good going to be fun so I'm looking forward to it now okay now I'm going to use the Urban Decay brow box and at brown sugar so this video isn't supposed to be a big for me it's not how I want you guys to like take it as for you guys to know like if you are going to anything am I alone I have themed it seems log so by the time you watch this video I have a blogger on my second channel I'll link it down below of my us a trip they want to VidCon I think this or something like that it works I thought today I could try Evan to K Jean that Michael a biscuit I can't pronounce that name I'm sorry I've never actually heard of that I mean this is dope I am doing a supply say I'm going to do something similar to the video that didn't work out for me but yeah I just feel like trying something so I'm going to try that sickened it shade down which is called a limitation and this is a firm blender brush just going to apply it into the crease now I'm using a little bit of shade not the salary as you can see I'm just kind of swiping the colors on at this point and I will blend it soon it's just a fluffy a blender brush this it's just checking then I take an eye shadow brush with that top color which is called enigma highlighted the brow I literally cannot even see this on my eyes I'm going to write a little bit of sucker-punch this color just here underneath my lower lashes it's a little bit and then I'm going to bring a little bit of that on the outer V and I'm also working on a paint which I can't show you not in packaging which I love I line it dries matte black and it's so pigmented you wouldn't believe so I'm just going to use it today so I'm still testing it out use any black eyeliner you want this is an eyeliner was this a just eyeliner brush I'm going quite far out rather than Lee we are told my girls I'm just going to use this brow jaw pencil could still in highlighter both billion dollar brows and mole water love I'm going to use the potty sex lashes I think I might use the wild one today okay I just got mascara everywhere but that's fine fine my lip is also bleeding that's fine too I'm fine I'm totally not falling apart okay the lighting is not ideal the let's do the highlighters so a link is down below I have prices at fifty five New Zealand dollars which here in New Zealand I think is a really good price of course if you live in America and stuff like that - strange roots make this like probably quite princess view and I'm sorry but I am a New Zealand business so I have to factor in all of the costs associated with you know running a business and you Dylan including paying my staff good wages and GST tax all of that crazy stuff in the shipping cs35 a New Zealand Dollars there are two shades to start with just to see you know how people like them so we had loosened and Aurora and sorry I've got fingerprints all over these I have been using them but the packaging looks like this it's beautiful and it has a really nice closure at the front I love that sound and it has a little sticker on the bottom of the name and all the information you need you do get points three five ounces / 10 grams which is a really good amount of product it is slightly higher than average these are cruelty free and paraben free and vegan friendly and basically I created these and it's be a little bit different than what's kind of trending at the moment which I know sounds stupid but as you guys know I love suitable finished products I love radiance I love highlighter but I don't like the shimmer associated with a lot of highlighters well sometimes I do but I mean on an everyday basis I just want something that will make me glow make me look youthful just make me look radiant and healthy do you not I mean so I created a product that is more like that a word with my lab and we created this really nice finely milled powder and it has a little bit of rennet that once you probably or face it just glows and I guess you'll just have to wait and see when I apply it I mean you've seen me apply it in a few videos and in some recent videos bring it like I was wearing it in my unboxing haul that I just uploaded on Saturday I'll link it down below so you can see how it looks and it's just so beautiful so yeah this is buildable I'm sure you're both the shaper so this one's Aurora at this one here is lucid so Aurora's all that lighter it's more of a pinky champagne and then Lewisohn is a little bit more sandy a little bit more golden they're both beautiful they do both go better for people with Sarah to medium skin tones if you have super duck skinning you like a blinding highlight it'll be okay but if you want to be natural it won't look as natural viously because it's quite a pale color the reason buildable is so important for me is because one is easier to use no matter what skill Liv you have and two you can create custom kind of effects with it so if you're just doing a really light daytime look you can just apply a little part of it of your face and it will just help to brighten your complexion or if you're going out clubbing at night and you want to look fierce and blinding you can just build it up a couple times or you can even use it wet like wet your brush and appoint weight and make it look crazy so the first way I like to use is Pat I'm going to use as a shader Lucent is with a sheer powder brush so this brush is quite flimsy this is perfect for applying it sheer amount of prep on your face so one way I love to use this pattern it's just all over to glow which sounds crazy I like to highlight all of your face that doesn't sound safe but with this brush it is possible I'll just do like half of my face so I just like to do a little dusting just right over my forehead cheeks under eye area and you see that slight low compared to the side like this is some of the radiance that also looks incredible on bare skin like you do not need to win foundation with this it's so finely milled it's almost like a Photoshop filter compared to some other highlighters that really accentuate all of your fine lines or wrinkles your pores this one it definitely it glides over a lot nicer of course you can still see those things because there's just skin you can't remove those things permanently at this radiant glow highlighting powder sound like an infomercial this lammle glides over and it hides those things a lot better than other you know highlighters so if you have an issue with uneven skin texture and stuff like that and you just avoid highlighted this one maybe a bit of here so when I actually want to concentrate this product on my face I love to use a rush life of this which is a small face brush or even something like this shimmery lip brush to something a little bit more dense this small face pressure my ultimate favorite so I'll do one shade on each side so this one here is Lucent once again so stack them on my brush okay hopefully you guys can see in this lighting I'm obsessed with these you guys like obviously and I'm just sort of happy that they're a little bit different I don't know just radiant looking at someone's wet looking you know it's not just sure of course is an element of shimmer but it's not as intense and some others so completely transparent if you love shimmer and frost and just you know those kind of products then maybe this won't be for you and it's totally fine I'm again the only person that's got this so far so I'm the only person that can review it and tell you guys about it and I want to be honest this is more for those of you who like buildable you like control you just want to glow you want radiant glowing and radiant other key word here so it one more layer so you can see how it builds up so that is Lucent on that side I'm just going to watch my brush and flop it over so when you swatch it as well and may look a little bit powdery that's completely not worth because it's so finely milled it's so fine so don't worry about that so okay here we go this one is Aurora here's one past season a little bit lighter and pink here if you have fair skin this one's really goes well because it actually is really really really pale so lucid Aurora on camera they look semi similar but really they are quite different I will swatch them on my hand but they really do apply it much better with a brush when you really them in when you swatch them with your finger they can be powdery so I'm going to do it I mean you better remember that this is not how they're going to look what's on your face honestly they look so much better on your face as you can clearly see but here's how they look so the top one is Lucent it's a little bit more sandy the bottom one is Aurora global pinky white champagne this one I like and that's how they look on your face and I was this I also like to take them on my nose and chin and everything I'm going to use Lucent for this the slightly darker Sandia color these just I could literally bathe them these yeah that's the project I've been working on for ages okay let's finish off is this makeup look with the lips and my lips destroyed as you can see but let's do it anyway I'm going to use the shade Firebird lip liner by urban decay and then I'm going to use a wavy severe by EXO beauty this color does pick up every single bit of dress and you love this event in my launch video this is best when you have nice hydrated lips but okay the smell of days every time at the launch site oh so good so that is my limb to check it with my wife update video I hope you guys enjoyed it but it wasn't too like up sitting or anything I know it's like not the best I know people come to you to to escape stuff you know people come here to happiness and joy and I'm sorry today's video wasn't that but I just like keep it real like you know I'm only a human and I have struggles and I just hope that the fact that I'm sharing them with your gives some issues of peace knowing that you're not alone as well so yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed the highlighters my hair is oily is so it's just pretend that's not happening oh okay I am going to go now I hope you guys enjoyed this video like I said and if you did please give me a thumbs up I'd really appreciate it and all the links to all the products I used to know we down below and yes I'll talk to you guys in my next video hi [Music] [Music] 
hey everyone so today I am at testing out the $1 makeup so if you saw my previous video if you haven't you should pause this video and go watch it right now look it down below basically I did a giant haul over $1 makeup and brushes and lashes and stuff and yeah I'm going to try it on my face today I make sure really excited for this because in the last video when I was watching it some of it looked pretty decent some of it of course wasn't so great but I mean a lot of it was better than I thought so I'm really excited to see if it performs really well on my face so let's just dive right in just a disclaimer I'm not trying to do any kind of like crazy makeup look today I'm not gonna do any cocktail inspired look today today's video is just like trying this out I'm just gonna do like a pretty basic makeup look so I'm gonna start this a or a studio one disking Mehta fiying a primer so the spray here when I used to on my hand I felt really nice and hydrating even though it says it is met like it feels really moisturizing and quite thick hate the smell of it though it smells disgusting in it she makes my skin feel really good okay next I'm using a foundation I think this is me to be a foundation brush because I can't see anything else alright here we go here's one foundation brush so these are the like foundation products I found on the website so I'm just gonna try and fun when they like mitches me slightly I think they're all completely wrong to be honest because they all look either very pink or dark and I'm super pale right now and I've actually got quite a like yellowy undertone this is probably the closest we're gonna get it's a little bit pink but not too bad this is the a new floors liquid foundation in the shade Caribe so I'm just gonna swirl some of this on my face this is probably the part that I'm most nervous about because I have not had a good experience with stupid cheap foundations and stuff before I can say liz's sometimes okay that whole see this is gonna be white your diet for me look at this that smells terrible oh my god this is horrible it's going so thick and pitchy look at this and like bright orange I can't even like blend it I don't know if it's the brush or the foundation or both oh look at that honestly this is so bad like I don't know how anyone could make this look good no matter what I do with it it just smears and go straight here and I've got dry skin on my chin and it's just like latching to them and not covering anything it's just made my skin brighter I hate it so much more and more orange the longer I light it is look at that obviously it was already the wrong color but like it's oxidized so quickly oh it feels so thick this is horrible I think I might have to use the concealers I got just like all of my face because that was the closest match ahead light yellow maybe light yellow will work let's try to light yellow I'm just doing this on time [Music] okay so with this concealer I am just going to do some stripes all over my face oh this doesn't feel terrible but it doesn't feel very silky smooth like it's quite dry I'm going to use a foundation brush of my own because that other one is caked and make up from there other terrible foundation okay this is working better Oh it dries quick so they blend together okay it doesn't look amazing but it doesn't look bad you know what I mean like it's just whatever it's a little bit cakey looking but I mean I did just put it all in my face and it is a concealer so I'm not surprised it looks a million times better than that other foundation that's all I'm gonna say thank you la studio ones I cover concealer in pale yellow at least my face is even now okay let's do some pata I believe this is the only one I got it's called the clean Easter priest powder in the color suede maybe the wrong color probably I'm going to use this a ouais to your brush which is like a powder brush it's a very soft but not dense so we'll see how this goes [Music] everything smells like grannies when it's like affordable makeup or not affordable makeup shake say super cheap makeup this isn't even affordable this is like the cheapest you can get I would say I can't even tell if anything's actually going onto my skin yeah I think it is actually it's quite decent a little bit cakey but I mean decent I'm more excited for like the lip of products in the eye products in the face products because I'm very fussy with foundation and powder even the blushes and stuff I think we'll be okay the contour I'm not so sure about because it looked very orange when it comes to makeup I've always thought you know it's better to invest and higher-end or like not even hiring just like good quality foundation and powder and good quality skincare because the rest of your makeup all of the color cosmetics and everything you can usually make almost anything work a Lego does a really good affordable foundation I've done my first impressions I'll link them down below if you want to watch them alpha cos minute so some really good really cheap foundations for like 3 bucks so 5 bucks or something like that I'm going to use a little bit of this bronze eye with the same brush this is called the govt USA San that glows shimmer bronzer I'm going to use a really small amount when I swatch this like you can even see how much just went off one tip when I swatch that I was like wow that's pigmented using a very light hand this is like crazy pigment there's something that costs like a dollar I still don't understand how they can sell stuff fertile it's like elf cosmetics you know how they have that dollar line like how can you sell stuff for a dollar and make money I just don't get it like eBay you know how you buy stuff with eBay for like $1 free shipping from like China like how are they making money off this I just don't get it it's actually quite nice because once you buff it into a skin you can't hide out see the shimmer it just gives a nice like bronzed look I probably should have washed these brushes before I use them but oh well okay if a blush this one is so pretty this one it is by scent a it's called the mineral blush in color are too packaging is very extra but the actual color so nice so I'm just going to use the same brush again because this one works okay oh it's pigmented really gonna buff it in this smells like ass it's what colors really pretty though if you're looking for a nice peachy pink blush it actually goes on so nicely it blends out so nice - it's super pigmented it's almost too pigmented okay guys I've transferred to the floor because the lighting up there was getting I control so now you can see it the colors better obviously I have not contoured and my base is not the best but you can see they colors really pretty the blush color it's just very intense and the bronzer is quite orange now that I can see it in better lighting anyway let's continue I think I'm gonna move straight on to my eyebrows now we have a little angled brush just here and then we've got this eyebrow essential kitten ash brown which is dot a if I thought ash brown would be like you know an extra brown like a light su Brown not a dark like black look it comes with little stem cells I kind of want to use them but it's probably not really a good idea yeah the packaging feels cheap AF like it's like very like bindi feeling called it clean at color brows essential and this is the color you know it's just a light brown this is gonna look so bad okay let's do it like I said in my whole video um I don't mean to be harsh on products that are cheap I know it sounds like that sometimes but I'm just trying to give it the same treatment is anything in terms of just me being honest I'm not gonna be like oh this is so great just because it's cheap do you know what I mean just because something's cheap doesn't give it an excuse to be crappy so I'm just giving you all of my honest opinion so you can actually weigh up if it's like worth the hassle of actually ordering antinomian like some stuff you know I could be like holy crap this is so cheap and so good so that's great some stuff I might have a bit of it constructive criticism but you might still think you know what it's still on their door like I'll give it a go so that's why I'm just being honest and you guys can make your own decision if I say something's good you know it's good you know I mean like I don't want to say something's good and then it's like actually crap just because I've said it's good for the sake of it being cheap that's not how I roll hopefully that makes sense this color actually doesn't look bad it's very patchy though I think you can see it for your self help patch it is but the color isn't as bad as I thought it would be it's just like working to certain areas with my eyebrow and this brush is really thick so it's kind of hard to get a nice defined line I had this tinted brow mascara Framus browse by clean color this isn't the shiny dat Brown at black this packaging feels really nice it's like rubber like nas packaging it feels really cool and then if we open it that's what the brush looks like is quite big but the color looks okay it's quite warm for something that is brown black like it if you had brown black eyebrows this is probably not the right color for you it is very warm and not that dark so it's probably better for me but even then I don't know if it'll be too warm or not it feels quite sticky I quite like it like I can really feel it sticking my eyebrows down look at this you see that like it really sticks them and makes them feel like I've just put like hair spray and my eyebrows and then back home to them alright that is intense I'm actually kind of impressed I don't know if it's like practical but it's not bad if you already have thick eyebrows I would definitely stay away from this but if you have very sparse thin eyebrows could be good because it really does volumize and make sure highbrows wife they could then what gimme brow does it's just kind of hard to use as you can see it's kind of getting everywhere if it was like a smaller brush applicator this would be like legit it's just very messy it actually feels like my eyebrows are like stuck like glued super glued down oh I might just quickly contour so I've got this little contour trio by a Mears in the shade natural and it looks like this I'm going to use this little brush here and none of these colors look great honestly I'm just gonna mix the two darker ones they all look very warm so yeah I think this is gonna work out very well oh this smells so better what is it with like these cheap powders Oh God look at that that's oh now I feel like I have to do the other side to even it out this is not going well I'm gonna use this color here to highlight my cheeks this is from the LA Colors trio in Magnolia it looks like quite chunky when I sweat from my finger but we're gonna use this fan brush thing and give this a go what that works my skin looks it's okay here it's not funny most of you use some of this on my inner corner you know my brow bone oh my goodness that looks a bit crazy now I've got this LA Colors met eyeshadow quad I'm gonna hear some of these I can't find any blender brushes maybe this is supposed to be the blender brush but it's like giant I don't know I'll just use what we can I am going to take this shade I don't know I'm just going to press that on at the eyelid this is in at the shade Mehta effect you must bring it all over my lid I'm gonna take the other gray color which literally looks almost the exact same with this giant blender brush it worked I think if you were just practicing with eyeshadows these are quite good I'm sure they must have nicer color combinations when I did go on this website a lot was sold out so it's probably half of my issue so I just had to like get what I could you know that the actual formula of days like they're not like the most pigmented things in the world but they work I'm going to use some of that like dark charcoal almost black color and they can go on the outer kinda half of my eyelid and I'll bling that in I'm gonna use this mu smoky eye eye shadow this is in the shade titty and it's really warm it's like a warm Brown gonna use that blender brush again and just kind of like pop some of it in the crease this blender brush is terrible it's huge and it's fluffy and it's probably not even a cleaner brush but that's what I'm using it for and then you can get better brushes off eBay to be honest even though these probably I you Babers I mean maybe they've got other sets look this particular seat just has a lot of like nonsense an edge you know what I mean like a random brushes like bullies and stuff where I would like more blender brushes and things like that this is like going halfway down my face cuz this brush is so big these actuators are quite nice the amuse ones I like them so it's how the eye makeup is looking I'm also got these eye shadows I might use one of these just on my eyelid this is in the shade six santé I should have styling comp it how many years that call out my finger I'm just gonna press that on my eyelid it's okay this is very similar to the kind of makeup I started out with when I was like you know really young in like intermediate school when I used to just play around with it it's not the best quality if you're already used to you know quite good quality makeup I don't think you're gonna find any value in this kind of makeup but by the way I'm taking the hot pink now if you are brand new to makeup and you literally just want to buy some cheap stuff to learn with you know I would say go for it because you know these facials are quite easy to blend they're not the most pigmented it's not the most exciting and the most fun colors and most pigmented but it's easy to blend I'm going to use this your eyeliner by clean color - to do it there is a liquid eyeliner and a pencil eyeliner so I'm gonna try the liquid I thought it was a brush tip but it's not it's felt Oh looks like we're doing fig eyeliner today oh god I miss it's the actual formulas this is pretty good it dries matte and it's quite opaque it's just that I suck with these applicators so I need to disregard that a dry super-quick um both sides of my eyes are very uneven but like check out that eyeliner it's like black it's mess it's quite nice so try out the pencil side - it's just like an automatic pencil oh it's sharp ah it's so hard it's like no color payoff either just like make my waterline kind of light gray I would still get it just for that side though that's really good if you like felt-tip mascara this is the mascara I chose it's the M useful you mascara there's been some incredible cheap a if mascara is back in the day Liebeck giordano lash extreme water it was called this is pretty good buy man it's gonna be kind of hard for you guys to see my lashes because I did such a thick eyeliner okay I want to slough that way it's just fine ho swim you in and look down or you can see the lashes but they look decent right and then for lashes I got these car lashes these are 100% human hair I hate these ones so I'm gonna use these ones today these are in the shade shade these were in this style 213 and they're very natural-looking mine with scars like everywhere so you need to make sure you let it dry and let apply carefully look at that that is a mess here's how it the eye makeup looks up close you see my skin's quite like chunky I've got black everywhere like a very cake you're looking but I mean it's not terrible oh my gosh I can't get it off mascara apart from the fact that it's Missy is actually quite decent I quite like it eyeliner I really like it I wish it was in a brush tip applicator but that's just personal preference and that brow gel is epic just Missy so now we're pretty much just got to put on our lip color I want to use one of the liquid lipstick so they looked really good in the whole look here's a brown eyeliner super gel intense by Cente I don't really know if it's working okay it really doesn't do that much to be honest this lip liner is by AOA studio and the shade faded oh it's sharp it's just like a nice kind of nude color it's not the best lip liner I've used it's quite stiff and sharp it's not very creamy so I don't know I'm not that impressed and then the liquid lipstick has also pervaded by a RAF studio it's the Wonder met liquid lipstick it smells so bad of cherry but the actual formula like look how pigmented that is why cherry like why is every affordable cheap as makeup brand cheery standard of all things so the liquid lipstick is drying it applies really evenly it feels quite thick on my lips though a little bit heavy I mean all to get that my makeup doesn't look terrible you know what I mean like it looks okay the contour is disgusting like that is terrible it's completely the wrong color it's orange it's even too orange to be like April do you know to me the shimmery bronze I quite like it it is quite orange also though the blush I do like it's just very very pigmented so use a very light hand the mascara was good the lash is a good the line is good the brow mascara was good just missing the Amir single eye shows definitely my favorite eye shadows I used today the other ones you know that would good for beginners the easier bling and stuff but they're not the most pigmented or interesting the formula is not super amazing the concealer is decent like it does conceal really really well it's a little bit cakey though the powder seemed to work absolutely fine it was a little bit cakey also but nothing too crazy what else there like I the highlighter is quite intense so that was good the eyebrow powder I didn't really like it that much was very very powdery and very patchy the liquid lipstick now that it's almost dry it definitely feels it a little bit sticky but for a dollar they're great you know what I mean apart from the smell I can still smell it if you don't like artificial cherry like me it's not the best so yeah I really hope that this video helped you out if you are curious about the makeup on shop miss a for a dollar I would definitely suggest checking out some of it hopefully this video helped you decide what you're going to try let me know down below in the comments what product you're most excited to try and let me know how you think it came out like what do you think was the best product and let me know what you thought the worst product was I'd love to hear from you down below here comes the Sun oh good it's so bright anyway I really enjoyed filming this video it was a lot of fun I definitely need to do more videos like this so I will just talk to you guys in my next video bye [Music] 
hey everyone so today I have a at current favorite video I know I haven't done a monthly favourites in a while so sorry about that I don't even know why I just haven't I thought it was about time I dated you on my favorite products as well as some products that who just do not like it also stay tuned and see what they are most of these are quite new favorites and then I also have a couple of older favorites them just going to show you again because you know kind of like rediscovered them and just in obsessed with them so I know start off with the perfume I've just been wearing pretty much everyday even though it doesn't look like it this is a relatively new bottle but yeah this is just been my go-to perfume this is among Paris Mon pari I don't know anyways by YSL and it is just such a beautiful like quite classy a little bit sweet a little bit slower which is like a perfect everyday scene and I love the bottle it's so beautiful and a cute little kind of like a squirrel packaging school I love that word little black bottle with the cute little bow as well and it just smells so fresh and ahh so chic it's just so good another YSL product that I have kind of like rediscovered not like I've rediscovered it because I always use this like this is one of my go-to foundations I would say I've just been using it a lot in the last month or two it is the wire cell fusion ink foundation I just love this so much because it's the most like lightweight beautiful foundation and you can apply it share or full-coverage just by building it up sometimes when I'm just like you're running out of the house and I'm just going to run errands or jobs or whatever I'll just put a couple of stripes of this on my face and I will just buff it out with a big brush and just do a nice sheer layer gives my skin a little bit of coverage in color just to like even out my skin tone a little bit it looks way too jacked me right now because it is I have no feet tan on right now I usually leave a little bit of fake tan on so it usually matches me yeah I just like kind of buff it out and it just makes your skin look smooth and velvety it lasts really well it just looks beautiful it's one of my favorites so what I've mentioned that quickly I do have a first impression on this ages ago holding it down below for you another favorite this is like new ish to me I tried this - the best time I think in my full face first impressions which had a whole lot of fails in it but this so good I have been wearing this I wear makeup and it's all good and makes my lashes huge voluminous separator just everything I want it's Maybelline that colossal it big shot volume Express and it comes in this yellow it kind of golden chroma package it is just so good so this is what the brush looks like quite big but it works really effectively I'm kind of slowly getting back into like the bigger purse or brushes yeah it's just so good one of those things are just going to trap yourself and see if it works for you I am like a big fan of Maybelline mascaras I always have been ever since I was in high school so I'm not really surprised that I like this but I really really like it it's like one of my favorites another one is like an old favorite like something I've shown you in the past but I have just been consistently using especially lately this is a face cleansing brush in its by vanity aplanet I just got out of the shower so it's kind of damp either this morning it's called it the vanity planet ultimate skin spa I'll put a coupon code down below and again just can't it's not a commission code or anything like that they just work with me and offer you guys the clothes so you guys can say the crest on our money it will give you 70% off slow come on that's amazing I'm actually really excited cuz I showed this in my bag unboxing halls they seem super close I've got new colors so this is the original one which I've just been continuously using so my shower there I'm kind of excited she is a pink one for this thing but yeah they've bought out pink and purple so this is how the pink one it look it's service you can super pretty look how pretty a new look this comes with the same three heads it's the exact same thing this is just the original blue this is the pink one so to show you this one quickly so you can see how it arrived you get this case which is really handy for treble and then you have to read at different brushes this one here is my personal favorite even though I'm using a different one at the moment but this is kind of like the one I usually use just day-to-day this one's really good for a little bit more like kind of scrubbing action but it's talking to enough to use every single day the bristles are so soft so it's good for you if you have sensitive skin normal skin dry skin oily skin layer doesn't matter even if you've got acne it's so gentle that it's not going to irritate your skin and then the last brush in you get this like a little bit tiny bit rougher but not still so soft and so gins but it's just a little bit firm I think firm as a bit weird but these are exfoliation so this one isn't really good just to use like every second day we're in third day whenever you need a little bit of exfoliation on your skin we've got to feed seasons 1 &amp; 2 and I usually use it on one just for everyday use I like to use the morning before I do my makeup and everything just cuz it helps to kind of buff away dead skin cleans your skin really well and it just makes a really nice smooth base so your makeup to go on top of and definitely a favorite I love this thing it's so affordable so that's why I like to talk about a few guys mr. bliss to another skincare product I've seen it really enjoying I've been using this quite a lot over the last couple of months this is the Apple mint fresh mask by skin79 you guys know how much I love my Korean at skincare so this is a Korean skincare brand just contains Amazonian white clay which is really good just to clean your skin exfoliate your skin that kind of get rid of any dead skin cells and excess oil it also includes witch hazel which is really good just going to pause like for minimizing and it's got little scrubby bits in it and I get really young keep going that's why I like to use like this I get a lot of dead skin cell build-up so things like this and then things like this I can just kind of exfoliating mask a really good for me I'm not sure if you can see if it's got a little scrubby bits in it I think you can the way I like to describe this is it's like a toothpaste for your skin and the reason I like to call it toothpaste for your skin is because it makes your skin feel really slim like I said it exfoliates and make sure skin so smooth and also like the maintenance of it just makes your face like so fresh and so clean and so minty I don't know it's just really refreshing when you use it it kind of reminds me of glam glow because when it dries the clay kind of pulls out all those excess oils out of your nose and out of your pores so it's really really good and it's really affordable too I'll have links to everything campin new okay and not a couple things I've been using all the time to like in my everyday makeup routine and even sometimes when I go to the gym which I know sounds stupid I mean I never used to wear makeup to the gym I mean I used to way back but then I got really confident going to the gym with no makeup on I've been going base the gym recently and I don't know I've just been wearing these at the gym because they just look so freakin pretty but still so natural like it doesn't even look like you're wearing makeup and I do think I'll do a tutorial so stay tuned for that just like my everyday Touro on makeup that takes like five minutes and looks super good the best thing is the benefit tinted primer this is another rediscovery like I've talked about this before and think I've talked about it in a favorites video and the basic it's just a really dark brown that liquidy a tinted mascara formula and it just makes your eyelashes looks naturally long like you can't really tell you've got anything on your lashes it just makes them look perfect like in a very natural way and it's also a really good as a face so put this on before your other mascara and it makes your lashes look so much thicker like it's just such a good primer I love it alone at the gym just because when I've got no mascara on my eyelashes look non-existent I've got quite long natural violations but they're just transparent so something like this just makes them look almost tinted and lifted and I prefer that look at the gem rather than wearing a black mascara that looks really really stuck on my face so I love this so much and then the other thing I think this was in my first impression video as well this is by Pony effect and it's like a lip stain lip tint kind of product and being it using two shades of this quite frequently is the other one so the first one is the shade that I bought in the video that I first showed it called romantic breath and then the other one that I wear sometimes is called okay I can't even read it because I've printed right over top of the name but that's what it says them if you go on the website it's just like a watermelon kind of color looks like this if the lighting doesn't want to look like crap please okay there we go and then romantic breath this is why I use more frequently finished and it's just the perfect everyday like pink you color it just kind of goes at my lips a little bit of color I'll put it on and then I'll leave it for a few seconds I'll kind of wash it with my finger just to make it look really natural just stain to my lips a really nice flash to color because my natural lip color is very dull so it just kind of gives a little bit of life back into them I love this so I got the only thing I would say I don't like about it is it's a little bit sticky it doesn't really bother me that much next favorite is a boy wash you guys know how much I love nobody watches this bunny here in the new one obviously you can tell we're ready used up two of these so you'll see in my empties video this is by the brand bonbon which is a New Zealand brand it's made of like Hamilton or something I think I remembers but anyways hand made in New Zealand it's vegan and cruelty free Peter approved and it's okay oh if only I could send every single one of you one of these like you guys are missing out honestly go buy this it isn't all Hamish is obsessed as well this is favorite one I also love the unicorn one the pink one if you go on the website you'll find it but this one just smelled like heaven on earth I can't describe how much I love this I just mix it together when I start using I mix the scrub in it to the body wash and then I just take like a dollop on my finger put it onto my sponge which it and it lathers up so amazing it la does that better then liquid boy wash because it was my concern is this going to lather is it just going to be like a cream you know but you really do feel sort of clean when you use it so good I can't describe to you how good to this I bought it for like my friends my family I was just like everyone everyone had like Oprah's everyone you keep I wish you get a body wash you can this is another thing that I've told about a videos before is going to hear on it yuck sorry I expressed Mendel for this but this is their chichi it like meeting bronzer with yellow undertones I'm wearing it today as a bronzer and the light you can really see because you know Lighting's always always bite me in the ass here you go you can see now so my favorite shade is the lightest one I love this because I am a seer person and it even works when I've got a bit of a tan on like just is a really natural light bronzer that I can build out the actual texture of these is so smooth at so buildable they are so easy to blend I just love them so much and I've been using them a lot lately and in my eyes as well just in the crease just when I can't people they're doing proper makeup like even sometimes at the gym literally like I'll just put some of this around the edges of my face and on my a crease just to give my face a little bit more dimension so I look like a potato you know I also showed this in that first impression video too so this is a new favorite this is the color pop okay someone told me how to pronounce to name I'm so bare so so so I key sabaki sake sake I can't remember I'm sorry I feel like I'm offending people I'm so sorry like I'm terrible at pronunciation this product she created in collaboration with color pop is freaking good color block is so cheap first of all these are incredible quality color eyeshadows or literally are just as good is like nas Mac and it stars easily over anyone in my opinion they have colors in particular oh this is the Shiki palette or chikki the cheeky palette these eyeshadows are perfect for everyday wear these colors go so well together I'm obsessed with them they are incredible and you need them hopefully you can still buy them otherwise go on the colour-pop website and just buy heaps of eyeshadows because they're all so good I need to go make another order like I've got a heap of them but I need more ok any all of them every single one don't even care just take my money this color here I'll swatch for you look it's so pretty cutting tools how pretty is in this creepy lighting key here we go thank you thank you they are so smooth and easy to blend so pigmented look at this shine so beautiful in this color here to like a brown pillow like we'll look at that so even no patchiness so we're great oh my god I will keep this in my collection forever and ever and ever I love it so much it's so perfect so another color pop favourite doesn't say know what I'm I go to like net liquid lipsticks to the month this color is called naughty is the ultra matte lip and when the lighting wants to change I'll show you what it looks like because this lighting is this is it here it's just like a deep pinky beige nude like it's not really a deep mood but on my skin tone you know it's not super pale on my skin tone it's a really nice just wearable nude color and it's just got the most beautiful undertones it's so flattering it makes my lips look quite large which sounds weird I'll show you a picture of me using it or wearing it there it is here like my lips just look really nice in it I feel I don't know I really like it and it goes with any makeup look as well because it's just like that really nice neutral look Brown not brown nude color sorry oh there's one more thing I wanted to mention that I always feel awkward mentioning my own products but hey I'm going to do it because this is just my go-to lipstick lately this is mine s lipstick info locally by XO beauty this color is just the perfect everyday color it's the perfect kind of more be pink and it goes with everything no matter what my eye makeup looks like no matter if I'm wearing natural or heavy makeup it just works and even that's net it's not drying whatsoever and it goes on so smooth that's the color it's just a perfect color in this work on people with super pale skin like white paler than me right up to darker skin tones it works with so many different skin tones smells amazing there's like I'm actually wearing it today so you can see it does not look drying on your lips at all and it goes on like butter just loves it so much I'm so proud of it you guys and if you check out these forgiving website who owns nicked it you she got EXO beauty website you can see reviews on the product page like to scroll to the bottom it will say customer reviews and you can read what everyone else has to say about it because most people think to love it too so that makes me happy okay time for the products I hate or that'll someone that I hate list and then I'll finish with the ones that I despise okay so this is the what I hate Li you guys know if you watched my first impression with it I tried it again and same thing like it was just sort of orange and I hated it I liked the application I liked the coverage I like the finish I don't like the way it looks taking it and goes bright and plumper Donald Trump buzzy-bee oranges if Smashbox Studios in shaping foundation I want to point out I freaking love Smashbox I love their primers I love a lot of their other foundations I love hips of Smashbox stuff as you guys know this one here was just a sale for me like it just did not react well to my skin I don't know what it is I don't know I don't know I don't also play my skin girls using with it I don't know it just doesn't with me so you guys can do your own research if your hands this product don't just take my word for it because I have seen other people raving about this so I don't know what I'm doing wrong this is not actually the shade I use the shadow users like buried under this pile of makeup on my desk so this is just like a random color but basically what it is is a contour shade on one end I'm just keeping this new so I'll donate it actually to work someone outfitted in me and then on the other hand you have your foundation so it's like a foundation stick the perfect shade over contour on the other end it works for some people just not for me I'm not a fan if only it didn't oxidize on me okay the product I freaking cannot deal with okay I've used this literally like eight times like I try to give it a decent go but I don't know why it just hurts my soul this is the Urban Decay meltdown and makeup remover cleansing oil it stick I love image decay as you guys know I was almost every single is the decay product is in a tribe so it's really excited for this they've also got other makeup removers but now I'm terrified to try it in anyway this looks amazing I was so excited you can tell I use it my back this three-phase oil-based bomb goes from a bomb to liquid oil to microphone gently dissolving even the most stubborn make up the stick format is portable and treble friendly molex no risk of a confiscation I think on two schedules and stuff like this it was irrelevant apply directly on dry skin and massage gently until the product melts into a liquid form splash with water to labor and then rinse off so doesn't see here avoid your eyes so I assume you could use on your eyes anyway as you can tell I just like to put on my lips put on my face put on my eyes and I would do like what it said I would massage it till it turn into a liquid which it kind of just with second creepy so I did a message off my lip product and it's not like I'm forgetting and licking my lips and like munching on this like taking a bite out of it but somehow it gets into my throat and it tastes like the worst thing I've ever tasted in my life I love oil makeup removers you know like bottom makeup removers and huge heaps of different brands so I was excited for this basically the same thing just a stick none of those other brands give a taste advantage the stuffs also literally it like it destroyed my eyes even though obviously I don't open my eyes while I'm massaging it and rinsing it and everything it's still burnt the out of my eyes and they my so dry to the point where blinking hurt I don't know what was up with it honestly it just did not work for me it got into my sister wrote it got out my nose I don't know what I was doing wrong I've never had this problem with any other League ball makeup remover I think I'll still try the other Urban Decay make it removers because I am such a big fan of Urban Decay this was just no good for me I don't even want to give it to you an ass to try because it was that horrifying like it was damaged me inside anyway I'm going to go now I hope you guys enjoyed this video hopefully you guys have found something new to try out

hey everyone it today I am doing a requested video some of you on Twitter asked me to do this and then I watched a few of the videos watched many MUA and I watched laura-leigh do this video and it looked kind of fun so I didn't watch through the whole video to see what their thoughts were on the actual like finished product I just watched how they did it so I know how to do it I have a tray I have my tea and we are going to mix together all of my foundations and with it and see how it looks and see how it lasts just as an experiment like I mean hopefully it's not amazing cuz this is not the kind of thing I want to do on a daily basis you imagined someone coming out to me on the street being like oh my god hold foundation are you wearing and I'd be like I have got a little catch I'm only going to mix together the foundations that I have already used cuz obviously I've got probably like 20 foundations that I'm saving for first impressions that's terrible so I'm not gonna use those ones I'm really gonna use all the foundations I've already got open which tbh there are sore blooming mini just a fear and then I've got some of my discs as well some of these are new so I want use some of them but there are a lot guys Wow so for this part I'm just going to like put some music on and I'm gonna put the taste of which foundation I'm using at each time I just want to get it on my face because I'm like highly excited which is kind of sad [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay I think we are done the funny thing about me is I have so many different colors on Foundations because I go from like super pale to like a medium skin torn from fake tan so some of these colors for me right now like way too too Huck and then some of them are even a bit too life I like overall like so five and mixed it but it's looking like pretty dark and this is gonna be funny okay I'm gonna take a little q-tip cotton bud and I'm just gonna mix all of this to get there the color is mixed it looks Ashley quite nice I don't know if it's gonna match me right now but we soon gonna find out aren't we it's obviously a very like yellowish undertone it doesn't look too dark like I don't know we'll see oh no I just drops the little q-tip inside there yeah so I'm just gonna keep him there and I'm going to prime my skin before we put it on we're here is my hair bad so for priming today I'm going to use my handy little at muster prime by Maybelline it's just an old favorite I really like this one because it's quite hydrating but it still kind of fills in your pores just a little bit just the perfect amount for me it's the blur and smooth one I'm really hoping that this foundation like it looks good because I've got Valentine's Day dinner later it's Valentine's Day today while I'm filming this boil so you know hopefully my face doesn't look like a cake you miss because I always like to redo it later I will come back in a little bit and just show you how it's like looking I can't imagine why it would like look at there although when I was like a teenager I used to always mix my foundations together like just like two of them um same with my mascara that always makes like - my scars the should I do um all of my mascara it could be dangerous all my eyelashes will probably fall out but let me know if you want to see me putting on every mascara I have open in my drawer it's probably like 15 or so okay I don't know how much to use so I'm just going to apply it with my little kill pipe man I hope this doesn't break me out and then I'm just going to use a flawless finish Spanish makes a beauty to blend OH I thought it would be super full coverage but it's actually not suppose there are quite a few in there that were kind of like hydrating formulas like medium and lower coverages they're the ones I don't use is often the color is definitely a tiny bit too dark but I think we can work with it today as long as I waste something with a high neckline later it's really easy to blend and it feels quite hydrating which is random like it doesn't feel cakey or heavy it feels very lightweight and even though it's not like a super full coverage it still looks really nice like it's still covering a decent amount this headband is like not even holding my hair back it's useless right now like you can still see all my free khals and stuff but it's actually giving me a nice even coverage on my face it's covered up my rudeness pretty well if you're wondering why might this is so random but if you're wondering what my ears look read it's cuz I wore earrings yesterday and I was allergic to like cheap earrings but I just keep wearing them so my ears get or red and irritated which looks really ugly so just put foundation on top of them it's not what I expected honestly I thought it was gonna be so thick heavy cakey and like an extreme coverage for some reason but it makes sense you know that the other ones kind of brought down the coverage of like the Mac Jacobs and the Tarte and all those ones I thought this would make way too much foundation as well but it's not too bad like there's probably enough for me to use for another like week but I honestly thought it'd be like a whole jar full of foundation after doing this video I love the finish it's like a really glowy kind of finish let me make it a little bit darker so you can see better and it looks really nice like it doesn't emphasize any pores or dry spots it looks so even and beautiful so there you go this is definitely like if this formula is in one jar I would totally use this on like an everyday basis it's like it's really nice I like it a lot you guys should try this with your foundations like if you have like you know three offal I'm sure you won't have like as many as me hopefully cuz it's not healthy but you know if you've got like three or four foundations you should like try mixing them all together and see what happens and then send me a photo on Twitter okay I'm going it to conceal under my eyes this is the nice vanilla can see ally complete coverage is it cold no self net complete concealer my god I love this concealer so about you guys if you have not bought this year what are you doing with your life it's so good I feel like no one talks about it and it's seriously one of my all-time favorites you can use it under your eyes on your face like I use it sometimes to edy coverage to if I'm wearing like a lighter coverage foundation I'll use the shake busted this has been a line demise but I'll use the shade posted on my cheeks just like conceal the redness and it works so good it's so nice it's like high coverage but I'm just putting in my waterline which I know it's really creepy but it works it's like really high coverage but not cakey feeling you know I really wanted to film a pure adult or peridot gemstone series look today but it's Valentine's Day I don't like that it's probably a little bit full longing for Valentine's Day I feel like I should do a romantic makeup so yeah so there we have it now I'm just going to sit my face with some powder I'm gonna use the shade g20 it by cover of dates which looks very yellow but once you put it on it's not so bad and big powder brush this is the vegan one which these brushes are coming back they're getting made at the moment so just for those people asking I think my foundation looks so flawless I hope it lasts well throughout the day and doesn't like break up because that's my big concern because obviously foundations are made from different ingredients like some of these foundation ingredients just gonna like you know not work together and just bounce apart on my face you know how you get separation and stuff and sitting so nicely on my nose as well which as you guys know it's one of those areas that sometimes your foundation can just not sit good on got a huge pimple right here like what is he doing and then under my eyes I'm using a little bit of summer bisque by bare minerals just to sit that concealer down so it doesn't crease too much I might film a romantic makeup tutorial next um because obviously I'm gonna try and look a little bit romantic today and then people can just use it any time obviously it's to life a Valentine's that's today I'm not gonna upload it today but I'm you know like hopefully people can use it for like any date night or any time they want to just look custom it's sexy I hate like trying to be sexy I'm not a sexy person you guys no way I'm Way too awkward for that sheesh so I'm gonna come back in however long it takes me to do my makeup I'm gonna take these earrings though because obviously this is not gonna go with romantic makeup even though I love them they're from kono Lovisa I think I'm gonna go do my makeup and I'll come back and show you how it looks at the end but this is how it looks now shoujo quick zoom in use like obviously you can see a little bit of Patek cuz I put the powder on and I would normally use a sitting spray but I'm not right now cuz first impression but like look how even that looks and smooth there's a little bit cleaning onto this dry spot right here that's about it looks so nice and even you'd say like every hair on my face right now yeah I really like the finish see you soon hey guys so it is currently 12:30 I've actually been finished filming for a while but I thought I'd should show you how my makeup looks all complete and I did film this look so it's coming soon let me just darken this a little um honestly it's looking amazing like so amazing I did add a little bit of my loosen highlighted bike so if you just all over my face to give more of a glow chi wanted to really like glowy look today and since I couldn't use my singing spray that's my next best thing like look how no what's this hello it's looking so nice and even it's definitely a little bit too dark but you can see where my foundation means but oh well it's not like super bad but honestly like it's working so well guys excuse the mess behind me I just did a giant unboxing video would you be coming soon so I'm just winging it my last little update it is currently 5 p.m. and I can't remember what time I put it on but it's been on for ages it doesn't look cakey it's starting to melt a little bit under run and around around my nose I'm just getting like so tongue-tied it hasn't actually like melted around both sides of my nose it's only the left side which is kind of weird I don't know it looks a little bit shiny on my hair but it's my highlighter so that was a really fun experiment if you want to see me do another one then just let me know differently think mascara could be funny but then it's probably just gonna look clumpy AF light let's be honest yeah if you've got any other requests for any crazy videos I like this one it's not really that crazy you know what I mean then comment down below with your suggestions and I'll talk to you guys vini old you 
everyone so today I'm going to do another cocktail series look and I really wanted to do something purple you guys have been at requesting what is it called i screenshotted it on my phone so I didn't forget and I also asked on Twitter once again which purple cocteau you wanted to see any bronze did the same thing again not everyone but I mean this was a very popular one this is a deep purple rain' so it's got like a light purple and they're really really dark deep purple and unless there's vodka blue Haruka Haruka I even know how to say that cranberry juice pineapple juice and grenadine yeah I think this will be really fun to do a look on so need to begin I'm going to actually start my own makeup sex I mean I'm in ages I just like switching up sometimes and doing my earth first where's my headband it is that it doing so hot Nia I could have Diwali gained dressed yet hence the robe my fake tan is still terrible this is still that sale of a new fake tan and it's like peeling off my throat this is so gross I just cut it off I've been scrubbing my body every day in the shower and it's just not coming off seriously I look scaly like I'm just not stuck with life right now okay let's do a little bit concealing first I need to clean my brushes again already and I only just did it don't ask me how this has happened I'm going to kind of double prime flush conceals like whatever you want to say cuz my lids as you can see have a lot of beans a lot of rudeness I am listening to the young young twins in the background so hopefully tight hear it or maybe hopefully you can hear it I don't know this is a jaw peddle brush and then this is their knives vanilla self matte complete concealer this is magical oh by the way asked me to show you in this video we have it new here taste it you guys have been requite denisa ages so I thought I would just quickly come on here and say we do have a new set you've got a black suit with heaps of black ones and then some it really really a pretty combination so I'll just kind of show you real quick just so you can see a little overview so unlike them down below if you this is my favorite I like that pink star ones and like some goals and tell it and submit silver as well I would die for a coffee right now I'm going to actually do my eyebrows after I do some foundation I think I'm going to use some of my cute little shooting stars tape this is just like scrapbooking tape and since when I go in with the holiday 2016 at pellets by Kylie I'm going to take this color down the bottom on an angled eye brush and I'm just going to start buffing that into the crease as a transition shade so actually is a great you guys this brush is also really good for the crease at bust out the color into nothing so if you just want like a transition shade this brush is perfect it just helps to get it real seamless and of course you can build it up a little I'm going to take the same brush with this like purplish burgundy color or show tape now I'm going to take this one you can put that on the outer corner and you like a darker bright purple so I'm going to take this color here this is the take me to Brazil palette by BH Cosmetics I'm going to take the same brush once again and then I'm going to layer that once again on top of that colitis use like highly this is super pigmented this is just a crease blender brush blending the edges and then I'm just kind of building up that color until it looks quite vibrant because obviously purple rain' cocktail is super super bright we want it to look like bright and going back into my crease blender Nora I am not worried about it being it perfect on the inner part down here in here because we're going using color but I just want to make sure the top area is blended really well now I'm going to go back end with the tightening you to Brazil Italian take a really bright purple just so you can remember this is like thanks Chelsea Andale unless this is the look we're going for so those comes a sell back back so it satisfy me you're like the right color you know taking it on at the angle brush again I've just wiped it off before I took this color and you know watch out the darker colors and I'm going to put this on the middle of my I'm going to go back in with that darker color once again and just darken up the outer good now what I'm going to do is take my students tree in a crease detail brush and just kind of carve out it in a part of my eye just like that just flipped it into the crease I'm going to try this color here just want it mixed with the white make it really light business from the BH Cosmetics marble collection cool it stone yeah that's perfect I want to really light frosty purple on top of where I cleaned up I just wiped off that brush I'm going to take at this light purple at once again in the corner and just click blend and then taking the dark purple once again I'm going through you can get inward across the lash line next up I'm going to take a little bit little it's just some glitter eyeliner of something so this one here is Delta door net size - this one is angel a size 3 so I'm going to dr. dorm on the outer edge and then the squad on the NX it's a little bit lighter since there's like ice in the drink I think it always looks like when you do glitter because it kind of like shimmers like ice would and to do this I'm going to use a winter liner brush and then I'm going to mix the glitter with be alert clearly it liquid it glue base so it does into the liquid base stuff and then if this is the darker glitter kind of messing out where I want it first can I leave it like that for now I will make it a bit thicker soon but I just want to do the inner part now so this one is like a lighter and thicker I mean not like a like bigger glitter making sure to blend them this one is so pretty oh my gosh this might be a new favorite it just can't go políticas minutes down below as well if you want to go to just come difficulties or I safe and they're freaking amazing okay now just load it up with my brush with the other glitter I'm just kind of making sure it's really opaque I'm just researching some of that dark purple over the outer V so feel like we've covered most of it up so let's be a little bit more vibrant again okay let's just as our nation and stuff and then we will tidy up under the eyes and everything with concealer once we've done that we can do some lower lash line still this one but yeah that's how the eye makeup looking so far what do you think I think it's really pretty I could definitely do some darker maybe I can find like something died from the waterline of me I don't know so that dark doctor for foundation I'll use a sponge so I'll just go with this quickly for my primer today I'm going to use the Aventa kate optical illusion complexion primer this one is like a pore filling primer but I really like this place is not too a second artificial feeling and then for my foundation say I'm actually going to use the Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour full coverage of foundation and light medium sand it's not like going crazy for Caruso so I'm taking my flawless finish spongebuck for beauty and I'll just Debit around and in Flint and I really like using this foundation with a sponge because it helps to kind of give it a more natural finish yqb that still gives amazing full coverage spray all the way down my nature because this creepy fake tan just my cover up below make it look a little bit more even and like choice myself looks and then under my eyes I'm taking that next I'm a not next NARS concealer once again and I just take it straight on at the sponge just like this and then just apply I'm just going to quickly sit under my eyes and set my foundation base on a bisque and then on my face I want to use my max I don't know where it is to need to clean my room so badly you guys like miniature those videos right put away my makeup and everything but my room is so messy you know I just need to like tidy up the floor and the benches and stuff before I can actually do that I'll just use this this is DG 38 coverfx pressed powder I'm trying to get through it difficult times go like give up soon because I can never get an even distribution on my brush because it's like all across one's life this is just a big powder brush by the way okay just before I work on my eye makeup I just went into my eyebrows because there let's get crazy the eyebrow hitters are pretty much gone now as you can see I need to get them done again it's like a little remnant under the makeup you can see the not much at all today I'm going to use browsing by benefit and I show you three as well by Blair by the way the way I use this is I usually kind of like grow some of the gel stuff but they go good and then I just drew it on by the way I'm using an eyebrow at groomer brush which is makes up you do also and then there's a C clinic just browsing brush on styling at mousse by clinic like I said I use this in my one brand tutorial by Clinique and I really liked it and then I'm actually taking a lip brush let's try out this shade just here from the take me to Brazil now I'm going to take royal lip liner I mean look liner eyeliner by makeup geek and my waterline and then I'm going to go back in with the kylie palette and I'm going to take a mixture of at these two colors just for the really dark purple it's going to start picking that underneath that halfway and then once again this color is your help blend it up and blend it across going blue and then right in that in a kind of area I'm going to take the same brush this color from the other BH Cosmetics just underneath here now I'm taking chichi bad girls aubergine and a look brush once again and I'm just applying a little bit of this and then on it very inner corner and taking Aurora highlighting powder by EXO beauty this was something a little bit more subtle than anything shimmery glow also pull over there right under the brow bone for lashes I'm using at the brave which I've a second to bottom this is it the lid look right here really good alternative to it mink lashes I have been thoroughly enjoying it this mascara the Big Shot by Maybelline so I'm going to use that to do my office oh gosh this glitter and my lashes this isn't going to go down while funding when you're using that unlit glitter adhesive you put in careful not seen your lashes because it makes them so crunchy when you apply your mascara and goes clumpy like you were using falsies so I don't need to have perfect lashes before little bit Oh does anyone else like their lower lashes more than their upper lashes because I do question of the day what is your favorite feature on yourself out of anything I don't actually know for me because I've actually learnt to kind of love myself a lot more I guess so I actually have quite a few things about myself I really like I think one of them would be my eye color I really like my eye color I also really like my lips sometimes I wonder what that would look like with some Egyptians but I like them so sleek them I love these lashes they look so appreciated nor Biglow obviously but look at that so I'm just going to let them sit there and dry I'm going to bronze first and I'm going to use something different I'm going to use the moon lights and illuminating how to draw by Tom Ford this is expensive it's using a medium face brush just to bronze on my cheeks and forehead also a little bit on the nose and then I'm going to take a bronzer brush to do with my tightest probe Alou so posh I'm going to use hit a pop I've been using this quite often lately it goes really nicely with this look I don't know why everything's going to Orange all of a sudden like some dark and then for highlighter I'm going to go endless Aurora and I'm going to use it wit so just take a small face brush or whatever brush I'm using some sitting spray doesn't matter what one and then just swell some in there and apply makes it more intense but it still doesn't emphasize your texture too much sliding is still crap what happened it's going to super cloudy outside I guess that's why to my nose keep it so CH and this looks so much better and real-life stay on camera right now like my makeup I mean while I'm here I'm going to you some of this sitting spray this is the fixing it missed by pixi as the rose water and green tea seriously this lighting is garbage Alec orange I hate everything we're going to have a long lips to lips and finish off this look and look these lashes I mean they're like a dark dark purple lip I don't know let's do it stuff it nice I like this is the very first when I grabbed I just gained my draw against high drama I met the retro matte liquid lipstick probably should have used a lip liner first but we'll wing it I actually really liked it I need to clean up the edges I'm going to use this little brush and a work paint product little applicator and I'm going to use shape very boy by benefit the industrial-strength been using this quite a bit lately but you can tell the lighting is turned to crap but this is the finished look for the purple range you like my phone case I decided fix a beauty so maybe you guys love balloon Zeus make me does so how do you guys think I went this could have probably been a little bit more purple purple rather than like a reddish purple like it's like a burgundy purple this is more like proper purple from that I think it is pretty bangin I love the way it looks I love this I make up those looks some good with just like a nerd or a pink or whatever but it is what it is I always do nerds and Pink's and stuff with these cocktail looks so I wanted to do something way more dramatic today I hope you guys enjoyed this video sorry I'm not very chatty just in one of those weeks you guys it's pretty today thank goodness I am going to spend the weekend at cleaning and just relaxing and recharging I just feel so exhausted I don't know you know sometimes we just get the info we can you're just like wow what a week like so much doesn't happen

oh no you guys and many for you bye bye solo Charles [Music] 
hey everyone so today I'm doing a new cocktail series of video and I thought not cocktail series that was my last series oh my gosh I always do that don't I gemstone series look and I thought I would do peridot pure adult or however you want to pronounce it in New Zealand like I always grow up saying pure adopt it's my birthstone it's quite an out-there color for eye makeup I think and I kind of want to make it pretty like duh I thought I could do something quite you know out there but I just felt like doing something quite pretty so I'm going to attempt to make like a lime green color look pretty and we'll see how we go it might not end up looking pretty but we'll try how does Google say how to say it peridot see you peridot this is more or less the color of a period it's another one it's a little bit more like mmm moldy green $11,800 whatever yeah you get the gist over what a peridot is so we're gonna do that today I'm gonna start with my base makeup while I try to like conjure up an idea of how I can make this look see me okay I have me iced coffee I'm vlogging again at the moment so make sure you check out my cool stripping cold water my thoughts make sure you check out my vlog channel cuz yeah I'm doing more blogs lately so the first portion of this video is in collaboration with Dermalogica I'm sure you guys have probably seen at least a couple of Dermalogica products on my channel or vlogs or whatever in the past Hamish is a huge fan of them all so I used some of this stuff how many years ago it was when I was at you call I'm pretty sure so 2012 maybe something like that I think and the lots of people live at the brand Dermalogica so I'm going to be showing you this little jewel over here today and if you do want a discount code I have one it is Keep Calm ten all capitals I'll list it down below and put a link down below so you can get the products I'm going to show you today for 10% off next during its February and March which it's pretty much isn't it hmm this year is going so quick so basically these two products here we have very air defence booster and then we also have the water calm gel so this little jaw is perfect for sensitive skin and it basically helps to kind of calm any of those associating fat days of sensitive scale my irritation redness dryness dehydration and helps to kind of protect your skin against the elements you know like the environmental abuse of the world my skin especially like at the moment it's so so dehydrated and flakey and just it's not its best it kind of looks okay through camera but it's just like when you touch it it just feels like like I can hear how like it's just not great and I've just been in the sea and the sand and the Sun I've been traveling on planes like I don't know it just makes an impact on my skin so I'm going to be using this today to print my skin before I do my foundation just so that my foundation goes on bit you know a good foundation base really does start with good it's gonna give say that a million times in my videos but it really does your skin is like the most important part of your foundation routine so step one is the ultra coming by Dermalogica barrier defense booster so you apply a few drops of this it's just like this little little drop e so you can just put like a few drops I don't know I just kind of shake out of here because I'm always extra just put a few in your hands and then on cleansed skin which my skin is freshly washed you can just Pat that over and this is basically just something that's gonna sue that your skin and help to nourish your skin now how silly restore the balance especially it to sensitive skin I don't have overly sensitive skin and I just still felt lateis worked really nicely on my skin type which is like you know just quite dry and dehydrated and I guess it is a little bit irritated and sensitive at the moment because of like I said like all the travel I've done so you just Pat it in and it smells so good by the way I don't even know what it smells like but it's good and then you follow up with it these step two of the duo this is the ultra coming back Jenna logica calm water gel and I've been loving products like this recently if you watched my vlogs my main channel you already know for some reason products like this works so well on my skin they really just make me glow like no tomorrow and they just work so well for me don't know what it is it's just I don't know this texture just works well so this product here has hyaluronic acid I know which is really good to lock in moisture into your skin and it looks gel-like it looks really creepy when you apply to scan just transforms and it's so good if it dehydrated dry skin because it just locks in like I said all the moisture rub it between your fingers and it just turns into this like really liquidy moisturizer and I don't know they just works so good for me so I'm just applying this I've got to like avoid my finger cuz I smashed my nail out this morning I was literally it just dragged myself with my towel and my whole nails net but I really need to get them redone so that's tomorrow's job today I just wanted to film I probably put on a little bit too much just in so I'm just not play it down my neck what you should do anyway I always forget though um and down my chest a little bit you only need a little bit I was just kind of like pouring it out so I'm sure you like the texture of it but anyway I think out of both of these pros like they work and mazing together but especially they're moist right so if you were just to try one thing honestly get both but if you were to try one thing that we stress is really nice so if you do normally like my recommendations on skin care if you've got similar skin to me the moisturizer is really really good I think hey Misha's favorite one is the active moist he loves that one he's got like more normal skin than me but he seems to really love that one I don't know but anyway seriously like that just made the world of a difference so thank you so much to Dermalogica for collaborating with me on it this little what portion of the video once again guys check the down bar for the link and check what the discount code if you are keen to try this stuff out because you want to save money right look who doesn't want to save money okay now my skin is perfectly it prepped for my foundation to go on top of it's not feeling all dry and irritated and crap and flaky or anything now like it disgust myself I'm sorry I keep going along but it just feels good we are going to put on this again so in one of my other recent get really was me I think it was my like hot pink one with roller lash by benefit what else did I use I used the Shin explode palette I'll link it down below I tried this out as I said I didn't know if it broke me out or not and I didn't break out after I used the last time I'm gonna try it again and see if it writes me out because obviously if I keep trying it now and it doesn't break it must have been just a combination of traveling and the seawater cleaning up my skin and stuff like that over in the moldings when I was using it maybe not the actual formula but I do know this breaks out a lot of people so I'm so confused apparently there's a Maybelline foundation which is like an amazing group for it which I really want to try but I don't think it's a New Zealand yet oh god this is gonna be too pale for me now probably I should have wet my sponge before I did this um okay I'm just gonna use my angled brush smells so full on this foundation I guess I can just put on this foundation and it's gonna be a little bit too light but I'm wrong like a darker powder or just some bronzer or something I think I used way too much didn't I what was I thinking I forgot how fast finish it goes look at me I look so creepy oh my goodness I remember when I was like 15 I used to actually wear my foundation like this heavy like I used to just pile it on until you couldn't even see any of my skin on today my good old Revlon Colorstay remember um hold on I just need like remove some off my forehead because it's way too much you need a little bit there's such a waste of protection and you're such an idiot oh gosh that all my hair my forehead is peeling up here so I'm so sorry if you can see some rank like skin it got like burnt just like there when I went small like so it's not ideal by the way thank you guys so much for your cute ears of feedback on my feet Eve log you guys are so lovely I love you I'm glad you guys like the smoking pots too when I was interesting I was like is this too much like too much footage it's not clean but it's literally probably one of my favorite things to do in life you know I should know this but when I asked you guys if you live in New Zealand like I do and I know I should know this but I don't does that anyway good to go small clean userland cuz like I need to get my fix this went on so good on top of that moisturiser seriously by the way if you're wondering why my hair's kind of blue it's because I got it done the day before yesterday and that's really cold and it was really yellow because of traveling and the traveling and the going in the pools and stuff while I was traveling and so we over the toned it so the next time I wash it it won't look so blue ok new stuff I need to conceal Oh God my hands are slippery from my iced coffee I can't open anything I'm going to use one of my favourite concealers this is vanilla I'm kind of tempted I'm not timid excited to finish using this up because I've made such a huge D internet and I feel like it's a really good accomplishment this concealer just goes on it so nicely I'm weird and I put on my waterline to don't need much at all I actually feel like I use way more of this product when I do use a sponge but I do like it with a sponge um it's just so smooth I'm gonna put over my freckles on my nose too the last time I filmed it was my natural makeup look not natural but the one where I tried out this foundation I'm sure you guys were probably saying already I'll link it below if not and you know there was like a very natural foundation coverage and today I just want like to not even be able to see my face anymore even though I think my forehead freckles are cute I don't like the ones with my nose can we please pick and choose where our frickles pop up on our body because that would be really helpful this is just the Kat Von D under eye setting powder with my shimmery lip brush and then I like to sometimes when I like to put concealer on my nose just put it just here too just to sit the concealer in place so it doesn't go all pesci okay now that my face is like a potato of one it shade well I should probably sit at first so I'm just gonna use that the Petric star powder Patricks powder I don't even know how I feel about it I don't dislike it it's just that I don't really know what a good loose powder is cuz I don't use them very often but it does make my skin have you said a few times that doesn't make my skin look very smooth so I'm just pitting some all over the stick because I don't think I need any more coverage and this is just like translucid basically by the way sorry guys in my last couple of videos I know I was using my own pellet a few times or a couple times and people didn't like that I'm sorry it wasn't even on purpose like it just happened I don't normally plan to do stuff like that I like to switch shop on my channel in trial it's the different products that's why I do so many of those like full face post depression and testing high-rated testing low-rated full-face of like one friend like i love trying new things so yeah it wasn't on purpose i'm sorry about that and people they say i used my own brushes like all the time it's like literally most of my collection like i have a couple of like BTW beauty brushes a couple of mike jacobs a couple ooh it's hot and my still image is my own so I use my own brushes because they're my favorites and I love them so much and if you want to see different lashes you can search like huda beauty on my channel or something I've got a few tutorials using those lashes and today I was actually thinking of trying Lillie lashes so what seed some Lily lashes and people rave about them so I'm kind of excited okay I can't talk I'm try I'm kind of excited to give them a go so let me know what you want to see on my channel like I appreciate the feedback just know it wasn't really on purpose and I know I'm going ham with make so beauty lip colors like I don't know I'm just obsessed with them and I love wearing them so I'm sorry if just like that but I won't use one today thank you for the feedback like I do appreciate it but I'm sure you guys can also see why like I would use my own stuff because it's literally like my dream stuff and I created it and put lots of work into it and I just love wearing it they make sense and don't hate me but it's like a lash try one video coming up for it so beautiful style because you know just helps when people are looking for a certain style and they don't know which one they want or don't know how they look way back so yeah just put on heaps and heaps of my glam glow glow sitter to give me a little bit of a glow because I feel so met all of a sudden maybe it was the powder but anyway it's fine we'll put lots of highlighter on later okay next up I'm going to do my eyebrows I'm going to use my current favorite which I've ever used one other time in the video that you saw the full face fist impressions I was just talking about before where I tried this shade medium this is the iconic London what is it calling in eyebrow cushion and it went on it so amazing on top of just makes our nation the other day however now that I've powdered it we're gonna try it on top of like a powdered face so we'll see how it goes so I'm just taking the lighter color from the cushion and filling in my eyebrows I'm not going to talk too much while I do those little take is to get through this tutorial okay update it applies just as well on top of powder this stuff is so good it reminds me of those like ink pens like by Anasazi people hijos and stuff except it just got home like 18 million times better because those little ink pens sometimes I feel like they look real watery but it's like a very similar texture that magazines I don't know why my eyebrow is way more ash than normal at least think I'm a little bit carried away whatever decide where I was like really wonky but we're gonna deal with it and then this is the brow Hema but okay I really do need to try the lighter color of this brow cushion but no I like dark eyebrows I feel like am i who was down because it looks a lot blonde or when it's down it looks dark up because of my natural hair color coming through the foils but like I feel like against this color it would be way too dark so contouring with my Charlotte Tilbury bronzing glow with my bronzer brush and the contour shade of course comment down below let me know what gemstone you want to see next in my series I'll provide you how many more do you think I should do like three or four or so and then move on to the next series which I've got an idea of what I want to do let's start with the eye makeup I have no idea what I'm going to do although I do remember let me just check something quickly so Kristen Leanne did look like this I just made her fix I remember just being obsessed with something that was like bright yellow a lime so she did this which looks really cool so maybe I can take a little bit of inspiration from that okay so a couple of pellets I have here this is the it new at Chloe Morello volume 2 which is super pretty look at this that's some nice light pink giant purples neutrals greens Silver's Gray's all sorts of stuff and then I've also got the it Saint since in appellate I get one day with this nice limey it kinda green so I'm gonna try and create something that looks kind of like a peridot I'm gonna start just by popping some of a neutral shade just through in my crease before I figure out where I'm gonna place this green so I think I'm gonna take the shade Nene which is right here from the clay Morello color on my duty of brush this is a tree lip crease brush and I'm just going to straighten today crease so one of my favorite brushes of all time so it really just like blows out the color makes it look flawless so it's colors quite a warm almost like a pinky Brown like it's not pink whatsoever just that I'm tuturro but it's a very very like I don't know pinky a reddish undertone so yeah once again we're trying to create a pretty look today whatever that means like a glam kind of fit okay I really really really want to try this this is this should state or paint the light cream eye color and this isn't it the shade nummy key bright green I'm so excited okay this look may not look glam this may look colorful if but we'll see how it goes okay I'm gonna take a little bit of that into the inner corner this is a very light kind of PESTEL shade like it looks scary in the pan but it's almost kind of wearable just smacking this all in there I don't think I'm gonna do any kind of cut crease or anything um we'll see where it goes okay so first I'm gonna take the shade Exodus from it this palette just here and I'm just going to put that right on top of the inner corner I'm gonna take the shade of chartreuse and the chlorella pellet and put it on top just because I like the shimmer and I'm going to take the shade halo which is like a really nice light golden shade and just Pat that right on the inner corner on top just to lighten it up oh my god that's so perfect I love this color oh my God look how amazing this color is I need to use that color one day okay I'm gonna take a little bit of it shot truce once again and just pop in the middle of my eyelid I actually don't know what I'm doing right now you guys like whatsoever color is really nice it's actually quite wearable considering it's like a lime green and then going to take a little bit of the shades sold which is that green right nice to let just blend that into the sides just a little bit and then I think I might do a little bit of a halo and just pop a little bit of a brown on either side to make a little bit more wearable then I take the shade next to it which is a very light kind of greeny and two toned Brown if that makes sense pop that just there we're gonna use that same color we used at the very beginning to pulling this together and make it hopefully look like prettier okay and then I'm gonna take a little time bit of that mehran color once again on my blender brush just a small amount just to kind of put this through the crease to make it transition nicer I have to touch up there Brown I mean not brown the lime green against it kind of buffed a lot of it away oh I like that I'm just gonna braid up into the crease a little bit too okay and now I'm going to just run the shot your shade right under here just simple I'm not worrying about it being too opaque or anything just like for a hint of green making sure it's more kind of opaque at the very inner corner I have a couple of like uber bright green chartreuse shades of eye pencil so the spine here is the vindicated post-punk glide on an eyeliner that's not as bright as I thought it would be but that's okay I'm also gonna take that halo shade the light gold just under my brow bone on the pencil brush so I have it these blues here I felt like using glitter today because why not haven't done in a while so I have the violent lost Gwynn I have the go get glitter just this color this is not a safe so like I don't recommend putting them in your eye on the top of your eyes anyways and then I've got the glitter gypsy in is it poison ivy and then I have some little stars I'm going to use a fin blender brush for the glitter to try and get like a very specific but we all know how that went last time I tried to do that with the turquoise look I'm going in with the vial boss Gwyn first and just tipping that all the way up like that I just put little stars on my eyes and you come and see them okay I've got Lily lashes I hope these aren't me but I don't know Hotel all day I'm ink okay I'm gonna use those ones these months don't say ink on them that's called opulent I think to pull this look together we just need to add glamour lashes so this is what they look like they're really pretty very long that's so long and just kind of like clustered I guess is that what you would say so I'm going to apply these after I do my mascara I'm gonna try this mascara that comes with the Chloe Morello palette this is the black magic wand wand mascara by ciate looks like this the one's actually quite cool-looking it's quite um I don't know fluffy or something it's not even going on to my eyelashes I know that's a no-no but it's not no product on the wand okay here we go Christmas grime makes my lashes look so long not so much of a luminous just very long this one doesn't have an invisible band so I'm just trying it as close to my lashes as I possibly can I probably should have done eyeliner with these lashes but what is they stole it really pretty so long and so so fluffy so that's the eye makeup and I am actually really happy with how it looks I think it's very pretty so now it's quickly just finish off the rest of the face because it's the main part of the look completed so for my highlights today I am going to use a Finn T a beauty one I reckon I might try this one I don't think I've worn it before it doesn't look like I have it's called hustla baby and I'm going to use face to find a brush oh that's so pretty I really like these highlighters for something intense they quite shimmery but I feel like when you buff them in like I am here it just doesn't look as like I don't know it doesn't just sit on the surface do you don't I mean like it kind of blends in and the shim is kind of bling to get this so it just looks very metallic rather than lots of separate glitters or separate shimmers or anything like that but it definitely does accentuate my texture on my skin but my skin's looking pretty nice right now from that moisturizer earlier it's just quite smooth so it's a good time to do it stunning it's almost like a peach with gold as well I'm in terms of blush I think I'm actually just gonna leave my skin as it is and just do my lips so I feel like with this look just a peachy kind of color maybe like a peachy nude or something like that let me find something now that I've like decluttered all my liquid lipsticks it's so much easier flying colors I need try this because it's like it's kind of thinking of something more like light but this one's not super light for me this is called Desha spice it's the rich roommate lip color by Mac it's very grungy like this color do we like it it's kind of something different let's just roll with it it's different to what I normally would do I love that this look color I probably normally wear it was something a little bit different makes my teeth look so white I don't know though I just think it's cool this is the completed look let me just say I want to see if I've got like a metallic eyeshadow so I hope you guys enjoy it at this tutorial once again don't finish it out the downbar for links to everything coupon code for the skincare I do really really like it doesn't matter if I'm in partnership wouldn't promote it if I didn't you guys know me thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and of course leave your recommendations down below next gyms don't look what do you want to see what makeup price you want me to see I mean want me to see want me to yours and my channel etc etc I'm going to drench myself in this again so good um yeah and I will talk to you guys my next video bye 
hey everyone so today I am going to do a first impression on this foundation here which I talked about in my previous first impression video where I tried out these which did not end up so good I will link the tutorial I mean not just the first impression down below if you want to go watch it it was just not my favorite it's there's your way essential high coverage cream foundation so I thought I would try a different full coverage foundation today the bigger ultimate coverage completion cream so hopefully this goes good okay so I got seen a few shades by Baker and I'm on their piano so I also have the primer so I might as well try this too I'm going to do half my face as always so we can see if there's any difference between each side of my face with the application longevity you know the way it looks this is the bigger velvet blurring a primer perfecting at base I feel like all their products have such long names and by the way I'm drinking coffee because I just woke up like half an hour ago and I'm struggling today for some reason it says shake well lit before use and it's in the shade apricot haze City mill oh it sounds liquidy I kind of thought it would be like a thick thick primer like a professional or something I don't know why I guess cuz it says blurring I thought it would be like pole filling oh it actually is like an airport color okay I'm gonna do this side sorry the lighting just like feels really moisturizing it literally feels just like a moisturizer pretty much oh do I have a pimple it's a super dry piece of skin right here I'm just gonna do a little bit more oh I kind of sits to like a velvety oh maybe that's like velvet it's it's a very like velvety powdery kind of texture yeah like roll soft okay does it look any different between each side not really feels really good though okay now I'm gonna find a color that matches so I've got a bit of fake tan on right now is you can hopefully tell okay so I've got the shade it's and I have the shade at cashmere and I have the shade shuttle and I went through these with my previous declutter video I'll link it down below let's just maybe do a tiny little pump of each color so this one here is sand which it sure looks okay I know some of these I think this one's pale this is cashmere No that bitter that one might be a little bit better with this fake ten and then the last one here I have is a shell yeah which there's a lot paler actually that middle one the more it dries down and it's kind of going a little bit pinky maybe I'll just start out with sand we'll see house and goes hopefully it matches so I'm first just going to do a half of my face and we'll see how to plays I'm gonna do a pump which is a bit much right there I'm just gonna spread it around it feels quite thick I'm listening to like trip Christmas music in the background by the way okay so this is really easy it to blend it doesn't feel as heavy as you think it will just from like the thickness of the foundation when you're like spreading it out on your face like it doesn't feel heavy and that did half of my face so I probably need a couple pumps all over maybe even three pumps if I wanted like to build the coverage but this is the coverage just one layer it's pretty damn good I feel like once again with this foundation let you look up close I'll show you and it just does not settle well on my nose or what so ever but it's only up close that you can tell from far away it kind of looks normal I actually you can kind of actually see it from there where I've got somewhat dry skin my nose skin is really dry a moment just I guess with the change of weather and it's gotten really hot here in New Zealand all of a sudden so even on my cheeks like it's just see something a little bit funny you like again from far away it looks decent that from close up it just looks a little bit like I don't know how I like it's showing up all of the texture of my skin like it's not great man oh my gosh I want to bed run with my first impressions okay we're gonna obviously continue and we'll keep trying it and see how it weighs throughout the day and see how it looks once I said it as well with some powder it might look a lot better oh god it's like probably more than a pump but the pumps like really unpredictable it keeps like blowing out here okay let's try this by the way this is just a flat top face brush which is a common net brush I use for my foundation the color is really good I feel like it's pretty much a perfect match I'm glad I didn't go where the cash Matt I'm gonna donate that color because the yellow I don't know it was intense once I blend it all over my face it looks good I thought it was just gonna be too yellow but it's really not to be honest I feel like it looks slightly better on the unprimed side but it's still sibling a little bit funny especially on my nose like the nose is the worst part it doesn't seem to be gripping on to too much dry skin at the moment but we'll have to see how that goes throughout the day I'm going to see if it's it wasn't any expression lines as well because the last one did really badly so now it does a dark lighting I'm sure you'll be able to see where it kind of settles funny it's not terrible like it is really no that's a lie it kind of is on the nose it's terrible on the cheeks that's not super terrible I do feel like it's still a little bit better on the unprimed side like I said I'm hoping once I put on my powder it all kind of even it out so we'll find out I'm gonna go do that now okay so now it is I've not looked at it close up or from far away it looks pretty I'd like to look closer it looks a lot more smooth on my face but it does look a little bit cakey I don't know if you guys will agree or not I think it does my under eyes are so dry so I'm getting real bad creasing today so let's just pretend that's not happening so yeah that's how it is looking I just want to look it up on you know Sephora or something and see what it claims to do okay so it costs of $44 the it comes about twenty shades it's rated four out of five stars on it Sephora yeah up close it looks really cakey especially like in this kind of area once I put the concealer on top okay it is it's full coverage it's good for sensitive no more dry and combination skin or oily skin so all skin types it's got a natural finish do we agree I suppose so like it's not completely a flat matte I do prefer this finish true at the previous foundations finish what it is a full coverage yet breathable liquid foundation enriched with high concentrations of pigment and water achieving coverage without the cake so I definitely think it looks a little bit cakey just the way it kind of picked up on the texture of my skin and it says it's got heaps of water in it so hopefully it's okay for my skin right now because it is quite dehydrated like I said with the change in weather my skin's just like not super dry just like dehydrated dull and then if you kind of dry spots on my face like my whole face is not dry but I definitely got little bits like down here that are dry supposed to conceal imperfections redness hyperpigmentation uneven texture so I agree with the retinas I definitely think it covers up the redness it covers up most of my freckles however you can still see like the big ones here and a couple of my forehead it's really picking up dry on this breakout up here it's cruelty free and it says you should only need one pump which I definitely needed at least two how if I do felt like I went further on the non-prime side you might have been because I used a bit more like I said the pump was a little bit like faulty so who knows I don't know like I just feel like one pump for me was not enough so I'm going to continue doing my makeup and I will update you later with how this is going it is 10:07 a.m. we'll just say it's 10:00 a.m. so I'll talk to you guys in a bit hey guys so it has been that 2 hours it's 12 o'clock I just do a quick update now my makeup is complete so I'll link this tutorial down below if you want to go what yeah I'm not like stoked I just feel like it's quite cakey looking it does look really really beautiful even and flawless from far away I feel like I could use this at in my time with something like that but I just feel like in daytime lighting if someone's too close to my face they'll be able to see like every speck of texture I definitely I'm liking it so far better than at the previous person version it's just not like my favorite thing you know like I've definitely got other full coverage foundations I prefer this one it just looks very heavy and I didn't even put very much powder on top of it or anything like that I guess I could try to game with a sitting spray but we'll see how it goes throughout the day I do have to say it's starting to cling on it to the dry patches of skin here like really badly I'm hoping it doesn't get any worse but you can see that just there and it hasn't really disguised like it's even like flaking on the skin right here look at this like that's a piece of skin just like waking up and down it's just cold on to what's really weird hasn't really sunk into my poise but it's still I don't know quite noticeable especially now I've put a highlighter on it's even worse like this do to highlight it as well but no and I feel like it's kind of sunken into random spots down here and I feel like it's starting to lose a little bit of coverage just a little bit just down here it's only been 2 hours so we'll see how it goes throughout the rest of the day hello friends ok so a little update it is 2 p.m. feel like it looks almost the same as last time so the dry skin doesn't really look any worse it hasn't faded any more I feel like it's gripping to this dress and a tiny bit more than last time and I feel like it's looking a little bit more cakey through here and up in between my eyebrows for some reason I must have like dry skin there was something looks ever so slightly more cakey honestly Laura like I said from far away I would happily like go out right now looking like this I just yeah like I said I think I've used better in the past hey guys so I have a little bit of mascara smudging that's not the foundation that's the concealer it is now 501 p.m. so it's been on for seven hours I remain visit learn and actually more or less looks the same so I don't know where I'm at with this you can definitely see where it's like caked onto dry areas but I feel like if I used this foundation with some kind of primer water or finishing spray like sitting spray would look so much better I do want to try it again but I'm not like super excited about it I don't feel like it has really faded very much more than that last time there's just a little bit of minimal fading oh Ashley is mmm it's faded a birthday because now my contour looks real hard out intense all the sudden it's definitely creased a lot more around my nostrils and it has definitely faded off a little bit on my chin okay maybe it's not looking as good as I thought from far away it looks really good it's just yeah up close it's just not great hey guys don't mind my hair I've just got it up in a ponytail cuz it's stinking hot today so it is now it just past 8 o'clock so it's been on for 10 hours which is a really good amount of time it's dimly it clung onto this dress and a little bit more at this point and honestly I feel like it's faded a little bit more at this point it doesn't look anymore k Keith in the beginning and in fact it almost looks a little bit more glowy at this point like my natural oils are coming through or something just like on my forehead I'm not sure if you'll be able to see in this lighting or not so overall it's definitely not a favorite but I'm kind of keying it to experiment with it a little bit more and maybe use a sponge with it maybe you're some sitting spray I wasn't a huge fan of how it settled on my skin but I think maybe I could experiment with maybe a primer oil and maybe a sue spray would make it stick a little bit better to my cheeks I don't know I'll have to keep you guys updated because yeah it's tickling faded here it's faded all on my chin but like on my forehead apart from the cakiness it looks really nice so I don't know like I said it's definitely not a favorite it's definitely not better than my Mike Jacobs or my Kat Von D or anything like that as far as school coverage goes I did find this one comfortable I liked the way it felt my skin it's just not perfect in my opinion so that's my review if you guys have tried it out leave your review down below cuz I'd love to hear how it went for you don't forget to give this video a thumbs up I would really really appreciate it and I'll talk to you guys in my next video bye 
hey everyone so today's makeup look is a super dramatic bold Christmas inspired look oh it's bright okay it's a very bold look but I just checked on this light pink lipstick now so you can kind of see how it looks with a different lip color just in case the bright green was a little bit too much for you which I can totally understand if it is but I think it's quite fun and festive it's like the exact color of a Christmas tree I think it's so cool this lip color here is a secret so thick so beauty so you have to stay tuned for that one but I'm sure you guys will have a similar color in your collection if you like this kind of look any kind of nude or even a bright red lip would look very cool and very festive for Christmas obviously so hopefully you guys enjoy this little chitty chitty makeup tutorial fingers crossed because I'm having a mirror of a deck seriously I spilled coffee all over myself so I'm doing another first impression that's why I've already got my foundation on and my brows on just to save a little bit of time so my video doesn't end up being 40 minutes long like always I'm doing a first impression on this bigger ultimate coverage completion it cream it'll be up soon so keep an eye out for it this is how it looks I am on the fence about it at this point in time I kind of want to use this lip color like I said in my last candy cane makeup stro which I'll link down below I actually use this in that video but anyway like I said in that video I just want to do something different for Christmas this year cuz I always do like you know just the classic kind of wearable pretty Christmas looks so I already got em on my channel I want to do something still wearable and pretty but just a little bit more crazy with a bright green look because obviously green is a very festive color green red gold silver so I might do some gold golden green I'm just gonna go in with my ranch pellet in the shade it clarity just on my finger and I'm just going to press fit on it my eyelid oh god it's still creepy okay a musician mochila brush I just I don't know I like forgetting makeup on my eyelids is not going well right now I don't know how I'm gonna feel about this foundation by the end of the day but so far like I'm on the fence about it so yeah keep an eye out for the first impression we'll see if it pulls through it's like kind of caked up on my eyelids a little bit with the concealer so I'm just using this clarity powder to kind of even it all out and then I'm going to use a cream eyeshadow as a base on top of this so today I'm going to use a drugstore cream eyeshadow this funny--i is bold of gold by Maybelline and I'm just going in with a little eye shadow brush to apply this hopefully this is still okay I didn't use this color in like a year okay we're good this is a very beautiful like muted gold color I'm literally just gonna apply that to the eyelid cuz I'm gonna use a different color in the crease and then I'm gonna use my Naked palette today because I have it out because I used it in my fist of Sephora video like highest roads for make a video I'm gonna take the shade naked and I'm just putting it through the crease and this is a fairly new brush and I'm not being scared to really pack that on I'm also gonna take that just underneath the outer half I'm trying this look pretty achievable like easy I mean not achievable I don't know about you guys but on Christmas Day I was just so excited for all the food and stuff I don't want to spend eight outlets doing my makeup although and saying that I probably will be wearing my candy cane tutorial on Christmas Day which took a while most of the time like I just go for something quite simple so this is simple using a round eye brush makes a beauty to buff out the edges okay we can work on the crease a little bit more so that I'm gonna use a pigment I make ice jam and he's one of the Kim K ones this is such a bright gold weight brighter than I would normally go for I usually go for quite subtle Gold's but as you can see it this one is just super super bold so what I'm actually going to do is just spritz my brush for this eating spray when I can find one and this shade here is that yellow gold I'm just going to press that oh my god that's pretty right on top it's very pigmented which makes sense it's a pigment I'm gonna bring that right underneath here as well then a little bit of this goes a really long way okay now I'm going back in with my shitty soy pehle and I'm going it too tight mm-maybe neaten are da cools yeah doc was just a really small amount it's quite pigmented and I'm just going to put that right in the deepest part of my crease and only out of it and they are not going to go in with Island glow which is a lot of gold and then I'm gonna take some of it milder I'll I know which is the funniest I'm like I'm in decay yeah I'm just pulping there and the water line and then I'm going to do some at Blackwing to lino I'm gonna use the wet and wild Omega lino cuz my horns are in my travel makeup bag right now okay so I've tried to do your like thick outer wings I'm just going to tidy up the edge with my little eye to find a brush in some concealer and then mascara I'm just going to use my wise Sal fossil mascara I feel like this mascara is white bumpier than the last time I used it but I still like it just feel like it's like thick is and then for my lashes today I'm going to use some faux mink lashes by EXO at beauty and we're using these once again they are Cupid breezy so so so I also so many times you guys you just need to UM carefully remove the glue I recommend using something with latex and X it's easier to remove off the lash band you just soak them in some like micellar water or something like that and it comes right up I don't know any of my tweezers uh I'm really bad at applying falsies with these nails luckily these are already like shaped to my eyes because I've won them a few times so they're not tear you're hard to get on with no tweezers okay and that lash glue will let dry but can you just check out how beautiful these lashes are this so fluttery and flirty and multi-layered just so wispy like if you love wispy lashes piece of year I just spit coffee all over myself I'm not even joking okay so while the lashes continue to dry I'm going to move on to the rest of my face from the star okay so for bronzing I'm going to take pocket princess because this color goes really well with that crease color years I'm gonna need small brush since I've already done all my own brows and stuff I'm just using this detail fiber brush and whooping this around the temples cheeks my gosh I'm going to run maybe other speaking with my friends and we're going to this like petting zoo with I've got it's not like a zoo so it's like farm animals just like a pet ik now I've got pigs and they've got goods which my favorite animals and dogs so excited my shapeshifter palette by urban decay and a contour fan brush and the contour shed sorry there must be a poster I'm just whipping that under the cheekbone this brush is really good if you want a quick contour and it gives your nice chiseled look to it super soft okay into highlight I'm going to use this see I bought going to use which color one of the golds I think that middle top one which i think is called creek CRI qu e it's gonna use the connect color on my cheekbone but I just feel like on my complexion it might be a little too dark and your like bright to highlight so this is like a gold color but a little bit more subtle you just use anything you want really come on crap ton of that and then the last tip from covering up that glow some more eyeliner the always on metallic met liquid lipstick by Smashbox and this is in the shade kale at my vibe it's just like a metallic green this color it's the perfect Christmas green a shade like this is the shade of Christmas trees I feel like a shiny alien this makeup obviously if you don't want to go green just pop on a red lip and you ain't good to go I have to say this green is just not going on very evenly I'm just gonna take a touch of stalker so there is my green lip glam gold look Ashley quite loved that I think the green with the bronzed skin is really pretty obviously like I say it if it's too much node read pink just whatever you want for Christmas Day like the gold is the main festive part and heaps and heaps of highlighter like I just love the look especially here in New Zealand it's summer for Christmas which I noticed some of you is really weird but obviously I've grown up with some in Christmases I can't imagine anything else so lots of highlighted for me is essential on Christmas Day just to glow in the sunlight I hope you guys enjoyed this

lipstick if you watched my channel you know that already and I've been it so embraced by the colors their life limits put out so far this month is no exception in it this month has some of my favorite colors that yet I talked a little bit about the liquid lipsticks as we go in the packaging and some features of the lipsticks so watch the video to find out more about them but basically I am doing a three-in-one tutorial today where I show you each color on my lips here is a little sneak peek and I show you a different eye look with every single shades or three different eye looks and they are all completely different and I'm using one pellet today so one palette three looks I hope you guys enjoy it by the way when you order life limb it does come in a little pouch like this and then you get a little pamphlet as well I always love to read the pamphlet this month we've decided to send nerds and these colors are to die for so stay tuned if you want to see them on my lips and see how I wore them with my eye makeup okay so I already have my foundation and base never being done because I did film a first impression on the new feat Tyrion Omega range which will be my next video up so get excited so yeah excuse that we are actually going to start by applying one of the shades over lipsticks this is one of my biggest tips when you really want to wear a certain that lip color to actually apply it first before you do your eye makeup because then you can kind of match your eye makeup to the lip shade so for the first makeup look I'm going to do the most minimal eyes I'm actually going to use the pinkest shade just so that the pink kind of stands out so this shade here is called the hip Lee ever after and you will be able to see how beautiful they apply how easily they apply and how I pay oh my god every time I open these I get just like oh they smell like forgetting cream door nuts or something like they just smell so sweet and delicious so good okay I'm gonna get hungry if I keep sniffing this look at that pigment so creamy these liquid lipsticks I legit you guys I really like the applicant is you guys it's just a nice little doe foot applicator it's really easy to use also as you can see these start to dry down really nice and quick and they do dry completely met which you will see so I'm using one palette for all three looks today so the first shades I'm going to take at the first four so we will be going for more of a matte smokey eye kind of like daytime look just because this lip color holy crap it is super pretty by the way it's just like perfect for daytime light is perfect for that time as well but this is the kind of color I would just wear out and about to the office to school like anywhere it's so wearable so I want to do like a wearable at daytime smokey eye so I'm going to start with the shade right here if you don't have this palette just use anything similar and I'm going to buff that into the crease and onto the entire eyelid this look is super quick too by the way also underneath the eye quickly and then taking this slightly darker matte I'm going to put that more in the crease but also making sure to blend it downward just so the colors are really seamless together and then taking this color here just another slightly darken matte Brown going to run that just on the Attic corner of my eye and the outer corner of the top as well and then it to finish off I'm taking the lightest color from this pellet and putting that on my brow bone and my Inuk wanted to of course someone wants to start mowing their lawn like right now it's not even a nice day chill out this I make up it's very like Daenerys the perfect everyday makeup but of course we want to finish it off with a bit of mascara I'm just gonna do the top lashes Nanette just making sure to apply a little bit of a nerd eyeliner and this is the perfect everyday wide-awake beautiful if it less kind of neutral smokey eye just a very minimal smoky eye like very belly this smokey eye the lips are definitely the focus I love that look love this color happily ever after I'm a big fan so that is the first look okay guys so for this next look we're actually going to just build on this eye makeup so first let's start with a lip color next look I'm gonna do is more for like day or night and the lip color is single-a if this look color holy freakin crap looks so beautiful I just want to eat this every time it goes near my nose now this one here is a gloss and it flies so good this is my first time I don't know why I always try to talk while I'm applying these it is my first time using a gloss from live glam it feels so good it's not sticky whatsoever and you can see that pigmentation is so nice as well of course you can wear this on top of any other lipstick but I just want to wear it alone so you can see the true color and we'll do a look to match also don't forget if you are a live clan member and you're looking at these colors and you're like oh I wouldn't want that like I wouldn't want to pay for that although like what is wrong with you because nudes are the bomb no I'm just kidding I know some people don't like nerds you can skip a month free of charge although what you can do is you can sign into your account and you can actually get trade this month's colors for a different sets of colors or a different beauty product even so yeah just sign into your account and you can do all of that which is really cool because I know not every colors for everyone you may not necessarily want to waste your money on the colors that you know you're not gonna wear although to be honest like it is a really good chance to try something new there have been it so many colors I've been like oh I don't know if this will suit me not necessarily from live glam but just in general and then you actually like a force to put them on and it's a different story sometimes they end up being amazing so it's a really good way to try something new if you do sign up to the service I don't think there have been any colors which I've hated yet like I've liked pretty much every single color I'll link all of my life plan videos at down below if you want to watch all of them and see what colors I have in my collection I love this lip gloss it's so flattering I'm so glad that glosses and making a comeback to be honest they're just so flattering on the lips and make your lips look bigger which is good for me so I'm actually going to grab this matte color here which is a darker blue matte Brown and I'm going to just kind of sweep that into the crease and on the lid a little as well if you're trying this look at home you can just use the other like matte color and your crease before this one just to help it blend easier it looks so perfect with this gloss like it just goes oh like a dream this look lost feels really lightweight on the lips - I can't feel it like while I'm talking it's actually a really really good formula and it's not getting stuck on my Invisalign at all now gonna take this like really warm riddick shimmery color and I'm using this just on it that lid all over going back in with that warmer riddick neutral just to blend any edges I love these colors if you have green eyes as well like the lip color and the eye makeups just gonna Paul and then undo thee what line I'm taking this really unique kind of brownish goldish warm color and just running that all the way underneath this literally looks so perfect with this gloss I'm obsessed I'm taking that darker one brown and just really focusing that on the outer corner just to intensify the color and then with this look we're going to use some false lashes just to really make the makeup pop this gloss is perfect day or night like there's all flight any makeup look on the planet really like it's just the perfect nude man it chuck it on some mascara on my bottom lashes you know what that exit was this look it's absolutely perfect day or night because the eyes are a little bit dramatic and then the lip color just really complements the eyes and because the lip color isn't too full-on like that's why you can wear it day or night it's just very universal so there you have it the second look the lip color single AF okay look three we are starting fresh I've taken off my eye makeup and we are using a promiscuous anyway this color is it the perfect like deeper nerd kind of pinky nude color if I quickly compare it to your heavily about after which is the one with the lid on it you can see it's less pink it's a little bit more nude this color I am pairing up with a nighttime fund like smokey clubbing eye because it's just going to complement any kind of a deep smoky eye perfectly in fact you could wear it any day day or night sorry I keep talking while I'm applying it I know this is really annoying as I was saying these really nerd colors are just perfect for day or night because they just complement absolutely anything look at that pigment this is my favorite oh my god this is so so beautiful this one looks so good with just like a really basic daytime like the first eye makeup look I did this would look so perfect but no we're gonna do something dramatic time for the dramatics time to crack it out I just scratched my face with my no I'm fine we are going to start with this shade right here it is a very deep kind of brown one color and I'm going to just start by kind of buffing that into the crease I'm on the lid a little bit I can't get over at this look color it's so beautiful and how many times have I stood up but I have to say it again the packaging it just gets me every at time it is so beautiful as you can see it is made in the USA it is it cruelty-free vegan they're just so pretty I love them this patient is are really nice and easy to blend too and then I'm going to take V it slightly darker warm color again missus and met and I'm to kind of just go over there area back keeping it a little bit more in the crease then you know all over the place I'm just taking another blending brush just to make sure the colors are all up seamless Nene did so blending brush I'm taking that really dark almost purplish neutral color and I'm going to place this directly on it out of kind of corner and then blend that into the crease as well and then once I have it that down I'm going to do the same thing on my inner corner so I'm going to place a little bit of that on my inner corner this is like definitely going to be a favorite of mine like I could see myself reaching for this look color every day now this eye looks a little bit grungy because of those really dark colors and the really smoky grimy kind of look grimy it's one of my favorite techniques of eyeshadow doing that kind of halo look I think it looks so beautiful I'm just taking a blending brush just swirling that around trying to make sure everything's nice and blended and then I'm going to take this last color right here on my finger and just pick a little bit of there right on the middle of that lid feeling free to be a little bit kind of messy to go dick grungy sexy vibe like you don't want to me see but not being true perfect just kind of slapping it on the middle of the eye and then it going back in with that very first shade just to highlight my brow bone in in a corner again I really actually like this color it's really nice oh my gosh this lip color looks so good with this eye makeup okay once again a bit of mascara that let's do some lectures you never have to do lashes of course but I definitely recommend piling on a whole lot of mascara with this look so make it look extra smoky and nighttime now don't forget if you are alive Klan member you can refer your friends and

hello everyone today I am doing my first look for my a gemstone series and so excited I actually tweeted you guys and said what should I start with so many of you said opal but I've already done opal except that's old but there's no point redoing it cuz I'm in love with my old opal look I'll go and get down below if you want to go watch it's got like how many of yours a lot 640 thousand views you should go watch that it's amazing that sounds really vain but I really like it so lots of people are saying things like amethyst is so many amethyst which I'm definitely going to do that it's my mum's birthday except I've just done a purple look recently I think have I let me check okay I did read looks I've done a couple of rage looks I've done like a burgundy look I've done an orangey look I've done a yellow look so I was thinking maybe something green because I haven't done green makeup in a long time I want to switch it up so that you know keeps it interesting oh that's right a purple rain' a couple months ago which was a while ago but I think I'll do Emma this and another couple of videos like after this one today so what should i do should I do emerald yeah amethyst topaz ruby and emerald alike the highest rated is heaps and here though like there's a bit of everything okay so here is a bunch of emeralds look at this so you can kind of see the color tone so definitely use some deep emerald green dark green is one of my favorite colors like especially to where I love wearing it dark green I just think it's such a beautiful flattering color and same goes for eye makeup like I feel like so many people would be terrified of emerald green eye shadow but it is so pretty like so pretty so let's just do something really glam today because I'm wearing my glam earrings my skin is feeling quite dehydrated so I'm going to use the allows primer by Weis LM still trying to decide if I like this or not super liquid a look at that the reason I wanted to use it because it feels super hydrating when I wear it and so silky smooth oh I was gonna put on revile lash but I don't know where it is okay my foundation I'm gonna use the white sell old Alice foundation with a sponge I did a fist impression yesterday it's probably up already and I see it I think I'll like a bit of the sponge I really like it but I just took a long time blinged out I don't even know what I'm saying right now but I just felt like it would bleed out quicker with a sponge and I am definitely right this is beer already it looks so nice on us going close up with the sponge it looks so radiant not like glowing radiant just I don't know how to put it because it's kind of met but it looks radiant at the same time it's so beautiful we're doing such a bold colorful look it's gonna be dark color it's gonna be a wearable color but my store just want to make sure my skin looks flawless with this kind of dramatic eye and I'm just gonna use a little bit of my airbrush concealer boy by benefit just cuz I have some breakouts it's probably not gonna really cover the marula oh my god I've got like a booger at my nose so tonight we are going to the magician's I'm so excited I love magic and then under my eyes I'm gonna use my current favorite which is the light 20 no filter concealer by it Culver marine white I'm so scared I'm gonna like drop my makeup on it look how nice that is so good so to sit my face actually you know why I'm gonna do some cream contouring today okay I've got this naked skin shape shift actually really like the contour powder in this this then it just here I'm not so sure about the bronzer it's very orange and quite talked to me but on the other side there are couldn't washes you can see I've tried them before but I'm gonna use the medium and brush which is coming out soon you guys I showed you guys way too early like production takes a long ass time and I probably shouldn't have shown you as early as I did like people a tour was the issues with something I'm like no it's just how long it takes them to be handmade because all my brushes a hand made over in Italy so yeah there's that they are coming really soon like really soon so I'm just using the very tip of the brush I'll let you guys know on social media when they're actually out too and don't worry we've got plenty of stock hope like there's been a lot of hype about this I hope you guys actually like them like imagine if I'd shown you and you guys got all excited and then all of a sudden they'll crack awkward I don't think they're correct and then I'm just going to apply more pressure which kind of sinks the little nibble down so it's a very natural contour like it literally looks like a oh I'm gonna try some of the highlight shade on my finger this is why not kind of boring like it's not boring but it's just whatever okay I am going to apply some a dream that med powder on my skin to set my foundation because it's the closest how do we have next to me hopefully it's not too pale cuz it looks pale but I'm gonna put on a light layer I really like this foundation I think well I said I likes to my first impression but like it looks really good and then under my eyes and on my eyelids I'm using well rested by bare minerals we are going it to now just sit that down a little bit look how much of this I've used do you guys remember when I bought this I got over in America last time I weigh you so much better like considering I've got so many sitting sprays like I really like this this is the glam it glow it glow it's it s if we're gonna love the mist it like it's so lightweight and then on my chit s lips I'm using the Clinique instant light lip comfort oil this is the mint one love this it's kind of like a droop of the Y it may know why I sell the hourglass one it cost like $80 or whatever it is I love it and it's so minty fresh okay so at brows that's what we're doing and I'm just going to use my chichi brow pomade today oh here's my revitalash okay we're gonna put some revitalash on I've also like I own revita brow I'm just been using a little bit of this on my eyebrows also just got a little bald spot up here we sell both resided brow and revitalash on XO Beauty Shop calm in my favorite I love them where is my brow brush sorry this is an eyebrow at groomer brush oh hello son nice of you to grace us with your presence seriously New Zealand weather is so temperamental well they say four seasons in one day so true I'm so excited to do this makeup you guys will be good I know it sounds so extra right now but I actually am like I haven't done greens my guys and it's so long the every time I use green on my eyes I always like it so I'm excited especially dark green you know back when I first I go in club a when I turned 18 I used to always wear blue smokey eyes like navy blue smokey eyes is probably something get ready with me it's from way back in the day where I was wearing my staple or navy blue smokey eye kind of bad usually you know what it's probably actually quite pretty but who is a navy blue smokey eye when they're 18 going clubbing laughs probably wasn't actually that good at makeup anyway that contour looks so natural look at it oh what's going on stirred my life but my man just having a little bit of a meltdown and then putting on my fav game Ebro by benefit and I love to put a crap ton of this and so that my eyebrows look nice and hairy and textured like real arborist it's the only scissors I could find okay Stella Amica I'm gonna start with some kind of base I think what is in here shimmering ivy this is by Smashbox let's have a look at this color this could be really pretty because I'll put a brighter color on top of it oh that's dry please hold join of--this it's gonna be a good idea cuz it's like really dry I don't know if I'm gonna be able to blend it I'm gonna use the little sponge on the other edge oh I'm getting crammed in my hand out not now it's a serious business oh okay this hits oh okay this is dried out right when I wanted to use it to be fair it's been sitting on my dresser for a very long time someone's gonna put this straight in the bin okay what else do we have oh this is better so this is Elizabeth I'm beautiful color and Emeril okay you guys Elizabeth Arden is not raved about enough I know people look at it like an old people branch old people you know like middle-aged woman brand but I swear here it's so good right oh it's a legit okay gonna do something like that and I'm going to attempt to blend it with an iShare brush this is really hard oh god it's eating already yeah this is a disaster Oh knock about you know what whatever oh well this color is so beautiful some winging it out a little pretty no no what the heck see okay we're good do you remember when um you guys saw in my declutter video how I black and why should the pellet this was it it was just the sample of my chantix no pellet so this was the third sample date received 18th of May that was the third sample we've been working on this for a long time we were actually I mean to get us out on Valentine's Day this yes sir but it's just a little sneak peek of how long and how much of a perfectionist I am here's another sample this one was from the 21st of July okay so first I think I found a color I can use I missed out this color from the Naked skin shapeshifter the pan looks like it's falling out can you say that it is weird okay I'm just taking this brown color through the crease just for a little bit of warmth and do the same on the other side of course you always you don't want her I mean it's up to you one of the only emerald green eye shadows like a fine we're in this Mike Jacobs the siren pellet I hope they still sell this otherwise I'm sure like this single I should I just felt like using a pallet even though this I'm just gonna have to use Elijah anyway so I'm using the color in the greens it's a shimmery emerald green and I'm going to press that all over the eyelid where I put that base this color is actually incredibly pigmented I'm wing it out a little this could be a huge mistake I'm gonna take this color just text I want to use more than one color from this palette on the same blender brush ace before I'm just going to kind of buff out the edge really gently and a bit more of the urban decay brown color and we are orange again can the Sun just like decide if it wants to be here but doesn't want to be here like I don't care the way I just like make up your mind install God all over the place and then I'm gonna go back in with the green you know why I like a little bit sharpest and when you're shopping it up again it's color so stunning I kind of feel like it's a little more misses some caramel looks a little bit blue and also I have so much foundation in my hairline how did I only just notice this I mean it goes astray out of the whole video okay I have another Elizabeth Arden eyeliner this one here is the liquid eyeliner in the shade and mystic green o-5 just cuz I'm a green on my eyelid I'm going to do a semi thick layer of this honestly it's coming out so much more glow on camera I promise it's not blue Oh too big got that wing is terrible hmm isn't it I'll tidy it up after oh my god I did it again hopefully the rest of this series goes better than today and I just got there too - dings my eyes twitching and I go round my crease love today I love I love this I love today this is great you know what I'm gonna go into a dark green and put dark green into my crease I have enchanted forest by make a big thank you makeup geek for saving me also the lighting has changed again honestly though sorry I'm just picking my nose this lighting right now is great like it's a little bit bright but okay anyways I'm taking that enchanted forest color and I'm picking that into the crease and I'm going to blend there we go that's more green vibes who knew that this would be so hard to find like a proper emerald green like no no my eye shadows alight the perfect color this blending brush is a dream I think I need a little bit of a brighter like obviously like this the document look it's still a brighter green though I think I'll draw it to get a hopeful ooh some glitter or something I am going to use some of this go get glitter this green one this is not I say so I'm making sure I apply it kind of like under my eye and I'm just going to be careful throughout the day you don't want to put not isafe glitter too close to your eyes especially on top of your eyelid where it could fall into your eye if I use something like this I usually do it like in a corner but underneath or like underneath here where it's less likely to kind of move and you just need be careful do it your own risk because people have literally gone blind from this okay I'm not joking almost simply you can just use a glitter but I can't find one that's like the perfect shade any years a little look brush to apply this oh this looks good okay chilly first let me just line my waterline and bloom it out sorry I am just organizing my Germany trip while I'm filming not let you guys know work so Peter stood out but I'm going nicked your anatomy you guys I'm so excited we're doing a literally like a five-day trip because I'm doing some meetups and I'm so excited to meet you guys it was too good an opportunity to pass down and I just love meetups like I've done so many lately so by the time you watch this I'm probably like in Germany or something what's going on here you know I'm gonna bring these all the way across why not let's do some great mmm don't think I like the Attic wanna done actually I'm just gonna take that off and just leave it like halfway this is quite fun cuz these glitter shapes are kind of like gemstones you know okay gonna use some nukes oh Beauty lashes that are coming soon these ones from memory I called it exotic and they are super heavy criss-crossed look at that fluff they're so fluffy and so how do I show you I'm curly double layered can you say like that just so fluffy they look terrifying but wait cheesy them all these are really easy to apply still even though they're like obviously thicker and more Philon but they're just kind of bling to your eye so nicely how funny does it look without any mascara this is how big they are once I trim them I've to trim off a couple of bits then wild it glue is drying we'll do our brow bone highlight quickly I'm just gonna use one of the benefit whatever here it is highbrow glow and do it a little bit on the inner corner just on my brow bone these lectures are not for the faint-hearted I'm obsessed with them I'm just gonna take a little bit of this shade from my pellet again with my lip brush I'm just gonna put a little bit on the center of my eyelid okay Giorgio Armani eyes to kill just to blend in my natural lashes with the falsies I'm gonna use a little bit of epic foiled eyeshadow on my eyelid I'm just trying to make it look more emerald looking so it keeps just looking blurred in camera oh that's better it's gonna put in a third or so okay time for the contouring sorry I'm gonna use this shade just here this is a bronzer brush by the way so beauty and then for my blush I'm going to use nude a pop I love this color we use this highlighted this is I just Couture gold digger so be a crazy intense so I'm just gonna dampen it cuz otherwise it's kind of powdery it's really pretty but just because it's a loose powder well now I'm going to do the lips I'm just gonna keep it really simple and do something like peachy nude or something because obviously the eyes are so crazed there oh I forgot about my coffee don't know how I feel about these look the line is because they don't go on super smooth if you like slightly stiffer pencils you might like this this is calm Camargue karma goo karma do I don't know okay you can bill even see this color they're definitely not my favorite that's willing to give it another shot but I don't know I just feel like if my lips and waist rise as well and I still feel like I really have to push hard to get anything and it's not just the nerd it was the same with like could there read in the black like they worked that will fly it's just not my preference I guess I prefer something really creamy it's this one this one here is cool to get it on organ that could be really pretty English try it this is the how I met lip pigment very similar to the Kylie Jeanette super runny and be careful when you use it because I just pulled it out and one everywhere this colors to your doc I love the color though but for this look mister doc oh it's so liquid it's like leaking everywhere holy freaking crap I'm so excited to go to Bill in oh my god I'm so freakin lucky and I cannot wait to meet my German subscribers I liked it a little Facebook into what I was like how me and my father was from Germany and it was so many more than I thought and I was one of the people they actually commented and saw it you know taking a very pale pinky kind of nude this is playing coy by Mac but you saw in my declutter oh like my lipstick declutter down below it was my MAC lipstick okay I just say lip dick it was my mech lipstick declutter video okay I made a daca lip liner I'm just gonna grab this one color pop razor oh my god it's blood I know this looks ugly right now but just be with me okay that's as good as we getting because today apparently I just can't apply lip pencils a little upline or anything okay so that is my first gemstone look completely it's just how long I searched like a mirage yard okay not looking at that I think this is pretty good like that sparkle underneath it's another picture I'm very glad I use that chunky glitter because that kind of brings and the lighter kind of you know elements of the Emerald that are hitting the light oh my God look how pretty this one is this is like kind of similar turn to what I'm wearing here so I do think it did okay I was kind of worried for a while because some emerald is like super bright green or as I want to reserve the bright bright green for the peridot peridot however you outside or not look it up oh my God look at this wedding cake some of you guys will totally dig this look how cool it is anyways so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm so excited for the series and I hope you guys are too I've got so many great ideas for future series but I think I'll do each series for like you know three or four or five months or so so I do a couple of series each year the cocktail series went for quite a while but you guys didn't really sing to mine so try and get like you know a couple of gemstone oak videos up a month at least a couple hopefully I don't really know I don't remember how many I was doing up the cocktail series but you know two or three I think that should be really fun at per month and then I'll keep up like the first-impression full face videos and stuff like that for something a little bit different just to mix it up every now and again but yeah I'm sorry happy with this look I think it looks stunning and I would definitely wear this on a night out like I'm going to wear it tonight for The Magicians show and I think hold on let me just darken this cuz the Sun is playing with me again I definitely think if you took away that low glitter you know that's a really wearable glamorous look for like a ball or a prom or any of you want to look super dramatic it's kind of like classy in a weird way I think like it's really glam very like feminine I don't know it's so beautiful so there you go thank you so much for watching once again let me know down below comings of the day I haven't done that in a while comment of the day what gym star do you want to see next I would love to hear from you I've like googled so many different gemstones are so many cool ones kind of more read that I hadn't even heard of before so I'm so excited there are so many beautiful color combinations to like if I remember was cool but it was like yellow in pink veined it was so pretty thank you so much for watching I think they loop that little fourth time I've said bit I told you guys in my next video okay [Music] 
hello everyone so today I'm going to do a full face of first impressions for you I just got back from Fiji last night so I'm fresh home I'm very dry from the plane and from the Sun and the sea it my skin is like flicky and peeling and gross and I've got a million at new freckles like look at them or in them a little bit some in just here um so yeah I'm gonna do something very moisturized today I actually kind of feel like doing something kind of natural but we'll see how that goes because every time I want to do natural I feel like it doesn't end up being natural so I'm just going to start by using it some of this glow tonic this is just like a exfoliating it whoa toner so just squirt someone here who's my skin is like so flaky so this should help a little bit I mean we will moisturize and prime minster so dark outside today by the way guys so Saul's about the lighting I was just could not wait to start filming um I'm so excited to start filming again and just kick back on my channel again just get out heaps of cotton gin can't wait to film heaps of decluttered I'm done traveling for a little while I have been traveling so much recently I've been in like 4 different countries in the last couple months or something like that so I'm just so excited just to be at home for a few months or a couple months or however long it's gonna be cuz you know my life is crazy but just so looking forward to getting into my routine filming and vlogging I'm so excited I really want to start doing almost daily vlogs again I'm so pumped so psyched thing I'm gonna start like tomorrow also because yeah I just have been missing it so much just have not hit the time so I'm sorry Kevin your primer by origins and it says it is a pore perfecting cooling primer with willow-herb I should probably like quickly just put on a little bit of moisturizer though actually let me just put some of the songs I find this quite hydrating this is the touch of luminous dewy skin mist it's like an oil must and then let's try out this new promo it comes in a form I actually did squeeze them out I had the other day because I was so intrigued so yeah looks like this how cool is that oh I feel so cold and I don't know how much I need oh my god it's so cold so Fiji was fun and I'm going to eat it a vlog later so by the time you see this video to be already up um I just did like a really short vlog showing some of my highlights cuz me and mum were doing so much relaxing just lying by the pool nothing exciting to vlog whatsoever so I just logged some about snorkeling and stuff holy crap that's feels so good it's just so moisturizing and it does actually make my skin look so smooth I don't know if you can see the difference through the camera that in real life like my skin looks so even okay first impression on that primer it feels so incredible makes my skin look so nice to like it definitely evened out my pores and everything makes this area look like silk say hello to my million frickles they'll probably fade soon but like this area here like you can't even see the pores it just looks smooth it feels so good feels so refreshing I have been not wanting to try this foundation for so long I don't even know if they sell it anymore but we'll soon find out so actually I should probably go that right be right back 2,000 years later it is currently still on the website it's by Giorgio Armani and it's called the maestro glow nourishing at fusion makeup and it comes only and one two three four five six eight nine shades they look pretty even across the nine shades that there are there's only like a couple shades in stock at the moment there's like three light ones three medium and then three deeper still have an amazing shade range but maybe it's really sheer something like it looks really sheer so maybe it's one of those pros that kind of like I don't know works with multiple people let's find out so it's a skincare oil infused with pigment each drop to fix the complexion it was inspired by moisture fluid in its lightness and silkiness and it gives an instant and lasting glow due to the pigment and oil blend they'll all make the texture comfortable easy to apply for women no with dry skin which is me right now so let's try it out and if it's a light coverage I don't even mind cuz I just feel like like I said something kind of more natural today this lag is so bad I knew in light I haven't even considered the fact that's gonna mesh me I'm just like I want to use this I don't care what okay the color does not look too bad let's try and I found a brush before I did this I'm such an idiot oh my god okay we're doing this one because I can't find another line this is entangled and I'm just gonna start with a little bit yes it's quite sure so I think this color will be absolutely fine cuz it's not an opaque color you're just kind of blend in it kind of sits funny on your skin when you look really up close but I think I just knew blended in a bit more it looks really nice like it kind of evens out my 7uu put on my cheese kind of evens out my skin tone and does make me glow a little bit like it definitely looks like skin care it's like no foundation foundation if they make C it's like it looks like I'm not wearing foundation I'm just gonna do another drop there there I'm gonna put some my chin oh god what am i doing just because I need to put some on my neck it's kind of brightening up my skin a bit cuz I was looking at very dull I feel like this would work really well with a sponge too but you have to be careful not to apply too much cuz I feel like if you put too much of this on your skin would just say getting really oily because it's so oily you know seems to be working okay with the primer - thank goodness because I didn't even think about that so first impression on that for something obviously like I'm not gonna with us every day I usually go for full coverage I'm not going to judge it on the fact that it's a light coverage because that's just who he is here's a light coverage person or foundation for a light coverage I think this is so pretty but definitely if you have oily skin at your work I'm hate it because it literally makes you look oily but I'm living for that because I'm so dehydrated right now so it feels really really good I actually really like how my skin looks right now and it seems to like Mitch pretty dang well I think together right baby I'm definitely going to keep this cuz I don't really have anything else like this and like a light coverage and I really like how it looks I feel like this would look amazing under a different foundation as well just to make like mix together even to make the other foundation more glowy what do you think do you like the way it looks it was a little bit more orange on camera than in real life to be honest it matches better in real life okay I have it the all nighter by Urban Decay I loved the foundation version of this from memory I did a first impression but the only bad thing about it was it oxidized so badly so I ended up getting rid of it because the color didn't match me but I had actually liked being trying to remind myself to pick out the foundation again in like a really like shakes that literally weed so dark on me but hopefully the concealer doesn't do that so this is the all that nights of waterproof full coverage concealer I'm gonna take the shade fear I've also got the shade medium light just start with fear I might actually mix two shades together because I don't want it to look too obvious under my eyes since I'm not wearing like full coverage so I'm just gonna do a few dots of that one and then this one here is in the shade medium light neutral and this light matches my skin tone perfectly which is good I'm just gonna conceal this part of my free khals cuz I don't like those freckles they're they're so big whereas I like the little ones I have I wish these ones wouldn't fade I'm just gonna put a little bit just over the lowest part of my cheek where I get written this the t-shirt feels good so far it feels really lightweight I thought it was gonna be really thick like shape tape or something I'm probably the last person on the planet to try this concealer but it's actually been in my little drawer fist impressions for a long time it spreads out really nicely it looks like velvet ooh lunes aren't really easy it's very yellow of me right now so I'm just gonna blend it down like a triangular shape and then onto my eyelids to conceal all of my veins looks really smooth and it feels really lightweight it doesn't feel heavy and cakey I feel like it looks even better on the actual face then under the eyes but it still works under the eyes just fine but on my face it looks like velvet like I said so this is how my skin is looking with the natural coverage and then it can seal I feel like to conceal this a little bit like brown like I don't know how to put it like it looks maybe undertones a little bit off like custard looking like putting all my face anyway so I have it these by Lancome the clicking glow illuminators I have the shade one enter actually have more shape than this but I put them aside for giveaways so this is the shade to a thank you probably gonna want them yeah the lighter one today that doesn't even look that light okay let's try it so shade one Lumiere door I'm so scared it's gonna like come there it go  me I think it's just like a highlighter highlighting has never been that's easy just one clicking you ready to highlight enhance warm and illuminate your face yep sweetie okay I don't really like the applicator I'd rather it just being like a squeeze tube or something please okay and then chilling this out I'm going to take my jewel pin brush blends out so easy and it's a very natural glow it's nothing too shiny it's a very pretty like wearable day to day kind of product it just brightens you up but it doesn't make you look like a Tin Man or anything you know how some of these products almost a too much and you have to like put powder on top of them or you have to wear them underneath foundation or something to make them work I guess this is one of those ones you can really just slap on it if atlas it's not hard to use it's really pretty like I think that just make my complexion look really nice so I do like it now I've got the sitting powder connect the Patricks powder and I'm probably the last person on the plane Oh sly this also but I'm very excited so I'm just trying to tap something I it comes out very slowly which can be a good thing otherwise you can have a bit of a powder meltdown in your house but just taking a little bit they can see lerna my Isis crease a little bit so you want to see it pretty quickly I think I am gonna use this to sit the rest of my face so now I just want to do my eyebrows quickly first so I'm going to try out the iconic London medium shade sculpt in boost eyebrow cushion 6 grams of product and here the packaging is so cute it comes with a little brush and spoolie and the product is protected you may have seen this I know some youtubers did like does it work dumpty if you you undo it and it's got two calories I might use my own brush with it because I don't usually use the little brushes just find like it's hard to get enough control with the tiny little brush so I'm going to be using today and I define a brush which is like oh my god I just dropped it which is a little like you know squid or a tingle with flat brush I'm gonna dip into the lighter shade this is so wind and I'm just going to stop ooh sorry pigmented I was not expecting it to be like that okay there is like a lighter shade - but I like darker eyebrows so I'm just using the lightest shade all over so far wow it's actually really good like it's better than I thought it would be it's almost like a liquid eyeliner or something for your eyebrow except really easy to use you guys ever have that issue where like underneath your eyebrow where you're trying to draw in the product it can look really like patchy and stuff like this doesn't look patchy it's sorry smooth I'm actually blowing away so it's not sponsored I just a toothpick down there like that just apply is like so smooth okay I just tidied it up with some concealer I am blown away my eyebrows looks so smooth it could help that I have been patted them yet first impression wise I'm totally gonna try this again I'm gonna try it on top of patters while to see if it applies just as smooth because that just we're not on it like a bloomin dream like I can't explain what the heck it's so good the only thing I have to say about this is it's definitely easy to screw axes quite fluidy it's really easy to put too much product on your brush like this is more like please you guys let me know what you think like what do you think of my eyebrows cuz I think they look really good hopefully it's not just me like I actually love the way they look so I'm excited I'm just gonna use some Riddhi see a brow on my eyebrows to see if I'm gonna have a new brow gel I don't know why my eyebrow is so long by the way I just kind of like it just keep going okay I found this while I was looking for brow gel so try this while I'm here this is a Hollywood contour wand easy contour sculpture for still a shallot Silbury I'm try not to squeeze it like I have this like thing where I'm scared if I squeeze it too hard the little things just gonna pop off and shit's gonna go everywhere so oh it's got a little wine D okay now let's try there we go that's a lot easier there you go whoa what's going and going now I'm just going to use let's just use this brush again my little petal brush which I don't know everyone stopped using this type of brush and I'm obsessed with it I use this all the freaking time every day it's magic it's very easy to blend and the color is really nice and you you actually get quite a while to blend the only thing I would say is I feel like it's kind of taken away a little bit of my base but it could be because my base was quite sick if I had have put a net this on instantly it probably wouldn't have like disrupted the base so much because the base would have been more weight if they may sin so I really like the color I definitely want to try this again also I'm having like a good run today I feel like usually my first impressions is like disasters happening so far we're doing well so hopefully it stays this way it's gonna put on a little bit of my head trick stuff look how cute this packaging is by the way I am so happy for Patrick he is one of the most genuine genuine genuine youtubers I've met and he had a whole collection with Meg that his goal was like it's so cool so so I found my eyes it's fine I don't usually go for loose powder though you know not the best person to like be testing it out but you know it works really well my skin looks very airbrush with my Ashley it looks very smooth like it almost a few uses your pigmentation in your skin like it really kind of diffused my freckles and everything they made them look a little bit more soft looking Hey look kind of orange at this age it's not too bit but like my neck is so pale I'm just going to put some more foundation on my neck look orange when you put it on but kind of is Ashley I take back what I said earlier I think the Foundation's a bit with a brush because as you buff it in it starts looking at more and more perfect looking like when I first just like put it on a little bit it just looks me then you buff it in with the and it starts looking like butter so I feel like if you use a sponge you wouldn't get like the full blended effect okay update that concealer under my eyes looks horrendous look can you see that it's completely like creasing so definitely not a fan of that and my eyes I don't even know if I'll keep it cuz like I do like it on my like cheeks and everything however I've got heaps of other concealers that work like on my cheeks and onto my eyes if they make sense like my nas ones and stuff so I don't really need that but I do like it just not far into the eyes I'm just going to mist my skin quickly with another spray this is not new by the way I just like it a lot moisture when I first used I was kind of confused cuz it's very oily and it kind of leaves it big blotches on your skin sometimes but it's more of like a skin kiss spray the into a makeup spray in my opinion however I still like to just put it on on top the powder and everything because it just melts it into my skin and makes it look more natural it gives me a hot out glow which I want today so okay our base is on now it's just a really simple eyeshadow I can't bother doing anything too crazy so I'm going to take this which I've never use this is the widow mod footer focus i should'a primer it's really hard to squeeze out okay it is very thick and kind of tinted which I like just I use my petal brush again my favorite looks really nice on the eyelid once you blend it out but I feel like it's so human though you know I can be used as much now like once I blended it I've got a very thin layer on there it feels so yummy that I'm like is this gonna stop creasing or create creasing I don't know oh my gosh okay I've closed it completely like messed up my eye makeup like the foundation that was on my eyelids the concealer sorry like made it a little Colombian looking can you say that and it feels like sticky like when I blink it's like good I'm getting rid of this I'm gonna try out this palette just here by bhim and I was a hidden treasure I love the minerals eyeshadows this so underrated in my opinion this palette here is really pretty although I think when I showed it does I don't I'll hold the door or something I said so many similar light colors like those first nine colors are so similar I just feel like they could have put other colors in there that would have been way more useful like these just look the same like it especially once you put them on your lid like they just don't look the same so I'm gonna take the shade ecru which is just like a plain pale yellow base color and I'm just gonna put that and sit the disgusting primer job okay I love the wet and wild foundation version of that line what is it called photo finish something like that but that primer doesn't mean no favors that primarily I still feel like it feels sort of thick and heavy even with the powder on top okay now I'm going to take my angled eyeshadow brush which is on sale or Nexo Beauty at the moment I believe it's about $11 New Zealand which is a bug in it so we just try and clear these ones Alex with and you synthetic ones you like coming in to replace them at some stage so I'm gonna take maybe the shade weights just this one here and I'm just going to press this on my eyelid like I said today I am doing a very simple simple look and then I'm just using a crease blending brush to blend I just want to say quickly about the beach house so far it has once again falling through and I'm gonna talk more about it when I stopped looking at tomorrow the flow probably already be out by now hopefully super disappointed naturally I just seen lots of you asking about it I'm just blending it out with another blender brush a little bit more lightly since this is just the blender brush and then I'm going to take the other side of my little jewel look petal brush I'm gonna take a shimmery highlight color so maybe Miri which is this one here it's like a pinky tone one a little bit cool and I just brighten up my eyes cuz I've terrible haver right now and I didn't honestly well last night I'm really trying to buff it in quite well so it was quite natural and then on top I'm gonna trade this out this is a a crystal topcoat in nude by Natasha de Nona I'm just going to take it on my finger and then just run that over the top of my eyelid that just transform the aisle into something a little bit more special and then I think I'm just mad you're very thin winged eyeliner okay so I have this Malloy precision eyeliner I've heard really good things about it from celli and shiny I don't usually like this brush tip but I'm excited to try it anyway hopefully I can do a thin lines I just want like a really thin line just to frame my eyelashes it's so pigmented like I don't even have to press hard to get the pigment on my eye but you said it was really easy to use for me it's a little bit more difficult so I'm not used to this kind of applicator but it's very black we're not doing thin eyeliner anymore it's big I've done a kind of funny shape on the bottom of my eyeliner so I'm going to take a pencil brush and the darkest shade up here of this palette and then just smudge that just on the outer edge so that it blends together a little bit better holy crap I'm so hungry right now I don't know why my stomach is going nuts there's some water line eyeliner soon as well but for now there's good okay okay knit side I'm gonna go off camera this takes too long 12 seconds later Ashley that was so much easier so do I like the eyeliner yes definitely I think the formula is really good it's just not my favorite applicator that's all then I'm gonna use this iPad it pencil by Charlotte Aubry the classic I'm kind of nervous cuz it could be like an eyebrow pencil maybe no I would say eyebrow just gonna put this I don't think they don't even not look terrifying so that is how the eye makeup is looking at very simple but I do like the process I used I think my favorite is the Charlotte not shout to read the Natasha Damona like top coat it's so cool I like it okay now for mascara I'll try a new one out we have an wet and wild its Excel mascara don't think I've ever tried this I haven't got a good track record with wet and wild mascara so I'm a little bit nervous so yeah xx eyelet lash mascara wand it looks like this it doesn't look too clumped in product which is a good start actually very natural which is what I'm going for today enough but I mean it's not xx whole lash so far anyway we'll try building it a little bit okay that's like a decent coat and a half to two coats it's so natural look about which I actually start about today so if you want a natural kind of mascara I don't think it's like have any of you guys tried this do you guys get XXL volume or do you get like a nice natural separator look like Mila it's a beautiful mascara I just don't think it's like XXL it actually works really well though for like a natural look do you know what mascara does she reminds me of is that um Great Lash mascara is it Maybelline you know just they're like classic like hot pink and green packaging that everyone had back in the day used to be my favorite reminds me a lot of that oh god it's very liquidy to wipe up I'm just gonna wait for that to dry a little bit longer but um that's how that the mascara looks I definitely like the way it looks but it is not crazy volume like it's a gel just in my opinion so next up what are we gonna do blush I suppose lose out well that's about it so at the only new brush I have it right here right this is the fit achieved by men right nas limited edition I'm not sure if it's still out or not that I think this is like the only blush I haven't tried so it's gonna happen so I'm gonna do a very sheer coat using a dense fiber brush literally just going to do a tap and just yeah it's actually a very very pretty color I like it okay highlighter I've never used this on my face so I'm gonna try it today this is the Kylie french vanilla highlighter I'm going to use it on this brush which I do still need to bring to it so beauty I've got well my samples reading everything we just haven't actually like ordered them so I need to do that because I actually kind of forgot about it I feel like this would probably look nicer with like a full coverage usually with this kind of makeup I'd probably use my Beauty highlighter it's a little bit more like not natural but you know like wasteful long whereas this is very shimmery considering a joy to have much coverage and it's still nice like I do like the highlighter it's a lot shimmery and then I would normally go for that in terms of being shimmery it's a really pretty color and it's nice and easy to blend okay this mascara is very wet it's like going under my eyes - I don't know how it got down here okay to be honest I probably never use it this mascara again just because it is a biatch to remove why oh my god it's like ruined my eyeshadow my under eye area looks so cakey right now which was sad so this is how many makeup is looking at so far I just want to do my lips next okay I think I found myself a little bit glossy duo so I'm gonna take this you a nerd I think this is a yeah cream lip liner it's a really beautiful formula so so creamy and so smooth and easy to use okay and then on top I'm going to use this vintage Beauty fatigue low lip gloss oh my god that smells so good it smells like lollies I feel like if I put on lashes right now I would feel way more myself like I just don't feel like myself because my famish is so low coverage so that is the completed look oh my god I feel like I'm I'm just not used to lipgloss my hair is a complete mess I'm getting it done in a couple of days so it's just gonna have to do so yeah that's the completed look I love that foundation to be honest I really want to try mixing it with a full coverage just to see what happens cuz I feel like I would just create the most perfect formula I really really really like the eyebrows stuff that's probably my highlight of the day um let me know if you guys have tried it what are you guys thoughts on it you like it as much as me or did you think it was kind of like me I don't know I also this this is so good I'm so excited about this I'm gonna keep using that for sure most of the products were really good the isotope Ella will probably get rid of just because it doesn't really add anything to my collection I've got all of those colors or really even though I love being minerals eyeshadows you know it's just kind of like a pointless palette to me the eyeliner I'm on the fence about like I don't wanna keep it cuz the formula so goodbye just don't know if I'll reach forever for the applicator that's my little full face of first impression review kind of thing I'm actually doing one soon a full face using it via top-rated k-beauty product so I'm just waiting for my parcel to arrive a can't wait I'm also going to film the Etsy video soon and somewhat gemstone it series looks which I'm really excited about so hope you guys are looking forward to them and done a gemstone look in a little while but yeah there will be one coming I just I just felt like doing something really simple today so this is my idea of simple kind of kind of natural skin but not really so yeah I will it talk to you guys a minute so yo don't you two thumbs up and I'll talk to you soon you 
hey everyone so today I am doing an update it all really updated I'm doing a new declutter Holy Grail what I'm throwing away what I hated stuff I freaking hated all of that kind of thing will I repurchase will I not repurchase is it the worst thing I've ever tried in my life let's find out I have a whole lot of empties makes me like you can't even see them all there's like two huge tubs full of it so my carbon footprint is looking really great today okay let's move Oh Kenny wise I'm just gonna grab stuff okay first of all we have it the batiste dry shampoo they'll probably be a few of these in here if it's anything like normal I can't even remember what's in here because it's been a long time since I did a decluttering not deep I can't even like think about what I'm trying to say right now it's been a while since I've done a empties video obviously the stuffs from like the past few months since my last one like my last one down below you guys always seem to love these and I know there was some like epic fails in my last one so make sure you check it out after this it's anything like normal or hit me please because the taste dry shampoo is my favorite they should really sponsor me you guys don't you think just kidding but also I wouldn't say no but just I love this dry shampoo because it is cheap it smells amazing not just this one I like the original one I like the wild one is a few I like there's a few I don't like also I don't like the volumizing one and I don't like the tinted ones I just don't find them good at all this is disgusting to look at anyway this is the joy cocapec conditioner which is to repair damage I've talked about this quite a lot on my channel I've been using this range for years on and off and I like it a lot it's really good for damaged hair I find it very very smoothing makes my hair feel a lot more manageable and soft I really like it and this took me a long time to use up as you can imagine it's like yeah Elita I'm currently using the joy co moisturizing ones I think along with a couple of other random branded ones I had this coconut anyway I'll show you guys that in my new CDs video this is done it's probably even more than this I think I talked about these in my monthly favorites the last one I did which was quite a while ago I need to do another one really badly we have it the bonbon body wash whip in mint choc chip Oh choc mint chip just licks it I read things really backwards sometimes this brand is a New Zealand brand where is it made Hamilton or something I'm sure I can't remember its handmade in New Zealand for some reason in my head I've got Hamilton but I don't know I bought all of these myself by the way but so many of them for friends for family I literally am like Oprah I just hand them out like lollies like I love them so much they're pretty affordable they are vegan cruelty free Peter approves handmade a New Zealand work so well like they leather up so amazing you wouldn't think so looking at it like it's kind of like the souffle kind of textured stuff but you just dig out a little bit put it on your sponge and it live is up so good smells amazing makes your skin smell amazing and makes you feel really clean so I have chalk mint what I really like this one I'm not a huge mint chocolate fan but oh I can't deny it smells good it smells like those you know there's thin chocolates with the mint in the middle anyway to it creme brulee which is Hamish is all-time favorite I literally had one in my room to force him to try the other flavors because he like wanted to open up all of the creme brulee ones at once I was like no we have to try the other flavors he's obsessed with it like he's got problems it's no offense Hamish it's so good though it smells exactly like creme brulee like it smells like brown sugar caramel cream like mmm so good I would definitely say if you just want to try out one creme brulee is where it's at so good comes with like brown sugar or something on the top which kind of acts like a scrub on your skin and makes your skin feel so soft next is birthday cake I was a huge fan of birthday cake it's kind of like a vanilla except bitter mmm smells like cake better amazing there is one I don't like so stay tuned but I'm just kind of getting through them this one it matches me it's the lemon tart I did not like the scrubs with this one this one came with oats and I just found like they were really hard to wash out of my sponge to wash down the drain like I just didn't find them as practical as the brown sugar so what we did is we just didn't use it we just picked out the lemon body wash from the top of it amazing I love the smell of lemon this is like a very sweet lemon like it smells like a lemon dessert like a lemon meringue tart it's amazing I love it I just don't like the scrub next step is when I don't like so this is the mechanic scrub so this is actually like a hand scrub but we just decide using like a body scrub which may be the reason I don't like it I don't know I just didn't really like the smell it's vanilla and whiskey when you first smell it it smells pretty good but then it's like the after smell like I don't know just not my cup of tea at all blame it milkshake was amazing this was a scrub we just used it all over our body like a body wash and it worked perfectly like it's still lathered up and made my skin feel really clean it's not so good smells like do you know what it smells like to me it smells like is that colored popcorn that you would get at like Civic video and stuff you know the like candy corn no not candy corn like colored popcorn it was like pink and blue and green and yellow and all sorts of colors it smells just like that I really liked this one it wasn't my all-time favorite this one also came with the oats and we actually tried to use that folks and this one we mixed it all together but yeah like I said it was just difficult to wash away smells really good it smells like if you have like tangy apples except peach version I'd say definitely my favorites are more like the birthday cake in the creme brulee and also this one here this one is milk and cookies body wash hmm it smells good it smells kind of like chocolate chip cookies or something like that moving a lot okay we'll start with this huge tub naturally we have some faced hands so I've got to our Express oh wait they're both to our Express except one of them is the big size your favorite teeny but I love this so much loving 10 to our Express I really like it just because you can wash it off super quickly and if you I wanted to see at the loving tan in action you can search shedding so your fake tan routine and you can see me using it we've got the Wishon wild max phonetic cat eye mascara I think I used this in a first impression video or something like that and I just really did not like it whatsoever so I'm just getting rid of it I would donate it but I've used it so you know okay next up I've got the primer what I've got a little bit left but I'm just getting rid of it now cuz it's kind of it they awkward stage where it just blows our bubbles onto your skin and I've got another one so I'm ready repurchased although I wasn't it I did actually really like this it just felt really hydrating really calming before my makeup like especially in summer when you just want to like cool down a little bit it's really nice I would not say it's in essential and you'll make up routine but if you've got you know the money and you want to try it out I would say give it a go because I do like it I just don't think it's like a staple like you need this in your life kind of like situation we have angels on biscuit I love this no matter what other skincare products I'm using at any time I'll often still have and angels on bare skin in my shower I just really like it to gently exfoliate my skin it comes in like this paste kind of texture you take a little piece mix with water massage it on your skin and it's called heaps of really good ingredients and I which exfoliate super gently like when I don't want to scrub it my skin and it really helps to kind of buff my skin and brighten my skin like it makes my skin look really bright afterwards and it really helps with breakouts really gently like if you want something that's really gentle on your skin I highly recommend this buy lash last pages to like it seems to be quite expensive but it does last a long time I'll link my makeup tutorial down blue by the way if you learn how to do this look I love it next up we had some more body wash because you guys know how much body wash junkie I am seriously I need my own range with body wash one day this is the original sources are so cheap I'm pretty sure it's like five dollars or less depending if it's on special and stuff it's vegan which is awesome especially for something that's so affordable and it's so accessible New Zealand like it's everywhere supermarket worry about this is the mint flavor mint and tea tree to tree getting all tongue-tied again and some people report that this makes their butt and parts tingle to the point where it hurts but for me it take this is really awkward it definitely tingles but I just feel clean it doesn't really hurt at all like it it doesn't hurt me but I mean used with caution I love it because it makes me feel so minty fresh like all over my body I love it I love the smell of mint like lip balms lip gloss body wash moist rat like everything I just love mint so good this is another body wash this one here is by the brand I thought I'd try a new one because I always get the same one get it in tonic and I just got this at countdown I believe I kind of shop at new world and count down so I get a little bit confused sometimes this has coconut water apple kiwi fruit and lime so it sounded really lovely and I did really liked it it wasn't my favorite ever smells really good it kind of smells like a kiwi fruit smoothie or something yeah I liked it I liked it it wasn't like incredible it wasn't my favorite favorite but I liked it okay I definitely think if you like the smell of like apple juice and kiwi fruit you'll like it next up we have the pro fiber reconstruct this is the conditioner I'm using the shampoo in the shower at the moment they might be one in here somewhere too and then I've also emptied out the mask which I'll just grab it dropped on the floor so here's the mask so I've talked about this a million times I did ages ago a sponsorship for L'Oreal and actually got like a DSL treatment for my hair the pro fiber treatment and I genuinely notice a huge difference in the quality of my care like it made my hair feel so much better but this is just like the at-home shampoo conditioner situation and I still use it sometimes I still ocean aid like I said before I kind of use different shampoos and conditioners all the time but I really like this one and I've used up while it like if you've watched my empties video I must have been three or four days by now really like them it's really good in a small sock so good you're so on it sells the L'Oreal professional range like give it a sniff sniff sniff it's great and I am a sucker for anything in my hair or my body that smells good naturally I used up my Xsara skinny kid nutshell facial scrub with Tulsi holy basil I talked about this in my last skincare routine I think loved this so much if my skin feel like brand-new every time I used it it's basically like crushed up nuts and it exfoliates so effectively it was quite intense so if you have super sensitive skin I would not use this or if you have like a lot of acne it'll just irritate it but I didn't have breakouts and things I loved it I definitely need to repurchase that I really really really liked it I got seen this one but I'm gonna buy some more it's kind of like a bit of version of like the apricot scrub and stuff more dry shampoo and another one another one I used up the Correa's um yogurt what were these I'm trying to find cuz the thing that's going Greek yogurt fish wipes these were really lovely they were very gentle really moisturizing non-irritating left them not sure if i'll repurchase them don't know why like just don't know how repurchase them I guess I'm just not really using facial wipes moment but I would definitely consider it if I was walking past them in Sephora like why not they were great I'm throwing this away because it's old if it's kind of like a liquid exfoliator I kind of want to get it again one day and try it out probably cuz when I did use it I wasn't using it frequently enough but every time I used it I felt like my skin looked really clean and bright like the next morning you put it on at night it's supposed to revitalize and assist in firming the skin in a single application through in multi-action formula of silk protein and licorice anyways yeah it's got glycolic acid I did like it when I was using it I wish I'd kept up with it and actually like got a lot of use out of it but hit this and make for like three years or something so I definitely need to get rid of it used up a couple of my favorite there is a big brown hair on that that is not mine are you safe a couple of my Danish skincare perfect skin moisturizers I love this moisturizer I'm actually waiting for some more to come in the mail at the moment so I've completely run out of my entire Danish skincare range I do have a link to week just this down below it is an affiliate code but I actually asked them for an affiliate code because the skincare range changed my life I love it that much if you watch my skincare routine you'll see it and it's not sponsored by them I just genuinely it like love this and so many people have bought it and said that they loved it as well so I'm so happy because like I haven't seen any youtubers talking about this apart from myself the cleanser is like my Holy Grail here's one I'm completely out and I miss it so much like I've actually been breaking out lately but I think that's a combination of stress with everything that's been happening in my personal life and terrible food choices not drinking enough water I wasn't taking good enough care of my skin like I was doing the bare minimum so my skin like sometimes I was going to sleep with my makeup on so I was just so sad and I just stuff like that Ellie I just wasn't taking very good care of my skin and I did hate some ice a couple weeks ago in last week and it kind of brought everything out I think either that or I just overdid it on my skin but anyway now it's kind of gone back to normal I got a couple little breakouts but it's almost better I'm so excited for my cleanse they come in because I honestly think it helps so much with my breakouts like managing them this could be another reason why I've been breaking out lately because I haven't been using this one it's my favorite there's one hint to the big one in another direction okay we've got another shower gel why Weiss isn't here I'm sure this isn't supposed to be in here is it oh yes it is it's cuz it smells really bad in my opinion this is by lush it's the shower gel in beautiful that I just it's just nothing good to me anyway I tried it I gave it a good go like there's probably only like 1/5 left I should really just use it up but there's some stuff in here that I'm just getting rid of cuz it's old if you guys watched my bathroom at decluttering video you would have seen heaps of it already I kind of like briefly talked about it but oh go over it again so there is the real you light moisturizer hips the gel version so I really like the gel version but the moisturizer just kind like I don't dislike it and I don't love it so I'm just decluttering it it's kind of old also this this is the time bomb at completion at cocktail it's a face moisturizer oil kind of situation it's got like coconut oil Chia oil like I love oil on my face but I didn't love this one I don't know why I did try it a few times it just wasn't my favorite I don't like the packaging either I found it quite messy like it's all covered in oil on the outside it's just not a favorite there is some makeup in here too guys I'm just signing it to declutter my Eliza V Kaimuki piggy carbonated bubble clay mask I did a video all about this it's one of those masks that just bubbles up on your face I did like it but I have it my Clinique one now which I prefer the clinic pip start but will my school do at school I can't remember I do like the Clinique one so I don't really need this one might actually put it aside for a friend so they can try it out and also I find the clinic one works a lot faster and it's not as messy in a way like this one is quite like it goes everywhere so I feel like it's quite a task to use it I can't just like put it on and beard and like chill out like I feel like I have to like I don't know I don't know I'm also getting rid of this one here because I just didn't notice like the biggest difference is not one of my favourite mass showed some of this in my bathroom declutter some of this I put in here before that video anyway this is one of them so I did use this in a video and it just made my skin feel kind of soft but it wasn't like it didn't blow me away so I'm seeing rid of it if you watched my bathroom decluttering video you know how many friggin face masks I have like I don't need mediocre ones in my life I only need it the amazing ones okay I've used up the gold wallet karisoke reconstruct intensive repair pretreatment which I just put in damp here it's just like a little gel and I really liked it and made my hair feel very soft manageable made it really shiny just all that good stuff that you want I really like this range the Curacao gold well I use this bloodying treatment a lot it's my Holy Grail might be in here actually oh we have another one this is my favorite of the original source it is the vanilla and raspberry and it smells like raspberry frozen yogurt I've also used up another free shape quick blow-dry if I came into California I love this so much but I can't find it anymore I don't know if it's like discontinued what the deal is basically you sprayed a new here at here protects it conditions and it makes my hair dry like with the blow dryer and literally like three or four minutes like it just spits out the blow-dry time it's so much I love this I'm gonna definitely try and find it but I can't so if I googled it and couldn't find anywhere needs the one to get it so out it on okay I'm also getting rid of at the Elizabeth Arden flawless future ceramide night cream I just felt like it was a little bit too heavy for my skin I don't know it's just so so so thick which sometimes I like but I don't know just for me like I felt like it was a bit too much I feel like it would be better for super dry skin or more mature skin or as I've got quite young skin so I just feel like it was a bit too much it doesn't like sink in really nicely and stuff I don't like feeling like I've got a lot of stuff on my face when I go to bed okay also used up the Manor protection by Evo this is so funny like if you read what it actually says on here it's a protein treatment so just good for damage to get bandages for the breaks boosts for the shoots a kick against the sick main attention is a heavy dose of shine and strength to help repair weak brush or color treated hair so it's literally just like a hand mask that you use in the shower shampoo your hair and then put it in and leave it for five minutes and then rinse it out on the front it says the shock tactic that'll cure your ills the psychiatrist for split ends the swedish dick pump for lasting body the reincarnated to bring the dead and the broken back from the grave i love their marketing all about that all about pumping up those hair shafts I used this up holy crap oh my god I just remembered what it was okay this is the Pina Colada exfoliating cream at body scrub so I just used to like a body scrub and I actually kind of used it like a body wash like no no not as a body wash I washed my body but like I used it daily coz it was really really gentle but I just had enough scrubbing it to kind of I don't know make my legs feel a little bit smoother I get really really dry skin on my legs it literally smells like sweet pineapple and coconut I'm all about that all about that love it definitely recommend this I think it was really really good especially if you need a little pick-me-up and some are coming up your skin's a little bit dull like it's so good with the eisenberg lotion purif --nt which i used up the whole thing surprisingly it's kind of like a tonic like a micellar water I just kind of used it after i cleansed to remove any extra makeup off my skin it kind of helps to get rid of like just anything lift on your skin and helps to brighten your face I really liked it I'm not sure if I repurchase because this brand is so expensive and I just don't know if I need it but it was definitely a nice extra step if you are looking for something to kind of help clean your skin better and brighten up your skin a bit I got rid of this because I didn't really notice it doing anything this is the which naturally clear blackhead at clearing it gel it's pretty much full of still but yeah I just didn't really like it we have a Marc Jacobs coconut primer who loved this early repurchase day I'm getting rid of this next color mascara found this in my bathroom drawer and it's so clumpy and disgusting and dried out and revolting and and then I've got a lash sensational by Maybelline which I love this I love it so much if you searched on my channel I've used a million times if you want to see how it works I love the wand love the formula I think it's a really really really good at drugstore mascara you know definitely use this again I've already got one in the drawer I have the Avett long advanced brightening serum at being looking forward to talking about this with you guys I bought this and it was so expensive it's one of the most expensive skin care products I've ever used by heard rave reviews and genuinely like after using it for a few days I noticed such a difference in my skin it looked way more even less red just nicer brighter better and I haven't repurchase to get balm definitely considering it because I've tried out a few other kind of serums they've just been in the house like that of things didn't and nothing else has impressed me as much so I might repurchase it I'm just holding off a little bit because obviously I wanted to try new things and I want to try to find something of you guys that is not as expensive because a lot of you guys probably won't want to spend as much money on this product it's as simple as that it's expensive AF but if you do have a higher budget for your skincare I definitely recommend it it says it addresses pigmentation boosts luminosity and rejuvenates your skin which I totally agree with has to visibly improve at the appearance of uneven skin tone for an energized radiant glow for best results apply morning and evening on clean skin after the brightening a lotion or just the other price I just used it with my Danish skink it was fine I used up this when I was traveling one time I kind of remember was ages ago this is the Aiko skinny brush mascara I love this mascara so much they used to be my Holy Grail like in 2014 was it doesn't did you in 2014 love the brush it's super skinny so you can really get a lot of volume in the roots of your lashes it's super black it just works amazing and I'll definitely repurchase this a lot it's so much the only reason I haven't got it again is because I've been trying new mascara is free repurchase this this is my studio fix powder by Mac which there's like a little ring around the outside but I'm just sick of it so I'm getting rid of it and then I'm getting rid of this because I really did not like it it's just a travel size like I think it was a sample or something but I just don't like it I just felt like it didn't really work that well it's my Bobbi Brown and send along with makeup remover it didn't work me just put it out there but I do like will be round eye cream Holy Grail okay we're on to my next garbage bag and getting rid of those too this I just didn't love it either but I'm going to probably empty this out and then refill it to reuse the tangka ching it just smells like really sickly to me like it just don't like the smell like I can smell the eklund it's glazed apple I can deeply smell the Apple which I don't mind but it also just smells like I don't know I like medicine it smells kind of like kids medicine to me there's this Antipodes Kiwi seed oil eye cream which is completely you so actually I think Hamish used this up and he loved it cuz I definitely do not use this I've used up a Schwing I love this liquid eyeliner I just love the applicator it's super black and it dries completely completely matte which I am a huge fan of the applicator is like a little felt tip brush and it's just so easy to get said line thick wide and winged no wing like just waver I love it it's one of my favorite the balm products of life and then I have a soothing moisturizer by oxygen skincare this is jojoba vitamin E and hops I love this brand I just don't love love love the moisturizers like I like them I find them to not soak in as nicely as I would like but the actual formula is really nice I noticed they go really well with my skin I'm just getting rid of them because I do have other moisturizers I like better but I highly recommend oxygen cleansers their cleansers are incredible especially the hops one like the pumice and hops I think it is I mean I did use like half of them but yeah just moving on okay almost done I'm getting rid of it the Eco tan winter skin daily nourish it and merging and I really liked this I'm just getting rid of it so it's super old I should have kept up with them more often every time I used it I liked it it's like a gradual tanner but it's so lightweight so since your skin so nicely and it's so moisturizing so moisturizing I really liked it ba just didn't use it up and it's super old now I think I've had this since we moved into this house which was like three-and-a-half years ago or something it was definitely time to do a bathroom declutter that's all I'm saying and we getting rid of this too I didn't love it I liked it it worked but I prefer like the solid oil cleansers like the break-up by Clinique and all those kind of products this is the Basha breakup makeup cool cleansing oil I used up a glam glow mud mask completely like the rest is it just all dried up in there I love this stuff it helps to drop any excess oils it helps to exfoliate your skin really brightens helps to minimize breakouts it's really good hey use up a nice a glow this is still one of my favorite foundations ever I do need to use it more often and videos it's just what am I like go to like the color is amazing I wear the shade put a job it's perfect for me but I've got a bit fake tan on it's just such a good formula it's easy to blend it lasts all day it's just a great great great foundation love it this is like half use by Meerut of it cuz the packaging just turned to crap it's all oily and like this is broken and it's sticking to me I don't like it lacks the actual product it's Byun Tiffany's it's the joyous protein-rich night replenish therm so it's just like an oil it's got Himalayan goji berry raspberry seed oil and hibiscus flowers so it's just like an oil um I'm just gonna rid of it coz the patients like disgusting also getting rid of this because it's old 8f I've had this for years also what does my hair doing I'm so sick of this hydrating style cream Moroccan oil hydration range definitely does what it says it's super hydrating I just used to use it in damp here and I've actually used up how Huey doing this is I think it's probably up to like somewhere in here somewhere you can kind of see through there it's kind of hard to see I've used quite a lot of it bun skin Rebekah's it's super old I don't know if I repurchase it just because I've got heaps of other ones I'm using at the moment like you will see in upcoming emptied videos also you start the Mario Badescu at drying lotion love this stuff but I actually prefer the other ones I've talked about in my other empties videos because simple reason I'll actually show you so you know how you apply it with like a cuter this one's dirty and old when you're trying to like dip it like to the bottom when you've used quite a lot of it like I'm sorry but that's just freakin in a way it gets all of your fingers the actual formula is great but it's not better then the other ones I tried so I'm getting rid of it this was also old a if this was awesome though it is the Saint Tropez soft an intensifier now this is just like a tinted moisturizer it looks like this it doesn't come out that dark so it just gives your skin a really healthy tint of color so it's really good to use as a moisturizer on top of like fake tan skin or pale skin to give you a little bit of color and it wasn't like a gradual tanner like it was just like an instant color that you could just wash off if it looked bad which I like I would definitely repurchase this I don't know if they still make because it's old I have to look into it next up I used up my manuka dr forming facial cleanse I just sponsorship for the ages ago talk about how I like this so firming cleanses so I like to use this sometimes with my vanity planet little what are they called like spending facial brush thing I've actually been using this for like a year but I haven't finished it because I've been using my other skincare products as well but I just finished it because I ran out of my other cleans I really like this it's not my all-time favorite but I do really like it and I recommend it if you do want to try this brand and if you have breakouts and stuff like that it's really good I used up the wash behind your ears shower gel Hamish hated this so much and he was like using 8 litres of it every time he used it to trying get rid of it faster I didn't love it but I didn't hate it and the reason I didn't hate it the reason I didn't hate it was because I really liked the formula I just didn't like the smell so much this made my skin so soft I don't know what they put in here but it was so moisturizing however the smell is kind of like man I don't even know what it is like it's not amazing I liked it I don't know if I'll repurchase it probably not they came in a bit of scent then yes but it was just so soft there you go it says conditioning sunflower oil creates a luxurious leather that will leave your skin feeling soft and sunny ok I also used up this annika sports shower gel and this is bible leader i love the brand walidah i think it's a great brand but this product I just hated the smell I mean if you have used annika products you know you really know the actual quality of the product was good though I was using this for but then I gave it up for my Danish skin care red liquid stuff this is the Paula's Choice skin perfecting 1% bhi gel salicylic acid and I just pumped it onto like a little cotton round used all over my face and it's basically an exfoliator in liquid form and it really did help they help to brighten it how to make my skin smoother helps with breakouts and blackheads and stuff like that it is really good it's just that I prefer my Danish thinking one okay I'm getting rid of this I liked it but I don't love it I used it the other day again I was just like it's not my favorite thing ever so I'll just get rid of it I'm trying to be savage with my face masks like I said it is a putty kind of formula by the face shop it's called black kid out it's like a putty-like you squeeze it really hard and it's almost like blue like it's really hard to work with and it turns into a poor strip and you take it off and it removes pause I mean whose paws we wish it removes anything out of your paws I just find that my B or a charcoal strips and more effective than this okay we're almost there there's like four more products so one of them my eyelash keeps getting stuck my hair this is the Rican extreme anti snap love it just don't use it too often I find if I use it too often it makes my hair feel really crunchy because it's got so much like protein in it but yeah I do like it it does help this is the origins that drink about 10-minute masks that I finished I've already repurchase this I love it so much it's basically just like a intensive moisturizer you put it on leave it for 10 minutes wipe it off and it makes your skin feel so hydrated I love to take this traveling with me for after flights when my skin feels super super super crack it's so good I love this brand origins I'm getting rid of those because I broke the top off I don't really remember if I liked it that much a spider veins which I know I'm pronouncing it wrong I don't know how to pronounce it it's a splitting serum I obviously wasn't wowed by it I use like half of it and I broke the top and I was like what about throw away and the last thing is the Beija trouble lotion I love this range it's by Innisfree I love the little spot treatment vision of the Beija trouble stuff too Raya seed oil um the actual lotion I liked this is like the tiniest bit left like I have well and truly giving it a really good go I do like it it was really good waited lots of breakouts because it was really lightweight it didn't

gosh look at this one I feel like I'm gonna love it and then it is like a really pretty like berry color and like a pinky or wonderful I'm so excited so these are made in the USA and then you have this beautiful frosted glass kind of true and then let is rose gold so I love the packaging I think it's really nice and classy and then on the little pamphlet it has a little description of each color and the name and global bus so I am going to start with the shade a teddy bear teddy bear the soft cappuccino colored met lip it is the perfect nude to have you feeling extra snuggly and cuddly it looks so pretty so let's try it on for ourselves you'll be able to see how beautiful and pigmented these are like I am not lying I've got no reason to lie to you guys I really like the formula phase they're so freakin pigmented and creamy see I feel like this looks so pretty with this eye makeup as you can see it went on it's super smooth and super pigmented as I already said and you can see it starting to dry down to a completely matte finish and once it's met it's completely transferred proof last month's like I was obsessed with the cherry color kind of color and the red holy crap that red and yeah they threw wear really nicely they're quite comfortable on your lips they're not too drying or anything like that and I think that quite nice like they don't seem to to situate the fine lines on your lips if you can see still trying this color is so beautiful it's like a node with the kind of warm undertone to it and there's the affair shade I cannot get over this College anymore I like take it off I found the easiest way to remove these is with a little bit of oil so I'm doing now I'm just putting a little bit oil on my tissue and then just massage it off because they really do stick to your lips if you watch my last video don't like on if you ever okay niggas that let's do a pillow talk so this is what it looks like on the low tide looks like such a beautiful berry color pillow talk you can't help sharing it internet secret or to cut up and be able the sultry bright floral pink oh my gosh that's so Prius or muted so creamy you guys have no idea how creamy and opaque this is like I don't know if you can see it on the camera hopefully you can the shade in particular like that all pigment in or creamy bit this is so luxurious so this shade here is at float off once again I love this so much more than thought I would this is the perfect color new time of year you could wear that any season just by switching up your eye makeup I feel like it's so green oh my gosh this is another favorite for sure life look how pretty I want to take it off seriously like I know I've only had two rounds of the service but so far all the colors have just been on the point okay in a last shade we have here this one is called set in sheets and this is how it looks on it the little pamphlet look how amazing that looks on her ah produce okay so this one says this satin lipstick and bold pink in a light touch machine that will hug your lips just like your set and chips have your curves now they have it told me that this particular shade all the others are transfers like I did thus particular shade because it's sort of deep and pigmented and like a second it's not as transfer proof I don't mind that so much but I thought I'm new to met you guys just in case holy this is almost like a joy chrome but not like it's got a little bit of a shimmer kind of throw at this color reminds me of Christmas for some reason by the way these smells amazing so real sweet caramel vanilla or something like that this color is so unique and definitely think with this color you need to take a little bit more time the other ones go on it's super super smooth and even my this doesn't but it does have that kind of Sheen through it so you want to make sure you apply it really really evenly like take your time with it and like the others this one's it's drying down super quickly by the way I can't remember pricey but these are definitely cruelty free and vegan so that is how this color looks dry it's like a bright kind of pink fuchsia color it's almost like a little bit like red and until something I don't know so unique you see the shine it's so cool this is the type of color that I need to pull out at Christmas time so once again if you are interested in trying these out you can use my code down below if you two free lipsticks your first month so if you use my code you can choose from the colors from my previous video which were hottie Tottie Cosmo

it down below so you have a little recap on the colors I really like all of these I think my favorite is definitely in the middle shade by the way something new I learnt about Kissimmee is if you dislike the colors a certain monk you can actually skip them as well which is really cool and of course you don't pay like it's free to skip a month so I thought that was really cool because some people were commenting on the video saying like this is so stupid what happens if I hate the colors like I don't want pay for colors I'm never going to wear so you can just go or alternatively you can

hey everyone holy crap it's so hot in here I am finally doing on one of my most requested like first impression goes I think I've ever had heard of beauty what is this called Photoshop Foundation so I have not been ignoring you guys you guys may ask you for this I feel like for months the reason I haven't done it sooner is because I could not get a hold of it it is on Sephora in New Zealand's website every time I went on there like every single shade was sold out and I went on the other day just to like look I've got myself signed up for like the notifications and stuff that I had a look and the one shade I needed was like the only one in stock so I got it so if you guys haven't tried this yet and you'll want you to buy it like I apologize if it's impossible to get seems to be like all the rage at the moment I've heard plenty of good things about it but I actually have also heard some not-so-good things about it so I'm excited to see what my own opinion is on it this product so it is once again the huda beauty photofiltre high coverage cream foundation you get 35 mil which is a little bit more than average and I got the shade at keshu 148 G so the packaging it's like this ombre it black like glass looking things but I think it's just plastic I thought it was glass looking at it but it's quite lightweight the packaging itself is kind of big it's similar to the white cell foundation but even bigger if I compare it to my wife and I should be talking a lot about like is you know quite a bit bigger so not ideal when it comes to traveling and stuff like that I do prefer something that's a little bit smaller just because I do travel all the time I like the fact that it's lightweight it's just the space you know it takes up so much space and your makeup bag and in case you care here's what the box looks like so yeah I'm going to do the normal thing I'm gonna prime the half of my face and we can see if there's any difference with the application longevity the look of it so I'm going to start by priming a half of my face and I use this primary cuz it's right here in front of me this is the J one at jelly PEC dramatic firming / ever oh I saw my supposed to do both sides which side shall I do I'll do this side this stuff is like superglue fuel makeup to stick on top of so we'll see yeah how it works so on the Sephora website oh my gosh I've got like a flush stuck in the primer what's going on the Sephora web site the huda beauty foundation it goes for 40 US dollars I paid more than that obviously in New Zealand and it's rated like 4 stars out of 5 which is pretty decent and there is quite a good shade range as well here is a little diagram so looks like I've got a good spread from like really fair you know slightly low medium and deeper skin tones and it says it is a medium to full coverage and it's good for dry combination and normal skin and oily skin so all skin types and the finish is I don't get it it literally says session matter radio like I don't get it there you go I don't know how you can be radiant in there in session all at the same time but that's fine a full coverage cream foundation that visibly conceals of blemishes and imperfections for a filter like finish oh here we go it says it leaves just Gannett with a hint of Sheen for a luminous appearance okay so I am just going it's got a pump I'm just gonna pump maybe like half I don't even know if that's half a pump but I'm doing that much to start by the way don't mind this giant friggin volcano that just popped up on my lip it's so painful it's literally like so swollen this whole area is just like swollen now it's so bad using a round face brush I'm just gonna tip it and distribute it and blend smells really good I don't even Alice so sore I didn't even know what it smells like but it smells good that's actually gone quite a long way look at that my biggest issues when it comes to foundation recently are definitely fading it down here and kind of like not sitting nicely on my nose sometimes it looks super aids on my nose so I'll keep an eye out for those issues and obviously any other issues as well oh that color is like pretty much perfect stoked okay yeah that finish is so beautiful I can kind of see what they mean like it doesn't look like a luminous foundation it looks quite nip then it does have that like shine when you kind of move your face so far really good to be honest okay let's do the other side and they're trying to the same amount let's see how it applies on top of a primer it smells like perfume hopefully it doesn't break me out I hope that it breaks some people out like really badly I don't know if it's because of the fragrance or one of the other ingredients who knows um but hopefully it doesn't happen to me if I end up liking their the smell of this is making me feel very nostalgic about something Tribeca smells kind of like impalas or something do you guys remember impulse in New Zealand like the body spray it kind of smells like that so if the foundation on both sides of my face looks very similar zoomed you in and lift the exposure quite low so you can really see how it looks it's sitting it beautifully on my skin on both sides of my face it hasn't emphasized any pores or anything like that I definitely think I'm going to try it build it up a little bit more cuz it's like a hint of pink you can still say and I feel like I need a light blame or look around this area because I've kind of like stopped so I'm just going to take another oh that's probably like a third of a pump it's covering up my free cool it's like okay nothing really covers them completely but I mean it's done a pretty good job so that's really easily a buildable I really love the finish I'm such a big fan of the finish it's so stunning I was kind of nervous to try this because a lot of the time with super hyped up products I feel like I don't feel the same way I don't know why I think I get too excited about it and then it's just like you know it doesn't live up to the expectation but so far this is so flawless and beautiful this brush is working amazing with the foundation so now my rudeness is well and truly gone so that's how the foundation is looking I'm going to quickly hop off the camera and finish my you know powder and concealer and everything and I'll come back and show you how it's looking it's 10:00 a.m. by the way so it obviously throughout the day I will check back in with you guys and show you how it's looking okay guys so here is my makeup all done it's now 20 or 5 pass teams so we are going to see how the makeup wears throughout the day so far I'm obsessed with how my face looks I paired it up with my no filter concealer my Kat Von D under icing powder and then my enormous ya face sitting powder and this is how it looks it looks so beautiful it's super full coverage it does look a little tiny bit cakey not necessarily cakey I guess it's just like you can tell there's makeup on Thanks so yeah I will see you guys in a few hours hopefully this Wiz really well throughout the day because the color is so nice like I feel like it matches amazing so I'll talk to you guys soon so it is 2 p.m. the foundation has been on what time do I start was at 10:00 I figured every single time I film one of these videos I swear for hours right I think if it meant I don't know it's still looking amazing before I had one of those moments where I just full-on started rubbing my eye because I forgot I was wearing makeup I was like ah but um it's okay I got a little bit of mascara Chung's down here but it's kind of brushed off it hasn't affected my foundation whatsoever and the actual foundation is looking amazing I don't think it has oxidation like that it looks so smooth full coverage actually a little bit has it faded just here and just here maybe from when I was eating um so that's something to keep an eye on throughout the day around my nose it's really good it hasn't started creasing or you know bone cake here anything like that yet hopefully it won't so I will let's see you guys again in a few more alleys hey everyone I just got back from my entomology and thought I would update here it is almost 4:30 p.m. I definitely feel like it is starting to deteriorate ever so slightly but it still looks incredible from far away when I have my entomology I was face down for a while it still stayed put pretty it well can you shush bone I just feel like it is starting to crumble up a little bit just here this is prime so I can't remember which side I prime this is the prime side right the site looks better for sure Oh zoom in a second but yes a nice tip right here it's starting to wipe off around my nose a little bit and there's a couple like little dots on my nose where it's wiped off a little bit from me being on my face which probably isn't like a normal thing to do when I've got makeup on but there is some my skin it looks so like this is one thing I forgot to mention before it looks so silky smooth like my skin it looks like butter it's so soft looking like it just looks incredible so I am pretty impressed with the foundation so far hasn't really sunk into any of my expression lines too badly there's that one just there when I realized she kind of said it but you know it's looking pretty good it's just those couple of areas where I've kind of obviously smushed it against the towel yeah the time is currently 7:30 what's that nine and a half hours it's looking quite cakey down here still and again it's kind of melted Moorhead peel off there but we already talked about that and I feel like it's gone a little bit oily just up here so definitely maybe not oily skin I'd say it's more for like normal skin because for me like I don't normally get oily and it's like kind of sticky hey I could be wrong if you've got oily skin use this foundation just comment down below and let me know what you think of it maybe if you use like seeing spray and the correct primer and everything is probably fine I mean on the side it's not very oily at all like compared to the non-prime side the prime site is definitely looking at much better it's starting to melt now around my nose that the sides like way worse if that makes sense I'm sure you guys can see however it hasn't faded on either side the lasting power is so good and I'm still loving the way it looks like I said if I didn't have a massage like the entomology and stuff I don't think it would be messed up just here because it's probably just from where like I was resting my face I think it looks really really really smooth still like my skin looks like butter hey guys so it is 9:30 now this isn't my last update I'm going to sleep I'm so tired sorry about the buzzing and humming off with my ring light on obviously because it's dark outside so I roll the prime side definitely dead beta and basically didn't fade I feel like it's starting to ever so slightly fade now that I have been laying in bed so I am stoked like I am definitely going to continue using this hopefully it does not break me out we will soon find out and I'll keep you guys updated within my videos didn't really sink into exhibition lines I think the worst it does is it go a little bit oily and then just went really chunky on the unprimed side I don't know why I'm obviously wiped off which once again probably probably would not normally happen I just can't get over how even it looks and it looks so buttery smooth I keep saying that but it really does like it just looks so filtered it really does I'm excited to keep experimenting with it especially with sitting spray and stuff like that I feel like it'll be even more incredible with sitting spray but we will see if you have tried this foundation write your review down below in the comments I would love to hear what you think of it and I will talk to you guys in the next video you 
hello everyone I know I look very crazy right now but today I am doing a video on makeup mistakes that everyone makes what everyone has made in the past including myself and I basically just show you the mega mistake from this half of my face and the right way to do it on this side of my face display mess because we always need a disclaimer on YouTube I'm not saying that this is how you're not allowed to do makeup or the cetacean do makeup or whatever these are my tips and tricks on how to improve if that's what you want some people may think that this side and way worse than this side you know everyone's got a personal preference and it is 100 percent okay I've had people tell me that my makeups terrible and I loved it and at the end of the day if you like your makeup that all that matters so hopefully I can address some things that may help you improve your skills or you know make you think about things in a way you haven't thought about it before just in order to help you hopefully improve your skills a little bit I mean you may learn nothing from this video but hey hopefully you guys find it entertaining and fun to watch regardless I haven't done one of these videos in so long and the ones I used to do back in the day they were makeup mistakes that I mean they were so exaggerated and I find a lot of the videos like this that I have watched on YouTube are so exaggerated like who even does that you know whereas I tried to do things on the side of my face that people do do by accident or have trouble with and just gave you tips on how to improve hopefully once again if you don't want to improve screw me who cares it's totally personal preference so all the power to you guys enjoy your makeup have fun with it and if you want to learn how I got this side of my face done anyway they're inter stay tuned so the first thing you want to do is make sure your face is nice and clean and fresh make sure you've got no remaining makeup on that your skin from the previous day make sure you've cleansed and moisturized and I also recommend it just making sure that you have exfoliated recently whether it be that morning or you know the previous day of the day before I find that if I have an exfoliate of my skin for a few days my makeup goes on a lot more patchy and cakey and it just doesn't look very good all of those like you did skin cells and everything they build up on your face basically just actors are really uneven based and all of your makeup is just going to stick to it and go super cakey and creepy and just not good looking so that's a really good tip I've already done that on both sides of my face but regardless we're going to start now and just do half my face good and half this is bad the next tip I have is just making sure that your primary and examination are compatible and this is only something I learn within the last year or two like I wasn't really familiar with it so I've been used to go for silicon or oily primers back in the day basically you want to match your foundation with your primer if you have a water-based foundation and then you go in with like a really early based or silicon based primer that can kind of just bounce off each other as you know water and oil don't mix they just separate and the same thing will happen on your face I'll put a link down below so I'm not making much sense to you just so you can learn a little bit more about it because it really does make a difference with how your foundation settles on your face if you do notice your foundation separates a lot my first tip would be a check what primer and foundation do what you are using and also check what moisturizer you're using before you do makeup because those all kind of mixed together and can create separation on your skin okay so the foundation I'm going to use today is reset gorgeous and I just notice I have coffee all of my finger that's kind of this is one of my favorite drugstore foundations I freaking love this as you can tell like I've used a lot of this is starting to get a little bit empty the very first ingredient in this foundation if you have a look right down here is water which tells us that for a good application we want to use a water-based moisturizer in a water-based primer I also want to say that there is kind of like an exception sometimes you'll find it'll work okay this is just like a general rule that will just ensure that you'll make up a look better you know we have at the oil-free Smashbox photo-finish and even though it says oil-free it still it does contain silicon and silicon as you know has a very similar feeling to oil whereas the hangover product that you faced this is water-based so these are going to work really well together this is not the worst combination in the world they may work they may not but what I'm trying to say is if you're using a silicon based primary you should probably use a silicon based foundation as well it believes like Thai Amazonian clay foundation foundations like there are often a silicone base but you can just quickly google it online and it will tell again I'll put more information down below because I'm probably confusing you right now but anyway let's just get started so on that the good say I'm going to put the hang of a primer often the water-based primers feel really refreshing as well which push you have a really big fan of and then on the other side this is another one of my favorite primers you can tell the difference when you touch them this one feels like a moisturizer this one feels very silky smooth and it kind of fills in your pores a little bit there's no right or wrong with your preference it's just all about choosing a foundation that works well with whatever kind of tissue you like better so both of the primers are on you can't really see anything yet next up we're going it to take really thick gorgeous foundation of course a makeup do is making sure that your foundation is the correct under twine in the correct shade it for you so right now I have no feet turn on I'm going to take shade at 105 on the good side a good way by the way to match your foundation is just by taking a little bit and kind of putting it near your neck and also on your chest so just kind of like blend it in and see if it's obvious you want to match your foundation it to your chest most of the time that's what people are saying they're not seeing like your jawline and often people that necks or a lot pelas in their chest so if you matched your chest it's all going to match so I just like to kind of a Deb machination up and down and this is just a flat face brush break so beauty and of course to move it down your neck a little bit because like I said often your neck is a little bit lighter than the rest of your face and chest you can see that that matches really nicely with my chest area too I'm sure you guys all know this so one thing you don't want to do is just go straight with a darker foundation you don't want to be thinking like oh I look so freakin pale today looks like tan up our face it's not going to look good let me show you an example this color is definitely fine to me when I say tan on but I don't have a tan on another makeup no nose to stop it the jawline again probably something most of you guys know on the good side I carry it all the way down so it's satchel but you can definitely see it that the side of my face does not match it looks really orange it's the wrong undertone to my natural skin tone it just looks very obvious and wearing makeup oh is because this side goes down my neck and matches my chest it looks a lot more natural okay let's do miss Texas this time so the next mistake is using a concealer that is too pale I have living a victim of this many times even in my videos sometimes you're so tempted to go on with a super pale concealer because you think I'll go crashing at my eyes and make me look nice in my weight but sometimes it just looks terrible to be honest honestly been there done that so this concealer as you can see is a lot paler than my actual skin tone or my cheeks can turn that created with this orange foundation for so you've noticed I've used a whole lot of product that's another thing you want to avoid is using too much concealer it can do the opposite effect if you are doing these mistakes I'm not trying to say like oh my god you're doing a make-out wrong you must change your makeup and do it how I tell you to do it if you like it that's totally fine but I'm just kind of showing your mistakes I have made in the past I've made all these mistakes in the past and if you like the look go for it because that's makeup like it's totally up to you you can wear makeup out every you want and everyone got different opinions so my opinion could be completely irrelevant to you do you not I mean so just do what you want that head in my opinion a much better look is going to put in just a little bit lighter and I'm going to do the exact same shape so there's no difference there and this can feel that it's a little bit lighter and texture to you so it's not going to look so cakey this side looks a little bit cakey air because I use so much product it's easier to go in with less product and build up this particular concealers so you can see to blend out in my opinion that just looks a little bit more wearable it doesn't look so stark and harsh is the really pale under-eye with like the orange garnish and it just looks a little bit smoother and less cakey next mistake is something I used to do a while ago sticking my under eye concealer with my face powder you can get so many amazing under a sitting powders which honestly they do work they work better because they're often more finely milled they are more lightweight so they don't look as heavy under your eyes and don't create so much creasing and caking it's on a good side I'm going to use my favorite which is the equipo de la kit brightening and ricotta but first on the back side and side I'm going to use at the c3 Studio Fix powder which is my face powder so we're just going to go straight in with the face data and pack that underneath my eyes like I normally would with my under eye powder and on the other side using my brightening powder by Kat Von D hopefully this video might help people by maybe pointing out something there they're doing but not really noticing you know some people like I don't know why my son nation is not sitting properly on my face or whatever the case may be even maybe it's just one of these simple things and then to finish off the complexion I'm taking my powder with a big powder brush so on it a good side what I do is I like to stipple first and this will set the foundation and then once I have stippled the foundation I've been down over my face I will be in that going really gently and kind of buff it just to make sure any loose powders are kind of flicked off my face or Bufton and then on the bad side going straight in and just buffing this can move at your base underneath and for some reason I often find it looks more cakey when I do it that way it's going to be hard for you guys to see on camera moving right along to some more noticeable rights and wrongs hopefully be able to actually see the ones going forward bronzing okay this is so easy to go wrong and I think a lot of people make the innocent mistakes of bronzing increasingly so one of my favorite bronze is the ambient bronze light bronzer by hourglass it looks like this I'm taking a medium matte face brush so on the bed side I'm going to straighten with heat the product on my brush I'm just going to put it on my cheek everyone tells you to do the three so up on the temple down to cheat and then down underneath now this is how I used to bronze you'll find that when you just go in with a crap-ton a product like that it's going to look like orange it may look patchy however if we just take a small amount of product in our brush and go in with a light hand and just buff that over and we'll do the exact same areas so over the cheek and then up onto the temple and now I'm tapping once more checking it off and then just down on the jaw making sure to get into the hairline can even go down the neck a little bit you can see the difference pretty much straight away for the side looks a lot more natural and then the side it looks very full on very dramatic kind of patchy kind of orange you want a more intense bronze to look then you can just go on with a little bit more then kind of intensified on the outer edges so on the back your cheek kind of well here will be ting when it's down and up on the very top of your forehead they keep it darker around the outside and blend it really really well it's just a little bit safer than going all in at once you don't need to do that contouring obviously I know most of you guys already know this trick but just in case there's anyone out there that may be doing this and is wondering why their contour does not look good taking your brush to contour using your orangish bronzer orangey bronzers can be very appreciated on this side it just warms up my complexion and made me look a little bit more like some tents and kissed away we want to say a little bit more glowing and healthy but when it comes to contouring you want to use something that looks more like a shadow this is not the color of a shadow this is like orangish so if you put it on we need to contour it's going to look not natural at all it's just going to look orange it's just going to look like a big orange stripe on your face however if I wipe off my brush and go in with a color like this one see how this one's a little bit more like grey that's what we want we don't want anything too warm so this one is a nice and cool tone like a shadow and I'm going to put this on kind of where I bronze as well just to create a little bit more structure and cheekbone shape and you can see that looks more like a cheekbone than this side I'm just going to press straight on top of my nose on this side of my face because I find it makes my nose looks more if I just kind of like kind of bronze it okay blush this is quite obvious but of course you don't want to apply too much blush I like to go in with a buildable blush these are one of my favorite kinds these at a clinic cheek pops this is melon pot I'm just taking on a small face brush and I'm kind of like holding my brush a little bit further back and then just using a really light hand just kind of blend it on my cheeks and I'm going all the way back so starting around the Apple does that silly look going backward and you can barely see it and it's kind of the aim you don't want to look like you've got a big stripe of color on your face what you don't want to do is build up to a brush too much I think this is not necessary and then you don't want to go in with your fingers straight next to the head you don't want to just put on your apples and really rub it on there you want to be gentle like I did on this side I'm also just going to keep it on my Apple I'm not going to blend it backwards so personally I think doing this kind of your cheeks was bigger which could be the aim for some people depending on your face shape for me I've got very chubby cheeks so this is a no-no for me for highlighting a need to emphasize once again everything this video is my personal opinion especially this because some people love full-on highlight and it's totally fine it can look really good sometimes personally I find it just taking a more natural highlighter or smaller amount of highlighter looks a lot more flattering on the skin especially for everyday wear I'm going to take this highlight event from my brand Expo Beauty one this is Sophie this is what it looks like and it's in at the shade Aurora and taking a little on my brush just like so and once again I'm holding at the brush at the very back to get a really light application and I'm just kind of buffing a little bit of that onto my cheek and you can see how pretty that looks that just looks radiant I love highlighter it's one of my favorite makeup products that I find that some people can go overboard just highlighting all the high points of my face so that's eyebrow chin nose and you can see how beautiful that looks like it just looks so radiant and fresh and glowy I cannot stress this enough personal preference personal preference personal preference some people look amazing in a shit-ton of highlighter I find it definitely looks really nice in photos but you know real life it can really implies your pores it can just do like the opposite effect of what you want it to do which is highlight your features sometimes it just highlights the wrong features you know that means I'm taking it the speaker highlighter I love these in small doses but if this is what you're doing like applying a whole lot onto your brush and then going ham by the way this is in the shade moonstone and it's beautiful it's a beautiful product but I'm just showing you how not to apply it and also bringing it too far down see how I'm going it down all the way down on my cheekbone if you looked on this side you would notice I kind of stopped just underneath kind of like just past the outer corner of my eye on this side I'm going down a little bit further and you can see it's just highlighted all of my pores even out here you can just see it looks quite chunky you can see every imperfection you can see every pore that I've got that really big like I don't notice these normally but as soon as I put a heap of shimmery highlighter on top of that it just shows everything side of course just still going to see some imperfections because I'm not photoshopped this is like my natural skin you can see it just glides on top and because I used less product and just kind of focused it where I needed to it is highlighting my features it's not highlighting the wrong features like on this side so I could be wrong you could still use this highlighter and get a terrible effect it's definitely down to the application as well if I do the same thing put it above my eyebrow like I did on the other side on the tip of my nose which I actually love these for the tip the mouth anyway and then gentleman chin you're going to see that it's just a little bit truthful on like go light handed that's all you've got to do like if you use this product and you find holy crap it just looks so bad on my skin it makes me look oily whatever your problem is literally take a little bit less apply it with the tip of your brush and just apply it in a really small area so you can see the same kinda just looks fresh and radiant the side looks a little bit oily nice top eyebrows so how not to do your eyebrows so you use a pomade it ladies what you don't want to do is go straight in and start applying a whole lot of product it's going it to look cakey it's going to look patchy but it's like this are designed to you know only use a tiny amount so you don't want to be painting on your eyebrows like this again personal preference some people like the look of really blocky eyebrows however personally I still like to be able to see each hair of my eyebrow so it looks a little bit more natural and just realistic I guess it's the same as natural also it's going to make your brush super stick and Kate with makeup which means you actually wash your makeup brushes mask in so there's how that looks and I guess it does a look at that bad right but let me do the other side now so I'm still just dipping my brush and I'm going to be very careful just to take a small amount on the very tip of my brush so you can barely even see it and then just do little strokes and then that keep going so just keep doing little strokes until there's nothing left on your brush it's such a different effect with the same product in a local Mesa like this a lot of them you might use as little as possible to get the best result especially in the beginning of the brow I like to use barely any on my brush just so I can it create little hairs that are too dark and I like to use my brush on a vertical kind of angle and just do little strokes and then to make it view good side over I look even more you know authentic I'm using gimme brow by benefit which is one of my favorite things if it and it really helps to kind of bring back those hairs and make your eyebrows look here II again rather than just like a big block and you can see that eyebrow just looks a whole lot more natural than this one this one looks really sharp and bold the slim still its bold and still looks pretty sharp but it's just a little bit softer and it's just a little bit more kinder to the rest of my features and this side it's just like whoa look at those eyebrows the side you see the whole face you don't just go straight to the eyebrow you said something I'm still guilty off make sure you prime your eyes so on the bad side I'm not going to prime at my eyelids from this side and I still don't prime sometimes but it really doesn't make a difference especially when you use a primer like this one which is tinted it helps to kind of hide any discoloration on your eyes I find if I don't hide the discoloration because I saw a lot of redness on my eyelid it just makes my eyeshadow look really patchy because you can see the little bits of red and the other colors underneath however when you blank it out perfectly I choose on top go on so much smoother and look the less pitchy it's also good just to kind of tidy up underneath your brows next up on the good side I'm going to take a shadow that matches my skin tone more or less and a little bit lighter and then I'm just going to pack that all over top of that primer to set it down and again just help to conceal I'm going to use these eyeshadow stays because they look beautiful things other saucy iShares by I love salafi so he said taking a crease blender brush if you have this brush your gets to be here this makes I should have bleeding so much easier I'm going to do the bad side first so what I'm going to do once you like the bronzer and the highlighter taking too much on your brush it's such a simple mistake and then what I'm going to do is start in the middle and then go back and forth and Blanche I'm sure you guys all kind of know how to blend these are subtle mistakes people make so you know just go back and forth and blend and it doesn't look terrible I'm going to do it the good side so I'm going to add one tap and instead of standing in the middle of my eye I'm going to start where I want the darkest part of my eye to be which is always the outer corner or often the outer corner where you first place your brush is going to be the place where the most eyeshadows going to stick if you start in the middle you're gonna have the most eyeshadow stuck in the middle if you start in the outer edge the most I show is going to be stuck in the outer edge so starting here and then blending in and you can sail got a lot less product on my eye I'm just going to take my time and blend that I'm going to go back in with one more tap again start on the outer corner and then it come in even I'm guilty of doing this now like sometimes I'm just like and put it on however if you just take a couple of minutes and not even there's like an extra minute just to do a few layers and start in the right place and just take your time with the blending it's going to give you a way more professional result so you can see that difference this color is beautifully blown out this color darker you can obviously build this color up to be darker too if you wanted but this color is a lot darker and it's quite patchy on the inner corner and in the middle now I'm going to take this pill here once again too much product like a lemon or actually it's just load up the brush okay now no put on my outer corner the problem with this good luck blending it out because this is going to take forever to blend and it's just going to go everywhere so if I place that down and try to blend it out it's just going to go all through the crease it's going to go all the way out here however if I'm taking the same brush and again just taking one look I broke it picks through out of it I've never done it before another reason not to load up your brush apparently anyway if you just take one cap once again and then start at the outer corner again a light pressure in little circles the products I'm not going to go as fast it's not going to go like all the way out here because you don't have as much product on your brush and because of the lighter pressure that you're putting on your brush you're not sending the bristle splaying lout which means that the product stays in one place I mean you can stack and moving that into the crease again start on the outer crease and just buffing it in now I'm going to take this color here because it looks really fun with an ice tray brush like to pack this on when I do my eyelid so just doing a few chips in there and then applying it directly to the eyelid kind of going up to the crease and if I do the same on the other side you know you can't really go wrong with the eyelid color and then on this side I'm not going to blend it out this is just a common mistake people make it's a very simple one I've done it a million times too but just making sure you go back in with that brush just buff out any edges just to make sure that there is no harsh line this also completely depends on what look you're going for though like sometimes you might be going for a harsher look makeup is art there's no right or wrong but you know if you just going the everyday blended natural eyes and I like this is natural beauty on me I mean the blending is key if you are aiming to brighten your eyes of course again this completely depends on what look you're going for so if you're just doing an everyday looking you want to brighten up your eyes some people may think immediately go straight to white eyeliner now this does work and make sure eyes look bigger but it also is very harsh you want to make your eyes look a little bit bigger more naturally and just make them look brighter in a better solution has to go with a nude and this is going to take away the redness out of your waterline and it's going to just make your eyes look a lot brighter like I said you can see the difference again totally depends what look you're going for but that's just a good little trick you know if you do find that you're like waves this looks like crazy mascara now how much can go wrong with mascara one way I think people put on their mascara is like this just sweeping up which works I mean it works right but I'll show you how to get even better results the way I like to do it take off any excess first of all from your brush most important step go in take away all the clumpy bits it's always going to happen no matter what scar you use tilt your head back look down into amer so you can see your lashes and your lectures aren't right against your eyelid like this when I was going like this you've got more of a chance of hitting the back of your eye makeup and ruining your makeup you guys are seen at my makeup tutorials I freaking ruin my I show all the time with my mascara but this just helps avoid it a little bit better and then what I'm going to do is rotate the wand underneath so I'm taking it over how to show you this so I'm kind of like winding it like this so I'm rotating the bristles into the roots of my lash a lot of people miss the roots so tilting of your back rotating into the root kind of look away from a wander if you're a little bit scared of hitting your eye and then blink into it do it a few times to cut all the roots of your lectures sorry if I've got your boogers I can go do cuz if I just stop there for a second and if I just stop here immediately look at the root of my lashes compared to the side they look so much thicker and then once you've done the roots go up to the tips I like to wiggle those find it helps to separate the lashes a little bit of what I like to do both in their lashes because they're still important it take my mascara want to do big eyes like this and I just use the tip like this I stabbed myself many times doing this so just be careful Mac also go through all the rest of my lashes and the same technique once I've done a layer this just helps to kind of separate them a little bit so straightaway hopefully you can tell the difference between the two eyes bottom mascara once again you don't want to just go like this go up and down up and down you're going to miss so many lashes but I like to place them on like place the wand on my lashes and then wiggle side to side and it coats more lashes without the meeting clumpy just a simple trick that makes such a difference you guys definitely try too few haven't tried it before and you can see by doing that as well you get closer to the lash line sorry the lighting is just blowing out okay while we here let's do another nono let's say you're doing eyelashes and oops I don't want to do too much okay that's realistic you did a little daughter's mascara on your eye your first instinct is to go in with a q-tip and wipe this is not ideal because most mascaras is going to smear it's going to spread it's going to ruin your eye makeup even more okay well you want to do is wait till it dries just one who's been here for like 30 seconds or a minute or whatever taking a little q-tip and again I like to do that rotating motion with my thumb like roll it I like to kind of like roll it as I go so that is little pressure as possible so I'm not disrupting the actual underneath i'm just doing little tiny rotating strokes just constantly rotating the trick is just to have as little pressure as possible you don't want to wipe you don't more like no smear it okay now let's say you are using false lashes and because of all I am using the gold digger today by expert beauty beautiful lectures hard to go wrong okay there's some easy to apply but the very number one thing of course depending how big your eyes are in your eye shape for most people the biggest mistake is taking the lash straight away off the train and just applying it as it is now this is a mistake I made when I very first started using false lashes I was like yeah all good just chuck it on that like lines up right a good tip also is to use a latex free glue because it's much quicker and easier to apply your lashes using it okay and then just applying it's true like this one bigger lash isn't it great there you go but the problem with doing this is one it's not gonna look as nice and you'll see the difference in a moment when I do the other eye and two you're going to notice that it's going to peel off a lot easier like the inner and outer corners are going to flick off way more often it doesn't set your eye properly now for the other side taking the lash I'll choose my son by the way to slide it off the lash band or the board Weaver I'm going to trim off any overhang from the inner corner and what I mean by there is the little piece of plastic you can really see on camera there's a little bit of place to it with no hairs on it and good trim it off and I'm going to line up it in a corner with where my inhalation start I'm going to put it right on it in a corner of my eye see this one's already flipped off probably like from here up see going to miss out that whole inner corner part you're going to line it up probably to the start of your eye weight and then you're going to trim any excess that stick out past the outer corner of your eyes so everyone's different you just need to line it up usually you have to take off you know two or three plastic so here's what I'm left with and always trim from the outer edge because then it's a little bit more natural and you can use a tweezer just to help set it down as close as possible to the lash line you will find it's easier to apply first of all and it's just going to last better on your eyes and still going to make your eye look is droopy to be honest because I find that this side looks droopy err when the lectures are like really long and I've made this mistake a million times to on it to Phillips this isn't like a makeup no no really but I recommend using a lip liner with your lip products just because I have some last longer look tidier and just stay in place of course so this is at the colour pot blood one and nine five one and like me if you over line your lips to keep it looking natural just go just over your natural lip line you don't want to kind of reconstruct a whole new lip line I mean you can so if you want it to look somewhat believable okay let's do a lip line on both sides so I can show you how not to a lip liner so let's say you're over lining your lips and you go literally like way over this is going to look silly on me anyway some people actually can pull it off so I actually really say you shouldn't do this but you know I think this is safe like if you start with this and once you're comfortable with you know you can do different shapes if you want I'm going to create a new shape I'm going to go pointy my natural lips are not pointy some people's are so it depends on you too now also would be correct size correct so I'm going to just blend it use your finger or a brush or just rub your lips together and on this side I'm going to leave it harsh by the way another point with the lashes it kind of hurts when they stab you in the inner corner so that's another reason why you don't want to put them too close anyway now I'm going to take a nude lipstick this is a bun to bake so beauty on the right side just applying it and not blending it with a lip liner you can see they don't match but there is a way to make it work once again it definitely depends on personal preference some people rock this look I've seen it been done those in me this is how I do it place more amount just dab it rub the tab rubbing only one side holds together you can even use your finger to blend it a little and doing this like pairing up the lighter news with the darker lip liner just make sure lips look nice and plump and there you have it so if I have like what kind of hides my face with okay so hopefully you guys can see the difference so here's the good side and the bad side once again not saying this is like terrible if you like to make up like that all the past years I think you can definitely see the difference so yeah this is how I prefer to do my makeup personally personal preference I hope that this helped somebody out there even if you just learn like a new tip or trick or something like that and if you do want to see more of these didn't feel free to let me know so I can do some more if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up even if you just found it entertaining and you were just like - and know Shannon question of the day what is

photos of me at high school I think they're all gone I think I destroyed them all but anyway I looked like friggin Slenderman or something I don't even know like my face was just so pale and then my

honest I could definitely deal with that take one capsule three times daily and it's just kind of like a conjunction looks like a supplement you know like you can't rely on something like this to make you thin or anything like that that comes from your eating and your exercise but if it does give you a bit more energy and helps with your metabolism in cravings and stuff like I'm down to give it a go I just hate stuff that you have to take multiple times a day like I am so forgetful when it comes to any kind of like tablets or supplements or anything like that like the only thing I remember to

hey everyone so today I'm doing a doesn't work video on another lip plumper product the last time I did a video on a lip plumper like product thing was those sucky little I can't even remember what they're called but you know like those red things I'll link my video down below I'm pretty sure it's my most viewed video on my channel so I thought I would try a different one today because this keeps forgettin stalking me all over Facebook obviously for some reason the ads are tracking me and the little sponsored video did and still does just show up all over my facebook wall so eventually I gave in I bought it which is exactly what they wanted me to do because I thought it would be really interesting to see if it really does work as well as the girls in the video say it does I don't know if they're likes one save it to do a video on this I am NOT sponsored I bought this with my own money I've never previously heard of the product so we're just gonna do like an honest first impression and see if it works we're so sure you'll love your jubilance results that we offer a 30 day money back guarantee along with a one-year product warranty which is pretty cool this little box I got the bonus pack which I've got the website just here and water off my druva lips calm and it costs 129 US dollars I suppose 129 dollars and it says it used to be 187 ninety so there you go it comes with the lip plumper device which is this thing yeah and it comes with a removable mouthpiece another mouthpiece 20 pack of felt pads a microfiber carrying gag and two triple A batteries it says your purchase includes 26 total replacement kits these pads will last for hundreds of users additional replacement pads are available here so you can buy some more and it comes with the extra mouthpiece so you can share it I don't think I'll be sharing it not sure if Hamish would be interested in this product but it's cool I suppose so I've already applied my lipstick the way I normally would on my lips right now if you're new to my channel these are my natural lips I don't have any fillers or anything like that and I do over line my lips slightly so you'll see when I take off the lipstick to use the product where my natural lip line is but I decided to just put on my lipstick as normal so we could see you know the difference with how I normally do my lips because if there's no noticeable difference from like this look that I would normally wear like why would I bother using it so this is my neutral lips and the lipstick I'm using is Kairos bikes for beauty it's one of the new shades it's a net I love this color so much it's so flattering and I'll also link down below this makeup look if you're interested it was the worst of maker video testing out the lowest rated products on mica so yeah link down below okay so it's got the features on the back let me run over these quickly it has a soft contoured fit it provides a gentle and comfortable seal a removable mouthpiece for easy cleaning its compact it's got a pressure regulated a pump which gives safe and reliable results errantly this is safer than those like sucky little mouthpieces because it doesn't suck too hard it's something about a shave and it's weightless likely to cause bruising or burst capillaries or anything like that it's got a push button control and a replaceable felt liner which applies equal pressure on your lips which I suppose would also help to prevent bruising so any size I was in a few different pieces so I guess this is the extra mouthpiece and it's got a little user guide which we will use and then this is the device so it is quite small it's kind of like the size of a nipple later it kind of looks like a nipple later slash adults wear /b trimmings we've got the batteries defaults and cymbal felts so first off I just popped that and I'm going to put in the berries they actually gave me good better Easter you know sometimes when you order stuff it comes with batteries it's lows like really rubbish random no brand batteries that lasts for like 10 minutes okay it's not too loud which is good it's already got a pouch little thingy in there so I guess that's how you do it you just kind of place it in there I'm not sure if you can see reading the instructions okay do not use the Dhruv ellipse device for more than one or two of the time 60-second applications during the first few times you tried the device okay so in this video I only want to do it one or two times small percentage of users may experience mild discomfort or minor bruising until you've used it a few times once it's been established that persons tolerant to once two uses you can increase to four to six if needed after the first few days I think I read as well that you can use it like before beard and use it consistently it can actually help to permit like not permanently but like steamy permanently plump your lips because normally with these kind of things you know her last wait a couple hours but I think the more you do it the longer the results will last so you could start to be like every night and it might last well something like that I don't know any of you guys had any experience with that let me know in the comments okay install the batteries done wit your lips or apply a lip balm before using obviously we'll do that in a second and we'll take off the lipstick and then it says you just place the device against your lips and push and release the power button allow an airtight seal to form it is automatically timed and will stop after 60 seconds so you should allow your lips to be pulled in to the hole and then after your first application you can share the results and repeat as you become more comfortable using the device you can experiment with working it around the lips to get their desired results for example you can work the top or bottom lips independently if needed do not overuse blah blah and then you can pull up the mouth guard from this to it cleaner just using mild soap and water and that is that so it seems pretty straightforward let's do it before and after so obviously this is my before and I've just put on quite a bit of a chapstick this is just a chapstick strawberry flavor and it's a little bit around my lips too basically I'll have to touch up my foundation let's just try this so I'm just gonna do it and I'll speed up the process so you don't have to watch me [Music] and my lips bigger I think they are mildly bigger there's not like a dramatic difference so just quickly first impression on there and it's really gentle I thought it was gonna be a lot stronger you can see me easily pull the device off your lips what I mean by see me easily is like if you just relaxed like it's not gonna like fail like your lips stay put but if you like pull it comes straight off which I kind of like it's kind of scary thinking that your lips could get like stuck in there I don't know it might just be me no it was actually quite gentle you could definitely feel it but it wasn't uncomfortable to use it wasn't too strong it didn't hurt in any way and I feel like my lips are mildly more plump they're not dramatic so I reckon we should do another one and see how it goes the little thing you fell out I think they look bigger but again it's not dramatic it's not as dramatic as those ones you suck yourself but I think that's because I would like suck really hard I'm gonna do another one the downside of this is taking a while like you know if you learn that you want to use it six times it's six minutes you've got to sit here I wish it was like a little bit stronger but I can understand like safety and all that and you don't want to bruise but at the same time just takes a while okay now I feel like I'm getting results if I get bruising it's obviously my own fault at this stage I'm gonna do it one or two more times on my top lip only because I feel like I've already got a quite full up bottom lip it's my top lip it's a little bit thin on the sides so we're just gonna try and do one lip now and I'll tell you how easy it is hey it's really hard to do one lip at a time I'm just going to do the whole mouth again twelve seconds later I can see it they're friends but I mean it's nothing dramatic personally there was a few times as well but I mean maybe once I put on my lipstick I'll be up to tell bitter because once again like my lip line I usually over draw it a little bit which I'm still gonna do cuz it's just how I roll I feel like it took such a long time my lips do feel quite good though like it's quite invigorating if you like my top lips a little bit past here at the side my bottom one looks maybe a little bit bigger but very similar my top lip definitely looks a little bit more like plump it would be quite cool if they created another measurement that was smaller so you could target areas like Tiger your top lip or something like even if it was like half the size and you can like massage or something would be quite cool maybe if they say this video maybe they could take that on board and I'm using Kairos again okay yeah my top lip is definitely plumper cause it feels different to apply my lipstick is this how people feel when they like first get lip fillers like you don't even know like what you're doing with your lipstick I'm a lips much plumper I can definitely see a difference but is it worth that amount of time to do this every time I put on my lipstick for temporary result I think I'm gonna keep trying this at nighttime like a full beard and like see if it makes an overall difference in my lips over time here's a before and after so obviously the lift is before and the right is after right now [Music] so the pros of this product for me it does work over time it's really comfortable it's easy to use it doesn't hurt it feels quite safe to use like how I said you can easily just pull it off it's like you're in any discomfort I like the actual like device like it feels really comfortable to hold in your hands it's relatively small so if you wanted to travel with it it's not too much of an issue it only takes two batteries which isn't too bad would be cool if it was rechargeable but also I'm quite lazy with recharging things so it doesn't really matter really the negatives it does take a while I feel like the results aren't as Extreme as what I saw on their advertising but different lips different people obviously individual results probably do vary some people might have more extreme results than I did I was kind of hoping for something quite dramatic I guess like that to me wasn't that dramatic I feel like the other ones I used in the last video once again I'll link it down below I do feel like they worked more extreme but I can definitely see how they're more dangerous they are way easier to like screw up you can easily bruise yourself or pop your blood vessels with those ones versus this one felt a lot safer overall would I recommend this I guess it just depends what look you're going for it is quite expensive but obviously it's a tool you'll have for ages you just need to realize that you have to repurchase these I guess each time you use them these are what helps the suction comes through evenly apparently so they literally just like pop out like this and you just pop it back in so it was an interesting product to try I'm on the fence about it I'm gonna keep trying it and I'll keep you updated but yeah that's my review let me know what you thought of the results down below like would you be happy with that were you expecting more other results too extreme I don't think that's gonna be the case for anyone but who knows just let me know your opinion down below even know if you've tried this if you've got any other tips or hints and tricks or anything like that to get it to work better I wish I had the same results as I saw on some of those girls on the air but you know I just didn't so that is my review I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll talk to you guys in my next video you 
the most important information these will be launching tomorrow at 11 a.m. New Zealand time Oh put all of the information down below and I'm gonna make a mini swatch video for my Instagram as well

swatch video on the new EXO beauty lipstick shades there are some normal matte lipsticks and then also at some new at liquid lipsticks this is actually the second time I'm filming this I filmed it previously and I forgot to use my mic and my eye makeup was just really dramatic and I felt like it was just taking away from the lip colors and I want this to be all about the lip color so I thought I just refilm it so hopefully I don't forget anything so there are five new shades of lipsticks and four new liquid lipstick shades and I am so excited about the new shades I feel like I like them even more than the previous ones and there is actually a sex color of lipstick here's a little sneak peek so you'll have to wait a little bit longer to see what this one's all about but it is a

and stuff like that you'll have seen me use this a ton this one is a cream it finish oh my god my lips are so dry fail Elise you can see how they look on super dry lips today so this one here is Ubuntu definitely looks better on exfoliated lips fail on my behalf I might just exfoliate my lips quickly before the next one so you can see this is a beautiful kind of pinky nude color and for me it's just my perfect node so it looks good with any makeup look whether it's kind of more natural I like this look here or more dramatic that one there is called a bun too once again if never seen the packaging it looks like this a nice click when you shut it up and it's going for you on the top it's got your little label down the bottom and then also it's got a little XO on the inside which is super cute like on the inside of the lid I love the packaging all of these colors or the makeup or the stuff on it so beauty is cruelty free some of these are actually a vegan as well so you can check on each like page on the website to see which ones are vegan friendly this color here is vegan friendly and sintered these is just to die for it's like a light kind of a creme brulee caramel I'm so stoked they still a little lip scrub yesterday this is so bad but I had the worst hangover of my life and my lips are so dry now I was so dehydrated next up is a new shade this is deja vu and it is a mess I personally love the Mets because they're very buttery smooth and they don't feel dry and if you go on the website you can scroll down on each product page and there will be reviews on all of the shades or all of the original shades you can kind of see what other people think of them as well so deja vu is at the perfect kind of that beige nude color I'm obsessed with this one it's definitely one of my new favorites especially out of the new range and it feels so smooth like it doesn't feel matte but it looks matte it's just incredible the formula is to die for this color again just like the last one for me I can just chuck it on with any up makeup look it's just a really really easy color to wear so I'm super happy with this one and once again it's a matte and it's called it deja vu next up is our bestseller this one here is called for locally this looks incredible on pretty much any skin tone there's been people with that super fair skin it right up to super deep skin tag us wearing this on Instagram and it just looks incredible so that's helpful locally looks on the lips and is a matte shade once again the matte ones obviously tend to last a little bit better than the cream finishes but just wear for any lipstick we're on top of the lip liner which and may be bringing out in a few weeks so keep an eye out for the head I'm so excited honestly there's so much new stuff coming to you so beauty this year so that regardless then no one's actually lasts so freedom while on your lips I will one the other Diana lasted all night through snacks through drinking it was

my day creating my own makeup line was definitely my like lifetime goal it was a huge goal for me and I'm just really happy that you guys like the products I created a brand I love but to actually see

like the products the look at the products whatever totally it's fine I don't want anyone to feel like I'm trying to like push you guys to go out and spend your money on something you don't like the whole reason I'm doing this swatch video so you guys can see how they look on and decide if it's something for you and if it's not it's totally fine your support means the world to me but your support doesn't just mean like buying my products I only want you to buy it if you are actually going to love it you know what I mean just you're watching my videos and commenting and tweeting me and whatever is like a support enough so I just want to say thank you guys so much for all of your support no matter how you give it to me but for those of you who do try out my makeup products I sincerely hope you love them as much as I do so once again this is for locally it is a matte finish next up we have it may rocky which is one of my personal favorites but it is a little bit more intimidating for a lot of people it's quite a bright pink and this one is a cream and finish so that's my rocky as you can see it's quite a bright kind of peachy pink color it's a very warm warm pink this is actually super wearable if you pair it up with a kind of a neutral brown lip liner Nathan and just tip it on top it's one of my ultimate favorite ways to wear it I do want to kind of show you quickly but first obviously this is just a alone I love it I definitely wear this one a lot in my everyday life just because I find it really brightens up my complexion and it's just really flirty and fun and perfect for daytime okay so now I've got on like this really beautiful neutral kind of brown lip liner this one is called Mari and it's coming it too except ut soon this is like my go-to color anyway so now taking my rocky just doing a really this is how I like to wear this most often see how beautiful that looks it's just so versatile and you can do this obviously with any of the colors to make them a little bit more wearable if any of them are a little bit too bright is that not just super stunning look I love it it's so pretty this color is an original shape by the way it's not new I'm just obsessed with this look so I can't wait till these lip liners come out please stop right now like pause the video comment down below and let me know if you do want me to do a lip swatch video of all of the lip liners when they come out just so you can see them on or if that's a bit over the top I should just do like hand swatches I don't know let me know what you think so anyway that's Meraki a little bit more wearable this time next up with a beautiful new shade this is a met and it's called it Kairos oh my gosh so this is almost like a deeper version of Meraki but probably a little bit more wearable for a lot of you because if the deeper kind of tone it's not so milky looking I guess like it's not so bright bright it's a little bit more bold than bright if that makes any sense at all this color has to die for personally I just think this looks incredible especially paired up with nice bronzed skin like I am today this color looks amazing on it so many different skin tones and I just love the matte finish it's kind of like a watermelon pink if that makes sense anyway it wolf I'm actually wearing it in the snapchat here that I put out the other day it's just so juicy looking look it's net but juicy does that make sense nope no if it doesn't anyway that's Kairos and I love it so much it's so pretty except it's read M&amp;C and this is a new met shade all of the new ones are actually matched read M&amp;C is the perfect kind of like muted berry pink it's quite a unique shade so I'm just gonna slap it on when creating this shade I kind of had it so locally in mind so something with a similar kind of undertone to for locally except deeper and bolder but still just as wearable and I feel like I nailed it like it's so wearable my application is starting to get a little bit shady but just ignore that this kind of reminds me of like that English Rose look like just really it's sophisticated but sweet and cute I feel like this car is really suitable for date where you just work simply like I am today or you could wear this to the office no problem like it's not too loud it's a really beautiful color and I'm gonna do an swatches on my Instagram at some stage so if you want to watch for them I'm actually waiting for these this is so lame but I bought these stencils of it seem to do swatches on because I'm sorry miss yet doing swatch it's like I'm always like how do people get such perfect swatches and I go put it and they use stencils so I bought some stencils I'll leave them in a video at some stage when I do them anyway so locally it's obviously the lighter one so for locally is a little bit more muted Rheda Mincey is a little bit more bold next up a decoy is the most beautiful muted peachy terra cotta of course I had to have the word terracotta in this video somewhere if you watch any of my love swatch videos you know I love terracotta based colors so this is my one so yeah once again it's kind of like an undertone it to record a peachy shade in credible on a brown lip liner to make it a little bit more Brown toned this is it alone it's a little bit more peachy this looks so good with bronze smokey eye it's a girl run smokey eye obviously with makeup like I'm wearing today just bronze skin like it's just so it pretty once again it just really brightens up your complexion and makes you look so wide awake energized that's what I mean when I say Brighton Bailey does that make sense I don't even know if that's like the correct word it just makes your complexion glow it is it the perfect peachy brownie terracotta ish like the perfect amount of bright and use it at the same time it's not too over-the-top should I show you what it looks like over the brown lip liner do you want to say okay so this is going to be over the alert planet could Kelly coming soon it's like a brownie more of kind of colors and I like a straight-up brown or straight-up more that's kind of in between somewhere and if we put a little bit of haddock or on on top like how pretty is that a beautiful muted like terra cotta kind of deeper bold color I don't know I just love it okay I think it's so flattering or you can put it on top of a more like orangey peachy lip liner and create a really like bright peach lip like a dot bold peach let there's so many different ways you can wear these colors obviously it's just like any lipstick paired out with different lip liners I'm just showing you some of my favorite ways to wear them usually I do wear it alone to be honest but I love this combo as well so once again this is a met and it's called howdy quad okay nice that we have an original shade this is again which one's not a favorite is the question but this one here is definitely like up there especially for like a bowl of shade it's one of my all-time favorites and it is a mess it's called Lorraine's limerence is the most beautiful orange toned like it's kind of like a deep orange orangey red like it kind of depends on your own tone of your skin tone this looks good no matter what your intertwined as though it suits everyone I haven't seen on someone that it doesn't suit yet I hate the face I do when I put my makeup on my top look I'm like this looks so stunning once again like the makeup over an hour on smokey eyes and warm smoky eyes copper smokey eyes anything like that I can't get enough of this it speaks for itself right like it's just so stunning and it just suits everybody fair skin deep skin it does not matter looks amazing next up is another matte and you shade this is Dolce Vita and it is the perfect bright true red it doesn't just have a plain plain plain red lipstick in my lipstick collection so of course I had to add one I do go for a red look here in this so if this is like my personal favorite type of red to any of my babes out there any of my red lip lovers this is gonna be your new favorite read it is so mad and it goes on like a dream it is not tight on your lips it doesn't drag it's so creamy but it's so matte and it stays put and can we just appreciate that pigment and that color in it undertone it's like the perfect true red and makes your teeth look so white as well Dolce Vita it's a new met and then we have a final shade that is out already it's one of the original shades this is called white be savvy and this is a matte also and it is a beautiful deep vampy kind of plum purplish I've got lipstick all over my friggin finger there's one definitely weird bit on top of a lip liner so I'm gonna show you both ways I'll show you alone first alone it really Peaks through those brighter undertones where it's on a lip liner you can really create like a deep vampy lip so it kind of depends how you want to wear it of course if you have like really dry lips it will pick up on that so I only recommend exfoliating while performing such a deep color like this so here we have wabi-sabi alone as you can see it as a beautiful deep perfectly plumb quite vampy color once again even vampyre if you put on top of the dark like purpley lip liner or something like that I love this color it's definitely my go-to if I want to go for something quite deep and bold and I love what this kind of makeup as well like just let the lips really stand out so yeah once again that is why beside the let me show you what it looks like on top of a lip liner quickly alright so I've got a little bit of it Lauren a lip pencil on my lips is starting to feel the lipstick swatch aftermath at the stage so that's what might be savvy on top of a lip Ian so a little bit deeper a little bit more bold it shows more of the darker purple undertones rather than the kind of Plum undertones because it does have a couple of different shades in here you like see where I've over lines my lipstick Yolo oh the lining is much cheaper than lip fillers so there we have it there's the final lipstick shade this is an original not sure if I said that and I feel like I missed the most important information these will be launching tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. New Zealand time okay all of the information down below the pricing and the yep all of the information the website it's probably all you really need to know if you're signed up to the newsletter next my beauty you'll get a email as well just to remind you when they are actually online and for sale and don't worry we've got plenty of stock and we've also freshly stocked the original shades as well so you can pick up whichever ones you want without any hassle so yeah let me know down below I love it if you a comment down below or tweet me and let me know which one is your favorite like your number one favorite okay so the elects the liquid lipsticks this is what the packaging that looks like I create a little little window just here so you can see the color the reason I didn't just do like complete see-through is the formula is quite a creamy formula and I don't want it to be too affected by sunlight and stuff like that so I'm having it quite opaque protects the actual formula and makes it last longer and go on better but I still wanted you to be able to see the color so there's a little window there four of these shades are old and four of these shades are brand new and I honestly think the four new shades are even like more my favorites in the old ones and I love the old ones I wear them today these are vegan they dry down to a kind of creamy matte finish is what I like to say so they go on very creamy a little bit shiny but they do dry down to a Dimi met so I'm not completely met but not completely creamy as well and it does to me not how much you apply but these I like to say less is more you really do not need much product cuz they're so pigmented like you will see soon I prefer to wear them on top of lip liner just because since they are a cream you can wear them alone all the planet it's totally up to you people on the website do say that they wear them alone with no lip liner and they still last all night through eating and drinking I'll apply them with no lip liner a couple of them are might show you how I wear them on top of the lip liner too just so you can get an idea I'm gonna go lightest to darkest once again so the first shade is a new one lucky number one is actually probably my favorite of all of them it is a nude because before I didn't have a nude liquid this is called it serendipity and I'll just show you the wand this is how the one looks is a nice flat locator I find it so easy to use you may just want to wipe off a little bit of the excess product if you don't want to go in with too much at once there just saw a buttery smooth and once again they have that same kind of caramel creme brulee scent it's delicious my mum was worried about it at first because she is the kind of person that cannot wear a lipstick if it's got too much of a strong scent she's really sensitive she smelled these and she was like is there gonna be too much but she put them on and she was like no like they're totally fine okay so that's how this color looks alone I really love to wear this on top of the like movie pink a lip liner as well and put it in the center to create like an ombre like really full look look look look look yeah look look these are not sticky okay they have no it stick to them whatsoever but they still do last on at your lips they are very hydrating they're not drying in the slightest they don't feel like a lipgloss or anything like that and they don't have that super glossy look they do drag down like I've said it's like a very cool tone at pinky nude and I just find it so flattering this looks good with warm I like what I've got today and it also suits cool tones as well so once again that shade there is called it serendipity and if you want to see how it looks next to a bun too and for locally I'm gonna swatch it I'm really bad at doing swatches this is a bun too and then this is for locally so sorry I'm so bad at doing swatches backwards I can't see what I'm doing so for locally is a little bit more more than pink and then open tears obviously lighter and a little bit more nudged so serendipity is kind of like the best of both worlds it's a nice muted a pinky node it's just the perfect like creamy liquid I love it if you don't like super matte liquid lipsticks it's a good one for you just so you can see I just decided to check on Mari look light I once again and then I'm going to go in with a little bit of serendipity wearing out on top of the lip line I like this with just a little bit of product makes it very met as well so stunning like I love it I'm sorry I say I love it about every color but of course serendipity on top of Mari coming soon if you haven't commented down below letting me know if I should do a lip pencil lip swatch video please do it now okay nice up we have carpe diem this is like my friend's favorite one of my friends Lauren she saw this and she was just like okay like a little flaky skin just there ignore him so this is another light color but it's so muted and as you can see it's kind of like a lilac color I don't know if you think my lips watch videos every now and then I put on a lilac and I'm just like this is so cool but I'm still too nervous to wear most of them out of the house because it's just something quite new for me so I created this color which has those lilac kind of undertones but it's quite like Grey's at the same time it's like a gray lilac it has a hint of pink in it which just really makes it easier for me to pull off in my opinion it makes it a little bit more wearable yeah kind of almost like a more the lilac color it's really cool and I would wear this any time I would normally wear a nude so with any look Road wear a nude lipstick this looks perfect and it looks good with warm eyes like I'm wearing today and even cool tones as well it's just so flattering I think this is such a fun color and I definitely think this is gonna be like one of the new bit sellers it's just super cool like so cool I wanna swatch it needs to serendipity so obviously this is cut medium so you can see that cafe diem is definitely more purple and darker and more muted probably as well next up I'm going to do the shade Elysian in this one a lot of people are really really scared off which is totally understandable for me it's kind of like a sh inin like shinik so pink color but for a lot of people I can tell like you know quite out there so you know it kind of depends on the individual but I will show you another way to wear it because just like my rocky like I showed you earlier in the video this one can it be made to look so muted and pretty so I'll show you in a second first of all it's just slap it on see what I mean you see personally I find this so bloomin fun it's like the perfect summer party color like pesto Barbie pink but I am well aware that this is not everyone's cup of tea so once again it this is a lesion just by itself I'll show you quickly how I like to wear it when I don't feel like wearing something super bold because sometimes I don't sometimes I want to just be a bit more understated and low-key my portlets is so dry at this point but luckily obviously these are really good for people with dry lips because they are so hydrating so I drew have on a little bit of Mikayla lip pencil by the way I'm not showing you all of the lip liner shades today there are so many more anyway we're taking a little bit of a lesion on top like literally just a little look how beautiful that is it's like at the perfect baby pink so if you do like a bit of pink in your life you can wear this a few different ways and of course once again depending on the lip liner it's gonna look super different sorry this video is gonna be so long you asleep yet so yeah that is a lesion a little bit more horrible this time next up is laotong and I kind of think of this as kind of like the more peachy orange version of a lesion so once again it can be quite out there is that she looks incredible if you have a medium skin tone or if you just have super like a lot of bronzer on kind of like I do today or even more stands out like a mofo okay once again you can really turn this one down and make it a lot more wearable but I'll show you how it looks alone it's neon okay I love the shade I don't actually wear this enough so there we have a lout on the perfect like coral orange peachy color I can once again see if this is a little bit too bright here it is very bold like if this is like a potty lip like I seriously adore it's one of my favorite like really bright neon types of colors so here is joseline lip pencil this color is named after my Nana who just passed away recently from cancer so I'm gonna show you how it looks I just think it's so stunning it's so pretty I will his lip color to my Nana one time and she loved it she always used to compliment my makeup so I love this lip combo and I just think it's so beautiful it's a little bit more muted but it still does pop like it's still got that bright pop next up is another new shade this is named J and numb J is the perfect kind of it again like a watermelon pink so I'm gonna put it straight on and show you so staying the perfect peachy pink undertones but it's deeply a pink it's the perfect mix of bold and bright I love this one I think it's so fresh once again you could wear this office party clubbing day time any time of the year depending what other makeup you peel with it once again it's called um J next up let's do probably the brightest most out-there color of the entire collection this isn't in football this looks so good on deep skin tones like I die like but it does suit anyone whether you have super pale skin paler than me or deep skin tones it looks great it's a blue based sorry blue based neon pink can we appreciate like this is stunning it is a bold bright color it stands out and I can promise you you're gonna get so many compliments not like life is built around compliments but it's always fun when you wear you know a bright lipstick and you get compliments on it it's really good for the good old ego okay lates of wind it back a little bit and do the final new shade this is a tall hat I know how is it be a perfect like muted plum I honestly have that reaction every time I put this on like it's just so flattering and it's that perfect like very pinky berry color and it's just so stunning I just I can't get enough of this color it's so so beautiful so once again at this one here is called Aloha doesn't look too crazy it looks really classy this last shade is one of the originals and it is a perfect read like a really nice bright red what I love about this wand as well as you can get such a sharp line using it it is such a bright beautiful color I'll compare this to the lipstick quickly the new lipstick that's right so this is imperative oops and then a Dolce Vita as you can see they're quite similar Dolce Vita is a little bit more muted almost I'd say inhibits a little bit deeper and a little bit brighter so they asked them below but they're not like the same if you are a ridge junkie you'll be able to clearly see the difference is it the kind of thing Hamish would look a be like they're identical Shannon do the same and I'm like they're not thank you for that I hope you guys like the colors and if not it's totally fine once again just thank you for supporting me in other ways like thank you once again all the information will be down below love you guys so much sending my love send you guys big hugs I don't what you guys 
hey everyone so today I'm doing a first impression on this foundation which I showed in my support will recently my $1,500 to 400 hold a link it down below if you haven't seen and get the start with my voice should come right so anyway this is the Givenchy photos affectionate solid foundation with sunscreen to be honest the packaging caught my attention when I was browsing in Sephora I love you on cheer like as a brand I think they're just a really good makeup so I was really curious to try this out and I don't know much about it I'm really excited to give you go so let's look it up on before and see what it's all about so let's goes for 51 in a u.s. dollar this comes in at 12 colors by the looks of it it's SPF 20 it says it's full to medium coverage and it fits the normal combination or oily skin which is perfect mix I've got like normal and that is literally all of the seeds so I guess we'll just jump in and try it out I'm going to take a leap here and assume it's kind of like a daytime full coverage foundation because it does have sunscreen so obviously it's not really designed for nighttime the color I have here is perfect cinnamon 104 I love dilute look at the lid and then it's got a pump that I did squeeze out a tiny bit on my hand before just to check that it was going to match me - no I didn't play around with it or anything I don't know like what the formulas like or anything we're trying it out the first time together right now so first off I'm going to get my hair off my face and prime half my face so we can see if there's any difference with the application and longevity by the way my necklace is from form star it's like super statement I'm skinnies was priming here is it the master prime blur and smooth primer by Maybelline and we're going to prime half of my face like I said this is one of my favorite drugstore primers I love it let me throw some water photos I like a cocky old man to say it better know maybe I'm losing my voice I don't know okay so I'm just gonna give it a really quick shake let's just start on the unprimed side I'm just going to do like a few little mini pump the pump is really good it's so easy to control you can do like eight of a pump you don't even like you can squeeze at the tiniest amount you don't have to do a full pump like there's a lot of control which I really like so I'm just going to kind of go like that that's probably equivalent of about half a pump and more just here just out of curiosity let's got my hand into a full punch so you can see how much comes out so yeah that's probably almost a full come for my face now okay so I'm going to use a flat face brush to blend this out on the website it says use your fingers but as you guys know I'm not the biggest fingers stand this is quite a small amount of product but I still feel like it's covering quite well like my redness or my eyelids I'm definitely going to build it up because I just like to being full coverage but I just wanted to see what you could do with a tiny amount of product and this looks quite natural considering its covering it really well like it looks freaking amazing can you see this and this is no primer like it looks smoother yes look at that it's covered up quite a lot of my redness this is such an awkward angle covered up like all of my redness actually but if you compare both sides in my face got such good coverage is such a small amount oh my gosh okay I'm going to take some more of this on my hand and just kind of stipple a little because as I said I want to like build up the coverage I think that's going to be plenty my gosh really impressed already looks so good the finish as well is so nice it's like a natural kind of glowy finish and the color matches me really well a little bit of fake tan on but not much at the moment and it looks really good did you think what's left on my hand to go down my neck a little okay seriously like this looks so good sitting on my skin amazing even on my nose where my nose is usually like where my foundation go on like really annoying it just moved on instantly I like didn't even have to try I'm like actually it's this with how this looks okay so let's do the other side of my face now the prime side so I'm just going to go ahead and do a full lip pump this time so I mean I guess you could say your full coverage you might use two to three pumps on your whole face this looks sort of it baby smooth I do have quite a bit of dry skin around my nostrils at the moment I don't know life so we had to see if the foundation kind of sticks to those areas because it didn't say that it was for dry skin on the website so straight away like this finish is so nice good looks sort of glowy and healthy and it covered up almost all of my retinas I've got a tiny bit more on my tooth I'm going to build up a little bit just a couple little mini pumps okay so the way it applies on the prone side versus the unprimed isn't very similar okay so yeah we're done now I would definitely say that was about three pumps for the whole face and neck probably about normally I use a lot of ambition so now I'm going to apply a little concealer and powder and they'll come back and I will do it flash test since it does have it sp8 like I would love to say that this would be like the perfect wedding day foundation like obviously depending how it wears later on but just first impression like the way it looks on your skin is sort of radiant and full coverage but still natural like it's crazy because you're going to still see some of my freckles I did not build that over my nose I needed one layer I'm sure if you built it out that would cover more freckles but I kind of like the look of just a few wrinkles thinking through it makes my face look even more natural when it's got a lot of mega bottom so just the fact that it saw it right and like it's just so Oh makes my skin look so soft and brand-new but yeah because it's got SPF in it it probably won't be ideal for wedding days unfortunately because usually you're going to have flash photography and will wash you the heck out so and in my eyes I use mayorship keep base height in the shade of stare with my flawless finish is sponge and then on top of that I used my usual locket brightening powder to sit it and then on the rest of my face I use my cover FX G 30 proof mineral foundation and honestly I have to say that the foundation going to did itself before even used powder like it really settled onto my skin it didn't feel tacky it just went nice it was good you might be able to get away with not wearing powder but I always always always wear powder no matter what so I put it on anyways and this is how it's looking it's looking beautiful as the Lighting's kind of average at the moment but you can still see it looks super super even full coverage that doesn't look like too much do you not I mean especially once I do all of my bronzer and highlighter and stuff like that I feel like it'll look really really radiant and really nice it's hard for you to see in this lighting because it's just like to interpret but it actually does have a really nice glow to it even though I said it with powder when I turn my face you can see like my cheekbones and my nose just pops it's really nice so let's do a quicker flash test okay so as I expected there is a little element of flash paper to clean those best I thought it was going to be and let's just be the formula like it's still looked quite good and flash photography but probably wouldn't risk it and then you could buy it and test it out if you were going to wear it to your wedding or a special event you could like do like a photo shoot beforehand and see how it goes play around with it but I don't know I probably still wear this out on a night out with the risk of getting a flash photography photo taken because it still looks really good that's just me though okay so it is now 9:30 a.m. I will come back in a few hours and show you how it's looking hopefully it wears good because at the moment I am obsessed with how it looks it looks so freaking good like why have I not heard about this 100% natural complexion zero flaws they go I didn't even read that before I am pleased okay see you soon hey everyone so is it now almost 11:30 so it's only been on for a couple of hours but I just finished my makeup which they're finished like quite a while ago but anyway I wanted to show you how it was looking and I am seriously obsessed I said some like selfies little ago my skin looked so good it looks so blurred and just like flawless so I think I will say it looks like it's starting to grip on some of my dry skin on my chin and around my nose which of course is not ideal it did not say that this foundation was good for dry skin if it was oily normal combination so I'm guessing that it's no good for anyone with dry flakes now that the Lighting's good let's show you just here you can see it and like around my nose you can see a few of the dry flakes but other than that they look how freakin this smooth this looks so smooth I love it and it literally like does not show any of my pores like through here it's like paulus it's just so nice so I'm really happy so far hopefully it does hold out throughout the day I'm already feeling very doubtful about the dry skin situation but we will look past that I don't voice hair but dry flaky skin so even if it does grab on today I know I'll still get a lot of use out of this if it lasts well however or really I'm going to so if you've got directing and it's probably a no-go hey guys so it is now the rear CD 7 3 3 8 p.m. so it's been on for over six hours and this is how it is looking at still looking really even and smooth so as you can see it there's like thickness Co peeking through it is actually really hot my room I've been sitting in this room for the past like hour was major Zeon only just turn up my hair con so I am really hot so be interesting to see how it looks and my next checkup when I'm probably not so hot and as you can see just here it's really caught onto that dress and it's like form fleetingly this has faded a little bit around my mouth from ra8 but other than that it does not feel greasy whatsoever and it still looks really even like it hasn't broken up on my nose Ranma 40 or anything hasn't sunk into any lines or pores or anything it's just kind of clung on to a little bit of skin but hasn't melted at all you know how usually my foundation kinda melts around my nose area this one has not it still is really good so the only thing really that bothering me is it's catching on to dry areas which we already established my reading this is kind of showing but my skin stores flawless even though you can do the redness like it's tall it's sort of smooth and just airbrushed yeah I'm interested to see how it keeps going throughout the day it's looking really nice doesn't look cakey so I'll update you again in a few more hours Harry Lance what is now called Passavant so it's almost 10 hours they think so straightaway you can probably see that it's gripping onto even more dry skin which I don't even know I had you know what I mean like it really grips the dry skin so definitely if you've got dry skin don't go near this take a look at this look it's so you completely like peeling off the dry skin I guess the good exfoliating treatment it's hard from there it is still get really good I have to say I feel like actually works better on the non prime side the prime side just looks like it's rubbed off a little bit I mean it could be from me like touching my face without thinking or something but the non-prime side looks a little bit more full coverage it's in the unprimed side you can see it still sowed it a little bit around where I've been wiping my mouth while I've been eating my 40 looks perfect and it's definitely faded a little bit here there's still a little bit of coverage it's just definitely like gone down a bit you can see a little bit of my redness just here and I feel like it's still as good apart from these drive it I feel like for the amount of time I've been wearing this it still looks pretty decent cuz it melted around my nose still so I feel like it's really at keeping your oils at bay you do have oily skin like there is absolutely no oil on my face whatsoever it's like bright it was hot today like very hot today which was weird hey guys so we're at the end of the day now it's been on for 12 hours which is a really good amount of time of course it's a long time for a-1 foundation to be honest and what do I think overall hasn't really gripped on to as a dry skin any more than last time it kind of like stopped it looks so flawless like on my forehead on my nose my pores apart from how the sides they want a little bit more just yet I don't know if you can see like just around my nose it's like I probably just watch - be honest and still go on the prime site I just feel like the unprimed side looks even better just slightly on a normal day we've definitely just touched up around my mouth where I've wiped off a little bit of the foundation but you know I don't want to do that today it hasn't faded any more down here I don't think you guys can psych yourself overall do I like this foundation I definitely do purely for the fact that the coverage is super beautiful and it just looks sort of radiant and smooth and soft I feel like if you have oily skin I definitely think you should try and get like a sample of it or try it out or something because I would love to see how it works on oily skin however if you have dry skin I would definitely stay away I will definitely continue to use this but only use it on days where Mexican is like you know super exfoliated and you don't none of the stuff happening by the way I peeled off my eyelashes in case it wasn't obvious I really like the color I feel like the color was a really good match so yeah once again I'm 104 perfect cinnamon it just looks really nice so even though it's a there's a little bit I can deal with that I feel like this is just a really nice at daytime at foundation when I want full coverage I want my skin to look really fresh and glowy and youthful you know what I mean I feel like this would be most perfect like daytime special occasion kind of foundation so thank you guys so much for watching I hope this video helped you out if you've never heard of this and definitely think you should go do some research into it look at some more reviews I just take my word for it it is quite expensive if similar skin to me was lift dryness you should definitely give it a go I think the she is so cute and the pump is really good quality by the way this is just like a glass package and then it comes with oh she doesn't 25 mil which is less than normal that's not great I feel like 30 mother's standards they wants 25 mil I still think it's really nice I would definitely get a lot of use out of it so thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoy this video don't forget to give me a thumbs up and I will talk to you soon [Music] you [Music] 
hey everyone so today I'm going to be wrapping up my cocktail series and I know so many of you guys I really see I'm so happy that you guys have really enjoyed this series don't fret I'm going to be starting another one really soon I asked you guys for suggestions and one idea I really loved that lots of you guys put forward was doing like gemstones and stuff because I have actually done an opal look in the past I'll link it down below I know that that was so many of you guys like favorite tutorial that I've ever done so I think I'll do that next I think that'll be a really fun series I'll put a link to my cocktail series playlist down below so you can see all the looks I have created thank you all for the amazing feedback I am just so happy you guys enjoyed it like I said so today I'm going to be doing a sangria look and I really wanted to play with some a new makeup I recently did an unboxing video like you guys saw so I just wanna play with it and yeah sangria is probably one of my all-time favorite cocktails it's probably the one I drink the most if it's on a menu I love it so much I love red wine sounding like a full time oaky right now show you a picture of it in case you are not familiar I'm hoping I've got new eyeshadows that I can kind of create the look with otherwise I'll just have to sneakily use a few others as well I did just receive though the Laura Lee pellet and I know there is some like deep purplish kind of shades in there and sangria is like purpley red Harrison color and spur so this would be perfect for you guys in full its well hopefully here in New Zealand when spring that is not friggin sangria that's like white wine sangria which red wine sangria is where it's a-ok when I make my sangria it looks more or less something like this so we're just gonna really focus on those deep reds and kind of oranges and deep purpley colors I guess lots of people put berries and there's like this so there's a little bit of purple inspiration there as well by the way I've got makeup out there because I just filmed my own walk thing and I haven't put that away yet I want to take photos of it anyway this is irrelevant let's get started okay so trying for the first time this Smashbox photo finish primer eyes though which is a moisturizer and a primer in one being really keen to try this out it's got hyaluronic acid in it and some other word which I have no idea what it is TBH i was picking at my face this morning by the way so you know do that don't don't do that cuz it just makes your skin worse you'd think I'd know this by now so the texture is it really ready as you can see mmm squish table feels good feels super moisturizing which you would hope oh that feels nice I feel like this would be so good for you guys in fall if you get a little bit of dry skin in fall and winter this would be a lifesaver for dehydrated skin this feels good I have dehydrated skin it almost feels like it's going a little bit thick it like it starts feeling more like a primer as you like massage it into your skin and a little bit sticky for my foundation this kind of looks like it's gonna be a little bit too pay with me but I think once we bronze it'll be okay so this is a Korean brand foundation and it kind of sounds like it should be a dupe for like if they want a double wear but who knows it's by etude house SPF 34 which is awesome for the daytime so it's good to protect your skin even in winter and autumn as well slow down the aging process as much as possible anyway this isn't it the shade will never close I can see a tool on there if anyone can require it feel free to comment down below and let us know what shade I am it looks like I've used this but I have not I promise so we're going to test it out together and the colors gonna be pretty good once I've got bronzer on I do too pumped and I should have planned this a hit I have no foundation brush okay here we go it feels quite whoa very thick usually a Korean makeup perhaps quite like radiant lightweight this feels like a sick kind of sticky foundation and it smells hot at like sunscreen which I like the smell of sunscreen but I'm just letting you know I feel like this might be better with a sponge I'm just gonna kind of buff it in with my flat top face brush they call is not bad it's blending over the primer well there's a little bit streaky I feel like yeah with a sponge you might get a bit of finish just because it's quite a thick like semi sticky slimy kind of texture with a brush it's getting stuck to those bristles so yeah it's probably one of those ones better with a sponge you can definitely use a brush like I'm getting there but a sponge would be much faster okay so there amount of product it's probably a little bit too much I could have done a little bit less but I mean that covered my whole face falling down my neck I'm not like instantly blown away by this foundation but it does look flawless it's a very full at coverage especially for like I said like a Korean brand this is like very high coverage so if you like Korean makeup and you want something with a bit more coverage I think it would definitely be worth checking out it's covered up almost all of the rudeness that I had just here there's a little bit peeking through still but pretty good chance almost completely covered up my free calls and I would say it's very hydrating as well like even though I hate a hydrating primer wrong like the foundation still feels really really really hydrating which I like and to my eyes I'm going to try I don't think I've tried this before this is the Stila equi glow I love at the packaging this is in fear light yeah I definitely have not tried this before look at this funky applicator this is so weird do I just just squeeze it so hard like you see how like much I'm squeezing this it's still not coming out well did we go ahh oh my gosh oh my gosh okay probably too much oh it's so runny which makes sense as a serum concealer so streaky okay I'm just gonna sit here and pet it again probably gonna be better with a sponge because it's so streaky okay I'm like not loving this at all it seems to like just not be covering anything and it's just so streaky like there we go it's blended now it leaves a beautiful finish it makes your under eye area glow but I don't really feel like it has concealed very much at all like if you look you can still see like the blue undertones of my eyes of course you could go in and color it first but I can't be bothered doing that every day like I'd rather just have a concealer that's got good coverage that covers it all sometimes I like to color crude but you know what I mean like I don't want to buy a product and then have to color correct every time I use it so I'm gonna chuck that one straight into my donut box because it may work better for someone that has maybe more mature under-eye skin I think if you had like wrinkles or something under there and not so much to conceal but more to brighten I think it would be good for that but for someone like me who's got like a smooth under eye area but darkness and purple and blue it's not so good okay next we have this flawless finish everyday perfection bouncy makeup which you guys thought in my unboxing video this is a natural beige or six and I have no idea if you're supposed to use this as a foundation or a powder but I'm gonna try it as a powder this is what it looks like and you can literally like squash it look at this amazing it's just so fun it's got a powdery texture but it does say here that you can use a sponge with it so I'm guessing it's like a kind of situation we could use it dry he'd use it with a wet sponge to add coverage I take my waste Bunch yeah and that adds coverage can you say that in fact I'm just gonna put a little bit of this wit it kind of reminds me of a moisture mist if you live in New Zealand and you used to say to a moisture mist it's like that I'm just going to use some of my naked skin net concealer by urban decay under my eyes because I just want some more coverage this isn't new obviously you can tell this one here is in the shade like new true this stuff's legit if you want to drip for it try out the color pop what's it called no filter conceal something like that Aylmer they color pop once I'm good it's like a perfect jus I need to do another like high-end drugstore droopier because that'll be in there look how much better that is than before like yeah that's still I'm not a fan of I'm going to attempt to use this like a sitting powder we'll see what happens just cuz I feel like it I'm just gonna use a powder brush the smells like I mean it's all weird it hits it my makeup like I don't really think it's a powder but it seems to have worked at the same time honestly like if you purchased this I think just use it as your foundation not a powder on top because it kind of just works better on its own I'm gonna try this under my eyes could be a massive mistake this is the pink haze by bicker I used I almost dropped it the bronze one I can't even watch the actual name I got worse but I used it in a first impression I hated it made my face like orange so this could be the worst decision of the day but I really just want to give it a go get it out of the way try it now and then if it's not my favorite I can just donate it and hopefully someone else can use it because obviously someone like these powders but I just did not like the last one so I'm trying it with a shimmery lip brush and I'm just gonna go in with a smaller amount of product you no that's actually a lot but yeah it's it's so pink how would you use this all of your face I just don't get it it's literally made my under eye area pink but no I have to mesh the other side I start understand what these powders are for I'm gonna put some on my nose training I don't understand it's supposed to be a stuff like blurring powder but literally like you take the smallest amount in its still bright pink I just don't get it like my eye area looks set now then I go in again with a product I have tried a million times and used my videos well restage I'm sure you guys will let me know that I'm doing it completely wrong and that's not how you use it but I just whatever I don't get it I just don't understand I love bigger products as well oh like I just don't get them I don't understand there's much better now the base is looking at pretty flawless it looks a little bit heavy where I put that Elizabeth adding products so yeah definitely not a sitting powder I don't think there's a sitting patty at all just gonna put on some of the three in one sitting spray I don't have a new setting spray as far as I know so we're just gonna I'm just gonna let that settle in and hopefully that'll sort out some of that cakiness and in the meantime let's do the brows I'm going to try out this etude house tint my brows this is just like a felt and I have tried felts in the past and hated them so this is probably just like sitting myself up for disaster but we'll give it a go and see what happens by the way I love the way this smells but it always leaves it big chunks on my face can you say that like big huge dollops of liquid my skin's evenly looks really flawless and like glowy though yeah by the way this is in the shade gray at Brown oh one oh that is really gray look at that oh okay it's going in the donating pile so I end up trying this in a fifth impression I can't remember if you've used this one off but let's give this a go because I don't remember using it this is by 20 Turkish Sangha Gong Gong men black brown brow makeup I love the packaging sooo cute okay so it comes with this weird applicator it's got a bit to draw your brows on with and then it's bully it's really hard to get a precise line it's quite clumpy looking I feel like it it'd be good for a brown mascara but maybe not like drawing or browse and but we'll keep giving it a go see if it gets better the stuff is super volumizing plumping up my ears from zero to a hundred this is so dark for me but oh well you know what I don't mind the formula it's a little bit hot tears but the formula itself is like really thickening I'm just gonna here's the brush side now oh this is kind of awkward - OH so thickening but like it's so hot - yours and the brush is way too big I prefer my gimme brow brush the formulas good though believe it or not okay that's a mess though if it came in an easier to use like true applicator I would definitely use this but now I have to do the other brush and then we'll clean these up with some concealer I guess who okay oh look at that jeez these are some dark brows so hay goes with the fall theme we'll just pretend like I did they don't bear this by the way I just got given this shade I got it from Mika it was in like a goodie bag so it was just kind of like the shade they gave me because otherwise obviously I probably would have chosen a shade or two lighter than this one and then around my eyebrows I need something that is not new this is number one of the airbrush concealer by benefit I really like this if I need something that's like you know full coverage and I just need to kind of tie up these brows so that's what we're going for now that I've sharpened up my brows they look a lot better but still if you look through here it's quite patch ear so I probably will not continue using that product either there's been a few favors in this video really fun okay it's time to open up my Laura Lee package let's look at the palette not excited to give it a go always good to support other youtubers having my own makeup line I understand how much work goes into creating a product it's no joke it is a lot of work okay plenty of good things about it already so I'm going to cut off myself and give you guys my honest opinion okay so inside but there's pretty pink tissue paper okay the jam is drops Friday October 13 now we've got this little box here oh so pretty look at it I love the packaging it's so cute kind of reminds me of like the color pop packaging that I love what would say I just love like the floral kind of theme so appreciate okay first look at the palette beautiful glittery packaging oh my gosh sorry pretty absolutely stunning so I'm gonna obviously go for some of those bottom colors today maybe I'm kooky and in one ear and my try okie dokie maybe a transition shade or something we'll see I have it the Layla palette by Natasha Gennaro which I just got as well so we've got a couple new palettes to use here in this first impression video I'm first just gonna go in with some lip primer this one here is the Chi Chi insta prime okay now I am going to take okie-dokie from the Laura Lee Los Angeles cat's pajamas pellet I'm just using a round eye brush and just petting that all over to kind of prep my eyelid okay now I'm going in to the Lila pellet Lila I don't know how to pronounce it tbh I'm going to take this shade just here as a transition shade and I'm gonna use that same brush pigmented a if that was only like the slightest touch in the powder and that blends so easy so I'm just gonna add that to both eyes and just build it up a few times just till I get my desired intensity okay so far so good just chucked that on there not being too careful tbh next up I'm just gonna take this top color mm-hmm-hmm yeah yeah this one Luther matte blender brush bring a bit of it there warm color in there because obviously we're going more read thin at purple I really like these eyeshadows they're so easy to work with I'm gonna go in with cooky from the Laura Lee pellet I'm just gonna add a little bit of that into my crease as well cuz why not it's a beautiful color just for reference this is a little bit darker than the last color we put in the crease so I'm just kind of building it up morally eyeshadows seem to be very easy to blame also I'm going to try to cut my crease with this this is the premium eye glow by a mean okay I am okay a mock jairs whines as a Korean brand once again boys must try this his color is beautiful it's like a muted British purplish read just gonna do one eye and just see where I'm going with this I have no idea what I'm doing taking a short shadow brush I am going to I'm going with this shade here it's kind of like an orangey bronze but then it looks great in sunlight and I guess there is orange in sangria often like the fruit so it kind of peeks through is this orangey root color as well so we're just gonna roll with it and see what happens is that's the whole point of the series that's just forcing me to kind of experiment I'm going to switch to a it tapered I brush to apply this color those bitter I'm gonna go back into kooky from the Laura Lee piss pajamas and just go around the edge of that just kind of actually blending that in a bit and then on the outer half of my I'm gonna try out this Illamasqua eyeshadow this is in the shade Damon and this is just a red it looks at pigmented a if holy crap I'm just putting that on the out of a these colors look so pretty together just using my blender brush with what it was on it underneath I really like how the colors have kind of merged together to create this really like sultry smoky kind of effect like when I turn my head the colors kind of change a little bit I really like that I'm just going to use the show again from this palette and then I'm gonna go over top that with cray-cray which is a really oranjee kind of neutral my voice just waited really badly uh-huh and I'm just gonna pop that right on top just to bring it a little bit of orange does curse so nice oh I love that one focusing it really hot out I'm gonna take this brush which is a little bit of read on it but it's gonna go straight into redonkulous this bronze I know some people hate red eyeshadow because it can make your life good like it I envisioned yay but um I think you can definitely pull it off you just need to balance it out with a whole lot of bronzer to kind of bring color back into a face and eyeliner and everything to break it up a little bit just gonna run a little bit of this eyeliner called fireball by Urban Decay just underneath the front of my lash line I don't even know what I'm doing at this point I'm just playing with stuff it kind of just blends in you can't see it very much but we're just gonna do it now continue cuz I've started it anyway I should be careful at least post she would do some glitter well should I not I'm going out tonight so don't look too crazy although I am going to the circus so it'll kind of be fitting so pretty like this though I don't want to ruin it I might just do a tiny bit on the inner corner even maybe some like orangey kind of glitter to go with the orange slices I really like how that eye liner kind of made it look like I have it glossy lids I really like that look okay so I couldn't find the perfect kind of like orange or anything so I'm just going to mix together a couple of it glitters we have it carrot head and we have Liberace size 4 and 3 so quite chunky glitters by lit and I'm going to try out the Too Faced glitter glue for the first time I'm just gonna put a little bit kind of where I put that liner on the bottom lashes just a little bit like that I don't know if this is ruined it or not me don't know how I feel about that glitter primer I think it's more for literacy' those but still now I'm gonna take this eyeliner and overboard by color pop like a brown a little bit under my lash line at the article just to kind of elongate I'm using my finger to blend it out okay new mascara I'm gonna try this clinic one which is really interesting it looks like you twist the brush maybe I don't get it it's like three different sitting see wet booms I don't get it I think it just takes product off the wand if you put it on the tight one you put on the loose one that put some more product on the watch I start the middle one lash power flooded a full mascara this is in black of course you know why quite like the way my eyebrows look right now but it was way too much if it I liked this wand for the mascara it's nice and skinny so I can really get into the root of my lashes it's not giving me like exceptional results it's not bad by any means it's just I like it on my bottom lashes it's really good for separating so if my memory serves me correctly these ones are called that the illusion lashes coming soon I don't have my box is it so I keep just showing you them out of the box they're being made at the moment so I don't know hopefully within the next couple months they'll be the same okay we're just gonna let them chill for a bit so they can stick down properly I love this eye makeup I think it's so glam Lucy to read can't be wearable well it's me I mean I think this is kind of wearable these are still drying so they're kind of slipping around this is the one thing I hate about like glue that isn't latex free it's just so slippery there his neck okay so from wrong side when you try and you win of course that's what we're doing today so this is in it the shade medium this is the sunlit skin bronzer I think it's got tiny shimmers in it by the looks of it maybe I love this brush foot whoa huh for bronzer a lot came on my brushes then but luckily it seems to be pretty easy to blend okay we're good this brush makes your bronze will look really airbrushed and you can see it blends it really well that's a nice bronzer quite like the color it's quite warm I actually really really like that color so nice so to balance out that red eyeshadow I'm putting on quite a lot of bronzer it does have a subtle glow to it I don't know if I have a new contour shade so I'm just gonna use my normal contouring palette almost full face first impression I'm using this Tarte random brush that bronzer is like super yellowy I think that's why it looks so nice you can say it kind of JLo like glowing up wrong effect okay this is scary I'm going to use bang I think I've used this before but it's just gonna be perfect for the kind of read effect so this is baby miss Kay bang literally taking one tap and then just doing one more tap you can just see that little peekaboo of that color then I'm going to try this highlighter that I got in Vegas this is the sûreté artistic blush made in Japan but it's definitely more like a highlighter and I just feel like this will look really pretty with that color we've got in the glitter I've already got a bit of a glow from that bronzer but this is just an amplified that cheekbone that's quite subtle which I like can we just admire these lashes so pretty for the lips like I feel like I should be doing rate but at the same time I just feel like nude would look so pretty and because with my last cocktail look I did my Pina Colada when I did that Riddick cherry pink shade which was really bright so I want to just make different I don't know I just want to try like a lip tint lip stain kind of thing just to say what it looks like and then if it's bad we can put something else on top so this is sheer delight by Pony effect I love these let you guys know I do like the way this looks but I think I'll just do a bit of some kind of nude or like I must need like a pale beige color or something okay this is near I'm going to try the shade I wish of the new ala glass lipsticks well they called ultra slim high-intensity refillable lipstick this is like the refill but I can't be blue they're putting in the packaging it's kind of makes them with that look Tim which looks quite pretty this lipstick feels really nice it's just so awkward to use it's so so tiny definitely is ultra slim for me just I feel like it takes forever to put it on that color looks so pretty I like it okay and that is our completed think really is some of the colors I hope you guys enjoyed it see I could have probably been a little bit more like deep purple in there but that's fine I still think it reflects sangria pretty well and I just really genuinely loved the way this makeup turned out I think it's so glam and just I don't know sultry really pretty perfect for fall if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up thumbs up if you're excited for the next series let me know which gemstone I should start with down below once again a link below my cocktail series at playlist and my opal look if you want to go check out the opal look if you haven't seen it before thank you guys so much for tuning in to the cocktail series I had so much fun creating all of the looks and it really helps me it kind of get out of my comfort zone a little bit and experiment with more color so yeah I thought it was really fun

hey everyone I'm doing a fist impression on it the foundation here it'll be up soon I guess is the illusion while the photo focus bomb notion that's why we're too got my face down I did my brows just to save a little bit of time and today I'm going to be doing a New Year's inspired tutorial I'm so excited I already know I want to do something a really smoky on the eyes I'm kind of eyeing it this up I still I know I've used these quite a lot in my recent territorial but this color here is just like tada motion at midnight I've used to like three or four of these at my channel at this point in past tutorials I love them it's so much so you know if I sound a zhilie it's because I called a heat cold light last week and it's now Wednesday and I'm feeling a lot better but I kind of sound Wis that I feel you know sorry I'm just going to start by priming my eyelids I'm using these smash fellated primal and then today I'm going to use sona cosmetics this is the identity pellet the packaging is so cute I don't know if you guys watch simply so now I'll like read your blog or anything um she's a friend of mine here on YouTube and she actually creates this a while ago I received it I was so excited of tutorial and then I misplaced it when I was doing my decluttering I finally found it so this is so overdue but these are the color is sorry I should probably not put them upside down they're absolutely beautiful that but everything you need for like a nice neutral look and you can really amp it up with some of the shipments and everything I just think it's such a pretty appellate I love the names as well so I'm just going to start with the shade humble and just kind of it pop that all over just just get that primer down cuz there's a Ted darker than my skin tone but that's fine because we're obviously gonna be doing a dark eye shadow today and then I'm going to take this shade it sassy on this concealer brush oh my God look at that it's so easy to blend this is so pretty this ashram right holy crap okay now I'm taking a fluffy blending brush I'm going to go into the lightest Metro which is a chiming this lineage serviette I'm just going to softly or bling this all through the crew if this is so easy to blend and then I'm gonna take a maverick which is a deeper like cool kind of brown and I'm gonna go and the deeper part of the crease being a little bit more careful and then I'm also gonna take that just on a pencil brush and put that just on that outer corner there just using my fluffy blending brush again to kind of softly blend that out such a beautiful color I know it's just brown but I'm such a neutrals like such an you chose go I don't know I look at Brad I shot my oh my god it's I appreciate it it's like brown anyone else conscious they may just use making super action of a top just to deepen it a little bit again no I'm taking an eyeshadow brush and I'm going to go into this color yeah which is called a fearless right there I really wanted to test out more of those shimmies cuz holy crap like so pretty because I'm using this Stila color we've just saved that for another day I'm definitely going to be going back to this pellet again that's for sure this color is so pigmented so be careful with it Wow I'm just gonna put this on as a base for this Stila color this is literally like one tip at a time I've gone in it a few times because I'm too scared to get your motion how about doing my brush but I just covered the outer corner I'm such an idiot this is a crease blending brush which had some brown on it from a different day that's fine it's like you guys don't do that too easy those blamed I'm not too worried if it's not perfectly blended on the actual eyelid because obviously we're covering it but I want to make sure that the crease is nice and blended good job you know what I kind of compare these to something like busy at the texture of them just in my experience like they're just so pigmented but like so blendable I'm just trying to get that blending on that crease quite spot-on before I do the stealing's I don't want to have to go back in and and re blend because this daily color might move a bit boy struggle with this part of my edges here because it's so different from the other side of my face okay I think this is okay so I'm gonna go directly and with my Stella Moulton midnight glittering glowing liquid I should her I'm so excited for this I hope it's not a disaster okay let's try it Wow I'm kind of cutting into my crease a little bit as you can see I'm just gonna leave it like that and then take my concealer brush again and just kind of pull out the edge to kind of blend it a little look at that oh my god it's so stunning that was like one it dip as well like one dip oh my god or it's like I didn't even ate that base color like then so pigmented holy moly going it back in with my persona palette I am going to take Network again because I want this to be so smoky and I'm going back in with sassy which is that nice shimmery color we put on our brow bone and I'm just popping a little tiny bit of that on that inner corner and they're not going to pop a tiny tiny bit over this color right under the center of my eye like that honestly I wanted to put these in my 2017 favorites I just felt like it was a little bit premature considering I'm going to use them fully the past two weeks but I love them just blending that out a little and then just to brighten up my eyes a little bit you could totally do black if you like I'm just going to do a nerd this one is the Gigi Hadid Jaala eyeliner it's the nude one I know it's cool it's what I want to do a liquid eyeliner I'm not sure maybe not I was gonna use the Gigi Hadid one but I actually think I quite like how it looks just as is all nicely you guys it's so glittery I love it this I makeup look it's almost a little bit like 80s like long guys though like just like that really round eye shape like how I did under here it kind of made my eyes look super circular a diesel Stephanie's I'm getting lost gonna use the Maybelline lash sensational mascara which was with my favorites of all time this is just the Gigi Hadid packaging feel like I am going to a disco and I'm here for it if you do not own this of course you can use any I save glitter just put it on top of a dark base you could use like a golden glitter and then do the dark base and you get a very similar to it but if you love this look I like highly highly recommend this the only issue is obviously if you buy this color it's not very versatile that you can a dark smoky eye look with it they do have lighter shades too if you like a lighter kind of look oh god why and with this look I'm just gonna do some like some kind of false lashes like obviously you can just skip the falsies if you don't like wearing them but I just love wearing them even though I love my natural lashes because of rabbi delish I just I just feel incomplete without them you know I've been religiously using my rib eye lash lately and my the lecture isn't getting and saying I should not be wearing this white t-shirt though I like need to put on something glam cuz I ain't wearing a white t-shirt to New Year's I can tell you that much my nose is so stuffy right now they're fused to blow it because I don't know miss them at foundation which I'm really loving right now to be honest it's super cheap keep an eye out for the first impression we'll see if it actually lasts well throughout the rest of the day actually I might use the wild one lashes today which look like this they look scary if but they're actually it's solar energy on you can make some look really dramatic or they just look fluffy crazy pants what kind of makeup you pair them up with oh my god like wit Oh what am i doing look how cute I am obsessed with these lashes just gonna use a little bit from the shapeshifter pellet yes shapeshifter by Urban Decay they're orange eCollege on the bottom I'm just gonna apply a little sinew expert beauty brush coming soon then contouring with the contour color the more full turn then for blush I'm gonna use my current favorite the Vizia rose Carl pellet which color might just mix the two lighter colors together let's see what happens same thing with this I sure anything would work really this is a dense fiber brush yeah that's pretty and then to highlight I'm going to take Aurora bike so it beauti looks like this another face to find a brush just because it's super glowy cuz I've got so much of the literal and I don't want anything with glitter for a highlighter cuz it'll be too much at least you like that look of course go for it the you do your goes so well with that highlighting I mean highlighting hello the brow bone ecology I'm gonna try this because I'm an actually won this year as far as I can remember this is the k'kaw Kylie cosmetics and it's in the shade Kim it's a cream liquid lipstick you feel like actually put on a couple layers of it to make it super opaque so maybe I should have used a lip line of it oh wow okay so that is the completed look love it I feel like I would have liked a little bit more pink on the lips this is quite peachy but it still works so well and I actually you know I do love it but I feel like if I do this look for years I might do more of a like baby pink or something just for annoy a little bit more color I guess this is stunning I love this slightly creamy finish it's just that yeah it to use like a million layers of it and be really careful as applying it do you only think I need to use a lip liner next time but if you guys enjoyed this makeup look please give it a big thumbs up and the thumbnail I'll put on something a little bit more blingy so you can see how it looks with like you know something a little bit cooler in a white t-shirt but hey I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I think I already said I don't know I would love it if you would leave a comment let me know what kind of look you're thinking of doing for New Year's or even like are you even doing anything for New Year's cuz I feel like we're not really doing much with my fringe group I think we're just gonna like chill but I still want to do cool makeup but you know we're not doing anything super dramatic I'm not going to any parties or anything like that what are you guys

[Music] [Applause] [Music] 
hello everyone today I am doing it too to get rid of me and I thought I would do a first impression like full face first impression so I'm going to jump right it get started I'm drinking my cold coffee I'm obsessed with these lately I need to show you guys how I make them on my vlog channel I'm just a dumb experiment blogging up such an idiot so but I also I tried a new fake tan and so please excuse my fingers and have hair centers then that I need to tone because they are just not the right color like they look okay I think but I definitely look you can see my head more pink because I turn my hair with purple shampoo and pink shampoo to make it the color that it is like obviously when you look at my hair it doesn't look pink or anything but it's a very creamy kind of cool blonde whereas this is just like beige so yeah I need to turn them but I felt like wearing them say these are Bellamy ones I've got so many different brands now Who am interference miss them they're pretty much the same really hey guys guys I can't find a promising to be here so the one there I feel like I can't remember much about this one here the hourglass ambient light primer I definitely use this before I can't remember a thing about it it must have only been like once I've used it in the shade at luminous light Symphony's the stress kinda cheating because yes don't have a promo have and use the full on it's actually kind of like not soaking and very good come on it doesn't feel very like moisturizing but it makes my skin look really pretty like it really makes my skin glow which you would hope so that's kind of what it's for it's a light correcting at primer it definitely like help to even out my skin a little bit I've got this makeup fixing mist by Pixies I haven't tried it's got rose water and green tea so I'm going to spritz a little bit of this on my face and hope that it helps to kind of hydrate I have already moisturized today but my skin is quite dry I think it might be because of the st. Anne on my face or something [Music] probably put on way too much smells like roses I hate the smell of roses but I love the benefits of rose water it like reacts really nicely with my skin but I have these these are the Smashbox dude your skin shaping a foundation I got heaps of shades they let see all of them so let's try one okay I have the shade 2.1 in soft contour here so this is the foundation color I think it's like the closest I'm going to get which is quite sad because the others looks super Bank I don't know in there I just I'm not looking properly if there's like the next one I can find up is 2.3 I mean it matches my really badly shaped hand hand but not so much my chest this is so bad I'm just going to go and with two point one and see how it looks and then I can always darken up my foundation if I need to so I would not have seen anything about this product I'm probably going to use it completely wrong but I'm just going to use it like I would if I just saw this product glide in my makeup drawer oh so smooth and then a little bit of the contour shade shade side-side-side as my spunk kid nice and easy to blend I don't know if you can tell by watching I'm just going to pressing it look stippling it and pressing it into my skin with my sponge the contour color is actually really nice once it's blended out - okay I definitely need more product though because it's not really a full coverage I'm just going to do more of the foundation and then I'm going to use some other bronzers and stuff later that foundation goes on really smooth it reminds me a lot of the Makeup Forever HD stick foundations like the texture almost feels the same to me I feel like the actual foundations a little bit easier to blend in the contour shade I've got these other stick products I really want to try as well so using within a second yeah this blends out so nice it looks really nice on the skin it covers really good okay can still have it a couple new ones by Maclean's these are the master chemotactic Charybdis or there's a couple of different shades right here let's try one I'm going to use this one here which is light green in it too so you've got highlight shade conceal and correct shade so I'm going to conceal this and going to go straighten up with my sponge and I think I'm going to mix these two shades together look super brightening that looks good so it's a light kind of bum texture it's easy to blend the coverage is decent definitely more like brightening than anything like it still covers but not amazingly so I think if you just need a lot of brightening and less kind of color correction less coverage you'll like this I'm just going to kind of highlight a little bit with the shade see what I mean you can still like see the darkness it just brightens it doesn't really cover it still it's decent though find what you need in the concealer okay now I've always wanted to try these by putting if I keep mini to try them i swatch them on my hand and use them on my face so it is a few different shades we have confidence it's like a contour shade I think a couple of them are in my travel makeup bag so it's going to use them I forgot this one is called touch me super pretty this one is called it dream like I'm going to try this one it's like a highlighter and then the last one I have right here called fortune it's another like contouring shade so I'm going to go in with dreamlike I'm actually going to go straight into the tube with my sponge and then apply it a root ooh quite a nice light pink highlighter you see super easy to apply and blend the foundation actually ended up looking really dark like it's at box it eyes maybe look at that it started off being quite light and now it's like pretty dark how me go we'll just carry along whose wing it oh and then my eyes I'm going to try out this Nick and Max banana bag filter powder this is me and makes mint makeup line mica beauty dr. Lindsay vk.com to a you so I'm going to use this on it whoosh immature lip brush holy crap my foundation like I loved it the way they found they should blend it out but wow that is getting very dark very quick it's getting darker and darker years ago so it's just me know it as a mask a anyway using the banana powder under my eyes to set the concealer and help to color correct a little more quite a nice color I feel like it could be a little bit paler for my skintone holy crap my foundation looks subject okay now how can I fix this foundation because this is not legit I swear it was not this color when I first applied it not that has oxidized so much so there you go if you do try out this product perhaps go a little bit lighter swatch them on your hand at the shop maybe and just like walk around and see how they react with your skin because yeah I think next time I use this I'm going to use a slightly lighter color and just let it kind of just as I said I know nothing about those I don't know if there's like a feature or what but I'm going to chain going to blend a little bit of the tastic foundation I didn't have that first impression on this up on my channel so I'll link it down below for you to go watch if you haven't seen it yet I'm scoring mixed together a lightening neutral and fair light neutral this one is super light this is the medium one and they're just going to go back in with the same sponge and just ah that's so much better already with that so kind of went over the contour immune but Allah just recontour through literally and plumper like why why did I try a new fake tan especially when today I'm filming my wife of petite fashion launch video if you haven't seen it like a doubler like why would I use a new Saint Anne on the day I'm doing a freaking release video would I have to look good why do I have to look good you know what I want to look good the yellow powder now that it has settled in to my under eyes definitely looks nice it kind of like just kind of rested and like soaked in a little bit doesn't look as powdery however the Maybelline concealer has it creased a little bit if you can see that so that's nerves like it I don't know how I feel about that product super nice for brightening but I mean it doesn't really cover very well and it creases I'm kind of not surprised because the teacher was saw a light and barmy it felt like it would be quite thin and little you know sometimes a little bit of a thicker formula can be good when it doesn't soak in so much and like crease up and now I'm going to try out sitting Powder by top business the filtered light sitting powder good people now look try to open it my foundation just today is not my day terrible the smells like custard powder if you live in New Zealand laddering or if other country type custard powder probably but you know like at the Edmonds custard powder or whatever brand it is you know the one in the box that you like Graham Elwood makes you so the custard powder I love it so and wonder if this is quite brightening it is called filtered light so kind of sounds like it would be a quite a suited brightening blurring product I'm going to use it with a big powder brush I'm just going to stamp it all over blend it in afterwards look at this like Lima to put this is the risk when you do a first impression makeup look ah that is so ugly is that the yellow powder is that the Maybelline can still or both how to stop me it with a good mix I can't hit the powder out that's it that's like it the powder is really nice though it's very blurring I need to blend them more because you can see I've kind of got like a white beard happening honestly at this point of time I just feel like washing off my makeup in starting again like look at this under I can can fix this like I don't know why me why me this pub is really nice it's just it's so take a look with a bit the heck or I am cheating and taking C to neck powder I'm going to pack this on my cheeks to kind of blend that cakiness down by the way sorry I'm blue everything is blue okay I'll fix it I tried to fix it by men I still look quite blue but whatever honestly everything I've done so far on my face is just been a waste of time like it looks so bad in taking disgusting it's fine let's just move along see if we can pull this together I'm just going to put some other setting spray on this is an emotional time tattoo brow gel too I chose this right now because you have to leave it on for ages but Lok this is by Maybelline villas brown tissues so let me know if you want me to do a first impression on it alert here comes the Sun and now I'm going bright yellow cool we have these like brow artist concealers to tidy up your eyebrows this honestly I do not even want to try like it scares the out of me this is by Maybelline also know this is by L'Oreal Dubrow artists marker it's got a little bit a big brush which is adorable but look at the pizza like help out how how do you do that I know we've had enough disasters today so I'm going to use a winged liner brush today with this tart hope in Mazzoni and clay waterproof Brown mousse this is the only other kind of new product I have this is the color hopefully it's okay and then I'm going to use that Maybelline concealer thing to try and tidy up my brows quite a dry formula like I thought it'd be more creamy but it's like very wet you can load up your brush and nothing goes on it well it does go on up you know what I mean like not a lot of product I'm not used to this kind of formula usually steps like this you're going to take a really small amount of this one you can like load it in the Sun purse off like you can't deal with this like changing first impression I do not like this as much as my benefit one this one I feel like I have to load up my brush like every stroke because it's just not drawing on properly maybe it's also because I've got so much friggin powder on my face that my eyebrows are super dry but I mean the colors really nice though definitely a little bit patchy but it could just be my dry skin it works the colors really nice do I like as much as benefit no because gives it's my favorite one so you know here we go now staying to warm up with that I guess now that I've got that top layer of product off not kind of going on a lot and mostly seriously we're going to find any products I'm obsessed with in this video please okay I like it didn't now that it's warmed up it goes on so much smoother do you go quite nice right I actually keep experimenting with it I don't hate it I really really like the color I think it's perfect there is not a lot that needs to be concealed there let's just give this a go anyway this is the illuminator perfection brow precise brow precise by Maybelline and I've got the shade medium and light and it's quite a cool product it's like a little square rectangle with sharp edges so I'm using just cannot carve out oops I just drew all of my eyebrow so very barmy very creamy it's such a cool idea look at that you need a nice sharp lines the eyebrow the very bar me at texture once again just using a round eye brush to blend pretty easy to blend looks a little bit chunky a little bit cakey I have set my foundation with powder so that'll be why I'm assuming it err to use you TARDIS after your concealers like this entire freaking video is just me like screwing up eyes with one of those days it's one of those days where everything is just going wrong persevere and persevere perseverance is key now I don't have a mirror brown mascara muse when I have I do need a new one lower this one is almost run out again I use this all frickin time sort of small surprising again I'm just going to quickly go back in at contour now so I really want to try this by Maybelline come on Maybelline pull through this is that the master contour at face contouring kit light medium and of course I'm going to use the contouring side nice a blush to that then for highlight it and use a different one now it's so hard to find a contour powder in the drugstore so if this color is good I'm going to be so happy so far it's looking decent this is by far the cake ears to make up I think I've give a warm I'm going to actually have to wash this off for a grow the gym because it feels so heavy it's just an all-round bad combination of different products today I think this is one of those times where my makeups probably going to look better on camera too than real life because honestly it looks horrendous looks so bad like it literally looks like my skin is peeling off my face okay this contour powder though I'm actually quite happy with it to drugstore like it's a nice color it's easy to blend I think that's definitely good for the Guinness it's not my perfect shade like it's not better than my top one or anything but look I'm not disappointed in it I'm going to use the same brush with the blush color cuz it's a really nice pale pink I really like it I feel like if I used this product on top of you know my normal base like a normal base I love I would really like it it's just because I've got bigger the lighting look how bad their likeness it's just because I hate the base and it just you know nothing's really blending nicely on top of it right now that blush colors so pretty for highlight is a big nutramax ones they look so pretty let's do the pink one so this one is called rosy it glows and this is what it looks like I'm just going back in with my shimmery lip brush going to mostly take that really pale color then I'm going to mix a little bit of the pink in there too so it's a really kind of iridescent pink glow it's quite shimmery but it does highlight really blindingly so if you like those blinding highlights you'll definitely like this I think it's really pretty it's not the kind of thing I've wear on an everyday basis but maybe like clubbing or something like that really like to kill us this looks so pretty - golden glow obviously just a more golden kind of highlighter look so nice so the highlight is actually really decent just shimmer you can see it just there really brightening let's do some eye makeup I just found a new gimme brow shaper II you know this isn't new but I'm going to music my favorite that's I based by Natasha - Nonna my under eyes so cakey I'm going to use a really smoky eye makeup underneath to kind of disguise it okay I really mean makeup palettes I have not used yet I was going to use a naked Heat palette by other decay today actually have used two already that's probably only a new new palette I have hair off I do also have that I love Sarah II they say I don't know everyone made fun of me in the last video I tried to mention in whose name I don't know the chickie or shakey-shakey palette so maybe I'll use a mixture of both of these so visi art or visor I don't know ever since the a theory palette and it just looks super pretty neutral and then at the colour-pop cheeky pellet looks like this so maybe I'll just do some kind of neutral smoke guy so some so take around I brush with this color here from there Vizia one I'm going to pick that kind of on the crease and upwards even my eyeshadow is going on terribly my skin's just saw like Kate would make up that oh man and then I'm going to take these second color down on the same brush and I'm just going to begin buffing that on the outer corner and then end it to the crease it looks really dramatic like this is so pigmented but this brush really busts the color it makes it super beautiful and soft so that's what we're going for I'm just going to keep bringing it these eyeshadows are freaking dream ha thank you you need to catch a small amount too by the way these action is a really expensive from memory but I mean they are legit ok now I'm going to take a tulip crease brush and the warm brown in this palette just pop that into the crease it's such a beautiful color these eyeshadows are so good - they're so easy to blend in super cheap and they take a little bit of that darkest color I'm going to put that on at the article and story about the light and finally this videos are already a disaster hooting cares at this point the reality is filming a video honestly gotta know remember my room to do artificial lights - the way I go to my makeup setup like it just doesn't work and then when I use my ring light it buzzes into my microphone it's just like a comes the whole time it's just so annoying and today was supposed to be cloudy all day which would have been perfect just filming with it was cloudy when I started and now all of a sudden this guy's clean cook you know like why would life want to cooperate with me at this point in time when everything is going wrong today why doesn't matter does it this brush is so good for blowing out colors like it just starts so nice blending brush so I put that into the crease a little - now let's go back in with the warm Brown from this palette and pop it underneath obviously a little bit darker colors going to be mixed on my brush - ah so appreciate love it covering up all of the eye wrinkles from the concealer these are beautiful now I'm going to take this Mac 283 brush and their second color down it's a Yuval foil kind of pink shade I'm going to pop that right on the center of the eyelid oh my gosh at least my eye makeup is pulling through and I'm taking at my tulip crease brush once more and just buffing out any harsh line and then we go back in with that really dark color and just go into my other Z once more this I makeup has officially pulled together this look the base is still terrible but I mean at least now the attention is drawn to my eyes and now how I look so perfect with that lip color okay let's try and do one more color from the busy art palette okay I'm going to take the paler shade with that same brush the Mac one I'm just going to pack that on my inner corner also and straight underneath a little just brighten up the apples Q see my makeup like cracking here what is going on okay I just want to do it mascara I don't care about eyeliner today I just feel like by - I want it will be terrible this one a colossal Big Shot volume Express fresh candle I'm wiggling this is the packaging it's like Crone I like it I like the Maybelline mascara is normally okay this is what the wand looks like look how where that is the actual end looks nice though it's nice tightly bristled brush is not too big I'm kind of getting back into the big brushes lately I'll do one eye so you can see how it looks compared white a dry formula which I don't mind I prefer you know when it's a little bit drier so it's easier to work with it's too wet I find it just equals clumps so there are the top lectures I need to tie up that inner corner but let's pretty good we'll do one more coat you can get a lot of volume two layers oh my gosh I keep getting everywhere sanity is not the day I'm gonna wear this falsies too because I just want to glam up the look a little bit and roar even more attention to my eyes just cheer hype the fact that my base is cakey AF so that's one code there and two coats on that I see into the difference I'm going to use the party stag lashes today does summer which is the middle one I'm just going to darken up my lower lash line a little bit just to balance out the lashes so going in with the top two colors the Browns the slash doesn't want to sit police oh don't mind him he's just doing his own thing today you know okay so now all we've got to do is finish off the lips and you darken this a little what's this this is a favorite fluid lip tint by Pony effect oh my gosh look how cute the packaging is so this one is in the shade romantic breath it's just like a lip tint not going to lie I'm loving products like this lately just because they look really like if it was I guess like you know I love liquid lipstick and stuff but sometimes they came a little bit too much you know depending what makeup you're wearing with them like I find if I am just wearing you know a liberty mascara brow product and I just want to put on some lip color a lipstick looks too much whereas a turn is really good just to like everyday sort of pretty I think for this look that I want to try on a lipstick - both there's a nude nude one this is purely nude slice 35 by Maybelline a brand new pop it's so pretty looks really good with the lip tune beautiful color and Ross this is supposed to be a creamy formula that's how it swatches on my hand I don't think it's really a creamy finish I think it's just this stain I used underneath it because it that glossy look but I love it the lighting and smiley good votes just really dark here we go okay the lighting is finally decent so you can actually like to see the finished look that is my full face of first impressions - the bra mascara the lashes and whatever else it was what a mission that was an adventure that was a roller coaster ride there was emotional stressful problems anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this video for a little juice entertainment I'm sure I've got what's going on I'm sure it was a little bit entertaining at least like watching me fail over and over again the highlighter is so pretty in the blush and the contour is actually really nice I do select the contour fade it a little bit doing so beginners and might prepare to learn to contour that's such a good you know drugstore affordable contour kit I'm going to contour a little bit more there the highlighter is beautiful it really is is just quite intense you know if the daytime wear but a lot of people like that so definitely check it out then overall a lot of the drugstore things I used today were quite good the Smashbox stick foundations definitely going to play around with because that oxidize like note I really liked the formula but holy crap that made me so orange the pressed powder was really nice I think there was just too much stuff going on there was too many creams and powders and things happening and it just looking cakey and then I had to use my Mac and then Oh anyway I liked the settings greater I'm going to use a little bit more so there we have it thank you guys so much for watching if you want another full face first impression let me know so so much stuff here umm so much

headquarters for a meeting and they gave it to me I'm so happy so I'm really such try that out too anyway question of the day what is your favorite lip color to wear overall I would probably say like a pinky nude color for me like you know stuff like this like pinky nerds is just like my go-to because they go with almost any makeup look I'm really loving like more V pieces bolder and then I also love oranges like bright orange but I don't wear bright orange as much yeah so much for watching once again don't forget to hit the thumbs up button if you did enjoy this so I know to do some more and

eyeliner quick drying crease proof dramatic precise yeah liquid eyeliner and it comes in five different shades and then the final thing we have care no it's not it's the second to final thing we've got one more line this is from Mika oh crap I love glencoe so much so we have the super mode clearing a treatment which is the or achieved when I did a review on way back in late 2013 or something we have the globe pseudo sitting spray which I own and I love it is so glowy you put it on and it gives you a low-key oily finish which I'm a fan of okay not like oily but you know it like leaves your skin glowing and really feeling hydrated and then I've talked about this in my video too but I don't think I have this shade this is sonic glow the glow starter and West Racer they smell like the best things you've ever smelt in your entire life I have not tried this one so I'm really excited this is the gravity mud firming a treatment I think it's a peel-off mask changes color from white to a beautiful chrome it peels off to leave your skin feeling tighter and more lifted so I'm totally by that and then at the last thing we have here is the glam glow Volquez MEK Volquez neck net blow moisturizer have not even heard of this one so I'll give it a going let you guys know what I think of it I've still got so much of my Clinique moisturizer live though so I'll just keep it in the box for now JK there's two more packages the second to last package is from Clarence again so we have four of these let the comfit oil that's gonna fall it's like all those recycling right here I can fit I can like hear it sliding all about lip oils so the first one here this one is how you told the difference oh it's mint it's called mint I'm guessing it's just oh that was so close to almost mimic carpet that went on the packaging I'm guessing it's just yeah it looks clear I think it looks kind of slightly green but maybe I'm just like imagining it probably oh it smells like I love the smell of mint this one literally literally literally I just made up a word um this one is glittery it's called honey glaze and it is a honey color I'm guessing it smells like honey the next one is called it tangerine and then the final one this one is candy is it pink yep and then we have a poor perfecting metafile foundation in two different shades and we have a blotting paper or perfecting metal fan kit with poor papers hot peppers blotting papers and then we have a I shudder at palette full color eyeshadow palette we have three different cream to powder or distant eyes shadows I'm just gonna like open one of them cuz that sounds really thick and then the last thing is a full color all-in-one pin for eyes and lips please tell me this is what I'm imagining it to be like one of those pins you know if the four different colors please it actually is if you guys want a first impression on this let me know I could do a whole video about it and we could try it out oh my gosh it's so cool you know how some stuff like this just scenes up in crap hopefully it's not and then the ombre or a decent cream to powder eyeshadows they come in packaging like this I'll click that I'm kissing it's just like a cream oh okay it's like one of those like new secretive creamy taste jizz ooh sorry pigmented it doesn't really feel creamy it just feels like a kind of like those George or miny eyes to kill you know like that kind of texture like spongy but not I don't know and finally something from a sauce which I've already opened cuz I was really excited I bought this myself my shoes came and I was like yeah hey new shoes and then they ended up being the wrong size and I haven't opened anything else cuz there's other stuff in here take a Brit Shannon so I reordered the shoes a size down because I got these in a size 6 and I am NOT a size 6 apparently I'm a size 5 okay so those new Eddie - they're the gray ones they are freaking cool my friend that does have it feet one size bigger than me so I might see if she likes them they are called the NMD in md-80s I have been back at the gym even though I think it's throwing my cortisol levels crazy again which if any of you guys out there have struggled with high Crizal let me know what you did because the only way I could control it was when I just stopped going to the gym I was literally eating so unhealthy and I still lost all this way it was crazy but yeah when I go to the gym I gain weight again stress anyway I love going to the gym so I am these are the adidas trick foil or however you say it all the games the black points just for casual or the gym I kind of just bought them for casual though I like to be active when I'm not actually being active you know just bumming around the house and then the gray as well I think I got these in a size 10 size us small UK tin I got this long-sleeve tee by Calvin Klein so it just is Calvin Klein down the edges so that's kind of just casual as well I know I got something for the gym here somewhere here we go Reebok so I go a size small which is like a size 10 I think hopefully because I'm a size tun this is the thing with a sauce yes is size 8 to 10 so there's me um with a sauce I swear they're sizing charts are so different to like a lot about the websites always get so confused that's why I bought the wrong size shoes cuz it was just so confusing anyway so this is what they look like hopefully they fit me oh okay because I kind of am like a true teen not like an 8 not like a 12 so hopefully hey this super stretchy so it should be fine but I liked the polka dots oh my gosh have you guys seen whitefox petite they did a sneak peak on their Instagram story of their workout range like their active range they're bringing out and it looks so good and then the final thing I got I already actually own in black but I got the great hellix they didn't have this in store in New Zealand I get a size large I think wait no this is the medium okay I think I was made to get a large I like it real biggie like it'll still fit just won't be as baggy but anyway this is the dry Fitch Nike little cropped jumper yeah I liked with us to and from the gym when it's cold

hey everyone so today I'm doing another face mask review on this math key which I featured in my Sephora recently I asked you guys if you wanted to sue for some pressure on this and a lot of you did say yes so I'm doing it today because my skin is crap I'll show you a close-up very soon it's so bumpy and just rough and dull looking so I'm hoping that this will transfer most going to be amazing but who knows because it looks really weird it's called a rubber mask and clear skin clearing wrapping rubber mask to Tyson and deep cleanse your pores so dr. jar is made in Korea it comes with in and pulip it and pule and I don't know how to pass it with and in clearing wrapping rubber masks which sounds creepy it sounds very serial killer fish I'm going to have filled out it but then again it's made in Korea I trust the Koreans with their skincare I love Korean face masks like clay masks pig masks so hopefully the rubber masks will be good as well I'm pretty sure this one's actually quite expensive though so it better be worth it well I'm going to look it up quick okay I'm on surfboards websites $12 on Sephora it's actually rated at four and a half stars out of five which is not bad this is air one time uh so paying $12 for one mask which in the skin thing is quite expensive considering you could spend twelve to twenty bucks on a clay mask and that'll last you for ages so I don't know let's just give this a go so it says after cleansing which I've just done massage is step one and portal Peck I don't know how to press it when I'm sorry onto your skin net to nourish that's let's do it so here we go step one it's got an expiry date on it which is quite reassuring intensive it clearing and pullback first let me do a close-up so we can do a little before and after okay and it going to keep the exposure quite low so you can see everything so don't know if you serve my nose I have quite a lot of like a blackheads just here look at that huge one right there and on my chin I've got a little bit of redness some breakouts kind of popping up I know my skin's not terrible but this is the worst mess and has been in a few weeks so it's a perfect time to try out this mask I always wait until my skin's playing up to do these videos so that we're really putting them to the test on my forehead of time to see but I've got this purple just here very rough you wish to take my word for it it feels really like flaky and kind of dry just very textured and very bumpy I am I'm really excited so I'm going to open up this step one we just like talk about how creepy this like pictures and it really scared me a lot okay so it's kind of like a moisturizer product here's how it looks it's going to be hard to see since it's white so I'll wipe it oh okay smells very clean and fresh it smells quite professional I know it sounds weird it kind of smells like that kind of professional skincare center that you often smell when you're doing a facial it's so weird I'm like rubbing it in but my hands are just like it doesn't get soaking in it's just kind of sitting on top of my skin and it feels really strange I don't know how else to explain it like a rub rub rub and it doesn't go anywhere it just sits there what do you anyway I'll put this all over my face it's quite thick in here look it looks like curdled cottage cheese this is very strange it was really cooling a nice surface is that there are purifying ingredients in this the purifying ingredients are gently absorbed into the skin pore cleansing at complex of plant extract green tea great persimmon cleanses the pores to visibly enhance the skin's complexion that's what we're doing right now look at this this is like kind of nasty like I feel like there's way too much in this little pad because I've used Billy any and I've gone over my entire face and it feels very sick and slimy I'm going to put extra on my areas where I've got really bad paws so on my chin especially that's where I get black kids a lot and then also on my nose hopefully I'm going to use too much it feels really whipped or my skin might not weakly not dripping wet just like damp like I've got snot all over my faces on that's really strange okay stick to clearing ripping rubber masks the exciting part rubber mask sheet prevents nourishing ingredients from evaporating and soothes dry skin so I'm getting it pretty much Traxxas until maybe this is the active ingredient and the rubber mask just kind of puts it on your face and makes it sinking cleansing ingredients are absorbed deep into the pores to clean from the inside out marine moisturizing ingredients berline and calc siliceous seaweed sea mustard through the any irritation caused by dryness this my sensitive of my skin right now like clarifying I'm just go like actually put a ton of this on since something the rubber mask on top oh no this is right on Arthur I don't know why they'd give you so much just like you weren't supposed to use it all since it's a one-time mask surely you're supposed to use it all this definitely feels like something I should be rinsing off my skin so be interesting to see if it really soaks in I kind of thought it was like a moisturizer like sisters time either using anything like this clearly okay now the mask is M it's a little box and it looks like this class can love a rough mask so it feels like it's like dripping everywhere so weird this is strange okay so this looks like a weight also kind of hard to pull out those are so weird so you have like a wrapper around the outside area this is like rub it like jelly and it's kind of slimy also so the pressure is on to make this look not creepy that's impossible whoo it feels so cooling I like it then we have the little beard part those put this on my beard now weird I feel like it's going to like slip off my face it's not like sticking yeah maybe now so now I leave this on for 30 to 40 minutes it says you can't just leave it on for 15 to 20 remove it gently massage the remaining and pull can put on ample oh why have I never like learned how to pronounce I swear before never heard it before so random this may be left on for up to 40 minutes in maximum hydration which I might try and do because as I said my skin feels like crap it's like dry flaky it's textured it's bumpy there's Eknath is blessed like I've got everything right now there's tip you can use remaining ample pack on your neck and arms as well so I have none left now so y'all look okay so I'll come back and it's 30 to 40 minutes and we will take it off and see how my skin looks after hopefully there is a visible difference now we have to tell you if there is a difference in like the feel of my skin also hey everyone so I'm back now actually I've shown for about 50 minutes so whoops it's a little bit longer than it is but surely they cannot be a bad thing so basic it's stuck pretty well a couple of times it kind of like started falling off just down here like this bit but other than that it really stuck this top line stuck so good which is the Prozac quite like slippery feeling so I thought it would just fall off my face you know I mean so I'm happy about that the only thing I would say is that make sure you actually will pair up and like a ponytail or a bun because everyone here that like flips on to it just gets like stuck it's just like super attracted to the texture so but like here's all over it's light you can pull them off so it's just kind of annoying so I'm going to zoom you in and we're going to take this off and see how my skin looks straight after this okay so two of the one one first yeah see this is like still full incision on my skin it seems to massage the extra in oh it seems to be like something in easier now that's weird you know helpful for it like wasn't it soaking in now I massaged it it just kind of hello so that's good a little bit pink from massaging my face but that obviously go away and this is how the face mask looks when you take it off so you're curious it just looks the same as when you put it on except it's got a little bit of product on it just going to massage and the extra like it says yes so much easier massage now now that I'm sitting on my skin my skin doesn't really feel softer which I'm kind of not surprised because like how is this supposed to soften your skin like when it's not play or exfoliating or you don't but it does feel very plump so not soft but plump very like I don't know fancy to love it sticky still at the stage but it should go away left so it's a little bit more I think my skin looks really radiant it looks really glowy and that's before moisturizing like it definitely feels like a really nice kind of soothing formula I don't know how like this is supposed to clear your skin but let's do a little close-up and see if there's any difference in and my black kids or my nose and like the pimples on my chin or do a little side by side because looking in the mirror right now I can't really tell the difference to be honest so you can see all of the little darling mini early you can feel a little like a blackhead but still I don't think they look any better to be honest [Music] like I feel like I need a prop explain us to get that off like a proper exfoliating or can it clay marks or something like that because those do the job perfectly for me I purposefully hopped on one in a few days so to be honest I'll probably do it claim us tonight because I'm annoyed that it can do anything in this breakout here looks more or less the exact same on my chin it looks more or less exact same the only difference is my skin looks a lot more illuminated and glowy and I think that's purely because of the and and pure and Paul what is it and Pohl Peck they like some stuff that I put on like you know it's making my skin look glowy just like if you put on any moisturizer or any serum or anything other than that my skin feels very similar just feels pop that's the only difference so there's a little bit of a bummer to be honest I really wanted it to work I do feel like my skin looks really nice but is it worth $12 for one years I wouldn't buy to getting to be honest I would rather just invest in a good clay mask because this could get expensive if you're doing one of these a week 12 bucks you know it just sounds like a moisturize I don't know I'm just going to put on some moisturizer for fun as well so this is the yet glendalough illuminating moisturizer and new blow this does give you a shine because it's got like little pigments in it I just feel like wearing this because I love the way it makes my skin look so this makes you look even more loomio on one side so you can see the difference is this dr. jart clear skin rub the mask with it my opinion not so that's how the eliminates and this is how my skin looks with nothing to be honest I would even say that a normal sheet mask is more beneficial to my skin I get more moisture and more glow out of a sheet mask definitely did nothing to help clear my skin straight away anyway I mean maybe it was over time I don't know that I'm not like reviewing it over time I'm reviewing it as a first impression and when I use a clay mask on my skin you can see the difference instantly so it's just super unsatisfying so hopefully this video helps you guys out if you were curious on this product that is my two cents obviously you can do some more research into the product because I mean so many other people loved it I won't actually pull up the reviews real quick so one pear thing ever at 5 stars this did that when they used this face mask redness from their spots was reduced and needless to say I don't think I agree because like this is story reader these are still very rude I don't feel like they really look that much different I mean obviously everything works different for different people some people say it's like okay someone here said I didn't notice much of a difference in my skin but it did feel refreshed I would agree with that and it didn't really do much for breakup so I guess it just is different person to person obviously this is just my review make sure you research next there I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you did don't forget to give it to eat them and let me know what you want me to do a review on it next I do have those eyebrows tips so if you're so interested in seeing their I can do that soon yes oh [Music] Oh 
hey everyone so today I am doing an n assist inspired look because I was hands down and one of the most requested gemstones out of this gemstone series also I have a feeling new trait in my mouth if you're wondering what all the weird mouth sounds are I hate mouth sounds those ears are the worst and also in today's video I'm going to quickly show you like a little demo on how the nipple brushes work because the nipple brushes are now out yay finally I'm so happy with them they look absolutely stunning at this light pink handle it's kind of hard to see in this lighting it's a really nice light pink handle and then a copper barrel copyrighting and then the white hairs which are actually quite easy to clean I'm going to show you right now so I'm spraying some makeup brush it cleaner cinema secrets or you can use the EXO beauty a brush cleaner for a proper cleanse this is just like a quick quick change kind of spray so it's not going to deep clean your brushes very well and then I have my towel and I'm just going to pour a little on the towel and then I swirl the brush in there the spokes will swell them treasure in real time so you guys can see do to do okay so that was one go you can see how much cleaner that is I've just got to clean the other side now and this foundation has been sitting on this brush for like three weeks which I'm kind of embarrassed to say but anyway you can see how well it cleans up and you're gonna get an even better result when you use a deep brush cleaner so I'll just go through them as I go I guess so I'm going to start with a primer I'm going to use this one today this is the easy way anti blemish matte primer so let's to like acid in it I have a lisp right now oh gosh he'd been I'll use this one that one of my subscribe to see me it's got a fluff on it I just got my hair done yesterday too so it's like super actually right now um yeah that's the end of the story I have so many blackheads on my forehead at the moment and I have no idea why I don't know if it's one of the new foundations I was doing a first impression on or like what it is because I haven't changed my skincare I don't know if it's like a changing the wither I don't usually get me blackheads up in my fourth most of my going down but I literally had like eight I have these real painful ones like up here in my hairline can you see that okay so these brushes I like especially effective at buffing so they're really good for like creams foundations kind of thing I'm gonna start with the Mike Jacobs remarkable foundation and I'm gonna mix a couple shades so that a little bit of fake tan on but billionaire moment so parallels gonna be way too pale which is ivory light and then the dark one's gonna be way too dark which is biscuit hope you can see on the brushes like if I've got these tiny little nipples that's why called the mean nipple brushes and instead of wiping foundation all of your face like I normally do this is especially good flight makeup artist and stuff basically the tip is designed so you can take your banker and why nicking it into small areas but to you can also like distribute without getting a big clump of foundation stuck in the middle of your brush what you'll know like if you take your angled brush and you just pump Foundation range there Center this is why I say fluffy everywhere if you pump your foundation right into the center there it sinks in and it goes all the way down and you can never get out again so those brush here you could pump foundation onto that nipple and it will keep it out of the bristles and you can apply it to your face and you don't waste your product and then the same of the darker color I'm gonna do a list of the darker color I can always add some more because I don't really know what color this is going to turn out to be and then when you start buffing that little tip if you put pressure on your brush to buff it just sinks straight in so it just sort of stuck inside there and the bristles are semi film so they're really good like they're soft but you see me firm so they're really good for buffing at foundations cream contours cream blushes cream highlighters cream eyeshadows anything like that and then of course that little tip is really good to get into any under eye areas around the nose just play a little bit less pressure it's just so smooth this brush is definitely won't be for everyone like you know I've never seen anything like this on the market I just wanted to try something new and my um brush factory over in Italy we're talking about it and just thought it'd be a cool concept hopefully you guys like them also on XO video we've got a new marble brushes too just if you didn't know now I'm just cleaning off the small buffer brush and I'm gonna take my no filter concealer like color pop this one just here okay and they're not once we've done that those concealer doesn't really like that foundation very much I'm going to cream contour I'm going to use the medium at buffer for this one I'll just wipe it off so if this here is the mitigating naked skin at shape shift Doug's like that and like this on the other side so I'm using this color down the bottom I'm just swirling at the little tip and then you can get like a detailed kind of line was my nose I just kind of pop it all over the top just like that and then once he games put more pressure down to blend this color is so good it literally looks like an actual I really need to coat all my forehead but we're doing it today I think this is my favorite way to use these brushes overall it's just contouring it's so easy I'm gonna do a little more I'm using a very light pressure this time to get a more defined line using the tip let's do the eyebrows away let me just put on this I'm revitalash and today I'm going to use my chichi brow pomade and this is in the shade soft Brown I want this and if this look to be really glowy and soft but I don't know still kind of dramatic going Christmas shopping tonight I'm nervous it's gonna be so busy it's like late night shopping here in Pamir I just hate busy malls like I avoid them all because I'm just not good in crowds like I hate the feeling of being real like school the legs so dug I hate the feeling of just being around a lot of people unless I'm drunk then I can usually deal with it like you had a festival or something but I don't know I just get quite like panicky ideas like claustrophobic is anyone else like that but I kinda know what we getting is so we should be pretty fine like we'll just be in and out kind of thing I actually hate Christmas shopping so much pressure I'm just gonna use a concealer my eyes this is billion dollar brows brow pencil which needs a shop in for our joy pencil what is happening there's like a little line in here just gonna finish off the rest of my face quickly into powder and stuff so I'm going to use what's up again on this small one it just has the perfect density to kind of spread it out nicely I love this color it's by benefit it's like one of my favorite cream highlighters and then a little bit of this cushion tint lip and cheek by mcqueen New York which is a Korean it brand I'm just gonna take it straight on the edge of the brush and this is the medium brush medium buffer brush sorry it's such a beautiful like natural pink color oops too much nana on an angled face brush I'm going to take my bare minerals be a pro powder and walnut light I'm just going to press that around my face kind of dodging the areas where I've got the highlighter oh my gosh I like actually love the way my skin looks right now okay now let's get onto the amethyst part of this look we're already all the base is done I'm going to prime it with my Natasha - no no I should our base and then I'm just going to take my shimmer chillip brush again in it to clarity just to sit that like I always do if there's things at first I'll show you a picture of an amethyst stiffly probably one of my favorite gemstones it's my mom's favorite I know that much basically they come in all sorts of purples but usually that really nice deep rich purple with hints of the lighter purple like these so I'm going to got in to the Lila palette by Natasha de Luna and I am at first going to take where is it this one just here and then this is on a crease tulip brush I'm putting on my outer V and through the crease like I said I want this to be quite glowy so I'm going to use some lighter Purple's as well as a darker one this is purely just like a transition shade it's got that kind of like cool undertone to it which will go with the purple really nicely and now I'm gonna take a pencil brush with this shade here which is like the perfect and that this kind of color it might actually mix a little bit of this one in as well and I'm going - just stop pushing that and it - at the lid I'm using a pencil brush they don't really know how much like lid space I want to cover obviously if you use a pedal brush like it I should have brush it'll be a lot faster actually you know why I might actually do that and just cover most of that and then put a lighter pop of purple in the middle this is a crease detail brush I really like how they look like the two colors together literally makes like the perfect color and then I'm just going to go in with my Cilic crease brush again and make sure that lose it you just is nice and blended and then I've never tried these before back the oh good when I go in this look because I feel like they'll be perfect I think see so I'm gonna be perfect I'm going to use my detail nipple brush oh my god so pretty so they're like Anna maybe third of the I are using the nipple to kind of carve out their line and then I'm going to run it just a little mixture of it these two shades just here underneath and then on my detail nipple I'm going to take the chichi pink nerd it's like a little metallic eyeshadow I'm taking out in the very tip of the brush I'm just putting that right on there in a corner and then looking at these pictures I feel like I need like a blackberry kind of color just on that outer corner or even eyeliner or something just to tie it all to get there this is taboo by makeup geek look at that I just feel like that is so nice the super dark color and it the amethyst so I'm gonna take my pencil brush again and I'm gonna use this a actually blended into hay fever has just been killer this year you guys oh my god head such been have you like the past month hurts so bad okay stay hive just like to find this is training docker and smokier as I go I probably shouldn't have done this but oh wow no longer light and beautiful it's very vampy and deep but I like it anyway so I love that like drawer chrome steel of stuff so cool okay eyeliner time what am i doin I might just do something really bright even like this isn't really the color of amethyst I just feel like doing something fun so this is a vivid bright eyeliner by next and the shade of vivid blossom these are really legit you guys sure can actually do hombre I think I should did I have a beautiful color Elizabeth Annan and plummet desire which is a darker purple this literally matches the eyeshadow okay just quickly before I do my mascara I'm going to put on some of the k'kaw Beauty the loose pigment and her dissing on my cheekbones because I feel like this is gonna look so purty it's like this I don't know if you'll be able to see it's like oh mom oh I want a glow today if you could not tell and this is a very wall this isn't your glittery but it's like very shiny it's not chunky like some loose pigments are and then it taking it the naked skin I'm taking it the bronzer today I'm going to use that light pink which is twinning it by Inglot just to brighten up that cream at blush we put on earlier I'm going to use roller lash and then fund elections which I've used these so many times I'm gonna reuse those or pop them on now and I'll be right back okay let's just get my lashes ready I just want to show you like I just think that a natural light will look better like don't get me wrong these one my favorite pairs of lashes but I just feel like it almost looks better with no falsies just because all of that glitter really shows but I think I might do natural lashes or even maybe the Sheik because they're super gap here these ones have been used as well hold on I think that looks really pretty like just simple lashes flirty oh this one's not stuck down probably feel like make Lois old with some links it's not very sticky and last but not least while that completely dries we're gonna do our lips and I'm just going to keep it very simple this I'm gonna use this live limb it kissed me shade it's so pretty it's a more chest one of the holiday ones and then I'm also gonna take some of that blue k'kaw beauty on my brow bone too much huh this is so big obviously it's pigmented it's a pigment but be careful don't use too much like me thank you all so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this chit chat get real with me and if you did enjoy the look please give it a thumbs up don't mind my like I just don't know what's happening with my hair it's so straight that I'm just like huh let me know what gemstone you want to see it next down below and the most requested one and I will talk to you guys in my next video [Music] [Music] 
hey everyone it's so today I am doing a updated like monthly favorites current favorites video haven't done one of these in a couple of months I believe so it's definitely overdue and I am excited to share with you some of these favorites because they're new favorites and they're amazing and you guys need to go out and buy them a step so I'm gonna start the reigning champion of the month slash ever since I first tried this I've been absolutely in love that's seriously one of the best concealers I've ever used and it is you probably already know because you were to see the thumbnail it's the color pop no filter concealer this stuff right here is amazing coverage it is so blendable it blends out like a dream it looks photoshopped it's just amazing you need to try it super affordable and the color I most often use sometimes they vary if I'm you know if I'm super pale or super freshly faked and or something but usually I wear light 20 it's a very yellowy kind of undertone it is so good I would compare it to the Naked skin concealer by Urban Decay except it's way cheaper and possibly better you guys know how much I love the Urban Decay one it's one of my all-time favorites so I'm so happy with this it is amazing I love it by the way my makeup is a full face first impression at drugstore makeup look it's not yet so when it's up I'll announce it on social media so you can go watch it if you like this look there are some hot out fails and hot out good stuff too so yeah anyways go buy this mixed up let's switch it up and do a skincare product I feel like I might have said something about this in the past current what I said about it but the more you use it the more I like it this is Antipodes divine a face oil with ewa cotter oil and rose head you guys know how much I love rose hip oil with full skin it's so nourishing or hydrating it helps with acne scarring and all that kind of thing this is so nice I worry it's today just on its own like I normally do at nighttime but I put it on in the morning and it lifts my skin looking so glowy it looks like I was wearing a highlighter but it was just this and the good thing is it doesn't feel greasy like it soaks in so it nicely and it just makes my skin it feels so soft so I am big fan of this product I definitely recommend if you're looking for a new facial or oil a kind of it product to try this is a hundred percent natural and 95 percent organic which is really cool as well next up is something I've talked about a couple of times in videos but I've just been using it a whole lot lately and it is the benefit high brow glow the glow one's my favorite I have just been loving this in my waterline in my inner corner on my brow bone it's for your brow bone and it just gives you that really nice kind of concealed and sculpted look underneath your brows to really sharpen them up and tidy them up not wearing it today but if I just apply a little this is the new formula to they've been a bit bought out was a year ago like a couple years I came in but it's when I went to Vegas I've got a terrible memory then your formula is so easy to blend you can just like blend it out with your finger and it's amazing I'll swatch it on my hand so you can actually say like what it looks like it's so creamy and it's just the most beautiful look glow so yeah it's so easy to blend down it just looks so smooth see I thought I'd mention that quickly just cuz I have been using it a whole lot I love it you stop let's do another skincare kind of product which isn't really skincare it's more like makeup remover the face halo and I have just been using this every single day to remove my makeup and I am in love this is actually a new packet I have about four of them opened already I will list my review for this product down below but basically this is what it looks like and it's just a microfiber kind of cloth except it works so much better than any other microfiber makeup eraser or anything else I've ever used like this is definitely the best you just whit it and you can remove your makeup with it seriously it's that easy a listener if you double it like I said you can go see it yourself it's incredible and I just have been using it non-stop so I highly highly highly recommend made a stop is kind of predictable but my shading side palette obviously I love this like I don't even have to put it in a favorites video to like prove that I love it because it's just my palette and I love it and if I didn't love it I wouldn't have it I wouldn't have made it I'm obsessed with this the remakes is I think even better than the original I love it so much so these are the new shades and I have just been using them every single time I've done my makeup except for today actually today is probably the first time in a long time I haven't used any of the colors even if I'm using other eye shadow palettes I always you like at least one shade from here I'm obsessed with this palette so I so put a link down below to where you can purchase it from I hope you guys love it as much as I do cuz I cannot get enough I'm so obsessed with it I can't put it down it's just my Holy Grail I should repel it I love it next up I'm gonna talk about this primer which I also like used and mentioned in a first impression video and I've used it quite a lot since so I'm really excited about it it's called the J 1 and jelly peg and if you saw the video you would've seen I was so confused because it kind of feels like a face mask like a pillow face mask when you apply it it doesn't really feel like something you should be putting on and leaving on it feels like something you should be like rinsing off and it's just really weird but you just trust the process you put it on it's really sticky and awkward but once it dries it literally like conceals every single pore on your face you put your foundation on top it's kind of sticky and it really sticks the foundation to your skin I really like this highly recommend this it's such a unique product and you probably don't have anything else like it so if you're wanting to try something new I would definitely recommend this it's pretty cool next up is a powder and I am usually not a fan of loose powder you would know that if you've watched me for years like most the time I used pressed powder to set my foundation however this is the first one to sway me I've used it a lot it's by Too Faced and it's called Born This Way it's real let's see taking a powder this is how it looks it's just a translucent powder and it is so lightweight and just makes my skin look flawless it doesn't crease it doesn't feel to powder you look too powdery it's just the best loose powder I think I've ever used and it makes my makeup stay on perfectly all day it's just a really good sitting powder so this is pretty much what I've been using every time I've done my makeup almost for the last few weeks like since I started trying out when was that I can't even remember you guys remember me trying a first impression but yeah this is like my go-to at the moment so I thought I would check it in this video next let's do another skincare so this is a face mask and I have arranged about this in the past not sure if I put it in a favorites video but anyway this is an oh it's another Antipodes product so obviously I like this brand quite a lot um this is the aura manuka honey mask now manuka honey is a amazing four breakout because it's a really good natural cure for bacteria like acne it helps your rid of bacteria so if you have acne prone skin this is amazing and it is so much into it's not your typical at mask that's gonna dry out the pimples it literally is so nourishing hydrating and gentle like I said so I love this what I've been doing a lot of like clay masks and stuff if maybe my skin is feeling a little bit dry and irritated this really comes it down it's also got vanilla pot in it which smells amazing it's got mandarin it's especially perfect for blemish prone dehydrated skin which is literally mean a nutshell so if you have skin like me we get the audit breakout and your skin moist feels a little bit like not dry but just meh then you will love this this is created and made in New Zealand it's vegetarian it is amazing I love it so so so much I need a new one like you can see next up let's do a bronzer this is by mica this is their own mickr like brand of makeup and the packaging is really funky it's like golden I love the square and then it's got this really cool like graphic design on the front not like it really made us but I just thought the picturing was quite cool quite eye catching this here it's called the sunlit it's getting a bronzer this isn't the shade medium it says for a goddess like glow this light reflecting a bronzer turns up the temperature so that it's silky summer love skin and honestly I was like terrified of this my fist sorry I was like I don't know how I'm gonna like this because you look at it and it looks kind of shimmery and just like an odd color that obviously when you apply it it's really not that shimmery I'm just applying it like real heavy to my hand right now it's not that shimmery it just gives you a kind of glow similar to my favorite hourglass bronzer it's it the color of this is way more kind of yellow almost which sounds really strange but the yellowness in it just warms up your skin like no other obviously I would never apply this heavily keep that in mind but it it's just such a beautiful color it gives you like that JLo glow it literally makes you look like you've just been sitting in the Sun like it is the most perfect sudden it lit glow you would never use this for contouring this would purely be like on the cheeks temples and stuff like that I use it like a blush sometime because it is quite a beautiful color I just love it so much I definitely think you should try it out if you are looking for new bronze that it's just like a really beautiful color something different to what you're probably already on because I don't really own anything this color and I love it so much it's really easy to blend as well of course like the quality of the product is really good I feel like I may it be thickening something it but this is the last major program I have yet okay oh wait you have no hair just remember down so this is the glam glow it glows didn't make up seeing spray I love this I love the spray Ojo to my skin right now so you can see like can you hit it missed like it is so lightweight you'll never get any like big dollops of product I hate that it smells so good like it smells really sweet and it just makes your skin look borderline oily which I love it gives the most beautiful Joey finish it feels so hydrating and refreshing oh I just can't get enough of it I love it if you have oily skin you may not like it but for me like I don't know what it is it just gives this like film over my face it just looks so nice I love it so much I literally just want to sit here all day and just well I put on so much of it if you just put on like one spray it doesn't look much different you know it doesn't really leave a different finish on your skin the more you put on this is why I've used half the bottle I love it I love it so much okay and then the final thing that I just remembered that I wanted to talk about is a eyeliner and this is by Emma cosmetics which is Michelle Phan's cosmetics line and I would say this I didn't try for ages until I was doing a makeup tutorial you may have seen it I'm not sure if it's up yet I was doing a makeup tutorial and my eyeliner winter deed like it ran out there we are I was like what's the proper term for this my eyeliner I was using ran out and I was like no eyeliner so I just grabbed this one and this is called the illustrative eyeliner the brush tip because I prefer brush tips I think it also comes in a felt tip and it is just such a beautiful formula this little brush is so easy to control I believe she was inspired by calligraphy pins or something but yet really like it works so good it's so so so easy to control so I had to screw up like literally you can get the nicest lines and it is just so so like I was barely touching my hand like it is so nice I love this so yeah I definitely recommend this I really really like it I haven't owned it for that long so I don't know if it's gonna start drying out at any point bill Beasley okay trying out my videos and you guys will see me using it so those are my favorites of the month please comment

hey everyone so today is the highly anticipated launch video of the shinik so pellet third remix by BH Cosmetics I am so hyped and so excited to like share this with you I'm gonna talk about the palette first Shearson swatches and then at the end of the video I'm going to do a tutorial for this look here's your really nice simple bronzed kind of eye with a little hint of pink bronze to skin and then the bright orange lips just to set it off this is perfect for spring and summer if you're in the southern hemisphere like myself otherwise if you are in fall at this I would look amazing with a dark burgundy lip like would look perfect so you can switch it up if you like anyway let's just like dive into this because I am so pumped their responds to the first shinnok so palette which if you don't know this is it here mine's a little bit dirty because obviously it's well loved it came with nine lipsticks and nine eyes shadows and this means so much better than any of us ever imagined like we thought it would do well but you guys like absolutely headed out of the park like you guys that loved it there was such a great response from you guys sending me oh look sending me photos such amazing reviews on the website like the overall love for this palette was just so overwhelming and so amazing and we cannot thank you enough for that over the last year I've had so many requests for a part two and little did you guys know over that entire time and more we've actually been planning a new one which is obviously it the one I'm showing you today their remix now the packaging is rebound as you can see like it's a brighter pink put a little bit of shiny shiny on the packaging to kind of like be nicer reflective and nice metallic remixed logo so you can do please tell them apart if you do already own the original like it's nice and easy for you to tell which is which I chose this nice metallic pink it's so beautiful like I'm just in love with it and then on the other sites a little bit of a lighter color so you can kind of tell the sides apart and you can see on the front it says 18 color or pellet now the reason we haven't called it eyes shadow pellet is because if you have the colors contain like the rig dyes and everything which on some people not myself but on some people it can stain the skin around their eyes so it's just you know just be aware of that there's more information on the actual box and there will be more information on the actual website so this is what the box looks like you can pause this if you would like I cannot actually begin it to explain how many people have messaged my selfish cosmetics lift comings lift review saying it like please never discontinue this eyeshadow palette because it's my Holy Grail I use it every day see to reconsider so we've bought back the eyeshadows so these are nine at fan at favorite shades there have been playing with this so it's not perfect it was perfect when it arrived in the post but I played with her before I showed you which was done I wanted to keep it nice than you but oh well pull back the nine fan of favorites now these eyeshadows are my Holy Grail I use at least one of these shades pretty much every time I did my makeup in real life and I use that in videos all the time as you guys know especially that top Pro and stick and roller like these two rows are my favorite and then this row down here is really fun for like nighttime or if I want to try something different we've got the mirror and you'll notice we've actually named each shape well I have named each shade so I've called a shade something so it's a little bit easier than me when I'm doing my tutorials to like communicate with you guys as to what shade I am using anytime okay you may be wondering like now that there are eyeshadows on both sides of this palette why should I not just do a traditional palette you know like a traditional appellant very good question first of all I love how slim and compact this palette is it is perfect for traveling I take it every time I travel with me it's not huge and bulky the other reason I kept it like this is because I don't know about you guys but personally when I have a pellet with a lot of eyeshadows in it like more than 12 or something like that I get quite overwhelms because there's just so many colors happening and I always seem to reach for the same a few shades and neglect other shades that a really beautiful but I just don't think about it because I see like this mesh of color and I'm just like that one so I wanted to keep it double-sided so that it's really simple so you look at this and you're like okay I can see the colors you know you're not getting overwhelmed by this plus color plus you know different undertones it's just very simple and one of the ways I like to look at the little 9 pen palettes is like you know this is a look this is a look this is a lo all of the colors kind of goes you get this so you can't really screw it up they're just perfect for everyday but there's again those darker colors so you can kind of amp up your look for nighttime I've actually been using the new side of this pillow even that's a little bit scarier like it's a little bit more colorful I've been using the new side almost every single time I've done my makeup I've used it or this thing is like when I've gone to events I've been using it like crazy my eye makeup is a secret my makeup once again a secret the eyes I can tell you but seriously I love love love these shadows and I know you may be a little bit intimidated by a couple of the colors but I'm gonna do tutorials and show you how wearable that they can be so at the top we have a nice neutral line of shadows and we have some pinks and like more burgundy red shades and then down the bottom we have obviously the super bright pink which is actually amazing as a blush as well so if you're looking at this palette like I can't even use that color if you don't usually you know go for colorful eye makeup this is actually beautiful on your cheeks and I show you how it looks right here I'm wearing it today believe it or not like it is not scary whatsoever trust me it's actually one of my favorite colors in the entire palette then we have this nice muted purple and then that's really beautiful muted kind of warm pink which almost acts like a neutral I use this just like all over my eyelid like it's just beautiful for everyday wear there are so many different looks you can create with this palette and separating the side of the pellet from the other side palette just makes the colors a little bit more you know they each stand out on their own so it's not kind of overwhelming like I said but then of course you can go from one side to the next like it's no issue I've kind of made each side a little bit of like a standalone pellet so you can almost think of this as like a toe and one pellet getting to 9 pin I should repel it in one I am so so proud of this palette it is so beautiful the colors are amazing they're easy to blend they are pigmented they go on like a dream okay and the price point is so affordable I'm just so stoked on this palette I know so many of you guys are excited so I really hope from the bottom of my heart that it really fulfills your excitement just like my last palette of course Audrey hates more tutorials as well in the coming weeks and months and stuff I actually have a playlist down below only get down below of a whole lot of tutorials I've created with this side only I know you guys will ask this is cruelty free it is vegan I chose old vegan which is amazing it's Gemma Tala just tasted it's even gluten free now I'm going to swatch every single shade for you including the original nine shades and then we will bounce straight into the tutorial so hope you guys enjoy okay so here is a closer look at the darker pink side which is the original side whence watching these I'm really kind of blending them as I go so you can kind of see you know what they're gonna look like on your eye the first color which is called clarity this is just the perfect bone it colored highlight color it's met the next shade is called Holy Grail speaks for itself it is my Holy Grail shimmery champagne color for highlighting brow bone and a tear duct lid anything it's so so beautiful the next shade is called globe ad this is perfect again for a highlighter on medium skin tones or it just is a perfect rose gold for all over the eyelid next is buttercup I like to use this in the crease is a really warm crease color or I mix it together with the Terra Cotta color which is coming soon this one here is called beach babe perfect bronze I love it and then this is the terracotta color which I called terracotta perfect in the crease or in the outer V or all over the lid and through the crease it's just like a one color eyeshadow look next up is toasted which is a shimmery taupe color it's so beautiful on the eyelid and the next shade is called avocado this is a joy chrome which kind of goes a warm brown to green to like a bluish color it's so beautiful and the last color is silhouette which is the darkest matte color and it is perfect like an eyeliner or for deepening out the outer V and that is how all of these that colors look so they are all quite neutral and wearable but I think they are all quite unique as well and the looks you can create a endless like old list my playlist down below like I said there's so many different looks you can create now we have the lighter pink packaging outside which is the new side which has some pinks and some neutrals and some purple and burgundy first we have Island glow which is the perfect light gold for highlighting brow bone and a corner cheeks and then next we have needyou which is my essential at crease color this is like one of my favorite shades from the entire palette that one is matte and so is this one here which is called Dark Horse which is just a darker Brown now we have drinker which is another beautiful quite unique shade it's a peachy pink kind of joy chrome it is so nice I love it and it's a really fun one to play with this next rid of shade is called stalker and it speaks for itself it is a matte so beautiful and actually really wearable I'll show it to you in some tutorials and then we have a van pitch which is in even darker reddish burgundy color and then the next shade is called misty and this is a really wearable muted pinkish kind of shade it actually acts really well like a neutral next is a really wearable purple good lover this one is super mutant as well and just looks beautiful all over the eyelid or in the crease and then the final hot pink is called baby girl this is going way too fast for me baby girl is actually really fun to play with and it's also good as a blush I will show you again how to use this in some makeup tutorials coming soon I made sure to actually blend it the swatches into my skin away arm so you can kind of see how they accurately look on the eyes so I hope you guys can see how wearable these colors I while realizing you can still create really fun and colorful looks so I can't wait to do some tutorials on my gosh so first thing before I stop my eyeshadow I'm just going to quickly a bronze up my face a little bit I am going to use the healthy glow powder by Siobhan Shea and this is in the shade 2 now you may notice my face is very pink I'm doing a first impression today on a foundation and it is obviously they're wrong and Ettore for me the wrong color so we're just going to pretend like it's fine using a medium face brush I'm just going to buff this around my cheeks jawline forehead nose just any weather somewhat naturally hit me today I'm gonna use my chi chi's soft brown brow pomade and then to clean up under my brows I'm using a high brow by benefit okay step 1 I'm going to first take the shade needyou which is at the top in the middle and this is like a huge round Ivor so this brush really like blows out the color this is perfect for the transition shade these colors are so easily and just like the other palettes new so I'm taking this Marc Jacobs the  brush I'm gonna go into your island glow and I'm going to highlight my Oh this brush is cheating this is like the most perfect light gold it's gonna take a little bit in my inner corner too right now now going into the original side with the shade Beach babe I'm gonna take dark horse and this is on a whim Linda brush and I'm going to apply some of this and it to the deepest part of

winning it my eyeshadow brush this is the hang of the three one seating spray I'm taking the shade drinko and I'm going to pick that on the middle of my eyelid so this is like a joy crumb so it's gonna change when you kind of move your head a little bit and don't worry I've got plenty of tutorials coming with the pinks and then I'm going to take a little bit of silhouette which is the darkest shade and I'm just going to apply some of this to my out of the just to make it super smoky I'm taking a little bit more of nature on this Philip bleeding brush I'm just going to buff that taking a little bit of nature on my brush with a little bit of dark horse I'm just doing some smoky underneath I'm not gonna use any eyeliner because I want my eyes to kind of look bright even though they're really smoky yeah I just want to keep them really wide open I guess I'm going to apply the etat gifted mascara just while I finish off my eye makeup I'm going to apply this Elizabeth Arden and bring

hello everyone so today I am doing a huge unboxing this might be one of my biggest unboxings yet you can even see all the mail behind me there is stacks and stacks I reckon there's at least like 40 packages right here so this video is going to be a very long and - probably not too in-depth I think I need to kind of get through it as quick as possible and three my finger is bleeding so you'll also probably notice that the lighting will keep changing anyway so let's get started there is so much stuff here so we're gonna dive right in handle with care I've got way too much bronzer on my nose right now Oh synergy here I bought this stuff myself free jelly babe I don't even like jelly beans but it's cute the first thing I got was olaplex basically this is a treatment for your hair and it's amazing I have used it before and I talked about it in an empties video so if you searched olaplex genic so on youtube it'll probably pop up oh my gosh - jelly beans okay I also got the Cure silk reconstruct regenerating at blow-dry spray I've talked about this in my empties videos in the past also I do like it I prefer the what's the other one called the quick dry one I think it's like km/s or something like that but I can't find it so I got this because I also like this it's basically just a blow dry spray it protects your here and I also got this to try from ripken it's the extreme at length Cielo first split ends and it looks like loose so give that a go and I'll let you guys know what I think of it next up is some stuff from Sephora so basically I bought a whole lot of stuff a couple of things in here I just bought because I wanted them but the rest of it is actually like high rated things off Sephora because I wanted to do a full face of a high rated makeup to see if they are worth the hype and like a chitchat get rid of with me and then if you guys like that I also want to do one with like Sephora's lowest rated makeup so yeah I just what hates the stuff that was rated really really high on Sephora and I'm gonna see if it's actually good so I'm not gonna go through this too much because we'll do that in the video okay let me know if you're excited for that because I'll film a set if you're excited how many thumbs up her in this video give me a thumbs up I'm just like grabbing random packages from the frightened center here's one that from a PR company

you hit a couple of days bye [Music] 
hey everyone so today I'm doing a bit of a kick read with me a little bit old school I know I actually filmed this look quite a while ago before I hit it out with my friends for like a BYO dinner and I just really liked it and I thought I'd share it with you today it's really glittery smoky smudgy quite sexy I don't know I had a lot of fun at creating it so I hope you guys enjoy watching it don't forget to thumbs up if you enjoy this video so I know to do some more my next video is going to be a cocktail series make it look so get excited for that so of course I'm starting out with a clean fresh face and I'm going to moisturize first I'm using this glam glow 1 don't mind the nail eyes just showing you you know snapped off always fun isn't it I'm using this glow starter illuminating glowing and moisturizer to begin this stuff you guys smells incredible like you need to go to Sephora if you have a Sephora and smell it it's so good it's literally like the best smelling product I think I own it's that good and then I'm going to moisturize under my eyes and using this Mac mineralize charged water little thingamajiggy I think II think same thing and then to hydrate my skin a little bit I'm using this photo finish primer spray by Smashbox which is going into it spraying all like weird on my face so I'm kind of gonna massage that in as well which I propped out apparently and then I'm using the hourglass lip oil just your hydrate medalists before we begin using my favorite Natasha general eye base eye primer on my eyelids to conceal my rid of any thin paper like I was but it sounded really strange this is just gonna act as a base for my eye shadow it helps to conceal I'm putting it under my eyes as well where it's like a concealer primer what's so good I love this I promise so much it's like my Holy Grail we are ready to begin I'm using my shinnok's toy palette just that kind of matte highlight bone colored shade all over to sit the eye primer and then after that we're going to do it the eyebrows so I'm using one Dubrow today and the shade it brunette and I'm just using a little eyebrow grooming brush like so if you need to fill in these bit boys I don't know where these words are coming from today I thought I would reach for the sweet peach palette today by Too Faced and I'm using that kind of warm peachy shade of met shade and my crease just to start off with with a crease blend a brush and then I'm using the one with a bit of shimmer in it but when you use a really dense brush like this it kind of flicks out the glitter which is exactly what I want because I'm just using that to kind of deepen up that color then I'm using the clay blue by Tarte palette I'm not the hugest fan of this palette to be honest especially at the face contour shades they just do not suit my skin tone whatsoever that I tried it out in this video anyway so you know experimentation and stuff pretty much what I'm doing is just deepening up that outer corner and crease with a whole lot of matte brown shade she's going slightly darker each time this really dark color I'm kind of going across the lash line and it into the outer corner and I'm just blending it in with so they're in a part of my eyelids kind of beer still and then I'm just popping down at some tapes because I'm going to do it these smokey eyeliner really soon but first I'm just going back in with that eye primer and kind of carving out that and I want to just make it super clean because you know as you believe sometimes the colors kind of go all over the place so using a brush just to blend that out that's just a dual face brush and then I'm going a to take the shinning slow palette quickly with an angled brush and take this kind of like rose gold pink kind of shimmery color and just pop that on top just to set that down and make the eye look nice and shimmery and pretty and why stop there when you're feeling extra if I'm also taking a peach glitter and popping that right on top of that shimmery pinky color we just used from the shinning side palette I love this glitter so much it is so pretty and they're moving right along to the eyeliner like I said hence the reason we were in tape on our face I'm putting that on my waterline and then of course across the top lash line oops this is me channeling my younger self during my emo phase [Music] [Music] seriously I'm kind of bad at doing smudgy eyeliner but I just use a pencil brush and just kind of mirrored and smudge it until I get the desired effect and I kind of layer up a couple of coats of it to just make it really dark at the bottom I guess so yeah just do it however you please you can copy me if you like but yeah it's probably not the best technique but the only way I know how apparently I was feeling a very dry this day so I'm using a hydrating primer as well on a mask in that prefer I do my foundation I'm using full coverage today the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation of stuff is next level courage holy crap you guys have seen in my videos already probably I'm mixing two shades to get it could shade for me today and using an angled face brush to buff it in [Music] I do find that personally on myself with this foundation it works a lot better if I buff it in with a brush like this rather than using a sponge because if I use a sponge it's just actually heavy coverage that sits on top it's gonna look really cakey and patchy so buffing it and gives the best result personally I'm also applying some of them still under my eyes and sitting there with my favorite powder concealer or one of them be well rested at baby minerals for my powder today I'm using the bare minerals be a pro palette on a big powder brush this is the vegan powder brush from its self Beauty they are still in stock we restocked them and then I'm using the bone color under my brows from a scenic so pellet once again just to kind of clean up that eye shadow and using these shimmery color and met in a corner because it's like my favorite in a corner however and then we're going to switch right back to those eyes again musing ash winged by the balm liquid eyeliner just to finish off the eye look putting that right into the inner corner and flicking it out on the outer corner making a really nice shot when and just to darken up that pencil gel liner a bit [Music] I find this really satisfying to watch for some reason I don't know anyways moving along I'm doing it my contouring now did not like this like I said earlier in this video just didn't like as much as might artists pro glow pellet it was way pitch here and I don't know it was just not the best so I haven't really used this palette since this video oh yeah I had to like blend it out with your brushes because it was just full along and kind of the wrong color too as you can see [Music] [Applause] [Music] and then it's highlight I'm using at this gelato swirl of baked illuminates illuminator illuminator tomato cause anyway I'm by Laura Geller and just highlighting my face and then for my blush this is when my favorite must have it by makeup store and I'm just putting that on my cheeks as well so I wanted to tie in a little bit more pink to go to any corner and because I'm going to wear pink lipstick to day I do not have a clue which lashes these are tbh reusing them they're not exclude bitty ones that's for sure so just applying those throughout my eyelashes before I do my mascara just cuz I find with this kind of like thicker lash band it's easier to apply them before I do my mascara and then I'm using lights camera lashes having a bit of a pic and applying that straight to my lashes as you do well done hey plus you know what pointing at the lips means I'm using this lip liner by nose and Soleil it's a little so I don't know how to pronounce that it was blunt I don't know why I was trying to line my lips well it was blunt but that's what happened because I was too lazy to find a pencil sharpener and I'm using Meraki lipstick which is a cream finish bait so beauty on top of that and it looks super bright and thus lighting it is quite a bright thing but it looks kind of cool in this lighting I wish it was like that in real life it's a little bit more subtle in real life that okay and then I'm using my shimmery color on my brow bone and I decided to add that in there just because the entire look looked quite glowy and then I decided to put some of my cheekbones and I did way too much but Yolo you only live once [Music] my her needed some action sorry I'm using the styling dust it's just kind of like good to you bullion and I'm just dusting that in and using my fingers to kind of tease it kind of like you know activate it wrestle it up make it a bit more voluminous can we admire this resting bitchface this is why people think I'm evil in real life they see me from afar looking like that it's not a good look and there was as far as I was willing to go with the hair so I'm living it like that and this is the finished look cue the posing I hope you guys enjoyed this look I hope it was fun to watch and if you did enjoy it don't forget to thumbs up and leave me a comment question of the day what is your favorite lip color to wear like brand color name let me know down below I'd love to know have an amazing day and I will talk to you guys in my next video bye [Music] when I met you it

because I've got obviously the more updated version now we have Kylie stuff this is empty okay I love this packaging this here oh I think it's one of the loose highlighters maybe it please don't go everywhere okay good it's got a steal on it a bit late on this because obviously her birthday collection came out a while ago wow that's so glittery Wow oh it feels really gritty even but I Heike want to give it a go cuz it's crazy I can't tell if you can see how glittery that is probably not in this lighting if any of you guys tried this let me know what you think of it I'm gonna keep it for now and just decide on that one later so it's called Queen then we have all of the little oh my gosh there's like clutter everywhere these are the matte liquid lipsticks by Kylie I'm sorry I'll keep daisies I like some of these would be so good just for like chucking in your handbag and stuff and there's padding everywhere where is this coming from something must have smashed oh that's right I know what it was for me but it was this which I got in a box I was dying over this pellet and look I'm gonna spit this out into the bin alright there you go completely annihilated the highlighter it just arrived like that like the curio was obviously freaking wrap and it's such a nice color to it which makes it even looks like I actually really like the shade I'm not one of those people that like represses powders like I just can't be bothered I kind of wish this just came and like by should our pants cuz this is quite big but also I love these shades they're so pretty especially this color here like this whole row I'm obsessed with I'm just going to put this straight into my collection my makeup collection I'm not going to put into the use stuff because I think I've kind of missed that bandwagon because that collection came out a while ago I'm actually gonna go through these and just choose which ones I want to keep one wish I'm definitely gonna keep that it's like a nerd I'm gonna keep the other node is this Mary Jo on our all nighter it looks pretty this is a gloss so I'll probably donate this oh my gosh there's friggin glitter everywhere you guys man we have the Judi time pellet by pixie I remember doing a tutorial with Judy's um BH Cosmetics palette ages ago when we did a swap and then I met her in Malaysia and we hung out a little bit and she is like one of the sweetest people I get for me she's just like one of those real genuine people you meet so many fake dicks through your shirt like especially you can imagine in the beauty industry like there's just so many people out there that are just all about you know the views the publicity whereas there's some really genuine people out there too and Judy is definitely one of them so this is what the colors are starting off the colors are really a bit good for my skin tone I feel like if you have medium and deep skin tones you will you will freaking die over these shades but for my personal skin tone like there's definitely some I would use but I think I'm gonna put this aside for someone else to enjoy because yeah definitely if you have medium to dark skin tones or deep skin tones you should definitely check that out I can only imagine the pigmentation is amazing - the colors are really pretty okay we've got charm liquid lipstick like Kylie which I'm gonna keep yeah V once you're big by Lancome I'm just I shouldn't really open it cuz now if you use it soon I'll give it a go and then this here is the you should say to full lash which is for perf so I'll donate that have a eyeliner brush which is Old Covenant Kylie's highlighter I'm just JDate okay we've got the big book of blush by tart which I stood in my video I was probably going to give away because I already have so many taught blushes and when I did my last decluttering series I got rid of like I decluttered so many of them so I'm gonna put this maybe even in a giveaway we have the Mary Mary Mary oh my gosh I cannot flow I'll start strobe and bronze and again I think medium and deeper skin tones perfect for you for me my pale is probably not so much okay we have this tight see you still up stick which I'm pretty sure I already have because I got to sink the full collection so we'll put them in the donation pile we have this  Seder it lipstick and desert quartz which is such a pretty nude keeping it just say don't make up like his really embrace me I didn't use much of it on my actual face to be honest but like just watching them the look of them like looks so luxurious this one here is in the shade Rose syrup oh my god there's not a roaster god I was expecting something pink but it's like a grayish color it's looking a little bit more pink on camera to be honest it's really not I'm just going to donate that one because I don't need to keep every single one of them and there's still a few to go through oh god I just remembered I have a friggin b12 shot later yay we also have fire topes oh my god that is a bright orange it's a cool color but I've got so many orange lipsticks especially Mac once I can go to my Mac declutter video where I showed a lot of them so I don't really need it and we've got the shade dusky honey which is a honey shade I'm gonna donate that because I think I catch one for my um the last part of this decluttering haul decluttering the whole decluttering video I kept a really warm nerd I mean what brand it was but it didn't hear some with the shade primer Sun which is a beautiful purpley pink or donate that one because it's kind of reminded me of snob maybe just a little bit darker I've got snob in my drawer we have afternoon amber this is so pretty that it's like a deep terracotta note I'm gonna keep that one cuz it's a little bit different this one here is Peruvian pink it's bright it's actually a really pretty color it's like a loli pink but I kind of want to keep it but no we have some paper light eye cream at color and some eyeline is as well Oh in another lipstick this one here is in the shade curious kisses which is a dark brown I definitely want that okay so these are the eyeliners so this one's in Shinran green I'm just going to check what color these ones are so I don't double up I don't know if there's just any one or more of each shade and I think they're all different so we've got black green and blue here I'm actually gonna keep these because I think they'll come in handy and I really want to give them a go I'll keep the black one for now even though black track is my favorite by Mac just in case the formula blows me away you know always I can donate that later okay and then we have it the shade in grey come with a little eyeliners as well which is really cute so this is like a deep grey color by the looks of it oh look at that it's art out of it maybe it's so that you can like brush your brush against it to make the brush tip really thin I don't know I'm gonna donate that one just because I feel like it'll end up looking like a muted black which I'd rather just use black we have the shade and a subete purple oh that's so pretty and unique look at that like a deep plum purple like brownish purple color it's super wearable minute this one is in the shade turned me sooo Brown I love the lid to how it's got these little like angular bits so it's really easy to unwind it's like a really random thing to say on our but it's true a little brush oh my god it's actually like a decent brush it's like super firm and like super pointy look at it okay now for the paper light eye cream color is which look like this just here this one here is in a saggy blue sherbet purple we have I can't pronounce these words who he's Lee great maybe I'm gonna pop babies up here two years and my gemstone series because the colors are just so beautiful I like these because they're so unique color wise like a lot of cream color is a really bold colors brizzy's are like super pestle which sometimes can be kind of hard to find so there's a yellow one I don't know if they're any good like texture wise because I haven't actually tried them yet so I'll try them in like a full-face first impression or something this one looks so nice Sango coral just watch it watch it yeah oh then it'd be a pretty just base like fall over I feel really creamy and um like almost like powdery they feel really nice okay this one here is

put this in it to my drawer of stuff I want to try out on camera even though I think you can really get any more I think they were doing their last drop of it soon or already or I don't know just cuz so many of you guys have purchased it I might as well try it out in a video anyway just because they look amazing maybe highlighter which I died over the forget packaging this is the way go one oh my god bit story pretty it's a really nice gold highlighter a lot of gold's on my skin tone of 17 it's like that one's still kind of intense but I feel like I could pull it off some Gold's just look so bad on me and then the other one here which is a darker color do you know what there might be too dark for me oh maybe not I'll like try it out and if it ends up being a bit too dark I'll donate it do you know the other day someone tries to hate on me for donating makeup that like I don't want or don't need or don't like and I'm just like just because I don't like it doesn't mean Naver and ice doesn't like it it's the whole point like every makeup product someone likes in someone doesn't even my own makeup line there are people they don't like it and then there are people that do like it I just don't get it like I'd rather at least someone else try it and see if they like it then just check it away in the bin like I don't get their logic anyway moving along this is cupcake what is a look on our gloss I'm gonna get rid of that put it in a donate pile we have a mum seal big brow which terrified the crap out of me by Lancome but you know what I'm actually gonna give it a go in a first impression one day and we'll have a laugh siren it's just gonna be a disaster like it's this huge I can't even like genuinely oh there we go it's like this huge chubby stick pencil I how are you supposed to do your brows with that but we'll give it a go and then we have a Innoko long at lash mascara in black made in Italy which I'm gonna try it some stick okay I have a whole lot of these iconic London it brushes and brush like pouch is so I'll probably end up doing any most today's cuz I have my own brush range and I have you know I love my brushes and they're everything I need them more I'm just gonna have a look and see if there's anything like unique that I don't think I have this super pretty though so donate these ones I need a new box for all this stuff I want to donate I like this brush I might try that one we've got these la girl lip apply one swipe and Tinch creamy color I'm guessing lipsticks cuz got lip in the title so you would hope so oh my god that one actually came off properly okay so they are this lipstick style which is not my favorite but you know sometimes they're like really creamy lipsticks they're actually not bad like that pigmentation let me try a brighter color oh my god this is like so annoying though this winding thing yeah this is so creamy I don't know how well don't last on your lips because they are like almost like look not liquidy but like this so thin and slippery they're you know they could last well who knows until we try them so I'm gonna just choose a few shades that one keep and then I'll donate the wrist I'm just gonna go off light the packaging on the outside because it seems to be kind of accurate so I keep these eight shades because they look quite pretty I've chosen a couple of bright and ones a really deep callous and nerds some pink and wearable colors and I'll put them in my little drugstore role often doing a drugstore first impression slash tutorial situation okay down here we have the smoke bomb with foil I should ours and they look like that they're very pretty but let's be honest we don't need that okay so as you can see we've got a whole of stuff we're just kind of like dragged everything into the corner this heaps of loose makeup these packages yeah this heaps of stuff Avenue donation box just behind the camera okay let's start so I'm gonna donate this this is a nude by Nature sit it's a value set just cuz I don't think I really get around to try that one we have oh my gosh okay Mario Badescu at skincare this seat just here I'm gonna try this because I really like this brain this is where the nikah turns 20 kind of gifts it's I guess this is a facial spray with aloe herb and rosewater I've actually been meaning to put this up the longest time you guys have no idea how many times I've added this to my cart and then just like forgotten about it so yeah I'm gonna spray some on my face right now use it to sit make her purse with your skin and dehydrating conditions or just give your skin a quick boost anytime anywhere it feels good it smells good Rose what it smell so nice I don't like love the scent of rose but for some reason whatever votes rosewater like I guess cuz I associate it with a thing like real refreshing and stuff okay and then we have the rose hips mosque which I'm excited to try this here says it is for nourishing and moisturizing and calming it's got rose hip and vitamin C so that sounds really nice but maybe when your skin is just feeling a little bit dehydrated dull or if you've been using a lot of like acne skin care just help calm down yeah it's gonna last thing is a cleanser which I'm kind of came to try except never try to cleanse it by Mario Badescu but it's a good brand so I'll try it out this one says it is for dissolving dulling it did it skin cells which helps to reveal a clean refreshed complexion and it's foaming so I'll be able to use it with my bin and you plan it skincare brush thing okay we have all of these you a long wear lip cream - holy moly Jerris army sorry this is upside down for you guys right now I love the packaging of these let's just try one and see oh it's like metallic is this a lip liner I feel like this would be a pretty eye liner like doing anything that would be a pretty eyeliner I wonder if it's eye safe or not I'm gonna get rid of any of the shimmery ones like donate them and then cuz I feel really creamy this one here is in the shade pink champagne the one again oh well swatch this one this is Sienna I feel so creamy so you guys know me I like creamy I'm just gonna choose which but they all look so nice like I'll just choose a few nah I'm just going to keep them all for now I need to go through all my lip liners at some stage I actually got a lot that I don't really like so I need to go through and take those out like when I'm decluttering and replace them with new ones to try oK we've got this cap indeed beautiful packaging package so there's a mini of both perfumes in here so I'm definitely gonna keep these I'll be fit forever boy and perfect Germany if I can get them out oh my gosh I'm so scared I'm gonna say no oh that's tight and then at the pallet which is the st. instant appellate so if you guys want a tutorial we should definitely out let me know how do we go I think that could be good for my gemstone series too because there's some really bright colors like they'd be good for the peridot that one and then we have it the easy way long way lip cream and lip glosses um I'm just gonna take a few random ones out that I really like the look of this is a lip gloss this is an Saint Germain which randomly reminds me of the Mac one but it's a complete different shade okay it's a really nice page I'm gonna keep that this is quite a fun I don't really go for bright glosses though cuz in case they move I feel like nude is more forgiving and lip gloss so I'm just going to take out showed you these three stickers coming off yeah I'm gonna take these three so st. Germain and then we've got diamond walk and then we've got Oxford Street I know donate these ones and then I am going to tape whoops I'm gonna keep beer even though it's like a color I probably have a million although I just really like the look of it I might keep this one too a French kiss and when I donate clove what is this we have a nectarine rich nourishing or moisturizing mask moisturizes and soothes the skin I'm gonna keep that because it's like a good triple size cuz I love my origins drink outlast but it's probably like you know quite a bit bigger so that could be good to take with me for on the plane even cuz it's only how many mil 18 Mills I could we have a designer brands invisible lip line I'm not a very big fan of invisible that one is I just cut me both up with them this is a glimmer of fate I brush like Mondeo's donate it again huge ass stuff look at that that's pretty but I'll never use it because I just hate big things that sounded like I just dropped there and I did not by the way it just like rolled off other stuff in the Box people always say you throw everything be careful with it I'm fine I'm fine this is a concealing pellet make it wrong what's this liquid eyeliner I'll try that out we have a concealer oh look at that some I've already got all of those tops makeup remover sheets I really don't like the look at those I love when wow I should our palettes comfort zone I think I already got this one do i mmm remember I'm going to keep the eyebrow kit this is an ash brown for my drugstore first and for sure it's okay this is a nail color which I want yours we've got a cream fatty that's like so the wrong coffee don't know that someone else we've got a mascara which I'm using my first impression we've got the bomb stains I've actually tried these I think already got some of my drawer what's this velvet matte lip color this looks like a pretty shade let's open it and see yeah that's some nice color it's like a warm brown we have the seeing spray

we have a primer cape we owe my god this is the longest frigging pencil i've ever seen in my life this is a new week so beauty brush by the way look at that this is a huge brush what the heck I don't like that just because excuse me so long we have a rose it champagne blush mmm not to face it I can't say if I keep this or not lip gloss and I'm scared anything cuz I think I might even have it anyway so we've got precisely my brow shade 3 which I've already got I've got most of these I've already got 3 brow tines in my drawer I am gonna keep the gimme brow because I go through this like you know no one's yes I've got a goof proof-- which I already got Bravo conditioner which I already got I've actually got backups of it too here's another J yes this is just the box so I'm gonna keep this as a backup actually I think I'm ready gotta back up or just keep it for now in case another goof-proof okay and then this is new so I'm excited to try this out is the full proof brow powder which is just like a little double so I'd love browsing I've used it quite a lot of my tutorials if you watch my makeup tutorials so I'll just try this basically the same thing except it's just two different colors so I'm gonna be good I travel and stuff like that okay this stuff is just stuff out of my makeup bag like all my brushes which I need to give a wash because they're all filthy I just use my Beauty brush soap to clean my brushes that one's clean um all these later okay my pro glow obviously I'm keeping there's my browsing I was just talking about which I love okay we've got this at girl on a pad I believe I was meant to give this to my mum and I must have forgotten this is pink me up I just think she will love this color it's really really pushy and then this was for her to my I'm nerd personal last cuz I love it last we have we have some benefit products like gimme brow we've got my tweezers all this stuff I'm pretty much just going to put back into my tribal makeup bad because yeah that's where it came from and I need to repack on my makeup we've got this glue which is like almost MD look at this so I might as well just chuck that way now my favourite split-end sirum stuff woo where are you this is the Curacao exploding treatment it's amazing I love it so much I have them make Amex sunlit skin bronzer I usually really really like this it's so it beautiful so back away I'm gonna get rid of it the nude beach I should or call it by the balm I just don't reach for the Baba shows I don't know why they're really pretty but I just never go for them oh my gosh she's so much stuff okay I'm gonna keep the lip colors and keeping concealers is my favorite at the moment I've got my another Ubuntu this was for mum as well it's just like a pressed powder by Napoleon we have a lip glazing cappuccino by nectar which I'm donating because it's like a dark brown shimmery tella we've got this extend a brow brow the Luminizer of illuminizer is it the word volumizer okay Shannon calm down with the old lingo I want to try that out my gold thick color is terrifying it's like green and then I've got the 24 hour foundation which I can use in the a fist impression as well I've got my beloved fusion ink foundation oh my gosh nail polish which alternates my brushes which old donates I've got this oil which I put my travel makeup bag because I love all my skin it's by elizabeth arden it's so pretty I love it we have a false in fluid mascara by designer brands we have my hula quickie stick which I love we have this little which I really like I tried it the other nights by Innoko and it looks really strange but yeah it's just like a lip moisturizer oil and we have a kylie 20 lip liner this color is really nice how do I show you I use this in an Instagram tutorial makeup tutorial oh man it's gonna go check it out my juror line which is like my Holy Grail I love that some Russian election 5 is which I saw Tati to a video on these and I kinda want to do one as well so I might keep no and then these lip liners I am going to donate because I'm just not a huge fan of them starting off the tutorials up yet but I explain why one of my recent tutorials I just prefer creamier lip liners these are quite stiff which some people definitely prefer so it's definitely personal preference I love NARS those just did not allow me and then I also have these which I use the shader north this shade in her tutorial which is called get it on I find these so liquidy they kind of like the Kylie Jenner ones except they kind of bleed a little bit but I might have had too much on my wand so I do want to keep trying them so I'm gonna go through these and pick a few shades to keep and then for the rest of them I will put them in giveaways or something so you guys can try them too oh definitely Kate get it on cuz everyday want that one so you guys won't want my germs okay we have I'm just going to actually line them all up and just kind of pick a few this color is standing out to me this is cold lowrider these two are really standing out and this one so it's a bright red too cool to light my fire just push play a darker red and then the darker darker red it's called rock with ear and I think these are spear kissimmee colors which I already have because sometimes I get double once they see me extra yeah I've already got those this is a hydrating hydrogel individual sheet mask so put it in my chair to do a Graham video on well I've got my Kylie makeup bag which I'm definitely gonna cake because it's just so super cute a little bit and my liquid is which I'm gonna Kate I put a blue one and a shimmery like shimmery light blue one and then what's this one just like a white I love these glitters shinning so as a discount card it's an affiliate code so I make a portion off your sales but genuinely these are like my favorite glitters of life you've seen me use them a million times in my videos and a mascara by Ramon and then we've got this ginseng energy boosting gel moisturizer by origins whichever can all give a go little scissors which are perfect for travel and then this is a gradual tan by Saint Tropez which I'll probably get rid of this I don't usually use gradual tans very often the hay fever right now is real okay now we had the issue a exceeds your high coverage cream foundation so put aside a couple of these for fist impressions I'm just gonna try and figure out which color I am so it comes with this brush oh it comes with a hi Linna I can get out met nerd oh it's like a concealer kind of color for your waterline which is perfect so I'll put that in here to try for a first impression I'm gonna start oh the colors oh look like they want an order this one that one looks pink this is called shell okay this one here is cold porcelain these are met hyaluronic acid oil-free they've got hollering kisses okay so this is in the shade porcelain which might be alright for me with no feet to I'm just gonna try out flips this shade here which is called sand sounds a little bit more orangey and then these ones just look way too pale for me I'm going to put aside a porcelain for my pale shade which is that one okay and then I obviously won't need the deep dark which by the way are not that deep dark there aren't really any stupid it's like the darkest color which kind of sucks this one here is almond so I'm just gonna swatch a few of them I try to figure out which one I should be keeping that looks way too orangey a warm beige for me doesn't look bad on camera but in real life it's definitely the wrong end of time it's like soup orange and probably a bit too dr. okay next up is one this looks better already yep the undertone is a lot better for me I know it looks like Superstock yellow but once you believe that looks way better obviously that's actually a really nice color so that's probably a goer this one already looks too dark so does this one so does that one and so does that one there's a lot of medium skin tones and light skin tones okay that's me and then we have all of these la girl brushes which I'll probably donate most of these okay and then we have the brush Bible by Smashbox okay so I'm gonna end up donating most of these cuz again I've got my own brushes which I love it's actually quite a cool brush there I might try that one out so donate most of these ones okay and then in these two boxes are all gifts it's so most of these I will let the premium into gift idea videos and giveaways and stuff because they are really cool bit once again I'll be able to use them once and then you guys won't be able to get them so it's kind of pointless for me to actually keep them for tutorials and stuff ok so this is all of my stuff to put away it now from those videos so I'm gonna do that on camera quickly and then in this video cuz this is probably like super long by the time holy grab I've been filming for a long time this in here is all that skin and kiss stuff so that'll go to my bathroom and then this stuff at the back is a giveaway stuff so yeah the stuff at the front come up this the stuff at the front is the stuff I'm keeping obviously putting

hashtag your favorite Mac lip products and hashtag Mac's lips lips lips and I will be announcing it too when I actually to announce this to two winners so two of you or when one of these glorious boxes each and yeah I will announce the winner on national lipstick day which is a 29th so you've got just over a week to enter moving right along I'm going to start with my base and then do my eye makeup so today the cocktail series they are and I am going to do a mojito but first I need to with my son's finally I'll show you what's in the huge box later on when I do my lip makeup it's so exciting so I'm going to take one of my favorite primers at the moment the Urban Decay self adjusting complexion primer the phone that changes to match your skin tone and it makes your skin look so perfect even without foundation like watch it I'm sure you guys have seen it if you watch my videos regularly but just in case you haven't like honestly I decide to mix most good looks so soft and quite even like even for no foundation and then the foundation today since I've used my covergirl a couple times recently I'm going to use my L'Oreal true match foundation this is in the shade one D 1w and I'm using a flawless finish on it's so sticky you hear that I especially love using makeup sponges in winter because it's winter here in New Zealand lose my skin gets so dry it just applies the foundation so much nice that gives a little bit of moisture because there's a damp sponge just makes it blend nicer so you still get that nice full-coverage effects with the flawless finish song from finally feeling a bit better I still sound a little bit objects my throat's lowest although I think the sinus infections finally like gone I received a box from k'kaw Beauty so apparently I'm on the P Alice somehow I don't know how so I've got instant all of the concussion at West kits I guess highlighting contour kit light medium dark and deep dark so I'm giving this moment under the light because I'm very fair right now hashtag winter life so it's a people vary done reviews so here's the packaging plastic packaging then you've got your highlighting contour stick and then you've got your little brush this is so much smaller that it would be like I've watched loads of reviews on this product I still like didn't realize how small this was in to me it kind of looks like something at all would use so the packaging I know a lot of people are very like and to it I actually quite like the nurse I don't know like some people say it looks cheaper whatever but I don't know I like it heard that the sponge is crap I've heard that the brush is okay different opinions about the products and will love it some people absolutely hate it I wasn't even going to do a review but loads if you guys keep asking for it so let's start with the contour kit so it comes with this much product which is stuff all to be honest like that's so small there's the product qualities there hopefully to be a wet there okay so you've got two colors it looks very similar I think this one's a little bit more cool tones and this one's a little bit warmer so for the cool all I'm going to draw lines we will contour do you feel like I use a lot of crap just doing is that much do you see I don't know how long this would last you can use it every single day and then I'm just going to mix a little bit of the warmer color just and around where I want to be a little bit bronze as well and now I'm going to take the little brush I mean it works it's a little bit stiff and what I mean by there is it's kind of like wiping off the foundation from underneath the contour when I blend the contour it's like blending away my foundation as well so rough I feel like a sponge would be better can I just try my sponge yeah see this already is working better I like to color the undertones really good like it works well for my skintone yeah look how much easier that is to blend so if you have a beauty blender or a row technique sponge or you know whatever it expedia well I would recommend that instead and it's quicker so do I like the contour kits I think so I just don't know if it's worth the money so an excellent chubby stick you're getting six grams of product and then Anna Kim kardashian-west contour stick getting point nine grams you're literally getting about four grams of product under four grams or product total not even four grams of product okay anyway let's do the highlight so there is a net side and then a shimmery so to the shimmery highlighter for the light one looks quite yellowy let's give it a go I'm going to use the cycle preventive concealer today kind of sinking in to my skin texture and the color to be honest does not blow me away it's not bad but I mean it's pretty like a natural look and you know me I like natural highlighters but I just I guess I expected her to have something quiet radiant because she's known for like highlighting and contouring you know if you like intense highlighters I'm not sure that you will like this at all it's definitely one of the more natural creamy highlighter eliminators over the years candles up so my first impression I don't I just don't know if it's worth the money like I don't know this is very pretty first impression that don't really think it's worth the money I'm going to use that this powder here which will probably cover up this contour to be honest because it's very subtle but anyway this is photo bomb and just going to I haven't concealed for my concealer I'm going to use the advanced concealer fluid by clinic I don't always try to say just then I really like this it's like a nice kind of like medium buildable full coverage by the way this shade is met light oh one now I'm using the Kat Von D petal powder under my eyes and I'm just going to use some of the glam glow glow getting spray just while I do my makeup but that's okay smells good Museum Cabral and then a little gimme brow score and then the Natasha Jinora obese and now I'm just taking fresh I should over by NS are typically hills on my browned I brush and just sitting there lid okay now some color inspiration this is what I'm a you know it's like if you did not know they're super refreshing a lots of lime lots of mint this is like your classic meter don't know what color I'm going to do with this today these are exciting exciting there's lots of sugar in mijitos so maybe we could do some glitter to represent the sugar I'm going to start with mac aqua eyeshadow that's going straight in that cream I'm going to bring that down onto the little at all now you're maybe thinking why using a crush balloon color but I just want some tonal variation I'm going to go over top of this in some spaces with a minty green just to make it nice and bright photos just a little bit of a neutral in there just to balance out all the color this color here is called it custard by Anastasia Beverly Hills it's like a neutral kind of yellowish brownish color I'm going to use the exact same brush I'm going to put that right in there crease by the way this is a crease blending brush and then I'm just going to run it and custard color underneath now I'm going to take the shade Dragonfly on a firm blender brush this is by makeup geek and I'm just going to pop it kind of in the crease also just kind of lower down in the custard shade similar to where I put that equal color now I'm going to take a little bit of that same Dragonfly color just on the outer corner and today and then next I'm going to take a gesture which is by makeup geek also and I am going to apply this to the outer half of my eye now I'm going to go in with a little bit of neck painterly paint-pot just to clean up with my inner edge my Island and then I'm going to go in with something to represent like the clear color of the Mohito so maybe like a wife or something like that I'm just using a little concealer brush just going about halfway across my eyelid like that again I found this color for the inner corner because this is perfect so this is like a joy chrome kind of shade it's called voltage by makeup geek got a hint of green net that is real white at the same time so this is perfect for the liquid over teen heat or also going to put that on the inner corner and then next up I am using a lime light by makeup geek on the same little crease detail brush I'm putting that right underneath in the middle this is super bright so I don't want to use too much but just really ties the look together look if you look for the perfect colors I'm leaving fall out might just add a little bit of this lime green just kind of on that transition and then one more color I just want to darken up that outer corner this is enchanted forest by makeup geek just using a little I to find a brush at that dark green color I'm just going to kind of line underneath my waterline with this I'm going to use at some swing liquid liner I found this freaking beautiful eyeliner this is it mr. right now Wayne better bomb its super broken most can put that on my waterline so it's a green but it's not bright eyes they're not working like works for my hair a lot of men would learn to not just using eyes to kill by Georgia and Manny mascara that's read in front of me early like this stuff it's not like my favorite mascara to be honest I often like drugstore mascara is better than high-end but oh my gosh my nose makeup look so bad just cake sink true anyways this is good virtuous expenses so there are the lashes with no it falsies but I'm going to use falsies today these are these huda beauty cement elections the stylish for some reason I cut way shorter than this one it's really annoying me why would I do that so if my eyes look crooked or like a mana corner that's why I should really just trim this one too but this one fits nicely I don't know why I would have trim this so short okay so there is that the eye makeup done and just going to clean out this mascara mousse I made today we had that Mohito eyes let's do the rest of the face I'm going to use the pro glow palette with a bronzer brush to contour because you can't really see the Khimki one you know just like a gun with it come kay one more if I hit like a minimal make-up day I want to select something on like it's really nice and fast to work with and quite natural need to highlight I'm going to use loosen my XO Beauty I'm going to with my brush as well so I've got some powder on my brush to make it super super intense I feel like intense today the sliding is not flattering right now and I think I'm going to leave my cheeks like that not add any blush so now let's just go to the lip so let's see it was in this giant box here behind me you guys going to die already no it's inside but I want to show you it is literally so heavy okay how cool is this so down the bottom I've got a whole lot of lip glosses these are so pretty I love it this hot pink land and then we have some lip line in and some retro matte liquid lipsticks which I love this I've actually done it looks watched video on some of the shades when they first came out I believe and then in here we have it the eclectic lipsticks which I'm sure you guys are familiar with if you do know Mac as a brand make is really known for its lipstick and for all of their high fashion trends and looks they create their

lip glasses which are like stupid litter it is heaps of shade here just a few of them so let's play I am going to start with boldly bare lip pencil so that's how boldly bare looks by itself but I want to use a lipstick on top something a little bit more new it just to create like a little bit of dimension using the darker lip liner and the lighter nude lipstick and then I think border I'm going to go in with creme Cup which is actually an old favourite of mine and then the glitter I'm going to use a luster white by Mac the lipgloss if I show you up close is super glittery curly see it's like a white clear glitter and I haven't done a glossy lip and so long I like to love it if only you can see how it sparkles in real life I'm going to take the tiniest bit over true flick gold at glitter by Mac and just pop that kind of like on top of my lips like on my Cupid's bow a little bit on my lips I'm also going to use a little bit of this glitter just on the inner corner just a title together so

below so you can find it easily thank you to max for collabing with me on this video and here is my mojito inspired look if I knew the lighting was a little bit better kind of crap lighting I'm sorry guys I love you guys heaps I hope you guys enjoyed this video hope you had fun watching it and I will talk to you guys again soon back [Music] [Music] 
hey everyone so today I am going to show you guys how I got rid on New Year's Eve in New Year's and I was actually at a little batch at the Mount so that's why this background looks a little bit different and I was well tipsy by this point I wasn't even gonna wear makeup and I thought you know what I'm gonna put on makeup and so like the end product is not the best but I thought it'd be fun to show you how the makeup came back anyway so I hope you guys like it so as you can see here I'm just starting out by priming my skin was quite dry because we spent the whole day in the Sun and I had been swimming and stuff previously so just getting all of that hydration it was key and same with my lips so I'm just using this little lip balm and then the foundation I bought with me is the beyond perfecting by Clinique I start with the darkest shakes I did have fake tan on but I didn't realize how much it had faded because I was tipsy so at first my face was very orange and then I realized I needed a lot of color so I edited this shade here just to lighten it up a little bit and make it more my complexion shade [Music] and I'm using my flawless finish spongebuck so beauty a true blend and I didn't have a big mirror so I'm using my little machine so the remix palette to help me out because I had no monitor anything that's why some parts those we were a little bit blurry I was just doing my base to plus yeah you know I don't know where I'm going with this anyway now I'm concealing and I used my collection lasting perfection concealer every time I use this I just remember why I love it so much it's so smooth my under eye area literally looks so nice and then yes sitting it with some powder this is my all-time favorite I mentioned it in my 2017 all-time favorite makeup products it's they kept on day under eye setting powder I don't know why I thought I needed so much of this right now like what am i up to anyway tip see I'm putting on some powder next I'm using them exterior if it's powder with a big powder brush and just stamping that everywhere my fake tan looks so bad seriously or what was I up to it with my life but anyway it's okay it's been and gone and then I obviously realized I had a crap ton of powder on my face so I used some sitting spray right before doing my eyebrows and it's so funny every time I use heaps of sitting spray look at my beard so what fluffed up just anyone ask it anyway I'm using a brow on my eyebrows and she's coming up my eyebrows the best I could I'm sorry this angle is not the best cuz yeah I couldn't see what I was doing while I was doing them otherwise I would have gotten a nice angle here we go this is a little bit bitter bit anyway I'm just doing that [Music] and then next up I'm going to bronze my face I'm using my favorite again I mentioned that in my favorites video recently I'll link it down below for you if you haven't seen it yet it's got all of my favorite price from the past year this bronzer is just the best thing ever and I'm using one of my marble brushes to apply it just around my cheeks my forehead my nose my chin my neck just anywhere I wanted to bronze myself up a little bit I love it love love this bronze was so much and then I'm using a little round eye brush and my shining soy pehle I think I use the same brush like the whole time pretty much I'm just using the light color all over my eyelid just as a base and then I am also going to use another light color just to highlight my brow bone this is a really lovely light gold color it's so pretty I love it so much it's so nice on your cheekbones as well if you want a nice cheekbone highlighter I don't know what happened here but I just like tripped out of my brush well maybe I was looking at Hamish because there goes Hamish in the background I don't know what's going on anyway and then at once we are satisfied there I'm going in with a nice light brown color and just popping it all through the crease my eye makeup is not on point today because once again just for the millionth time I just want to remind you I was a little bit tipsy you know but I was doing my best job look at that concentration okay and I'm putting out under my breath perhaps what would Shannon under my eyes as well so crease and to the eye and then I just took this color on my finger it's a base they need color but I didn't need to do that because I forgot how pigmented they are but I did it anyway I'm using it rose gold retro the Stila liquid likes shimmery I should or whatever they called I always forget and I picked this TF on so putting it all over the eyelid in a corner like under my eye through the crease just everywhere I just wanted to Sparkle and Hamish was like do the glittery in the corner so had to talk to him his birthday was on the first so had to make it about him as well it's not just New Year's for us he is so super cute with my makeup he always compliments it in a way his comments unlike my lip colors and my eyeshadow and everything he always comments on my lashes cuz he does work Vic so a pity quite often so here like you know picks up on these things his favorite thing that I ever do is the inner corner highlight especially like the metallics so when I use my little chichi liquid I mean no liquid cream eyeshadows or the stealer ones like the old ones or anything like that just something super sparkly on my inner corners whose favorite thing in the whole world so I just think it's adorable so that's why I did so much Sparkle kind of went everywhere but oh well and I'm just adding a darker color to the outer V of my eye just just want a mention but it's kind of messy but Yolo and then next is a lip liner that I am working out with this would be very soon surprise surprise not like I haven't been hinting about it for ages and this is not my actual final packaging it was one of the last samples I received but stay tuned that's the color on my lips now before I put on the lipstick and then I'm putting on lipstick and this is also a new shade I'm just so excited for the new stuff coming to you so it'd be really soon so definitely keeping an eye out for all of it because I'm just obsessed even more obsessed than the first drop I reckon so I'm really looking forward to seeing what you guys think of it all then in my brows and then eyeliner and this was the omit of the night I mean who the heck does eyeliner when they're tipsy it's so not a good idea this I actually went relatively okay this eyeliner is just you know what I should have put this in my 2017 favorite that was a fail because this eyeliner is so dang it good I don't like the other side of it it is jeweled ended but the longest side is so good in the reason I don't like the shorter side is for some reason it just seems to bleed on me and I don't know what it is is that the longest side stays in place it's super black it dries matte it's just so beautiful this side here I just went out of control like it's so huge this wing is so huge it's such a terrible shape I don't even know what's running through my head yeah the alcohol I guess [Music] you know it's bad when you'll see me drunk and you can tell maybe not happy oh well okay moving on a true mascara I'm using it the taut or the lights camera lashes being loving this one again recently and just piling that on it before I do my falsies [Music] away first before I do my falsies I'm contouring I found my old what does this call weight Naz eater is it the each of our I can't remember it's been years since I've used this thing it's just been sitting in my room and when I cleaned my room recently and decluttered I actually found it again they LED taken away with me still love it but sheds like my dog in summer it's so shitty but I like the effects of whatever conjuring with my tightest / glow and then I'm also going to do at my blush as well and I'm using this should have been a match of thousand seventeen favorites as well but to be honest like I've only just started recently using it I love their blush palette just a nice light peachy color and then highlighting and holy crap I put on so much okay Yolo and then it doing the lashes now I'm using the extra Beauty natural sit the very bottom pair and what I did was trimmed off the back end like to make them fit my eye and then actually it stepped that on the outer corner just to make them a little bit more cat eye so there's a little trick for you if you don't want to waste the lash that you trim off your lashes I do it sometimes I don't know how you ever talked about it before my youtube channel but there you go there's a little heck yeah [Music] and then here's me pretending to be magic I thought I was so cool and I did that I'm not even joking I checked on Nicholas this one's from a monster and then because we were at the beach I just checked on this nice little place sorry I kind of forgot to show you it but this is the finished look it's really pretty I would actually wear this like daytime but obviously with a bit of blending you know that bitter blending would have been great a little bit of alliteration for you today but I do like the colors and I love the lipstick of course as being at my grocery lately and you'll see it soon if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and yeah a hose in my next video happy new year by the way [Music] 
hey everyone so today I have my coffee because apparently I'm bitter to watch but I'm on coffee when I'm on coffee makes it sound like some kind of drug when I drink coffee anyway today I am doing a very highly requested video my voice is a little bit croaky I don't know what's happening a cruelty-free makeup tutorial and I don't even know what kind of look I'm gonna do today I was thinking something quite dramatic like clubbing kind of makeup full glam and then if you guys want to see more of these cruelty free tutorials I could always do like a more natural look or something but I don't know I just feel like wearing and a makeup today so the website I'm going off is cruelty free kissy calm so I'm gonna try to use completely cruelty free products so brands that aren't owned by companies that do tests on animals it's gonna start with some of this hourglass lip will on my lips cuz now let's it's still dry if been hearing so many lip issues lately like my lips have just been peeling so like a solid week and a half as you guys know I don't only use cruelty free brands on my channel I use like every brand on my channel it is really good to be conscious of what you're buying is a consumer so I know that this video will be so important to you guys so first of all I'm taking an EMI jakers recover perfecting coconut sitting and messed by like to use this before my makeup sometimes too I've just started experimenting with this I love Matt Jacobs and they're like face products foundations prime is considera and then to give it my skin it glows put under my foundation I'm using it the Charlotte Tilbury wonder glow and students soft focus Beauty flesh this I actually love this I've hit this with such a long time now I haven't really use that much every time I use it I'm like this is so good I don't know why I always forget to use that I'm just going to blend this in by the way I'm not naked as I'm sure you guys have figured out by now full foundation I'm going to use Anastasia Beverly Hills ivory stick foundation alright we're gonna use this on my channel before everyone really experimented with it that much cuz I just used liquid foundations morphe tuning stick foundations and I've been using the top stick foundation so really need to use this some more and then I'm using the flat face brush by EXO beauty and its obedience cruelty free this color is a really good match for me right now I've got this zero fake tan home oh my gosh it's almost spring here in New Zealand and I am pumped holy crap I can't wait I just winter so much I hate the winter because it's cold it's miserable raining all the time Wendy I hate winter and it's just so dark all the time and it's dark so early at night like it gets dug at like five o'clock at night and I'm just like I can't deal with that so I like the days are longer I love to hate like I'm just so excited and I'm planning a trip now I just clicked my my shoulder I'm planning a trip with my mum over to Fiji because I usually go on like a little I usually go on a trip you know somewhere tropical like once a year or so just cause it's so close to New Zealand there's not many countries that are close to New Zealand it's like Australia or the islands so my mum's never been so I'm shutting her trip over for her birthday present and I took her into the travel agency yesterday and she just started crying she's like oh my god so that was really cool so I cannot wait you know for somebody are all around and go away and then hopefully we'll be doing something fun over New Year's like I have no idea yet we haven't even planned anything which is slack cuz you always have to plan stuff so far in advance I'm just gonna add some more people here say Shannon you can't have a natural full coverage like full coverage isn't natural but to me it makes sense like it doesn't look heavy I don't know comment down below your favorite Spotify playlist I'm trying to find some new music like I just feel like none of my favorite DJ's are putting out new music lately and it's disappointing me I just want to find some like new stuff to listen to and I'm typically by the way going to do more of those full-face first impressions because you guys were obsessed with the last one I'll link it down below you have insane oh it was just like basically a huge fail so many terrible products but I feel like I pulled it together in the end I'm gonna use a little bit more Charlotte Tilbury actually I really like this I don't know if I've used in videos either but you took quite a lot of my everyday life just because it's really natural and like brightening it's called the retouch and shade to fair and it's kind of like the tushy claw or however you say it by YSL but it's got a little bit more coverage than then I find and it just oh so nice is so easy to blend and just melts into your skin so I'm just gonna kind of take that on around the place where I want a little bit more coverage too like around my nose and stuff no no my eyes I'm using this tapered face brush makes a beauty on your playlist at the moment on Spotify and everything sucks this is how you know you're getting old it's like I'm like oh my god everything you sucks I'm like can we go back to 2013 music because it was so much better this is stuff my parents would say like ah music a so bad these days it is not really bad but you don't I mean like the best period of my life for music was definitely like 2013 2014 like I lived for that style of music and like Skrillex and Alvin risk and you know all those people like under my eyes I'm using my favorite battery though this is a locket Peter what brightening powder by Kat Von D Von D it's cruelty free yay this is just sort brightening I'm using a shimmery lip brush to apply this makes a beauty this is a tortoise shell handle it is not real tortoise shell people asking they're like how is that a vegan brush stick because it is vegan people has their figure it's like tortoise shell is like it is no real daughter show screw that plus like I don't know anything about the black market but I'm pretty sure that stuff wouldn't be cheap I don't want to know either the way we've made such progress with the beauty industry and like cruelty free and everything like almost every brand I use is cruelty free except for the fact that they sell in China so someone asked is there products on animals okay phonies China would hop on the bandwagon it would be like you know I just feel like it wouldn't even be a thing anymore like why can't try to just be like yep like we don't need to do this let's just taste makeup when you know fake slabs of skin you know how they like gross skin and lids and stuff like why can't they just use that I don't understand for my powder one of my favorites cover a fix I need a new one this powder is amazing it's a really good droop before the studio skin is it called a studio Skin Foundation by Mac my other favorite but of course Mac does sell in China also it's just like full coverage beautiful finish lasts all day like I'm just obsessed with and this is a powder chiller brush it just takes me eight years like get all the product on my brush like there's just nothing left in here I just like need to throw it away to be honest where are those new Natasha Janata powers I've been dying to use I must be wanting to use this for ages the sculpting glow by Natasha and then the highlight is to which I'll use soon these ones anyway oh actually first on bronze I can't find my hourglass bronzer which is like one of my favorite cruelty-free bronzes okay let's use something at drugstore will New Zealand Australia drugstore this is the chichi light to medium bronzer with yellow undertones now as far as I know this is a cruelty-free brand they say cruelty free all I've got all the cosmetics I'm going to use at the lightest shade because I have ferrule fail skin pale could not fail skin fear I love using this on my eyes to like just in the crease and stuff it's so beautiful thanks seriously look at that color it's just so beautiful like sunkissed I'm obsessed also gonna play some down at my neck

from the Natasha general ad this is the pressed powder I'm just gonna kind of use it just over my cheeks just for a little bit more coverage next up I'm going to use a bronzer brush with the contour shade let's try this out I hope it's an outcall it looks quite dark like I don't know we'll see this is turning into a first impression oh this is actually a beautiful contour shade it looks kind of warm on camera for some reason I don't know why I think it's cuz it's just mixing with the bronzer I'm gonna put on my jaw - I like it it's easy to blend here comes the rain it's been raining every day for like the past two weeks like severe I'm gonna stop there cuz I'm getting carried away because I really like how this is like chiseling my face but next thing I'm gonna have leg too much

cruelty free but a lot of their cruelty free drugstore brands these days according to this website I learned by parent companies that test on animals but this still brands like bitch cosmetics okay my palette color pop Milani makeup geek win wild so this heaps of drugstore cruelty free brain still I'm just using an angled shader brush to blend out this primal I'm gonna use my Shan exploit palette and I'm going to use this shade here to stick to the primer cuz it's just like the perfect kind of all-over color and brow bone highlight color why my blue again okay it's a little bit musing at this Milania eyebrow tinted fiber gel - sits my eyebrows down now okay so I'm gonna do it super dark smoky eyes using a few different brands so first I'm taking my it crease blending brush and going to mix together the yellowish color with this really dark color which I know seems scary I'm taking mostly the yellow with a little bit tiny bit of the darker shade and I'm going to buff it in to the crease just take your time to blend it because it is quite dark just like that remember to hold your brush from a little bit further away when you want to blow out the color and use a really light kind of pressure if you do a heart pretty sure with these dark colors it's gonna make the eyeshadow look patchy so just do a really light handed kind of movement this brush does do most of the work for you because it's a really good kind of buffing brush for your eyeshadows to really blow them out and make them look super blended now I'm taking a little bit of this eyes to mesmerize by Charlotte Tilbury and Mona Lisa and taking a small amount because it's quite pigmented I'm just gonna Pat this all over the eyelid this is a crease detail brush just before icon with the pigment and taking what he was left on my brush and I'm just going to blend into the crease just to make sure that it's all smooth so I don't want any like chunky patches of that cream color you could stop here if you want it to like it's a really nice smoky eye we're gonna go one step further then we're gonna take makeup eight Gargoyle foiled pikmin I've never used this so hopefully it's nice just went everywhere I'm gonna take the same matte crease detail brush I'm actually gonna whit us a little bit with my sitting spray I'm just going to pick that on it the first half of my eyelid up to there in a corner like not on the inner corner bit up to the inner corner with the same brush I'm going back in with that highlight are used and I'm just using on the same brush because I'm just going to pick the tiniest amount could have on top of it just to bring in a hint of pink and then on a pencil brush on a clean one I'm going to put that same product just on the inner corner and then underneath the outer edge of my I'm just taking whatever's left on that crease blender and then a little more yellowy color cuz it goes so well with that pink on my cheeks I'm gonna take a little bit that bronze color from the center of my palate just underneath the eye I'm taking it the middle champagne a highlight color on that inner corner just on top of the pink just on the very inner corner just to brighten oh the lighting just means so crazy on the outer part of my eye I'm taking more at that dot color now I'm taking some of this which is really dried out so I just put some jerilyn on there what a prove-it cream color and Sun see it by Anastacio Beverly Hills and I'm using a winged liner brush okay we're going for something like this this side I've kind of screwed up a little so we'll have to fix it I'm kind of just going up to like two-thirds across and then blending it down into the lash line okay I'm pretty happy with how it's looking so now we're gonna do some lashes these axo Beauty vegan lashes a link down below for you they called the rebel by the way but first mascara this is a whit wild next phonetic cat eye mascara never use this before this is the first time first impression this is the wand that's good to go the one's a little bit awkward but the actual formula is nice it's just I don't I'm not used to this like shape it's really weird but it's making my lashes really long I definitely say it's not curling mascara if you look like side on you can see my lashes are quite straight but they look long if and definitely quite fanned out and separated just popping on at the lashes and I like to just kind of leave them sex I'm not wearing black eyeliner so I want to make sure they're nice and close the lash line I'll just put them on and let them set and stick and then I'll go in and kind of pitch them closer once they've started to stick that makes sense Oh God look okay and now I'm just gonna start pinching this side the mascara is still wet this is taking forever to dry nice and close especially on that in a corner I've got this like one really long eyelashes in the middle what is their doing alright the eye makeup is on okay for the lip liner I'm going to take razor by colour-pop and then I'm taking my ex lip UT matte lipstick in for locally okay my favorite just like everyday color and it is not drying at whatsoever goes on like butter ha I love these

coconut your Fiji their product smells so good except for some reason they irritate my skin so I'll give it someone else I have all of these a face talks mass which you mix together yourself I'm gonna put these in the maybe pile because I've got so I've got like here's everywhere for my hairbrush I've got so many face masks so I just want to kind of see you know what I end up that before I commit I have this soothing and moisturizing by oxygen I actually really like this moisturizer but I'm going to donate it because hit it sitting here for a little while and I don't want to like go off or anything and I've got a couple of my Clinique ones I'm using at the moment and then some others I want to try I have used this in the past I really like it just want to try some new stuff so yeah it's a really good brand just if Yifu Lin the news I love their pumice and hops facial cleanser it's so good I should actually get some more of it we have it this posture makeup breakout cool cleansing well I'm actually going to just get rid of this because it's almost empty and I've got others I like a lot better so I put them in this video I have some baby wipes here which one's gonna keep I hope this cleansing balm by pixi which I've started trying so I might keep this in here just to continue using this is what the packaging looks like we have the circle juju volcanic clay mask I really like that this is what the texture looks like in case you're wondering I've used it a few times it's a really nice and lightweight Jean tool kind of clay mask I have here my lemon sort of blackhead out stick I could do a video on this if you want I like google it just so Schoeneck so lemon soda blackhead and will come up so I'm gonna keep this I did really like I haven't actually used it since that video because I completely forgot about it so I want to keep that because I did like it I have it these blemish patrol at peds and these are by 50 Beauty didn't really love them so I'm going it to give those away hopefully they're still all good they look really moist still pack West I still want to continue trying the Saints do a couple times and quite liked it but it didn't know if it was just me like thinking I was working or if it was really working it didn't make my skin feel amazing I was really cooling so I'm gonna keep trying that asked by dr. Brandt that pores no more vacuum at cleaner this is the problem I just love it skincare so much I feel like I'm just gonna be so attached to half of these and not be able to get rid of them this hair is das food house wonder poor ultra clay at Peck I freaking love Korean face masks if you could not tell at this point you're going to see a lot of them I've actually used a decent amount of this one so I'm gonna keep it because I love it I really need to like trying to almost like one of those project two pans it's it with face must I need to like use my face mask before I buy anymore cuz I've got so many and then I get seen heaps as well which is amazing but you know it's just so many in this money so many I can use for friends I probably do a face mask when I'm being good with my skin yeah I'll probably use a face mask maybe three times a week like a clay type and then I usually try to do two or three moisturizing must as well whether that's just a moisturizing mask and like a true or if it's a sheet mask this here is the trilogy and makeup begone cleansing balm I've used quite a lot of that too so I'm gonna keep that and try to use it up I've got a couple there now and I know I've got more as well like this evil omen cleanse that I actually really like this it makes Mexican feel amazing I'm gonna put that in my drawer of stuff that I want to use because I want to use that up because I've actually run out of my favorite cleanser so I'll use this until that's gone and see how it goes I need to open the window because I'm literally okay I also hit this China by oasis and I was using this because it smelled amazing so so so good I don't know if I should honestly I want to try it because I just love the way it smells and I love the brand but I just don't think I'm gonna give a commit to using a toner so I'll donate this or give it to like a friend or family member because it's a bit grubby with fake tape over it seriously fake Tang is when everything in my bathroom I don't know how I really like this and I think I might use some of this tonight this is the glow revealing liquid peel exfoliant by the body shop I've mentioned this in a favorites video it's really fun to use it's like a liquid and then you kind of just exfoliate it will like rub around on your dry face and it gets rid of weird dull skin so good I have this tan accelerator which is literally just like if you don't know really intense moisturizer it's just super hydrating and people use them before they go out on the Sun to make them get a tan easier cuz they skins more hydrated so I'm gonna keep that just cuz I like to use this a boy so I said this does smell so legit as well oh my god seriously like the best-smelling thing ever I love it but I put some of my like tanning stuff and body stuff on this side I think and then face masks and things on that side okay we have the Ethiopian honey deep nourishing mask by the way shot I love these masks I've only used it quite a couple of times this one literally looks like edible honey look at this like how amazing it smells so good but I am going to donate this because I need to be a little bit cutthroat and I do have another couple of like moisturizing face mask that I love so when we give someone else the opportunity to try this they do like it I'm not saying I don't like it I really do okay what else we have this Aptos shower oil bilipid all I'm gonna keep that and give that a go I think I've tried it once it's just like a really like thin audio oil like a moisturizing body oil and you just chuck it on when you've got damp skin after the shower so I might as well use that up I always find that those oils don't really last that long because I use so much about when I put it on look how filthy this is like you can tell this is old I was literally on this for like three years I think it's about time to throw it away I actually really like this though but yeah it's basically like a tinted moisturizer it's just super old so time to get rid of that but I'll keep this one because this is a good kind of product for the same thing this is the Chi Chi's solarium in a bottle it's just like an instant body bronzed it's shimmery but once you massage it into your skin it's just like a really nice moisturizing oil with a slight tension color actually show you so you put it on looks terrifying but you massage it in and look at that beautiful beautiful glow I probably looked it on my hand for too long usually I would just do like one area put it on my fingers massage it on straight away so it doesn't go Apache okay it's kind of hard to see on camera but it leaves your skin looking a really glowy like not shimmery it just comes off with like soap and water so it's quite good just for like good night is it another one of those body shot mask this is the British Rose fresh plumping mask here's how it looks from the name I'm sure you can completely imagine what it's for it's just kind of like brightening and plumping helps to give a little bit of life back into your skin it good for like more mature skin as well it's very gentle I'm gonna donate that one because I have some manuka dr. ones that do this similar kind of thing that I prefer a little bit more this one however I'm going it to keep but this is the Himalayan charcoal purifying at glow mask kind of a similar idea to glam glow you can see I've used quite a lot of this is a very thick exfoliating kind of texture it makes just going look so bright and clear so yeah I'm gonna keep that and finish that this is a face and body moisturizer by Antipodes I'm gonna get rid of this it's been open for ages I do like it I just find it doesn't soak into my skin as nicely as some of my other moisturizers but it did make Mexican feel really hydrated when I used it it's just not my favorite this here is again absolutely filthy this is by soap &amp; Glory the furminator it's basically supposed to like firm cellulite and stuff which is this really like nothing really does that but I really really like the actual product it's almost as if when you actually look at it you'd be able to tell but it's super minty and like tingly and fresh feeling when you put it on like real cooling it's a bit of way to put it so I'm just going to keep that and continue to use it's probably about half empty anyway so I'll just finish that one off I have this this is brand new so I want to try it this is the black sesame hot mask by skin food yes good food I'll talk about that one yet obviously okay we also have another face oils it's empty no this is the interpret is a divine face oil avocado oil and rose hip and then I have another one how falls this one yeah that one's quite full as well it's the exact same thing so I'm just gonna keep one and donate one my hands are getting so greasy like all these prices are just leaking everywhere okay this one here is plant a rose hit fruit and seed it's serum foot dried add image skin so basically it's just rose hip oil gonna keep that and give it a go cuz I love rose hip oil I haven't used all my skin in a while I've been using sunflower seed oil lately this here there writing has completely come off but you can see the brand is called sky bright this is colloidal silver moisturizer colloidal silver is really good for fighting bacteria and germs and so I use this occasionally a way that I have it really irritated like acne pimple pimple eats getting kind of thing when you know I don't want to use just any other moisturizer I have this sunscreen so I'm going to keep this because they would come in handy what some are coming up and you Dylan we're in springdale it's by Neutrogena and this is really good on the face it's SPF 85 as well which is pretty amazing and then we've got this ring skincare um I bought this while we were in Vegas last me and Hamish cuz Hamish ran out of his favorite cleanse date and he didn't like my cleanser so he really likes this one I'm gonna keep this aside for him to see if he wants to continue using this I liked it didn't love it but I like he really liked it so I have it the bronze shimmer luminous cream by a loving 10 in the shade dark and ultra back I love love love love love this stuff so it's definitely gonna stay it's basically like a tinted moisturizer sparkly gives you like a boost of 10 which is a really good product I was talking before about how I've got other moisturizing and face masks that I really like and this is definitely one of my favorites this is by origins it's the drink up intensive overnight mask so I'm going to keep this it's so good you just literally massage it in like a moisturizer and they leave it on overnight and it's just super thick and nourishing and really just helps me out when I've got really really dehydrated skin this here is josie maran intensive creamy oil the Argan I'm going to give this to my mommy she likes I think she will like it she loves products like this I just don't find too much of a need for it to be honest like personally and I need to bloom and I was a game I literally bloom and I was like eight times we have this Paula's Choice resist hyaluronic acid booster for all skin types it's supposed to plump skin its wrinkles how you use this apply once or twice daily after cleansing toning and exfoliating edy three drops to your favorite moisturizer or Surma I initially tried that because that sounds pretty epic so it just comes with a little drop in drop a drip drop I still love using these when I was like 5 do you remember like you'd have water time we just like play in a water tub with like objects they said these at my like kindergarten anyway that's random it's like super thick gel you're never gonna be able to see that's not gonna focus as there you see it on my finger oh okay some contact lens cleaner I don't need that anymore him blister plasters at our first date camp now I get blisters so badly sometimes hints the reason these are in yet although I don't know why they're in here and not in the first-aid kit maybe anyway I also have this wash off Atlit Ann Braun's instant natural-looking town gonna donate this I think I tried it once and hated it so then I have Lovings hand ultra dark a couple of bottles of this I'm actually running very low on my tan so we have to purchase some more and then I've got this I seek a body low I actually like this again it's kind of like an instant whoops you can kind of see it it's usually thicker but it's obviously just not shaken up it's like this tinted bronzed beautiful moisturizing kind of products actually need to get my energy and properly use all these moisturizers and everything because my skin always looks  to be honest like I always forget to moisturize and everything and then I faked here to forget to moisturize and it just looks crap so quickly so I need to actually you know commit to using moisturizer there's a little travel and tippet ease moisturizer that I got on a plane so I'm going to keep that for travel just because you know if I'm going something just overnight it's quite handy okay another one of the body shop face bar this is the Chinese ginseng and rice clarifying polishing mask in this is a must-have I really really like this one this is how it looks on the inside it reminds me of that it's getting 79 when I have that I love which I'm wondering where it is I think it's on my shop so after organizing it's so true but it's basically like a creamy rice exfoliating kind of mask and it just makes your skin look so bright and feel so smooth and really exfoliated it's so good okay we have some one-night stand self-tanning mist I don't use this often but I am gonna keep it just because it's good to have a mist sometimes just to you know if I want like an extra layer of tan I've already got a fake tan or something like that it's quite handy I also have the Merkel hair treatment by a live in Australia going to keep this because it's like half-empty anyway so I need it just finish using I do like it I don't know if it's my favorite thing you know that I like it I have this ten here which I don't like on my skin it seemed to really grab onto a lot of pitches that my Lovington doesn't grab on to have this blemish acne Jolla by oxygen which I'm going to get rid of because I prefer my like this stuff hold on I've got it up on my shelf this one's pretty much um do this is a treble of body wash so I need to put that in my travel makeup bag it looks like it's dirty but it's not this is like a Smashbox foundation brush but I love it for masks and I'm gonna give these to friends to try it like it but I've got so many oh my gosh I didn't even know I had another one of these I used up one of these like ages ago and I really liked it by Mac surprisingly because I don't usually go for mix Kim kit you know this is a volcanic ash exfoliator and it's actually pretty legit like I really like it make sure it's gonna feel so clean oh there's another one guys this money has the Amazonian acai energizing radiance mask I'm actually know if I've tried this one might actually donate it just cuz I've kept a couple of the other ones that I love oh my gosh it smells so good though but I've got so mean we have the clinic care purity cleansing water by vanilla Co if you want to focus please camera is too bright anyways by banila car this is almost deep do as you can say so I'm going to keep that filthy hair brush which I'm just gonna grab all the loose hair out of so I've got some Saint Moritz and dark I'm gonna keep this and just finish shooting it up I used to love that back in the day do you guys remember back when I first started youtube videos I still always always use that one if you're rich gun remover in here might come in handy for holding I'm just going to put that aside I think I'm gonna get rid of those two instance pink spray stuff and then the last thing I have down on the ground here is this bamboo smooth anti breakage thermal protectant spray I really like this it's just as it sounds it's like thermal protectant spray the heat tools but it's kind of more like a creamy formula so I usually squid into my hands and then massage it through my head like that I've also got my Clinique face washer thing I'm gonna give this to a friend I really really like this mention doesn't like a favourites me oh my gosh it's so bright and then I've got this cast oil which I'm just gonna put in here two for now because I might find it useful for that even though as I said I'm using my sunflower oil on my face and skin in here and stuff at the moment yeah so as you can see we've got a tuna mass here get my awesome to get and really start committing to using my face mask more often like when I used to daily vlog I used to use masks all the time because it was like something to add to my blogs and like you really don't know just a difference with your skin when you use face masks but yeah like we have been really really lazy with my skin care to be honest because I've just not been feeling the best I guess like immediately so at the end of the day I'm just like oh I should really use them because they do actually make you feel better as well they mentally you know they're so much fun and it just feels nice to pamper yourself so there's that now I'm gonna go through my everyday stuff even though technically most of this should be pretty good okay so once again I'm just going to first empty out the straw and then we'll go from there okay I believe it or not that's as clean as we're going to get that it's got so many stains in it okay first off I have the city lips what is this pumping like gloss thing I really like this I use it at night too sometimes and it kind of helps to hydrate my lips as well I have it these Beauty bakery lip lip remover wipes they're really good fill up in eyes so I'm going to keep those Moisture Surge extended thirst relief and then I also have the makeup take the day off farm which I really really like sorry I'm gonna swap it I'm gonna put this away and that drunks just cleaning out and we swap it with the one that I've used Heat's off just so I can get through that one first and then go back to it this trilogy one because yeah this one's like hoppin three semis we'll get fit finish hit this eyelash that I was trying so let me see what it was like compared to revitalash I don't know I still love something here what is that but I won't show my eyebrow in there and then this is your eyelash the pink button for breast cancer awareness it's another reason I love revitalash like it works amazing that we also donate I have this who sheep no fishy-fishy rescue bomb I make up that to Mum as well she'll probably like that and have this epsilon care ho ho about facial serum which is really good for acne it's like a really watery kind of serum it's different to just like herbal oil it's got a few different ingredients in it as well and I really like to mix that in with my moisturizer and stuff what I've got really bad pimples we've got my detox mask by T me which I've talked about in sponsorships before sorry if you can hear the dogs barking I love this so much I'm actually being reaching for this all friggin time you can see I've used so much sorry remember they're in the other drawer and I was cleaning out before I've got my Danish skin care what she saw my skincare routine my smooth skin treatment I thought this juliek rudeness rescue moisturize I'm gonna get rid of this one I tried it out but I prefer my Clinique one so much more and then I love this mask I'm gonna keep this clarifying it like another use or two out of this even though it looks pretty much yours this differently quite a lot through here this is the Antipodes or I'm gonna come muñeca money make a honey mask and it is so good it's so nourishing it helps to fight breakouts while still moisturizing your skin so it's super gentle it amazing I love this for the daytime sometimes especially if I'm going to be out in the Sun specifically because it's SP 50 it's just like a tinted sunscreen kind of product I'll put on my moisturizer and put on this as well this is another moisturizer mask I love just like my what was the other one I showed you origins I think this is the Clinique Moisture Surge it's like the exact same thing it's so good this has got a little bit left as well for my other mini me trying out this in that time sometimes and I do a quite like it so I'm gonna keep this for now and continue to cover to go spike which is the micro what a complex and I live cream it's just super super hydrating so I don't know if you can see how much I've used I've been using it a bit and you only make the tiniest tiniest amount it's so like literally it feels kind of watery it's really weird like it just feels so hydrating it's so quite luxurious you know I have this blemish stick which I like to use during the daytime sometimes by which it's actually really good at just completely like it dries out your breakouts yeah I like that one I have some inner coil which is really good for broadcast as well this is by living at nature so they continue to try that out my little tweeze them in facial dermaplane I think this is really good too the sebum that clearing must by Dermalogica really good for when you have oily skin or breakouts or anything like that we have a head-turner which i got from where did I get it from here plus soot it's me so I need to try that at some stage I have it this cure boat Tenneco slay and player fishing hymnist I really like this term to start realizing this it doesn't make you a boss or something it helps to make my hair feel and smell nice and fresh when I'm going in between washes we must finish this one so that can go at down below as well at the front serums if you use this one first this is my evil oh it's purifying it clay mask it's quite good as you can tell so I've used quite a lot of a epilator and I've got this boy milk which is finger well this hand cream as well like I said don't really use hand cream but I'm gonna keep this one just in case but this carbon cocoa I bought this myself I know everyone sponsored by Dean but I want to try it and we actually used it in ages because of my visit line but I do want to keep that and try that later I'm so finished these are my blades for my gym of play-doh I need this right now maybe that's inhaler the top bench got this teeth whitening P and I'm gonna keep as well from Tarte just to keep trying man like I said before this face cleanser they eat long I've got this Mac lip scrub which I'm not the biggest fan of I prefer the lush one so I'm going to get got this real you face gel I wasn't like massively blown away but in Thai range but I really really like this when I've got breakouts it's so nice and then I've got a moisturiser here this is the hot chocolate body butter by Bambang and then I like to keep us in here so remember to use that this is rican extremely sila it's for breakage and like split ends and stuff you might have seen that my recent huge

hey everyone it so today is my letter sweety clothing loaded up the videos show old towel video holy freakin crap I'm so excited to be filming this video right now okay so if you follow me on Instagram you know that I have my own clothing line coming out today in fact so I'll list all the links down below of course I have shown you some sneak peeks on my social media so today's video is just going to be all about my clothing line how it came about I'm going to show you what everything looks like on and just talk about everything I am so excited so I have been working with white box boutique on this clothing lines quite a long time now so it's so exciting that I can finally show you guys everything and talk about it and you guys can actually get it it's really exciting I've never done any kind of clothing before I haven't done merch or anything like that so this is really really really cool it's different and hopefully you guys really like everything so I'm just going to talk a little bit about the process first before I show you all the items so as you guys know straight off the bat white fox we take this one of my favourite online clothing websites I have been shopping with the white fox fishing for years now and I've also been working with white box boutique for years now you know we worked on videos together in the past but most importantly it's one of the websites that I shop on personally all the freaking time I just love their stuff I love the customer service it's fast shipping like it's just a really good website so I was really excited to collaborate with Denver for my first clothing line and I feel like myself in whitefox boutique you know we have this similar kind of vibe with similar style we've got similar visions and things so they were definitely the perfect company to work with on this line in saying that every single thing in my clothing line is custom designed as custom styles you know we haven't just taken some random item and put my name on it or anything like that like this is us which they set down a year ago and designed everything the owners of what flops to take time over to Palmerston North so it was really nice to meet them in person so I've never met them before and then they bought over one of the air like fashion designers and we just set there and chatted and talked about you know my style there you knew my style and we just talked about you know like what kind of pieces I wanted to put out there so everything in this clothing line I think is very chantix I like I think every single thing I put on you got to be like yeah thank you so you like my style I think you will be all about this collection and I definitely think there's like something for everyone when we sit down and we're designing the collection I also kind of chose separates and colors that were really me as well I think you guys will agree like the colors are quite on trim no very basic like different black and white there's some denim and then just some really neutral colors like really on trend pieces that I think will slightly in your body and everything is really easy to style which is important to me because I get really lazy with my sessions sometimes I just want to check something on and I want it to look you I don't want to mess around like mixing and matching different pieces together I just want it all to look good you know so once we had to XY's everything picked up some fabric discuss colors and everything like that we went back and forth many many many times obviously trying on the fit adjusting the first thought was really flattering adjusting the fabrics where needed changing the colors slightly just make sure that everything was super perfect so it has been a really long process when we were actually like initially talking about this collection we were initially going to try and chat around at Christmas time late December 2016 and you can see it oh that was a quite long time ago so we really wanted to make sure everything was absolutely perfect the fence the colors the fabrics like the quality all had to be perfect and we got there so so pleased with it all if you couldn't tell I'm a bit excited so without further ado I think we should just jump in and I think I should show you everything so really excited by the way I hid a fake ten disaster great timing right I tried out a new think ten and it was like okay on my body like you know like that's okay and then you look at my hands except I don't know by the way they're pressing it check out the website down below the link to the collection down below you can see all of the prices and for the sizing we are starting with extra small to extra large this is so important you guys we don't want you guys to miss out so if you are a different size outside of those sizes if you guys are in love and you want it in a different size comment down below let us know what your size is let us know what piece you would love you know for example if it's like the t-shirt let us know and let us know what size you are so we get enough demand for that particular style we can you know order some more a different we just need the demand so please please please leaving or so don't want you guys to miss out okay now get on to the showcasing let's start with what I'm wearing right now also by the way whitefox boutique does ship worldwide so this is available to every single one of you out there so I am currently wearing the okay my thought here dress so it's like a t-shirt dress and look how freaking cute this is this is freaking cute so this just comes in black I just love the black because it's really easy to dress up or down like obviously you can just wear it as is around the house out to get the groceries it's super cute you can just check on some converse or something like that it cuts off it just above the knee like it's really flattering links and I also think it looks really cute when you not the bottom I love it to wear this with the Lois lace-up boots which are these babies right here these are well-worn have been wearing these non-stop how it's freaking to you today is basically they are just a lace-up boot as you would expect from the names look how cute it's even got the shinnok's or white balls on the inside so yeah this outfit here is just like a dream come true I think it's really cute to go out and about check on a denim jacket it's such a cute look so this is like a perfect date night kind of piece and I love the sleeves they're a little bit longer so CANSEC kind of like relaxed fit which I'm really a big fan all and a fabric is sort of freaking soft you guys like it is just so comfortable like seriously I would love in mess if I could also with my shinnok's of white fox collection we did collaborate with make collections to create four different pieces of jewelry because as you guys know I love my like dainty layering necklaces and things so I'll show you those in a second too but this is the first one actually wore this recently and got so many compliments and questions everyone was like where is it from this is the XO layered choker so it comes with the black choker part obviously and then there's really glistening a glittery chain like you just like hit to like so nicely and then this one here which almost has like little leaves like here's a little close-up like it's just so it's so stunning so the accessories look at the label so this is on all the clothes look a cute me so here is a brand new one of what I'm wearing the actual little tag has white fox and XO so freakin cute so that is the first necklace niklas is called the X or diamante drop so it's a drop necklace it's double is so like a triple layer and then it has this drop design with this cute little budge on the bottom and then is totally covered in little dome antes it's so cute definitely my style I love it drop necklaces like this so I'm all about it and they look really cute when you wear plunging neckline as well the next one is the expo multi chain the last time I wore this outfit today I got so many compliments as well this one I think will be so so popular or I'm showing it to backwards so again this one is a multi layered it's got a couple of similar kind of chains is the one I'm wearing now which keeps disappearing behind my skin dress right now but this one also features a little X oh and a ring and then another draw so pretty again it looks so secure if you pair it up with a plunging neckline or even just a t-shirt if you want to dress it up like what I'm wearing right now you'll notice everything silver because as you guys know I've definitely with silver a lot more often than gold so I wanted to just kind of stick with what I know you know what I mean although I do really think that these would look super cute and gold as well to me I don't know if you feel like silver is more wearable for daytime and you can also run at night the last piece of jewelry is a body chain and naturally because I love my body chain so it comes like this so it'll come nice and you know not tangled it is called the XO body chain and this will be easier to show you once it's actually on but it's super delicate and super dainty I put a couple of those little rings and then once again it has the little X or dangly bits on the edge of the clasp the actual chain is just so it glimmery and it's just so beautiful like these really really do dress up your outfit they're not just any chain like the chains just absolutely shine I'm obsessed with a story on to the rest of the clothing so let's start with this because you guys have already seen me wearing it in my Instagram and never have I ever seen as so many compliments on the t-shirt so this is my copy polity it comes in white because I love a white tee because I love how they look with just denim jeans or black jeans or a cute skirt like they're just so easy to style so as you guys know how people that is basically a phrase that I use all the time and people always always always talk about they're like yeah I started saying can't be bothered because of you the time just like my phrase you know can't be bothered just we put it on a t-shirt so this is very like murky I think and I think this will be super popular especially for all of those of you who have started seeing this phrase all the time I just think it's so cute so yeah I'm a huge fan of this piece sometimes I'll tuck it into like a skirt or something like that or like denim high-waisted shorts or sometimes I will just notch the bottom and then kind of wear on top of some high-waisted jeans I think that looks really really flattering it is so easy to wear obviously it's a white tee anyone can pull this off absolutely anyone next up is a bodysuit and this fabric is so freakin amazing it really sucks you in in all the right places and make sure the silhouette looks so beautiful it just really emphasizes your curves it's amazing this is the bodysuit and as you can see it's very stretchy so it's going to be a lot easier to show you once it's actually on the body but it's really flattering it's super exciting and there's heaps happening you don't really need to wear a necklace with this like all you need is like a black body calm skirt and you're good to go this looks really cute also if you layer it underneath like a black sheer t-shirt or something like that because the stretch just show through it's really really cute or you can just check it on underneath a leather jacket and it looks super better it's really important to me to have a bodysuit in my collection because I just wear body suits all the time and I just think this is super super cute this is called the go-to is good because it is my go-to skirt is a beautiful sandy kind of color and the fabric is kind of like a faux suede beautiful soft fabric and it features a crisscross design down the front and then it features a silver zip up the back I really like to look exposed zips so that was important to me and there's not much else is there really I'm obsessed with this it's got the day or night I especially loved it during the day with a cute little crop top denim jacket it looks super super cute speaking of crop tops this does not scream at my name I don't know what does this is the obsessed lace cami and it is so so beautiful let me show you closer so you can kind of see the texture and pattern it's got this like exposed lace it's so delicate and so beautiful and these really nice straps as well like everything about this I am obsessed with I love the kind of cable look of these kind of stress so we did a double strap this is the back right here it's going to be hard for you to see if it's got these little like buttons up the back it's so beautiful delicate and just super classy looking once again this is perfect for day or night maybe a lot like in every day where Ison but you know if you're going to like a daytime festival or something like that it's so so perfect perfect for layering or perfect just to pair up with your favorite pair of shorts or skirt or whatever you want to do so proceed I'm obsessed with this I would love to see this I'm like a black or a pink or something as well but I went white because I just love white crop tops simple as that now that the sun's vanish you can see the button detailing up the back it's also lined it so it's not see-through which is really nice the next item these are so me I'm obsessed I love the color change the color a couple of times I wasn't quite happy with it and so happy with the shape the shape goes with so many different things which sounds really random because it's like the peachy kind of pink color it's a very muted color it's all it's really good day or night by the way these are called the legit shorts they're just a really nice kind of tailored short with a little strip at the front and for the style I chose a kind of conceal the zip so you can't do this the bet by the way I forgot to show you the label on the insides look how freaking cute okay anyway this color I'm so so happy with it looks amazing with white black denim so many different things hello the lighting just keeps changing on me anyway that's the real color there that's perfect this color is perfect so it looks super cute with almost anything I even just love these with a plain white tee so cute they're so easy to dress up or dress down they're just essential they are legit and then who would I be without some denim we have a denim jacket and denim shorts and you can pair these up and actually looks freaking too when you wear both of these together for a double denim look or obviously just wear them separately I do both sometimes I do W them and then sometimes you know I just style them by themselves so we first had the exposure stripped denim jacket.this is so it to you and I've been wearing this like crazy every time I've gone on a holiday a trip I've traveled like this comes with me I were all the time in my daily life I were everywhere I've actually had so many questions and vlogs on Instagram social media snapchat like people asking where is your denim jacket from and I've just hit ignore people because I couldn't announce it yet but now now you know I'm a look how cute this is so the buttons if you look real closely oh my god however do it so it is just an oversized dinner jacket got the strew thing which will serve it's very on-trend it even looks super cute with what I'm wearing right now just like chapped on top of any outfit day or night it is so essential this is probably my favorite piece from the whole collection maybe can I say that everything is my favorite I'd say it's my most worn there you go most one and then it's EXO distressed denim shorts these are super cute so many pairs of shorts that I buy online are super short they show your butt or they're too distressed or they're true this or to that I just wanted a simple pair of denim shorts that'll go with anything these will I came up with a gimmick or the two little shinnok's or button so there is the front super cute stitching and in the back has a little bit more distressed action going on and then there are cast which I love I love the look at these I think they look super sweet and they just show off your look so nicely I'll go with anything absolutely anything crop tops t-shirts whatever you want to do so wearable so cute not too short you know what I mean and then if you want a little bit shorter which sometimes sometimes better I'll just like roll them up a little who would I be if I didn't create a couple of like places not myself that's for sure this right here is the India romper I will this out for dinner and it was just so super cute no war it was like a black blazer on top it looks super formal interesting but you can also wear this casually if you check on some converse check on like a leather jacket on top like its surface is versatile as well it's got off the shoulder like little baggy kind of ruffles they're not tight or anything they're super relaxed and super like I don't know just like slowly it's got the crossover belt which is going to be almost impossible for you guys to see until it's on but it's got this little crossover belt you kind of that that you tie up around your waist and then it's got a little like pleated bit which kind of goes along wrong it's going to be too hard to explain you cannot see anything right now so just look at me trying it on okay it's super cute super versatile I'm obsessed with it and I love off-the-shoulder as you guys know so I had to have something off the shoulder I think is that one is going to be super popular as well it's so good for like clubbing and stuff like that as well going backwards to something a little bit more casual again this I could also live in it is so cozy and comfortable the color as soon as we're looking at fabrics and colors I've like this right here this color needs to be in something this is the abettor lace-up tee it's got lace up on the shoulders of course I love lace it's one of my favorite trends so I had to have it somewhere so up their shoulders and arms is a lace-up design with little rose gold it kind of hoop it's super relaxed once again and it's just a t-shirt dress and I love this fabric it's kind of like that jumper kind of fabric it's so soft so cozy once again you can totally dress this up for nighttime wear it with some heels and some jewelry and like you know rocket otherwise obviously it's super cute for casual I wear this more often for casual but it's super versatile once again as I said in the beginning like I explained everything in my collection to be quite versatile easy to wear because that's just my style like I'm very effortless with my style this color is just life like how beautiful is this color it's going to flush up all of you and I saved one of my favorites for last so this I'm so happy with this okay we actually need to change this so many times because we just weren't happy la with a changing one thing right now change it back change this now no just trying so many different color combinations and fabrics and things but we finally nailed it this is the sort cute romper and it's so it's going to lace up kind of front to it again you're going to get to see this bill went to actually try it on it's got the lace up front it's got how cropped like just see flurry kind of sleeves to where we go you can see between the sliding and you can see the fabric is so beautiful so to share on the arms and a little bit down the very bottom of the legs but then it does have a layer so it's not completely see-through it cinches in at your waist I love the scalloped kind of lace detailing on the legs to get into it you've got your little concealed as if at the back edge you want to keep it completely white because I feel like this would look super cute if you paired it up with heaps of gold jewelry or silver jewelry or you know just keep some hits of jewelry and earrings and fun stuff so I didn't want to put a colored zip there so it was kind of limiting your options you know so concealed zip and it's just so so beautiful so effortless day or night I think this will be perfect for festival season check it on with your favorite shoes oh it's just so so beautiful I'm obsessed with this so that is everything I'll put the link to my collection down below go check it out shipping worldwide don't forget there is anything

to you soon [Music] 
hello pretty people so today I am doing a get ready with me to check get rid of with me I'm using my shake so the remix pellet I'm actually filming this before you guys even know about this I'm like in the future right now yeah I'm doing a look with this pellet so hopefully you guys enjoy it I don't even know what look I'm gonna go for today but something quite glam as you can hopefully tell I have a face mask on right now this is the manuka dr. peel-off mask it's always hard like try to find the first edge okay here we go yeah it's a bit thick on this side usually it peels off really nicely with these bits just here I just use a wet cloth and just wipe it off it comes right off same kind of thing if I get it stuck in my eyebrow or in my hair up here you just use a wet towel I mean like a whip flannel face cloth um and it'll just come right off okay I just got back the lighting is a little different it looks like it's about the rain outside what's new but this mask literally makes my skin glow like it looks photoshopped obviously my skin's uneven my bare skin the actual like finishes my skin it just glows like I love this mask so much anyway moving along I am going to I'm just gonna go straight in with my base first so I'm gonna start with a one jelly PEC to prime this is the second time I'm using this the first time was in that full face first impression and I surprisingly really liked it feels like a face mask by the way I did moisturize just before with my Clinique Moisture Surge I think it's called you know the one I have fake tan on so hopefully this works out okay I'm going to use a little bit of my Fiji Beauty 130 Pro filter soft matte foundation the strays darkest so it's gonna look real pale but should dry hopefully the right shade hopefully is when I wore this made in no fake tan on it was well and truly too dark I list my first impression for this foundation down below if you want to go watch it I'm using my flawless finish sponge-on I can't remember if I said that I love the sponge so much and the sponge doesn't so I got too much product it's ever so slightly firmer than the Beauty Blender it's still soft if yours feels a little bit harder when you get it just make sure push through it just make sure you need it with the water like have some warm water running and just kind of need with your fingers damn it and squeeze it out and then you should be good to go okay hopefully that'll dry to a really good shade for me the fake tan is fresh and still developing as well so it's a little bit tricky but I think once we have on the rest of our makeup there look perfect then applying my I would say current favourite concealer this is the color pop no filter concealer in the shade light 20 today I'm just going to conceal under my eyes with this a little bit over my freckles this concealer is just bomb if you haven't tried it I definitely suggest you go to go it's so cheap to sit under my eyes I'm using some a bisque by bare minerals and this is a shimmer Chula brush and then on the rest of my face to set everything I'm using my studio fix powder in its e30 it's using a nice big powder brush okay now I'm going to do my eyebrows quickly and today I'm going to use my tat taupe Amazonian clay waterproof and brow Latin boosts I'm using an eye definer brush which is like a little flat brush if you can see you can definitely see I know why but in my camera I look really patchy and in real life I really don't like I am 100% said and I don't look their bitch in real life so I don't know if it's coming to review guys just ignore that least I'm taking some of my high brow it glow by benefit and I'm just gonna shop it up under my brows I'm just gonna shop in this face I'm just using a little crease detail brush to smooth that out and then finishing off with that gimme brow in shade three this just kind of brings a little bit of life back into my eyebrows kind of like highlights those hairs again makes them look nice and thick I don't like the look of two perfect brows on myself so the gimme brow just kind of volumizes the natural hairs I have to make my eyebrows look a little bit more here again and I'm just gonna put on some of this city slicker tinted oil by Tomica this is in the shade Rose now going back into the shake so the remix this one is one of my samples from the packaging samples but the eye shadows are all you know this is them you guys have probably seen the colors by now if you watched my launch video I'll list it down below cuz I would have done a launch video by now so weird filming this in Reverse anyway I'm gonna take a little of the shade at niju which is the top middle Brown just the perfect brown shade for in the crease just like a really good transition shade all over the lid I'm just taking the tiniest amount and buffing that all over with a blender brush I'm just kind of building it up a little now I'm going to go in with the shade misty with a crease blender brush and I'm going to pop that right into the crease also I'm just kind of using a really soft pressure on the brush I love this color so much it's so beautiful I'm kind of putting out on my inner and outer corner as well and then just going back in with my first blender brush to make sure the edges are really soft now I'm just flipping over the palette and going in with the shade at terracotta just gonna apply that to the inner and outer edge with the same brush just buffing that in really well gosh I love this color so you can just see that beast ishe kind of peeking through and it's just like really warm there's like some red and purple in there cuz bisti is almost like a bit of a warm purplish kind of shade is really pretty like really unique and I'm using some sin I should our prime a potion by urban decay just so Matt very and a bit I mean middle bit of my eyelid I'm just using that crease detail brush again to kind of blend it out and then taking the shade at drinko which is like a joker and peach patting that on top and then kind of bleeding those edges a little and I'm gonna take a tiny bit of ambient on my crease detail brush just pop that right on the outer corners and then just one more time with the blending brush just to make sure it's all seamless I want it to be quite soft even though it's quite dramatic just like that really blended look I'm going in with the shade of Holy Grail that's my crease detail brush again I'm also gonna place that color right on the inner corner and then again the shade at bisti we're just gonna run that underneath the lash line I just love how soft this looks it's so pretty and then a little bit of neat you want to blend a brush just on that out of age like maybe they oughta half just buffing that in bring it a little bit lower to really make it quite smoky by the time you put on lashes it'll balance it out in the waterline I'm going to apply this and it's free gel eyeliner and this is in the shade I don't know it's in Korean and then I'm going to do some winged eyeliner say I haven't done it in a while this is the matte liquid liner by next this is running out and it's stressing me out okay I've got the em cosmetics one now hopefully this is good it actually is good so yeah I like this I think it's really good it's quite black too and love this eye makeup okay lashes now I am using it the arts to kill Giorgio Armani mascara I shall do it the bottom lashes in a moment first I'm going to put on some lashes and use these about four times and look how amazing they still look while I'm filming this video they are not out yet they are being made at the moment so coming soon props still think I will lost my dark lash glue which kind of really annoys me so I'm just gonna use that the clear since I've used these a few times they fit my eye shape perfectly that lash glue is obviously still drying but I'm gonna take the feathered and one mascara by Marc Jacobs for my bottom lashes which is drying out next step I'm taking the CIJ Palm Island bronzer I'm going to use a domed of fiber brush with this I've never tried it I just really like the look at the color ooh that's so nice to blend and now the lighting is just playing games with me again now I'm going to contour with my pro glow and a bronzer brush and then I'm going to use the same brow bone color that I used to my brow bone this one right here is my highlighter using a DS Hale fiber brush okay now for the lips to finish off the entire look I just want to keep it really simple I think I'll do like a light pink or something just to kind of flatter the eyes I'm gonna try on the shade and naughty by colour-pop which I mentioned in a favorites video a little while ago I'd really appreciate if the lighting would stop changing and then just because my fake tan hasn't developed as fast as my face it's gone dark I'm just going to use some of this this is my little trick I like to use the Laura Gullah body or frosting Tahitian glow all over face and body glow just with a big powder brush I don't know if you can still get those I bought this so long ago looks like I haven't even touched it and then I just kind of dust it over it just goes like a bronzed glow okay and now it's kind of too dark I cannot win today you know what whatever so there we have the final look I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you did it don't fit to it thumbs up here's a little close-up over the eye makeup so pretty a lovely kind of like rose gold warm vibes of it I just love that color as a highlighter as well like if I want something that's a little bit more blinding I go for this so yeah thank you guys so much for watching I will link everything I used down below if you like always and Antonis time talk to you guys soon I [Music]

Sephora so I will of course link everything down below with links and blah blah blah blah blah so you can check them out if you are interested so thank you Sephora for working with me on it this video is sponsored a Sephora when it makes favorite on my website as you guys already know make sure you can buy on the hashtag and your at Sephora to keep up to date with all the new releases and everything as well so let's dive in and get started some of the stuff looks really pretty I have kind of unwrapped it from the bottle rep and everything but I'm trying everything for the first time today actually that's a lie I did fill my stuff using this just before I started filming this video as you can see I've already got my face on just so I can kind of put on the other products while I go and not waste too much time so the first thing that I got tint from Sephora other near huda beauty tweeze them in tweezers and these are so legit they are really good you guys I just use them to tidy up my eyebrows so a lot of people kind of asked me how I maintain my eyebrow shape I just use tweezers and I just pluck away any stray hairs from underneath and on top of my eyebrows just to keep them looking really tidy I kind of keep my natural shape and you just get like underneath square any little stray hairs pop up these are so sharp you guys like sort of it's so sharp I got so many hair down but I never know where they're so yeah these are called the tweezer men if root of beauty limited edition net tweezers as you can see they've got some really cute little prints of some lips on there that pink and the middle is hot pink the outside is like a lighter pink I just think they look so pretty if you're not familiar with beauty critic a ton of her beauty is just like a PDF so she's a beauty blog I follow her on Instagram she's beautiful and she knows a lot of stuff about makeup so such a cool collab okay next up I haven't actually tried this today because this is a product that you apply at night and then by the tiny wake up in the morning it basically makes your skin look nice and plump radiant fresh is it Laneige water sleeping it must for all its skin here's how it looks you get 70 Miller product and I open it up and try it out on my and see how it feels okay so this is what the picture was like facial really pretty packaging it's like frosted kind of glass open it up it does have a security seal okay so to be honest lately I have been loving gel what kind of textures like this when they hear a new villain and my skin it gets so dehydrated and just dull looking and I find that these Joel textures are super super nice just to kind of reach I just going to make it look really vibrant and glowing again it feels service to the cool to the touch this is how it looks by the way it's just like a gel so basically you put it on at night before bed leave it on and it just works overnight to kind of recharge your skin and make it feel really nice and soft okay this sounds amazing because I love any mask I've got swatches on I love any kind of muss it kind of gives my skin a glow I get really dull skin it feels really really nice as you can see it's sort of in completely it's almost just like a moisturizer oh my gosh I'm so intrigued by this I can't wait to try it out this impression it feels so sort of slow soft and super cooling I can't emphasize enough how cooling it feels like it's super super refreshing feeling okay there's one more skin care product in here and it is a face mask also this is by Clinique and as you guys know I've been really enjoying clinic lately I'm excited to try this this is the clinic peps double bubble purifying mask so I have it used bubble mass in the past and they are really really fun it said here allergy tested 100% fragrance free Apep rush for skin Britain even layer of your clean face leave it off for two minutes and watch the masks transform into a blanket of tiny debris lifting bowls I'm going to try this on my hand and we're going to see if it works obviously I've already got my foundation on so I'm not using all my face but let's give this a go oh it's pink look so this is supposed to kind of exfoliate away any dead skin cells and purities the bubbles are supposed to kind of like help lift away those kind of imperfections so I'm just going to spread it out on at my hand like you work with your face so you can see it just going to goes into a clear layer doesn't feel sticky if it's really smooth and kind of slippery and suppose I get oh my gosh it's working already like immediately I've had this on to literally like 30 seconds and it's going nuts already I think this would be perfect for before makeup like your skin just need a little bit of extra exfoliation I thought wasn't feeling very smooth or something dude perfect to prick your skin before makeups that doesn't take long either two minutes most v marks you leave on you know 10 to 15 minutes at least so two minutes is people look at their you can see at their site on don't my mate terrible effect and by the way it feels really really fresh it's very cooling once again like it's making my hands like feel really really ice-cold super super refreshing another reason why I would probably feel really good in the morning before you do your makeup just like wake yourself up I'm just going to massage it oh it feels really creamy when you're massage it after it's been a bubble Club it's actually helping to remove those lip swatches that I hit on my hand okay so obviously I'm moisturized but that Tyler's compared to my other hand thus and obviously is the one that I had the bubble mask on it actually don't look really fresh and it helped to remove my fake ten and the lip swatches - okay so I'm really impressed it actually did like lift off the crap off my hands it's quite impressive I'm excited to try this out on my face if you guys want to see me like talk about a little bit more let me know because maybe I could do like a little snapchat like face mask video and like to see how it works on my actual face and give you a little review okay on to the makeup so there are a few new makeup protests this one is the one I am most excited about is called the Smashbox create and transform at masterclass palette and this is how it looks like in the box obviously so this basically comes with four different pellets inside bit and one pallet then you can remove the pallets so you can travel with it so a Transformers contour and cheek a shadow and lip colors so inside this is how what the palette looks and then it opens up of course and you get before palettes like I said and actually kinds of transformer shades as well and this little palette here which are supposed to transform the other shades if that makes sense so you'll be able to create a huge amount of different looks with this one palette okay so I am going to start with this at this shade right here it's called it anode Russian it straight in to my crease to give some dimension okay so first impression they are blending out super easy will the colors blending out too breezy it's a really nice transition shade perfect to my skin tone I'm also going to take some of this just underneath my lashes on the blunt lash line okay now let's try a bit of color I'm going to take the purple shape which is called at plumbing and I'm going to start applying it to the outer corner and at the outer half of my crease once again this colors really easy to blends like it's really effortless and then I'm just going to run out the outer half of my lower lash line on both okay I've got like a few lip shades from Sephora and so I'm going to use those today no idea what colors they are haven't even opened them up yet so we're going to keep this I look quite smoky and kind of neutral just so that if we look color suits it I'm loving how this is looking so far those two colors look really nice together now I'm going to take it to shade washed out which looks like a stunning light kind of pinky and nude color this is the first shimmer I'm trying so loose see how it looks going on my inner corner it's really pretty it's not as shimmery as I thought obvious almost like a wash of shimmer but if you want it more shimmery you can just layer it up a little these I should have a very user friendly I think if you are a beginner or obviously if you've got to make up as well you'll love these colors but just if you're a beginner these eyeshadows formulas are really easier to work with they're buildable days easy to blend they still have a really good level of pigmentation I'm taking a little bit of that darker Brown I'm just going to kind of intensify the crease all the way in this is a more that purple on the outer corner and they're using another brush to blend it out make sure there's no harsh lines this toggle is giving me life so wearable now I'm just going to use the shade of vanilla which is the plain netcode brow bone highlight color and going to use it for that purpose as well I'm just going to carve out into my brow bone now I'm going to try a couple of these at transform at shades so you can use these on top of the other eye shadows to kind of transform them into something new so I'm going to take a bit shade here which is called strange of magic it's like a light pinky kind of color going to take this on my inner corner oh my gosh that's pretty it almost goes like a pinky kind of throwback jewel chromis it I'm just going to put there on my inner corners I'm going to take of this first shader which is called the witch and that's going to go on my brow bone I use the same brush just to make my eye makeup glow a little more and then on my lid I'm going to take a little bit of the shade it's filtered it's like an orangey kind of golden matte color it's going to pack a little bit of that on the middle of my eyelid oh my gosh there's pretty it just makes the I may have glow that gives a whole lot more shimmer to oh my gosh okay that's my favorite one there's also a couple of it cheeks transforming as well so we'll give one of them a go sound moving along it to the contouring cheeks a little palate let's start by bronzing so this is the bronzer color right here so it's just a nice warm at bronzer I like warm bronzers just to give my face a little bit of color especially when to wind I look washed out so that is how the bronzer looks so far so good now I'm going to try at the contour shade oh this is your really nice contour shade perfect kind of like grayish undertone to it so it really looks like a or okay for blush today I think I'm going to go maybe this one here this one here is called guava not something I would normally go for so I'm excited to try it out I'm just going to stay with a small amount of my brush just because I don't know what the pigmentation is like I don't want to apply too okay yeah that's very pigmented and don't want to apply too much and then the highlight of course is the light color it looks like a really nice kind of buttery beige color and it is not shimmery so that where the Transformer shade will come in I am assuming so I'm just going to apply that on the top of my cheekbones so it does actually breath and look at that but it's not shimmery what Soviet is like really really mad now we're going to amp it up with a transformer I'm going to use actually one of the eye shades because I don't listen to the roof this one here I think which is called it dial up and I'm going to put that right on top that's really pretty and seeing that I'm going to try some of it this transformer just here this one is called it fuse blowing put a little bit on top because they're really nice kind of golden Sheen to my cheek personally I think I would use it these shades mostly on the eyes I think on the eyes they look so good on the cheeks I quite like how it looks without the transformer but it's just personal preference this definitely my most good look super glowy dollar and then the last palette is the lipstick color but I'm going to try the other lipsticks I got sentence did the last thing I have hair in my little new at Sephora box Avenue by beauty liquid at lipsticks there's a little liquefied at left they come in 12 creamy supersaturated super pigmented shades so I'm excited to try these out I've got four shades here I have a demi-glace caramelized wet and chutney these also have monoi butter and coconut oil in them to make them as super hydrating all of these shades actually look super super wearable so I might do a little mini lip swatch and try them all on with this eye makeup this is not the packaging looks like you've got a little bit color swatch it down at the bottom and then their own like a matte kind of rubbery feeling tube and they are square they're really classy looking so first I'm going to try on it caramelized oh they smell so good that is so pigmented the filling of these they kind of feel like they go on sticky but when you rub your lips together they feel really really smooth I think it's just like the thick texture they're quite thick they don't feel sex they apply thick they feel lightweight on your lips this is really weird I love it the finish of these we've got that soft kind of gloss to them so this shade here once again is called a caramelized they apply so easily I love the applicator which is a nice little daughter I have heaps of control with that one next up is the shade wet looks like this oh my gosh this color this looks so perfect with this eye makeup it's super flattering the perfect everyday nude they feel so comfortable on the lips it's a really strange formula though you really have to go swatch it for yourself and try it out and the smell is so pleasant it's not super sweet or anything like that it's like really refreshing it's really strange I've never smelled anything like this almost like pizza monkey did not pit them in to you that makes no sense but I like it okay this color is delaying my favorite so far what next up I'm going to do demi-glace this is dark and vamp it's almost like a grayish purplish color so it's that exact color this actually looks really cool design makeup to take a purpley brownish grayish color it looks perfect with that purple in the crease so once again that is demi-glace and in the last shade is chutney love the name I'm so happy that like creamy glossy finished at products and making a comeback Oh this is my favorite SS color okay I actually love that this color is absolutely beautiful once again is called chutney definitely my favorite this feels so nice on the lips I'm impressed I need to train more of these colors so yeah super pigmented buttery soft silky smooth they applied NSTIC but it doesn't feel sick once it's on once it's on it's like not really there now if you rub your lips to these and Felix it's like slippery but it doesn't feel sticky it's really weird you guys just need to try yourself so that is my completed look of trying out some new makeup products make sure you go check out the hashtag nuit before I check out your local Sephora go

hey everyone so today is the highly anticipated launch video of the shinik so pellet third remix by BH Cosmetics I am so hyped and so excited to like share this with you I'm gonna talk about the palette first Shearson swatches and then at the end of the video I'm going to do a tutorial for this look here's your really nice simple bronzed kind of eye with a little hint of pink bronze to skin and then the bright orange lips just to set it off this is perfect for spring and summer if you're in the southern hemisphere like myself otherwise if you are in fall at this I would look amazing with a dark burgundy lip like would look perfect so you can switch it up if you like anyway let's just like dive into this because I am so pumped their responds to the first shinnok so palette which if you don't know this is it here mine's a little bit dirty because obviously it's well loved it came with nine lipsticks and nine eyes shadows and this means so much better than any of us ever imagined like we thought it would do well but you guys like absolutely headed out of the park like you guys that loved it there was such a great response from you guys sending me oh look sending me photos such amazing reviews on the website like the overall love for this palette was just so overwhelming and so amazing and we cannot thank you enough for that over the last year I've had so many requests for a part two and little did you guys know over that entire time and more we've actually been planning a new one which is obviously it the one I'm showing you today their remix now the packaging is rebound as you can see like it's a brighter pink put a little bit of shiny shiny on the packaging to kind of like be nicer reflective and nice metallic remixed logo so you can do please tell them apart if you do already own the original like it's nice and easy for you to tell which is which I chose this nice metallic pink it's so beautiful like I'm just in love with it and then on the other sites a little bit of a lighter color so you can kind of tell the sides apart and you can see on the front it says 18 color or pellet now the reason we haven't called it eyes shadow pellet is because if you have the colors contain like the rig dyes and everything which on some people not myself but on some people it can stain the skin around their eyes so it's just you know just be aware of that there's more information on the actual box and there will be more information on the actual website so this is what the box looks like you can pause this if you would like I cannot actually begin it to explain how many people have messaged my selfish cosmetics lift comings lift review saying it like please never discontinue this eyeshadow palette because it's my Holy Grail I use it every day see to reconsider so we've bought back the eyeshadows so these are nine at fan at favorite shades there have been playing with this so it's not perfect it was perfect when it arrived in the post but I played with her before I showed you which was done I wanted to keep it nice than you but oh well pull back the nine fan of favorites now these eyeshadows are my Holy Grail I use at least one of these shades pretty much every time I did my makeup in real life and I use that in videos all the time as you guys know especially that top Pro and stick and roller like these two rows are my favorite and then this row down here is really fun for like nighttime or if I want to try something different we've got the mirror and you'll notice we've actually named each shape well I have named each shade so I've called a shade something so it's a little bit easier than me when I'm doing my tutorials to like communicate with you guys as to what shade I am using anytime okay you may be wondering like now that there are eyeshadows on both sides of this palette why should I not just do a traditional palette you know like a traditional appellant very good question first of all I love how slim and compact this palette is it is perfect for traveling I take it every time I travel with me it's not huge and bulky the other reason I kept it like this is because I don't know about you guys but personally when I have a pellet with a lot of eyeshadows in it like more than 12 or something like that I get quite overwhelms because there's just so many colors happening and I always seem to reach for the same a few shades and neglect other shades that a really beautiful but I just don't think about it because I see like this mesh of color and I'm just like that one so I wanted to keep it double-sided so that it's really simple so you look at this and you're like okay I can see the colors you know you're not getting overwhelmed by this plus color plus you know different undertones it's just very simple and one of the ways I like to look at the little 9 pen palettes is like you know this is a look this is a look this is a lo all of the colors kind of goes you get this so you can't really screw it up they're just perfect for everyday but there's again those darker colors so you can kind of amp up your look for nighttime I've actually been using the new side of this pillow even that's a little bit scarier like it's a little bit more colorful I've been using the new side almost every single time I've done my makeup I've used it or this thing is like when I've gone to events I've been using it like crazy my eye makeup is a secret my makeup once again a secret the eyes I can tell you but seriously I love love love these shadows and I know you may be a little bit intimidated by a couple of the colors but I'm gonna do tutorials and show you how wearable that they can be so at the top we have a nice neutral line of shadows and we have some pinks and like more burgundy red shades and then down the bottom we have obviously the super bright pink which is actually amazing as a blush as well so if you're looking at this palette like I can't even use that color if you don't usually you know go for colorful eye makeup this is actually beautiful on your cheeks and I show you how it looks right here I'm wearing it today believe it or not like it is not scary whatsoever trust me it's actually one of my favorite colors in the entire palette then we have this nice muted purple and then that's really beautiful muted kind of warm pink which almost acts like a neutral I use this just like all over my eyelid like it's just beautiful for everyday wear there are so many different looks you can create with this palette and separating the side of the pellet from the other side palette just makes the colors a little bit more you know they each stand out on their own so it's not kind of overwhelming like I said but then of course you can go from one side to the next like it's no issue I've kind of made each side a little bit of like a standalone pellet so you can almost think of this as like a toe and one pellet getting to 9 pin I should repel it in one I am so so proud of this palette it is so beautiful the colors are amazing they're easy to blend they are pigmented they go on like a dream okay and the price point is so affordable I'm just so stoked on this palette I know so many of you guys are excited so I really hope from the bottom of my heart that it really fulfills your excitement just like my last palette of course Audrey hates more tutorials as well in the coming weeks and months and stuff I actually have a playlist down below only get down below of a whole lot of tutorials I've created with this side only I know you guys will ask this is cruelty free it is vegan I chose old vegan which is amazing it's Gemma Tala just tasted it's even gluten free now I'm going to swatch every single shade for you including the original nine shades and then we will bounce straight into the tutorial so hope you guys enjoy okay so here is a closer look at the darker pink side which is the original side whence watching these I'm really kind of blending them as I go so you can kind of see you know what they're gonna look like on your eye the first color which is called clarity this is just the perfect bone it colored highlight color it's met the next shade is called Holy Grail speaks for itself it is my Holy Grail shimmery champagne color for highlighting brow bone and a tear duct lid anything it's so so beautiful the next shade is called globe ad this is perfect again for a highlighter on medium skin tones or it just is a perfect rose gold for all over the eyelid next is buttercup I like to use this in the crease is a really warm crease color or I mix it together with the Terra Cotta color which is coming soon this one here is called beach babe perfect bronze I love it and then this is the terracotta color which I called terracotta perfect in the crease or in the outer V or all over the lid and through the crease it's just like a one color eyeshadow look next up is toasted which is a shimmery taupe color it's so beautiful on the eyelid and the next shade is called avocado this is a joy chrome which kind of goes a warm brown to green to like a bluish color it's so beautiful and the last color is silhouette which is the darkest matte color and it is perfect like an eyeliner or for deepening out the outer V and that is how all of these that colors look so they are all quite neutral and wearable but I think they are all quite unique as well and the looks you can create a endless like old list my playlist down below like I said there's so many different looks you can create now we have the lighter pink packaging outside which is the new side which has some pinks and some neutrals and some purple and burgundy first we have Island glow which is the perfect light gold for highlighting brow bone and a corner cheeks and then next we

darker Brown now we have drinker which is another beautiful quite unique shade it's a peachy pink kind of joy chrome it is so nice I love it and it's a really fun one to play with this next rid of

reddish burgundy color and then the next shade is called misty and this is a really wearable muted pinkish kind of shade it actually acts really well like a neutral next is a really wearable purple good lover this one is super mutant as well and just looks beautiful all over the eyelid or in the crease and then the final hot pink is called baby girl this is going way too fast for me baby girl is actually really fun to play with and it's also good as a blush I will show you again how to use this in some makeup tutorials coming soon I made sure to actually blend it the swatches into my skin away arm so you can kind of see how they accurately look on the eyes so I hope you guys can see how wearable these colors I while realizing you can still create really fun and colorful looks so I

every one so I put together this really easy vampirish diminish devil look it was supposed to be a devil if you couldn't tell from the horns but you could use it any of those costumes to be honest it is really really pretty and glam while still being a little bit creepy with like the veining and the creepy lips the dark contacts which are totally optional of course yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this Halloween tutorial so starting out with my skin I'm taking a pale foundation and just applying that all over my face and I'm building it up through a pretty full of coverage I'm just using my flawless finished punch back so beauty to blend that out and then taking a really pale concealer under my eyes to conceal as well in a triangular shape using that same sponge to buff it out I still don't know how I feel about this concealer it's definitely not my favorite I don't really see the hype like it's not bad but I don't think it's like amazing I don't know anyway then I'm sitting it with a translucent powder just to make sure that it lasts all night or all day or whatever you're wearing this I don't know and then I'm doing my eyebrows so I'm starting out by just filling them in how I normally would so I'm using a brow pomade and a nice little thin brush this is an eyebrow groomer brush by XO beauty and try to make them quite sharp as well and quite well filled in so they're quite dark and then I'm taking a black eyeliner and just outlining the tail and like the middle of my eyebrow with that black eye shadow and I don't know I just think it looks really cool and creepy and kind of goes with the Halloween theme I guess next up you want a I should repel it with some eyeshadows that it kind of warm tones like Reds and stuff like that so the desert dust capela is absolutely perfect first I'm taking Musk on a fluffy blending brush and just buffing that all through the crease it's kind of like a grayish neutral so if you have like a grayish and neutral eyeshadow that'll be perfect and it just kind of goes with like the really pale skin I guess it makes it look a little bit creepier and then I'm taking the red color and buffing it through at the crease and enter an outer corner a little bit and just building that up and blending it out until it looks nice and even next up I am mixing it together these two shades on my finger one of them's quite glittery and I'm just pressing that all over the eyelid I did get a little bit of fallout so I just used a little shimmer fan brush to kind of sweep that away and worked fine and then I'm just going back in with that other grayish neutral color and putting that underneath my lash line just as a starter to kind of I don't know made my eyes pop a little bit more I guess and then what I'm doing is taking that black eye should I use before with a winged liner brush and just kind of winging out there in the corner I'm kind of just mapping it out we're going to use some of that gel eyeliner next which is this one right here black track by Mac is my favorite one because it just doesn't smudge and go everywhere once it's set so you can use it like on your waterline and stuff and it doesn't move it's so good so I'm just applying it to my waterline and filling in that little inner corner part and then I also use it to create a winged eyeliner [Music] see [Music] I wanted it to look a little smokier so I took a black eye sturgis today out of corner of my lower lash line to kind of buff it out and joins it up with the wing on the outer corner of my eye and then i'm taking it that red color again and intensifying the crease just because i decided once i at the eyeliner on i wanted it to look a lot more dramatic so that's what i'm doing here and then just using a nice big fluffy brush to continue to blend that out so it's nice and soft and I kind of still lift it quite vivid if there make sense so don't bleed too too much you want it to look bold still and then I am highlighting my brow bone this colors not really light enough for my skin tone beautiful medium skin tones but whatever you see anyway and I'm using this red eye shadow by Illamasqua and just buffing some of that it's really a beginning of my crease closest to like where my nose is like the inner corner of my eye just to really make the red pop like it's super bright this red I wanted over dramatic lashes for this look so just putting some glue my hand and then going straight onto my mascara while that kind of gets a little bit tacky so I'm using this gifted at mascara by higher on my top and bottom lashes check out that nice as mascara face yes I'm using these ones here Noelle faux mink lashes by huda beauty they're really really pretty so just popping those on and then cleaning up the mascara I messed up and then I used some of this red glitter bail it on my inner corner just because I thought it really looked cool like when my eyes were open I felt like there wasn't enough red happening so I just added this here and then I really loved it so I decide to put some on my eyelid too so I just messed it on there as well [Music] even though I want to look pale I still wanted to have a little bit of dimension on my face so I put on some of this really pale bronzer just to my nose chin forehead cheeks chin did I say that already probably you know and then I'm contouring and I'm using a couple of different colors to contour because I wanted my contour to be a very very dramatic and angular so you'll see I'm kind of bringing it down even further than normal down my face close to the edges of my mouth then I'm using another brush which is even thinner and that color from the huda beauty palette which is kind of grayish and yeah it's just making the contour like super amplified and super angular and then I kind of put my face front floored it to the mirror and just kind of like contoured out that like part of my lower cheek chin area you know does that make sense I hope so and then I'm using that red eye shadows of lush [Music] I am going dramatic from a highlighter so I'm using something stupid literally literally what I always a glitter aliy instead of glittery anyway something dramatic is my highlighter cuz why not it's holding and then I'm using a black lip pencil in a red lip pencil and you can totally just use black eyeliner if you prefer I just had this one so I thought I'd try it out and I'm just lining my lips first with that black and then I'm kind of winging it out on my outer corner of my lip and I'm really bad at lapatin any kind of like different shaped lip liner lipstick anything anything that is not just my natural lip line so don't worry if you're not that good at it just try your best I'm just doing my best here so I'm lining my entire lip and then going inside and on top of the black with the red and kind of blending that together and I'm not too worried about how it looks yet because next I'm gonna take a liquid lipstick this one's beaucoup de Beauty and it's in the shade icon it's like a deep kind of reddish terracotta ish color light muted read almost and I'm blending that on top and then I'm gonna take the red lip liner again and kind of blend into that and make it all blend together hopefully and that's kind of how I did it so yeah I really am not that good if I can do it you can do it I think it turned out decent like it's not perfect but I mean I think it's good enough and then I'm taking a lip topper on top of that so you can just use like a red lip gloss if you want a this one could feel this by her beauty and I'm just applying that straight on top when I think of devil costumes like the typical devil costumes I always think of like latex and like liver liver so I thought I did gloss to kind of mimic that you know idea I guess and then I'm using concealer to tidy up the lips because I always make mistakes with stuff like this next I'm adding my contacts these ones I just picked up off pinkyparadise they're just black red looks really cool as well just FYI and that's how it looks without the veining so you can keep it like that if you want but I thought I'd add veining just because I felt like it I did a veining tutorial and another one of my videos for Halloween I'll link it below it's actually way better than this like I did a way better than this so you can copy that one if you want I'll link it below like I said but yeah basically just using a watered-down gel liner and just dragging it down my eyes and dabbing it out with my fingers and then I use a little bit of all white eyeshadow mixed with water just to kind of you know make it balance out the sides make it bounce another slice this is amazing you know what I mean give it some dimension yeah [Music] and do you have it like I said this is perfect for like a demon log or even a vampire look if you're dressing up as a vampire it's perfect that's the completed look it is so easy you guys it took me like an hour to do I hope it was simple enough for you guys to follow as well I do like to do more simple tutorials sometimes because those the ones that you guys actually like to recreate most of the time you know there's no special effects needed or anything like that it's so easy so make sure you thumbs up this video if you did enjoy it and I will talk to you guys in my next video bye [Music] 
hey everyone so today as you can see I don't have any of my mascara eyeliner anything on and that is because I'm going to do a first impression on this new MEC eyeliner which looks really crazy really really weird to be honest so basically if you have not seen it yet it is a little roller wheel eyeliner it's a liquid eyeliner this one here is brown it's not black but I thought I would just try it out on camera for you because I got sent it recently and I just feel like it's the perfect product to do it does it work video one because I've never seen anything like this before in my life as far as eyeliner goes all that Lighting's really good all of a sudden please stay like this okay so this is the brown roller wheel liquid eyeliner by Mac it doesn't have the extra name on the bottom because I will sent this it's a little pressed sample but the packaging I really actually like the lid I know this is a weird thing to point out but it's got flat edges on both sides which honestly just make it really it really nice to hold it's really comfortable in your hand on the inside you can see it's got this little like a contraption which kind of sucks off any excess product off the tiny little wheel so the actual wheel looks something like this hopefully you guys can kind of see it I've never even swatch this before so we'll try it in a second and it literally looks like a tiny little pizza wheel or something you know like a tiny little cutter and it's so so freaking it small it's so tiny I have no idea how this will go for creating a thick winged eyeliner because the actual thickness of the little wheel is so thin you're not gonna be able to tell on camera honestly it's a literally like a millimeter I don't know how this is gonna go but I'm really excited to try it out thought first of all we could do some swatches so it's going to dip it pull it out and give this a go okay Wow oh my gosh it's a really really nice line so the actual wheel feels really nice and sturdy it doesn't feel wobbly or anything it's really really easy to use I'm actually impressed so far I just did a few more lines so we could see how much product is on the wheel and you can see it's just starting to kind of get a little bit patchy in some of those swatches so one did last quite a while here we go so you're still going but it's just getting a little bit more patchy as you go I'm looking nervous to use this on my eyes that weird didn't feel sharp in my hand but I'm interested to see if it feels quite sharp on my face because you know your eye area is so sensitive so I'm like is this gonna hurt I'm sure it won't like why would they and eyeliner that hurts anyway it's just a concern of mine so let's just dive in and get started I guess oh my gosh I'm nervous so I'm just zooming us all the way in so we can see what we do I've got a murder down underneath me so I'm just going to line up the little wheel with the side of my eye I'm gonna do a wing huh okay one thing I did notice when I drew it did kind of like move my skin I don't know it like just gonna pitch to my sick this is like my sticky eyelid like pinched around like on my eyelid um but it's still even though it did that still to do it quite even line if you can see I love this color by the way it's such a nice really rich Brown it's super dark okay I'm having a little bit of trouble just kind of joining up the lines you really can only move in one direction like if you want a really straight wing it's perfect usually I kind of flick it like you can see so it goes like in a little curve and it's really not good for that like it's really awkward but if you just want like sharp winged eyeliner oh gosh okay so I've kind of filled in some of that if you could see I'm just taking a little more product now let's try and draw a line across the life line did you like at the top of the wing first like the top of the eyeliner I guess no I'm just filling it in it should pretty easy to fill in I thought it would take ages but it doesn't I think the trick is kind of like holding it on a really straight angle like usually I do my eyeliner with my hand underneath but with this you kind of have to like really angle it flat rather than like this you've got to be like this just with the finish of this address so Matt you can't really see because I just kind of went over it but Wow nice formula okay I thought it would be really easy to draw a really thin line but it's kind of hard because every time I have it on the wrong angle it just goes thick you really need to have it really flat to get it really close to the lashline you kind of thin line I'm gonna do this in a corner sort of awkward okay I'm finding this a Nick one are really hard to get into her maybe if I go like over the side my nose is in the way there's drew my eyelid okay honestly this inner corner is the hottest pot I can't friggin get it like flat okay here we go so if you care under like from an underneath angle you can kind of get it into that lashline bitter nailed it there you go that's the trick go from underneath at the inner corner and that's giving me a much thinner line but now I have to clean up all of their products that I got everywhere I think I did my wing way too long okay now let's try the next side the side is usually easier for me to do liquid eyeliner on because it's a bit of shape my I suppose really different shapes okay let's do this hmm that's really long as well it's easy to get out of control cuz the wheel just keeps going and I'm just gonna line up the little wheel and drag it back towards my lashline I don't know if this is any easier than normal liquid eyeliner another thing with this I feel like you have to get so close to your murder to be able to see what you're doing cuz the little wheel is so tiny so if you're far away you can't really see where the wheelers do you know it makes it sort of small you don't really know if it's on the right angle usually real up-close-and-personal to be able to see what you're doing well the formula though is so nice so I don't know I feel like it's slowly getting easier and easier as I go with a little bit of practice okay honestly I think if you have like a mono led eye shape this would probably be so legit it's actually quite easy the further I go and the more I practice like you know as I go the easier it's getting and I feel like if you didn't have much of a crease so you could draw a really perfect straight line and just drag it around it would be so easy to use for me I'm kind of like contorting my eyelids like trying to get it perfectly straight so I'm not quite sure for me if it's easier than a normal liquid eyeliner but I do quite like it I am so sold on this color though it's almost black it's just a little bit less harsh and you do get such a straight line this side over here like my first try it isn't as perfect the sights a little bit better I just don't know how I would go about doing it less dramatic wing because literally when you're using and it's just like zoom across your eye you have to be so careful no is this good or is it not I can't tell okay I'm gonna put on some mascara and some lashes and then let's have a chat okay so I've got lashes on and that's how the eyeliner looks up close I've actually just noticed there's a few patches where I've kind of missed it's just such a thin little wheel there like obviously you should go over it so many times to cover the entire area of your wing okay if I just go back in again with the little wheel oh you do be so careful so in my opinion is the mech roller will liquid eyeliner good ah I just don't know I love this formula I can say that straight away I just touched this up it's gonna say I'll rub it because before I tried rubbing it and it didn't move I'll just wait until it dries and then I'll do a little rub test I love how dark it is it is so dark and it drives super matte which I'm a huge fan awful eyeliner I love matte liquid eyeliner because it kind of looks like gel it just looks darker and I really like that really dark look this color even though it's brown is amazing like I don't know what the h1 I don't know if it's called at Brown because that's all it says here but most likely it's probably got a different name so I have to find it and put it down below for you the applicator is definitely interesting it would be quite cool if they also gave you a different applicator somehow I don't know so you can have like a little brush as well as the little roller wheel but do I like the roller wheel and do what I daren't if you guys have tried this product please leave your review it down below I feel like with more practice I love it so I'm definitely gonna keep trying it I feel like it deeply it's easy you've just got to be very careful and controlled still so just because it's like a little roller wheel doesn't mean you can just like go home with it you still have to be very controlled and slow otherwise you end up like me with like really large wings which I like this look anyway so it's not that much of an issue but I kind of wasn't going for this look it just completely went out of control once I figured out to hold it from underneath the inner corner was easy like doing it up here was not easy however doing the actual wing you kind of have to hold it straight otherwise you're going to end up with a really weird line so does it work I suppose it does work and like I said if you love that really straight eyeliner look I think you'll like it I think if you have a less of a crease like monolids or close to it I think you will really like it anyone that has hooded eyes I don't think you will like this because I think it'll be too hard to use I just have a bit of a like deep crease I guess I'm not quite hooded but I don't know they're quite deep creases and I did have to kind of like flatten out my eye like this to make sure I could draw a nice straight line otherwise it goes really bumpy and kind of awkward because the roller ball doesn't really move properly on lumpy skin and then if I just do it a little bit of a rub test you can see it's not smudging and it doesn't seem to be fading or cracking or anything so yeah that's pretty good too it's not like you go around rubbing your eyes and you've got eyeliner on so I think that's quite good I'm definitely on the fence it's definitely a bit of a 50/50 situation but hopefully you guys enjoyed watching this you know it doesn't work kind of how it works video it's definitely a really cool idea I just don't know if it's like super practical but I guess it just depends on your eye shape really by the way I don't have my contour on because I'm about to film a calculation waist contour kit doesn't work review first impressions I'll link it down below coz it already got by now and if you're wondering my lipstick is in if a bull by EXO Beauty it's a super hot I think I'm in

on the other side it's got a little explanation of each color and I start with the paler shade and show you how to create a really wearable look with this because when I will do this I think it just looks great to be perfect day to day makeup for the office or makeup for school kind of color you could wear it anywhere it's a little bit bright keep you know your look interesting it's not too out there for everyday wear so we're going to keep the face very natural you can see I've already got my base done so we're going to add a little bit of bronzer into the crease first this is a trick I love that to do just for everyday wear it's super quick and super effective and it just helps to kind of warm up your face a little bit I'll list all the products I'm using it down below as well and you can see the difference it's just a really easy way to kind of emphasize your eye shape into a little bit underneath as well if you want by the way yes my face is way darker than my chest right now I was intending on matching but then I went ot T with the bronzer today to finish off the eye look I'm taking a highlighter and I'm going to highlight my brow bone just using a little bit of product so I want this eye look to look kind of natural because I want the attention to remain on the lips still while we're here we'll put a light dusting of that highlighter also on our cheekbone I'm just using this joy fiber brush to give a kind of sheer layer and then just finish off this really simple eye look I'm just going to put on a coat of mascara I'm just going to keep that on my upper lashes today usually always do my bottom lashes but this just make sure I look really wide and bright to the daytime for a little bit more brightness I'm just going to put a little bit of this flesh toner eyeliner in my waterline and then the most exciting part so this is what the packaging looks like even though you probably already know this by now beautiful rose gold I love love love the packaging the frosted glasses super classy once again this first shade is called sherbet so let's apply it the smell of these you will see it the pigmentation yourself when I put this on once white people now these do drive down to a mess and they are transfer proof they last for ages on your lips and obsessed with this lip color isn't such a mean color so this is the first makeup look with the first shade sugar and as you can see this what takes no time at all so perfectly offers before school you know if you're just at eye restricted individuals this color is absolutely beautiful okay let's move on to the next one next up I'm going to use the shade at pink cherry this is so freakin vibrant and we're going to dress up this makeup look a little bit but still keep it suitable for day or night depending how adventurous you are I want to intensify the makeup a little bit just so that it looks a little bit more balanced because it is such a bright color so first I'm taking a shimmery neutral eyeshadow and I'm going to Pat that on the lid this nice kind of coppery Brown that will compliment the hot pink so well this is going to be like the perfect kind of party look this is also a really good way to end pop your makeup the nighttime if you're going from the office to a party or whatever and just making sure to buff out those harsh lines I want it to be very blended now I'm just going to add a little bit of a skosh the bottom lashes this will make my eye makeup look a little bit more smoky and dramatic crap and even add a little bit more mascara on the top and my waterline I'm just going to apply a little bit of gold and then finally I'm just going to brighten up that highlight I'm going to layer a little bit more on I'm going to intensify the inner corner and the brow bone now let's apply pink cherry I'm so excited for this one oh my gosh holy crap this is bright this is the perfect party look after work drinks after work cocktails night out with the girls anything like that that is what this makeup is for obviously you can wear this makeup wherever you like but hey that is definitely where I would wear this in fact I would even wear this during the daytime just to make a statement this look class is legit it's almost like a joke Rome except it's matte it's so unique also a reminder if you look at these colors and you're like oh my gosh I do not like those and

go on to the last color and do something a little bit more dramatic so this final look we definitely need to add lashes but first I'm going to intensify that crease a little bit so I'm just using a darker brown eyeshadow and then just applying it right in that crease and applying an even darker Brown on that outer corner and then bring that through the crease here you can see the different lashes no lashes honestly to take any makeup look to night time I think the two EDS please add lashes and a bold lip color and then in my tight line and waterline I'm using black eyeliner just to help blend you can leave the gold if you prefer as well but I just want to do something different for this look I'm just going to intensify my contour a little bit for nighttime and then using a damp brush I'm going to apply a little more highlighter and then of course to finish off the look we want to use our bright purple liquid lipstick once again this is called berry oh it's so pigmented this is such a fun look it's a little bit grunge almost like very small Dury 6000 times a night time if you're going out to a party clubbing going out for drinks whatever I mean I'm sure some of you would even wear stuff like this during the daytime but hey these are just suggestions just ideas just some inspiration for you guys especially if you get this mask kiss me club you guys have some ideas on

hey everyone I have my iced coffee today I am so excited to film this video we are going to go through some of the lowest rated products on mickr so I bought the stuff about a week and a half ago but like I said these are basically all of the lowest rated products and we're gonna try it out on my face and a full face first impression today there were some products that were rated lower but they had like one review so I tried to pick things that had multiple reviews that were lower reviews that makes sense so it's not just like one person saying they're bad it's like multiple people we're gonna read the reviews and see if I agree with them or if I actually liked some of the products so hopefully I do like some of these hopefully this entire makeup look doesn't just come out looking like trash because that would suck but it's just the risk we're going to take so if you don't know what Meeker is it is one of my all-time favorite websites to shop on it's kind of like a New Zealand version of Sephora they've got all of our high-end brands I love them so much because they brought all of the brands to New Zealand and Australia that we previously could not get like two-faced Urban Decay Stila ciaté beer minerals I hate stuff and some really high-end brands too so I'm gonna try a lot of the stuff today let's see what they're like so for the worst rated foundation I died this is a bitey recovery expert SPF 15 I really hope I like this because it costs $97 and it's been rated 2.7 with 47 reviews I got the shade vanilla beige I hope it matches me and I hope I like this because I want to get my money's worth but we'll soon find out so once again it's called Covey expert SPF 15 perfecting it fluid foundation with alt recruit dang it coverage 35 mil which is a little bit more than average it's got 21 one-star reviews someone said that the formula has changed so they don't like the new formula I wouldn't know anything about this since I haven't tried it bright orange undertones that said it's not horrible and it ends up leaning out okay I do notice that it sits on my skin differently and doesn't last as long someone else is amazing coverage yes someone else just said disappointing change in formula it ruins a good thing the new formula is different color and the finish is there is nice I got the shade at 7:00 at vanilla beige oh my gosh I'm so nervous this is the packaging it's just a nice like tube and you just squeeze out the product like that you know actually hasn't know how to do it I hope Cole looks alright come on I really hope I like this you know SPF obviously isn't good for like photography but if it's a good foundation it could be a nice one for the daytime at 90 something dollars I have certain expectations and I am going to use my journey because I'm lazy we hunt face brush I need to wash my brushes I'm just going to start by stippling it a little Oh looks a little bit orange now smells hot out like sunscreen which I love the smell of sunscreen but just in case you guys didn't know I know some people hate the smell of it but I adore sunscreen smell let me know what you think down below do you love it or do you hate it or do you just not get I really love the finish I feel like it's going a little bit patchy so you have to be careful when you blend it and I feel like it's a little bit orange but it's not so orange that a powder won't help to courage that they did use quite a small amount of foundation for me anyway because I usually use so much and the brush is working well one layer like it is quite thin and I'm really buffing it in it's really evened out my skin tone but it's not like flawless so I'm just gonna do another layer and we'll see how it goes I love the smell of this if you like you put it on and then you blend it out it goes more orange but hopefully it doesn't oxidize I feel like if it doesn't oxidize it'll be completely fine it's quite a thick techy kind of texture but once it's blended out it doesn't feel sticky it's just like before you blend it out a little bit sticky I'll link down below my previous bit stove videos mixed up and planning to do the worst of Sephora and then I want to do the same thing for like Ulta and beauty bag I just wanted to get this one out first because obviously for me to order all the Sephora stuff it takes a little bit longer so to ship it to an address in America and then ship it to New Zealand because I can't hold a day rate so usually by the time I do that the reviews are a little bit like different sometimes the stuff that was a bit fellow aware seller is not within a couple of weeks so you know we just have to accept that okay this Leigh is so nice I actually do not mind this so far I'll wear it again in my real life and I'll update you because I think this looks quite nice it is a little bit too orange and perhaps a little bit too dark on camera it kind of looks like a Mitch's but in real life it's a little bit darker than my body I feel like it's dragged down like half a shade darker it's not too bad but yeah so first first first impression I love the way it looks up close it's so flawless it's even sitting quite nicely over my nose which is usually where I struggle doesn't look cakey it looks so smooth it has a nice finish we'll see if it oxidizes over the next few minutes because I seem to have really good luck with that sometimes ok the worst rated at bronzer I'm going straight to bronze that will make sense in a second was it the Stila aqua glow perfecting a bronzer so it's like a cream bronzer so obviously I want to put that on now before I do concealer and powder and everything I have it got the foundation and concealer from the Ed quickl over range I've been tried them much yet but I have it tried the blushes I love it the blushes okay this one was rated one star someone said it makes me look pink and it's $52 so let's try it this is what the packaging it looks like I love the packaging to be honest you get and you get 30 ml which is heaps and comes in a little pump so how do I go about this I might just put on the back my hand looks like this it looks like fake tan I'm trying to figure out what contour color I gots I can't find a contour color in here did I forget to apply this I'm going to use a detail fiber brush which is like my favorite type of brush to use liquid EU products with like bronzes and blushes so I'm just stippling a little oh my gosh my face is so dark look at that I think it's oxidized a bit looks quite orange it's not as orange as that other foundation though and the last makeup one I did well it wasn't really the foundation but you know what I mean I'm we bright orange in that video it's like barely noticeable it feels so weight as well like it like feels weight on your face like it doesn't feel like it's drying hmm I'm just gonna put some weight but you can see it more there but it looks like orange so that's fun I'm gonna take more of this foundation and just waste some and put it my neck because this is not okay so we'll just let the rest of that foundation ketchup and orange nests on my chest and then hopefully I won't look so I'm so sorry I forgot primer I didn't even know how I did that this was the primer that was lowest rated so I'll try this in a new video in a different video I promise let me just try it out on my hand it's a neck primer which isn't early for my skin type I prefer glowy stuff but holy this that gets like pull fish and I'll bet even thicker it just like stays up by itself oh but when you rub it in it feels like a bomb like it's real slippery that actually feels quite nice and it's quite sticky which I don't mind for a primer because sometimes it helps to stick the foundation down okay I'm gonna try that in a different video that feels pretty good though to be honest so hopefully it's better than what the review say I am just a little bit confused because there's no concealer in here maybe I already own it see what the lowest-rated concealer is I have to make an apology so the reason I didn't buy the concealer is cuz I thought I already had it and I can't find it anywhere I'm thinking it's cause I've tried it before I wasn't really a big fan of it it's the stay light at click low serum concealer $42 and it's rated like Tona half stars I'm such a failure like okay this video goes a bit smoother I'm gonna try a different conceal that I've never tried before just to try and make it up to you this is the beige Bobbi Brown corrector something concealer and full concealer by the way this foundation feels so weird on my skin it feels like almost tight look I can feel it there on my skin and it's not a good feeling so this foundation it is just not embracing me anymore I like the finish I like the coverage I like how it sits on my skin but it feels strange and the color is not good maybe if I had like a crypt and I faked head-on but even they might I just don't like the way it feels it almost feels hot too like I don't know if I'm having like a reaction to it or what I can't get like any product on my wand right now come on please it feels really thick I'm using my Lodge buffer she'll probably use a small one I'm using my medium buffer oh my gosh I'm sorry okay just on the side nipple brush this feels so thick I don't know if it's because of the foundation underneath light of coverage though it's super brightening look at that difference I'm definitely gonna try this again but with like a different foundation underneath cuz everything just feels so heavy on top of this and the one thing I don't like about this is like nothing comes out on the wand and I'm the kind of goes in there piles stuff along that really does conceal the under-eye bags I like that so far a little heck I like to do after I do my concealer is take the little nipple this looks scary but it's really not and just rub it across my waterline to like brighten up my eyes so definitely try that concealer again I don't think you can get that on makeup but anyway so powder I have here is Shawn to Col I don't know how to pronounce it probably HD a perfecting loose powder and it comes in this cute little purple box this is an expensive brand I'll look it up in a moment like the smallest amount of powder 2.4 grams this is one of those like on-the-go type situations we a little brush go to bed it's a little bit stiff that I mean it's reasonably soft you would hope so and then you I don't think you were meant to do that okay I think it's actually situations where it comes out of the actual brush so I just wasted like $80 worth of product I mean Oh we'll check how much it cost but cool I'm gonna like sucks them up into the brush and try to like selfish this Hey so life hack don't do that it's never a dull moment is it okay so this is $109 just for comparison in the Laura Mercier foundation I mean powder loose powder you get 9.6 gram this one what did I say it was two point four four hundred and four dollars oh that's a good idea for London do you want me to do full face of cheapest stuff in full face of most expensive stuff it could be another good one to do and it was rated 2.7 very confused bought this while on a whim as I love the brand but I can't see the point of this product it's a glorified makeup brush is no powder comes out so what I said it magic they love the patter it doesn't get cakey or irritate their skin I thought this would be great to carry my handbag for touch-ups it's very pretty but I can't seem to get the powder out of the brush so yeah you're supposed to just shake it down I guess hold on let me read the directions because I want to say like do just shake it upside down like what do you do it doesn't even say it just his following application of foundation buff HD powder all over the face I have powder all over every single one of my brushes now so that's fun okay I'm just using what's on it I can't see the powder coming out but we're just gonna do this and the brush is all over my eyelids not to be confused with and I feel like I'm wiping off half of my foundation I don't like this at all I might just end up opening it and using a different brush to use it but I still wouldn't never buy this because it's like a hundred and something dollars and you get nothing look I don't care how good it is that is too expensive I am quickly gonna take my Mexi to powder because I want to give the rest of the products a fair review and my base I'm just not happy with you know if I put blush and stuff on top of this I'm just gonna be like it looks  so I'm just gonna fix it up and actually give it a proper fair review this will help to kind of color corrector because I'm just orange so it looks like I can trust a lot of the reviews on mica so far hopefully we find some good stuff next trying to find the lower rated contour kits but there really aren't any it's funny cuz shape shifters one of the lowest rated ones there is to either have good reviews what they have no reviews so I mean I guess I use my shape shift appellate but I like that it's still being rated four stars why do people not like it mostly unusable I have this in light/medium the shimmery highlight is okay the cream and powder contour and bronze colors look a can by chin but they're horrible in the face tried to make them work but they always look blotchy no matter what fair enough I don't have that problem okay so much the issue which I can't agree with is that people don't like how it's like double-sided powders creams etc so on mica this will set you back eighty-three dollars these are New Zealand dollars by the way so if you're sitting there and you live in you know in the United States or something and you're like so it's got two sides it's got the contour sight like this which I love this contour shade they showed their use for bronzer sometimes it's quite intense but I'm like just use it today obviously cuz that other bronzer from Stila did not work out the highlight is really pretty and that's nice just like under your eyes and stuff but yeah to be honest I don't use this like that often I use the contour a couple times it's good but like I never use these two or even that one really like I've tried them but yeah I can totally see why people wouldn't want to pay for this entire pillow when they only use a couple of the colors and yeah - they like media I mean if you have skin it fear they may be that color there is completely unusable I can't use that when I've got super fierce going so it looks really a lot pretty much just use it for the contour color most days so it's one of those things to consider when you're buying a pellet like if it's gonna be a pellet you're gonna use a lot of colors or if it's just gonna be one color it's not really worth it is it okay so have you seen the contour color and this is a bronzer brush Oh actually I want to show you some of my new brushes with EXO Beauty they're just coming out we've got new sets out so we've got like a pro I brush set the blender I brushed it so smaller sets that just have a brushes and then we have a highlighting contour face it and essential space set like we've got quite a lot of new mini brush sets so they're a little bit cheaper than the twelve piece sets and they're just a good way like if you're a beginner if you made certain brushes to add to your collection or if you just want to expand your brush collection it's a good way to expand because obviously it's cheaper to buy them and thus it been individually and it's also the brushes I recommend from like you know just maybe what I would recommend because people always ask me they're like which brushes do I need for like a beginner I'm just starting out with eyeshadow which brushes so go for the essential I brushed it etc so hopefully you guys find that helpful and yeah save some money I wish they would just do this palette as a single sided pillow because that would be better I'll swatch the highlighter but it's not the highlighter I'm gonna use today but it's like super blinding if you like that look like it's really pretty I really like the it's like an iced champagne crime why did that come out so with I love new brushes we have the jumbo face brush this softest most luxurious powder brush you ever see so if I compare it to the normal minds Judy their normal powder brush normal powder brush it's like a big powder brush circular this one's tape it on one side so I like this one metamorphic powder sitting powder especially t-zone or all over and as a nice big bronzer brush is freakin soft and it's just beautiful look at him like isn't he elegant and then it turn your eye brushes which I'll show you when I use them I'm gonna take some of this scary dark orange bronzer one tip look how much comes off and just kind of brush blends out really well by the way the white hairs are so easy to clean so I'm just going use my instant brush cleaner this is by cinema secrets you use brush soap they come really clean there you go freshly clean it's a little bit damp but next up let's do blush so this is by CIA and ciate I haven't tried much of I've tried obviously the Chloe Morello pellet which is incredible I'm excited to try something new but it was quite low rated it costs $41 and it's rated 3.3 I went with the shade date night which is a peachy color I believe so it's got one five star review but then it's got three and two star reviews someone said they swatch them in store and they swatch it beautifully and they reminded them of the hourglass blushes so they bought all of them got home put them on their face and nothing showed up they had to use like so much product to get any pigment same thing with the other reviews no pigment so apparently they're not pigmented so let's give it a go the thing with me is I usually like buildable blushes personally I prefer something that I have to work for because I don't like having to be super careful like I can be but I prefer things like the Clinique blushes where like you can buff them in build them up and they just look really nice I still love my other blush just like the urban decay ones and stuff but yeah those ones you if you use like no product and let be real careful if you're like buildable is easy so this is date night that's what it looks like swatch on my finger yeah look at my finger this heaps of pro - there was a tiny swatch and you'll love the finish I'm using a detail fiber brush again I think that it's really pretty that's the kind of blow I prefer so there you go oh that's almost too much I like with him on my brush not hand but you know I put a decent swirl on my brush because people like it's not pigmented but on me put on too much now so there you go just goes to show that everyone's got a different preference with the products because I think that's legit I'm gonna have to use another brush to blend it out now I think it's pretty so whatever what if it river and then the highlighter is called invisible blow by Fiat minerals the bronzer is got like five star reviews but then the highlighter of the same range has three beautiful natural-looking highlights they gave it three stars I like natural highlighters someone rated at one stuff with the label scam I bought this a month ago look great on to the light in the store once I got home I found it hard to apply I can't even see it and then a couple other people actually gave it high ratings and said it's invisible but in a good way it's really natural makes your cheekbones pop and someone said you can use it like a sitting powder if you want just to make your skin really glowy sounds so much the expert beauty powder I won't be surprised if I actually like this so I got the shade fear to light and see is inspired by golden a low light the silky ultrafine baked highlight it illuminates your skin tone for a lit from within aglow okay so this is what it looks like it looks kind of average in the pin but let's give it a go I'm gonna try on a  powder brush first which I like to use with my XO a beauty highlighter just all over my skin we'll see if we can see it oh yeah they gave a really nice all over glow I don't know if you guys can tell the difference but I definitely can in real life okay so far so good now let's try it with a small face brush which is dirty so let's don't it let you guys have clean brushes we'll try them look this this is so similar to the XO PT 1 I like it I think that's really pretty so if you like they kind of highlight is I like that I just blowing from within not like super shimmery but still like it's still intense it's just not shimmery intense you know okay next up we have at the eye shows I'm using today I thought this looks so pretty on the website but it's only rated at 2.8 it is called the mikham X which is Mickey's own brand wink weep in mini pellets this isn't the show embellished waste of money like a kid's eyeshadow box drops off enchants colors seem to have any pigment you have to keep brushing and brushing to get any college transfer I like the packaging it's quite classic it reminds me of the MEC pellets those mini Mac pillars I'm not gonna use a primer I'm just going to go straight in so I want to see how they perform on their own I'm gonna start with this one mm-hmm yep I do feel like there's not a good like transition shade like this is quite light and then this one's super dark I wish there was something in between but we'll use this is a transition shade it's like just talking in my skin tone maybe I'll mix it I'll mix it with the darker Brown so I'm using a fluffy blending brush poke so beauty colors are easier to blend I can see how people think they're not pigmented but I mean they are still easily buildable they're not like the most unpigmented eyeshadows I've used in my life and I don't think these colors are chalky so far so it next let's do the gold glitter I'm just gonna use my finger for oh yeah that's pretty you can see like every single glitter particle when you swatch it literally looks like a glue plus a glue a loose glitter up close instead of like a I sure literally looks like I just dipped into a loose blood that's so I don't know how this is supposed to stick to your eyelid I mean normally I would use oh it's kind of what it's like not transferring onto my eye from my finger yeah that's so glittery gritty it's pretty it's almost like not an eye shadow that's so weird when you use one of my new brushes this is not gonna be the best way to test the new brush just show you how it works because this ishow is a bit strange sorry I was very brightest in anyway so this brush here is the dense brush yeah like it's not even picking it up like you need to use your finger but your finger doesn't transfer it this is a weird eye shadow how you supposed to use this okay I'm not gonna use this brush anymore that just so you know I might use it to highlight actually this is the dense shadow brush this brush is so lovely so it's basically like a luxe I should our brush it's a little bit thicker and dense and I just love this for like picking on pigments and stuff like that you can use this with as well it is synthetic maybe I'll try that let's try this still like barely picking it up but we'll give it a go oh yeah that applies better yeah this I should i repel it because of that glitter shade which I feel like it's like the he you know I like that it's like the pop of this palette it's just not that good to apply it's a stunning color and I mean it looks really pretty but that's not easy to work with like that's a lot of work to get it to work once you build it up on the brush like five times onto your lid it seems to wear it but who's got time for that I'm going to go in did I my brow stuff why don't I buy brow stuff I was like I look different Oh God my eyebrows okay okay if you have a look at that to see you know I'm gonna take this color just here look at that sweetie it's often like scrapping look we'll do one swatch what is that I blue man that loves makeup but you can't get away with that I just scrub up my finger I was like why is this not going on same with this one like a look at that it's like barely anything the only color that somewhat decent is really their dark brown for me so it started off okay not amazing but got worse and worse as we went so I'm gonna go in to my shapeshifter palette and use that highlighter way to showcase my new brushes and the makeup doesn't work typical okay here we go that's better that's why I expect gonna use the contour shade and just pack that underneath the lash line by the way all of this caught stuff cost me like a thousand dollars so the things I do for you cuz I want to sleep all that this stuff was not even gonna be bad and half of it as bed oh that's what haven't showed you the other new brush the last new brush is another favorite of course this is the new slim increase brush which you can use in the crease out of the blending and it's just basically like if you think of the fluffy blending brush sorry this is filthy it's got that friggin powder or um it's like a really narrow tiny version you know similar shape and like I love this just like out of a circular motions into the crease to really define that crease and blend at the same time like it's just so flawless this is so good if you love doing i shadow to do a halo look because you can really blend with it place the color it's like pencil brush and a blender brush all in one you use it to blend under your lash line too if you love a smoky look I'll be we just completely didn't even consider brows I don't know what I was thinking the lowest rated product is a blobby brown long-wear brow gel well maybe they do stop the Bobby Brown concealer then either like went out of stock when I bought it and they didn't send it and something happen like that what I just didn't buy it I'm gonna quickly do my brows I am so sorry Oh Rachel is does not happen the nice look I feel like I'm forgetting forgot half the products I'm so sorry okay I just did a really really quick eyebrows using my hourglass brow sculpting thing which is from Mika and I just figured I'd better show you quickly this is the difference between the deep shadow and then the eye shadow so the Dean shutter is a little bit smaller as well so if you've got Liesel in space but you just want more precision okay eyeliner this is another expensive brand I have not really experimented with is it Ellis vos el espacio so this is one of the lowest rated products of this entire video but it's only had two reviews but one star through one star reviews this practice brush with eyeliner push through unfortunately I must have turned the dial 100 times with no product of Caring apparently once you finally get to use it the product becomes Kate to the brush it requires a wash under hot water prior to eat the BRE single use which does not sound very practical someone said one star I'm really glad I speed nearly $50 on this eyeliner then I can't even use no manoir no matter how many times I turn the dial on the bottom to push the eyeliner brush it doesn't come out well I'm looking forward to this one so it looks like this it kind of looks like a bullet or something so a packaging which I love and the brush is really Steph look mine came out oh my God look at that it's going everywhere that's my own fault mine came out okay the brush is actually kind of easy to use but look at that it's not that black it's not even covering that glitter at all it's hard to get a fine tip though it's as shops I can get it and I'm doing a second layer because it's not very opaque it's actually a pretty good way but um not sharp feel like I'm having such a bad run with makeup lately like I used to never have products I disliked like genuinely stuff I try more often than not I'd really like it I hate this I start think the formula is that good it's not bleeding though it's good I can see how you would have to like wash this and between each use cuz it's already starting to get quite like stuff I guess that's no different to a brush in a pot eyeliner but at the same time when you're buying at a liquid eyeliner you don't really expect that you're gonna have to do that I guess because it's not inside you know like a normal liquid eyeliner you kind of insert it back into the liquid so it would stay liquidy whereas this is like in a cap so I think moral of the story is I really like the applicator in the end the brush is actually nice and easy to use apart from like I said to get a sharp wing it's not sharp but I think that was really easy if this twisted it three times and nothing came out next up we have it mascara of course and we've got the hourglass curator mascara and I've never tried an hourglass mascara before and actually they've got a few mascaras that are rated really high this one is not though so this one is curator realist defining mascara rated 1.9 and it's $57 what is it what does this mean I use this product with the recommended instrument and it definitely wasted my money it's really clumpy too much product starts clumping the bottle after four uses someone else did that too it's so weird looks cool but I need to look up instructions what is so confused how do you get it out thick curator lash instrument into the mascara and coal ashes from roots took using a zigzag motion flip the tool okay so I can't get this open so I'm assuming it's not supposed to open but this is dry so I shake it did I drop something this must open I'm going to search your video someone using or just go in am I meant to friggin buy that separately the choke like the instrument because if so that's so stupid can someone please tell me like I don't care if I had to buy that separately that was not clear on this product page it doesn't say please buy the friggin one I am pretty sure you're supposed to buy that separately like why couldn't they tell me that I don't know I don't understand it doesn't say like warning it literally just sees ok I guess this is designed to use exclusively with the Cure a dilash instrument but like I would assume it would come with it because it didn't say break it come separately or anything you know how am I supposed to know that you guys probably watch more YouTube than I do and you're probably all like - Shannon I'm sorry I didn't know that if you want me to do a first impression on it cuz it looks really interesting it's like a this little like brushless tool and it's so expensive I mean I might as well forget buy it now because like I could do a whole video about it and we could test it against like my favorite mascara from another brand or something let me know if you want to see that and I will let go purchase it I want to punch myself in the face right now ok so I just looked for another mascara that's available on mica this one isn't necessarily rated really low it's a car go to 3 star in a 5 star this restock just says like it's okay designed to promote thicker longer lashes and it's got ingredients in it to strengthen your lashes as well and this is what the brush looks like kind of interesting looking it's a little bit different it's quite wet it's definitely quite lengthening but I'd say it's not very volumizing at all but I wouldn't really agree with the fact how they say it's thickening I'm still annoyed at myself about that ala gloss 1 all over my eyelid I would agree with that person like this is just like okay definitely is not clumpy whatsoever it looks nice on those lower lashes that's for sure so the lashes I have here from nikkor cosmetic oh these are the defining lashes defining false lashes look how creepy this is it's like go to knows these cost $22 just kind of pricey for lashes in my opinion well I mean if that was super detail but they're very natural you know so got a couple of four stars couple of a couple of one stars a couple of two stars these were so heavy I ended up taking them off after an hour that were overpriced and not worth it someone else said one pay usually likes me one month but these ones didn't last some people say they're beautiful easy to apply natural delicious look so pretty there like nice little clusters and have an invisible lash band so these are the kind of lashes I would use for volume because as you can see that like longer than my own lashes so that's how they look what do you think now let's finish off this video because it's probably an 8 year long video tour like always the lip pencil I have here is in the shade tough tomato that's right I think I got like orange or something so I wanted to do something bright so this is tough tomato 47 dollars for a lip pencil it's right at 2.8 dry and cakey the pencil is very very waxy so you need to heat up in my hand it's too hard this isn't not looking good for me because as you guys know this is totally once again a personal preference but it's like how I didn't like the nice lip pencils because I don't like hot lip pencils I prefer creamy lip pencils personally it's definitely hard but it's not as hot as I was expecting from the reviews it's definitely very pigmented but to be honest I would never spend forty seven dollars on a lip liner I don't hate it like I feel like I could keep this and get use out of it okay and then I had searched for the lowest rated orange lipstick I could find came out with this one which is by mechanics it's rated at a three point four and it's thirty one dollars which is a very reasonable price here in New Zealand thirty one dollars for a liquid let's say that's not bad nice color awful texture good color interesting texture most terrible I could look I've ever tried love the color but oh my the formula and applicator the applicator is massive and awkward there are quite a few five stars but then there's some like really low ones which obviously made a bit lower rated especially if it when I was looking for an orange lipstick so this is what the packaging looks like it is it completely opaque and it says hot to trot on the top which is the colour with a little like plastic bubble they look at is not that bad I love it the pay's like this this is like what I have with my liquid lipstick if I XO beauty like the flat applicator it's my favorite because you can your really precise line I guess that just depends what you're used to personal preference once again such a pretty color it's not really alright it's more like a kind of what a melon pink or something it's a very lightweight just applicator is so fine to you so I definitely disagree with that person doesn't feel heavy it did definitely go a little bit streaky when I rub my lips together so I think it's one of those formulas where you want to put it on and let it dry without like rubbing that was fine okay so here we go it's matte now it looks really pretty like a rose velvety kind of matte finish I don't hate that obviously I have to wear it all day and like feel how it felt on my lips all day long but that color is super cool I like the color and per formula like the application was so easy I didn't think that was difficult obviously personal preference once again whatever so I'm going to keep that and then the last thing we have here is a singing spray so this is really affordable too it is $28 for 150 ml so that's a good price and it was rated 2.6 out of 5 most of the reviews say it's a really good product that's just the nozzle we all know how much I like a good nozzle that's why I dick lamm blow closer is one of my all-time favorites like the mist let me just like I'm just gonna spray it over here first okay definitely on my hand I could feel some like bigger blobs but didn't feel too excessive so I guess let's try it on the face smells kind of like hairspray but not in a bad way but you know there's really fruity hair sprays okay yeah I put in my iya stings that's one of those sitting sprays you spray on is it taste bad it feels wet like it lands on your face and you feel like you've just been sprayed by rain but it didn't leave big on oh dude okay up close the dish so it sounds like it's a good product it's just the spray bottle so that's the completed look I don't love how the skin looks now you know what I might keep trying that foundation with a lot more fake tan and with my neck powder obviously I ended up agreeing with most of the reviews I think the lip products were both good the lip liner isn't like my ideal formula but I feel like the reviews were a little bit harsh the liquid lipstick I felt like some people were being very harsh once again personal preference I know I know but in my opinion I thought it was really good it does feel a little bit drying but it is very net so it's just one of those things that comes with that you know I love the highlighter I really really really like it like personally all over my face as well it looks so stunning the blush I like I'm gonna say I love it but I do like it and I can definitely imagine me using it again I left the color for like a natural look the eyeshadows didn't end up being so good the mascara couldn't try it the liquid bronzer I hated the foundation was kind of like 50/50 you know I look at my base now and I'm like so good this thing like I said 50/50 like I use this quite often on my videos cuz I love the contour color but I can see why people wouldn't want to buy it because of all the extra you know so I'm really really sorry that I forgot about the primer oh definitely use it in another upcoming video I'll do like a full face first impression or something like that and I'm really sorry about the concealer situation I thought I had it but I obviously already got rid of it so let me know what you thought of this video obviously my next one will hopefully be a little bit better than this one because obviously I forgot stuff this one so make sure for the next one to get my under control if you did enjoy this video regardless please give it a thumbs up I would really appreciate it can't stop looking at my lip color I'm really happy with it it's definitely more pink than I thought it was gonna be I thought the swatch was orange maybe I was just imagining things it's stunning though like I really like it and I love the way my skin looks now so there you go and I'm excited to keep trying that boy Brown concealer - it's a little bit of creasing happening but I didn't use an under eye setting powder so I can't really judge that I'm gonna talk to you has Minnie's video I'm just glad I'm not an orange miss anymore kind of balanced out so well done me okay bye

subscription service for liquid lipsticks and it is usually $19.99 a per month which is really affordable because you get three different colors every single month in my opinion I just think that's a really good deal also every single month that you get all three colors they're always different you never get the same at three colors so it's a really good way to kind of expand your makeup collection however if you do come across some colors and you think don't like them those are not gonna suit me I'm not interested you can it skip them up or you can trade out those colors you don't

lipsticks are still so cheap anyway let's move on to the swatches and if you do think this sounds like your cup of tea and you think you would enjoy the service make sure you sign up for the holiday

for the holidays it's or pretty okay so this is what the packaging it normally looks like which is so stunning rose gold by the way these are also cruelty free which is amazing and made in the USA so yeah this is the limited edition it's sparkly silver packaging it's so cute let me wipe off this lip color I'm currently working by the way tutorial coming it very soon for this entire look it's my video I did where I bought all the Sephora like highest-rated makeup and then tested it on my face to see if I agree with the reviews it'll be up soon okay so I'll show you quickly a close-up of the three it colors you get these are so beautiful I feel like they'll suit so many different skin tones as well they have very wearable more V tones which are very on-trend and I feel like you're gonna look really pretty with the makeup I'm wearing they look kind of similar on the true but I'm sure they want on the lips so let's try them out okay I'm gonna start with Venus let's have a look you can see how pigmented they all when I put them on this or appreciate I am so happy with this color this is definitely right in my Holly if you guys know what kind of colors I like it does dry down it completely matte this color is just very wearable it looks perfect with this eye makeup also the smell of these so delicious I just straight-up think these are awesome so there is the fifth shade honestly this color is like legit now it's completely met like look how beautiful nice up we have it Madrid okay let's plan Madrid yes before we learn of these is almost like I don't know like a mercy met formula it's not like it straight up mousse or anything but it's a very creamy formula that's a good way to put it so that is Madrid it's a very beautiful deeper more then I felt like this will show a lot more skin tones than the previous shade obviously if you have a deeper skin tone than me this will look beautiful especially it's like more of a nude as well I love it there rosy undertones to this color as well it's so nice and here's how it looks once it dries down a bit I love it I can really tell them that I love like all of these shades because more is like my favorite right now and this is just so beautiful I can tell this is the kind of color that Hamish likes on me as well he loves colours like this and then like oranges it is very pretty by the way I don't know what's happening with me here today it's just a myth so I've just like I don't know it is not cooperating okay NIC shade so it's Madrid this one's called Naples so Naples is early deep this is giving me feels this color is so rich like that's the only way to describe it it's just such a rich like deep more Brown I don't even know it's just so rich this gives me like a hot chocolate feels like it just is so homely and comfy looking it's got that kind of vampy effect to Exeter's so taking my skin tone of course if you have a darker skin tone or a medium skin tone it's gonna look different on year and I feel like it'll look amazing okay the lighting is changing but yeah this gives me like hot chocolate feels it's like a hot chocolate more color it's definitely not a pure brown it's got that kind of like purplish undertone to it but it's giving me hot chocolate feels I love it once again this is Naples so as you could definitely see they do all look super different on the lips these might be some of my favorite shades yet I feel like I said that every time that seriously I love more I love them all and these are just so beautiful I feel like he'll get a lot of wear out of every single one of them and then like I said if you sign up with my code this month you'll get two free lipsticks instead of just one like normal when you sign up taking your total to five lipsticks for 10 bucks

so you could get these ones although we hate some others to choose from as well so I'm gonna swatch for you this color here which is called a hotty toddy I love this one so much it is one of my favorites well eyelash like literally almost came off when I sneezed it's so weird so that's hotty toddy it's a very beautiful terracotta brown color you guys know I love the word terracotta I love terracotta colors like these very warm Browns and as you can tell compared to this month like it's very orange compared to like being more pinky purple so yeah that's definitely want to make favorites and then another one of my favorite is this shade here which is called it Cosmo you will die this is exactly the type of color I was talking about that Hamish loves me in leaves like vibrant like orangey colors this one's more of an orangey read but this undertone okay that's like a terrible application that can we appreciate that color it is so stunning I love it this eye makeup too it

hi everyone so today I was looking through my little withdrawal of foundations that I need to do what I know this eyeshadow and hit my foundations and I was trying to figure out which foundation to do a first impression on it today and I thought I would do the G way essential high coverage cream foundation because I have some problems today so I definitely want some full coverage so it's the perfect opportunity to give this a go I am quite excited for this not gonna lie it's also at this moment which is a high coverage that ultimate coverage it by bigger but I don't know I guess mine egg pie is coming out today I just spotted this shiny packaging I was like by the way if you see any little flakes it's not dandruff I just have a crap ton of dry shampoo in my hair it's not even funny also I'm gonna be filming a Christmas tutorial today so maybe it's probably gonna come out super crazy at the end of this video and I'll link the tutorial down below sorry I'm like totally procrastinating perfect rating right now so first things first I am it going to I'm going to look this up online see what it costs see got what it claims to do see the shade range okay so it's on Joey's a website and it's fun Beauty lish and beauty babe I'm gonna go on their website it's been rated four point nine out of five with 11 reviews it costs 38 US dollars however I just clicked out of a little pop-up on the joy website it said you could get twisting off I think comes in 17 different shades and here are the canova swatches I did receive every shade if you watched my blog you might have seen all the shades they don't really have any super dark shades they have a lot of kind of paler shades so the shade range isn't like 10 out of 10 but we'll see how it works and it does say more shades coming which is really really cool so hopefully they have a wider variety after that it says supreme coverage lightweight and long wearing which sounds amazing I love lightweight foundations by the way I have been abusing these what appeasing them but I've just been using these today I'll put both of the first impressions this one was like a Sephora fist impression like trying out Sephora's highest rated makeup this one here and then this one I did a first impression a video all about it all hours I have been obsessed with these two I've used them basic every time I've done my makeup since using them for the first time in videos so really enjoying these I think square packaging is like a trend right now anyway getting so sidetracked let me finish reading this it says it has a airbrushed met finish smoother small amount of the concentrate of warm large the skin with joues essential precision at foundation brush and buff to reveal at your perfect complexion it has come a mile extract you can extract hyaluronic acid tripeptide a complex it's met it's oil free it's vegan it's gluten free it's paraben free 20 mil oh that's a lot less than normal 20 mil which is 0.6 8 fluid ounces but people are saying in the reviews that you literally need the tiniest amount so I guess if that is true obviously it's probably still gonna last you about same amount is a different foundation okay so let's just dive straight in I'm going to prime half my face like always just so I can see if there's any difference with the application and longevity with a look cetera don't know what this is okay so on half of my face I'm going to use my hangover primer by Too Faced it's to this side I love this Ivan actually used this in a few weeks it's one of my favorites okay so I have picked out two shades for myself hopefully one of them matches me today I boys I can always try and mix them so I have porcelain and for little swatch both for you cuz I have like a tiny but if they turn on but not much i scrub most of it off this morning so I'm kind of like an awkward shade right now by the way the pump is very controllable like really easy to control also this feels amazing first impression and also the packaging like I said it's square but I mean I didn't talk about it very much I love the packaging and it's not too heavy but that shade looks bloomin perfect almost see that was porcelain nullus to form which is a little bit darker they'd be perfect for me I think when I have a bit more fake tan on it might even be a little bit pale when I say turn on but for now with almost no effect hand on I think I'll start with porcelain I can always add a little bit of the data one if it's too pale so I'm just gonna actually take some of this and yeah and by the way I am using my brand new marble brushes by Expo PT it's so pretty this is a round face brush this pimple is so sore by the way it's like a big a blind pan boy probably should've knew where maker but whatever I can heal LOI under my bedroom door he does this thing where he stick since never Sun already goes it was such a girls night it's just like blowing the air under there anyway so I'm gonna take one whole pump which is huge no let's distribute this it feels so light weight on your finger like I don't know if that makes sense but just the way like it spreads it's like so silky it doesn't feel thick like a moisturizer or anything like that so this is the unprimed side Wow it is full coverage look at that okay I definitely think one pump for the whole face is more than enough I'm gonna go ahead and do the other side too and see how blends on top of the primer okay straight away I prefer this doesn't happen very often but prefer the way it looks on the prime side it just looks a little bit more and I know multi-dimensional it's very met on the unprimed side like it looks a little bit heavier so you like one pump all over my face it's almost too much I did use a little bit here of course but like still so I'm just gonna keep buffing it out don't bring it it's out my neck wow this is the kind of foundation that really does cover everything every frickle Wow like I look crazy right now like I need some bronzer stat so this foundation is not for those of you who like a natural look this looks like cake face it doesn't like it doesn't look I shouldn't say it looks cake face it doesn't look cakey really like once you bleed it out probably it's just you know like you can tell you're wearing makeup cuz it's so flat but yeah I definitely prefer the prime side I think it looks a lot nicer than the unprimed side and it doesn't look as heavy for some reason I think the color is pretty good once I put on some bronze I think would be perfect holy moly though it's even coming up like my frickles which nothing comes up my freckles it looks quite heavy on my nose just wipe the exists over the foundation off my brush so I can gonna oh it's really showing up every dry patch of skin uh Wow okay hello exposure so you can see every a little bit of texture you do my nose where I've got like quite dry skin it's kind of gripping too dragon can you say that you can and same thing that don't have head you know like pimple treatment on so it's obviously dried out my skin a little bit just around here and you can definitely see that however on my cheeks where I've got no dry skin it looks bloomin great so this perhaps would be bitter for like people was normal to oily skin maybe I mean I don't have oil a skin so I cannot confirm that but if you have oily skin do your research and I definitely like just looking at my skin I think it might be a bit of oily skin the coverage is definitely there whoa look at that you guys know if you watch my first impressions often not much covers all of my freckles like there's a little bit peeking through the more I blend oh I think I'm bleeding some of it away yeah it looks all for my nose look at that that's bad and it looks really drying on my eyelids too anyway let's do some concealer I might put some concealer on top of my nose and hope that it doesn't make it worse just because it might help it look a little bit smoother I don't know let's try it today I'm going to use my vanilla by nas the submit' complete concealer okay I'm gonna use my round eye brush it looks better I don't like the foundation under my eyes I don't know if you'll be able to see but look how smooth this site is compared to their site like this is so much better my skin has a lot of stuff on it right now it doesn't feel heavy it just looks kind of heavy like I'm blending this concealer on top and it's kind of like breaking up a little bit it still looks a million times better on their side so I'm going to concealer this side too of course even though that foundation definitely covered my under eye circles pretty much I just don't like the finish of it under my eyes so if I use this again I'll probably just avoid the eye area I'm just going to put a little bit of this concealer on my nose they look so much better just looks cakey a if now but at least it doesn't look all like broken up okay so with those two products it definitely covered the breakout I'd say by itself it didn't cover it perfectly but I think it's just because it's such a raging friggin pimple it's so red any normal breakouts I think it would cover just no ones like this that are like literally like protruding I'm just gonna see everything quickly I'll be right back okay so I just eat my foundation with my cover fix my eyes I used to keep one day sitting powder the Peschel one and I my brows with that makeup for the brow pin thing and submit gimme brow so this is how we are looking I have to say if you have dry skin I just wouldn't even blow that already - it's like sitting into my expression lines a little bit like it just feels dry I think yeah I think it's just like too much I feel like if I use a stating spray it would be a complete different story however of course I just want to see how it lasts by itself with no sitting spray but just without cities raela as it is with a look I didn't even use very much powder I didn't that's one thing I did not have to use much powder because it sit - like a matte finish without actually needing much powder at all so I just did a light dusting where I've got dry skin so nose and chin a little bit between my brows it's definitely gripped onto those areas quite badly however unlike the lower perhaps my cheeks and stuff where my skin is quite smooth it looks beautiful so I definitely think if you have really nice skin texture and you know you just want a full coverage if you've got like oily skin or something I definitely think it's a good one for that we'll see how well it weighs though throughout the day so that is that I'm going to continue doing my makeup now it is 10:00 in the morning so we will see how long it lasts and Sewer looks like later definitely very impressed by the coverage but so far like I just don't love how it settles on my skin oh my god could this be a foundation that I don't fall in love with maybe hello everyone so it is now almost 12 o'clock it's been a couple of hours and I'm not like super starts with this honestly I am so happy with how my makeup turned out today apart from the base like I feel like my base is letting me down a little bit from far away it looks perfect because it's such a full coverage but up close it has like kind of separated a little bit and it does look better on the prime side I just want to put that out there it looks white there on the prime side if I show you quite dark like I don't know if you can see but it's kind of hot because I've got the bronzer and everything on like it literally just died separate you see these little like veiny bits like that's because the foundation is just separating look you can see it in here so like from far away it looks fine but up close I'm just not start with it and it's just sinking into expression lines like hey I feel about it whoo you guys tried the sleeping no down below if you have tried it I just don't think it's very good for my skin type perhaps oily like I said but you'll have to like look that up because I don't know whether since I can't say it was certainty this is just peeking through but that's just a horrendous pimple like all down here look at that just so cakey and separated and just like this is just not my favorite I'm obsessed with the coverage like for something full coverage but it just does not sit nicely on my skin once again on the prime side it looks a lot better um so if I try this again I'm definitely gonna prime and I think I would definitely use this eating spray to hopefully keep it like in place but I mean I just don't even know if I'll bother using this again I guess we'll just see how it continues to us throughout the day there are typically some positives to this product but at the moment for my skin type there's just a few more negatives which is quite rare like most of my first impressions work out so good so I'm kind of shocked ok so it's 3 p.m. so it's been off for five hours and you see hurts all just wiped off I wiped off my lipstick because my lipstick smudged here and I literally just like took a tissue went like that and the makeup just rubbed off and then I took off through some my lipstick and it came off so easily like I'm just gonna touch up on camera so how is it looking like from where you can see me you probably think wow that looks really good up close I'm just not feeling it let me zoom in this lighting is like 10 out of 10 lighting by the way so you can see everything hopefully at least go real close around my nose it's melted a lot you can see all the texture on my skin and hair looks cakey it's creased up here it started to fake down here it's not too bad like you know like that's kind of normal for me I would still be happy with that that was the only problem down here so at cakey like down here look like the hair it hasn't sunk into pores so give it that it just does not look good on any kind of dry skin texture whatsoever how like hey he looks like my nose like in here it's just so he'll be looking it doesn't feel heavy um it just looks quite heavy I was quite excited to try this but I'm just feeling like it's not for me let me keep it on until tonight though because I want to see how it goes over you know like 12 hours or at least like 10 hours or so the color is really good though I like the color I think it's just who met me and not very forgiving look at it in the dark like it's a chunky and that's not even where I just touched up either like that's from this morning look at that hey guys so it is now 7 o'clock yes 9 hours and this is actually going to be my last update because I really just want to get this off my face it's mosted a little more around my nose which I'm not super stoked about and it just is looking K here and cake here on my dry areas also just like peeled off my nose so don't know what's happening there I don't remember touch my nose or anything or rubbing it so it's just really strange even the places where it looks smooth it still just looks heavy and kind of separated like I don't know if we're us it just looks so chunky and cakey so I think you definitely need it to have a super hydrated base I did some research just before and some people said to use like a primer oil and then to put it on top of the primer oil to make it go on super silky smooth and obviously super hydrated so I could try that but at the same time like compared to some method that Nations I'm just kind of like and like it's just not my favorite at all as far as like super full coverage I would prefer like my Mike Jacobs remarkable or the Kat Von D lock-it foundation I think it's called or the tight Emma's own Ian forest one you know like there's just so many bitter full-coverage ones I have to say this is one of the best coverage of foundations I've ever used but just the way it sits on my skin is just not worth it and my skin isn't even like super dry feeling today I definitely like you know during winter and everything it feels a lot more dehydrated and even sometimes flaky than it is today it's just not that bad yeah just considering I don't know it looks like it's faded a bit more down here as well like it just doesn't look amazing doesn't feel amazing that's my Varitek's so let me know if you guys have tried this and let me know your thoughts if so like I said I definitely think this is one of the most full coverage foundations I've ever tried so if you are looking for something like that and you have maybe oily skin or just super smooth skin you could give it a go and see how it goes for you I know you can get start and pulls on the zhihui website so there could be a good way to do it just get a sample first and see how it looks if you have a dry skin don't go near it at all if you've got any flaky skin or tasted skin I just I don't think you'll like it at all so I don't love how it's like giving me this wrinkle right here like what is this that's just gross like honestly I just want to like wipe my face right now like it just comes off look at that I'm not even rubbing that hard look at that granted I have concealer on my nose too but like so girls look you can see in that lighting cut you well anyway I will talk to you guys in my next video thumbs up if you enjoyed this video even though it wasn't a great outcome I'll talk to you guys again soon [Music]
