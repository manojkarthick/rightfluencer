We're discovering the world that once seemed much smaller to us. With every discovery, our photos are coming true. Not only should we appreciate those precious moments that we discover, but we should remember them. Remember and try to freeze them. From kiss to kiss. From journey to journey.   Seeing on a photo is one thing. Seeing with your own eyes is entirely different. Here and now. From photo to photo.           They say one should leave a mark in this world. But maybe it's more important to let the world leave its mark on you. Because it's you that contain seas and oceans, islands and continents. It's in your eyes where sunrise and sunset can be seen.   It's with you that I feel the energy of life. With you, every new day is the start of a new story, our story. This world runs around you and me. Streets, cities, countries are passing by us.   We were meant to learn to fly, to be able to see the world that we had only seen on pictures,         Where will we be tomorrow?

 cheers so you want to   ask where we are   we are on Kamchatka   of this plant   we are in the city   where people in our   the country meets   dawn first   By the way, you know till   moskvy like me   it seems to be somewhere 6780 three   kilometer away from the lookout   the truth itself is   Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky   I suggest immediately   to go on well   the beach   but we cube the cube   let's go to the beach   Kamchatka is   boundless expanse   volcano mighty quiet   ocean and volcanoes   the Bears   volcano surfing and   snowboard   simultaneously in   ukraine and nothing   forgot to me it seems   volcano for the whole trip   there were only five of us   days therefore route   we had to choose   the most intensive   way I could   lost their way   see who I am   and you're not here   teenagers help   build a route   Masha build and Koran and   good here at   really no me   here too   definitely like   But we need to get   to clap Russian   the beach is black there   volcanic sand   scattered by the harsh   by the wind at 30   kilometers by the way on   acting beach will be   camp of surfers   Surfers and I   suggest today   right there to stay   camp out   if you divide   bonfire then I   prepare this   Dagestan's wife to me   pro cooked henk   says you can   infinitely help   please such   big beaches   rarity   volcanic lava   instead of the usual sand   turquoise   and white foam wild mind   favorite place   inhabitants of Kamchatka and   came Uzi then   specially behind the scenes   we were simply stunned by   of all power   the power of the passion of the quiet   ocean and we could not   stop the cold   wind and rain   at first we are just like   children ran along the beach   collected all   shell pockets a   then they just kept silent   and listened to how noisy   ocean   this is super luxe   mega hotel with a view of the   ocean   how we will sleep we   we will sleep now   break it here   camping   come see this   tent kitchen what there   there is probably   deliciously prepared   this   the tent received   the first michelin star on   Kamchatka   well, very cozy i   you will say so very much   cozy and us   cold do not act   how we will bask   but like the old ones   times are in fact   nature is very   beautiful on prom.ua   of course it's raining   around us everywhere these   drops dribbles in   our tent is young   naturalist and   yes, someone has legs   although the substrate   the rain stopped at night   and we met the first   dawn in Kamchatka   and all this for the sake of one   frame   dream come true 1   Daghestanian surfer on   all Pacific   coast city ​​you   I am sure that you will go   ran   let's not   Think about it and   water will be warmer   water temperature at   this achieves   maximum plus 15 in winter   she is near the foot and   now about the same   and my husband is trying   conquer their ocean   wave   look from the side   very nice and everything   for some reason   agreed after all well   but because it rides   professional   surfer my attempts are not   were crowned with success and   I do not understand how they   ride in a   cold   the weather in Kamchatka   very changeable and   Today the beach is quite   do not know the time   make a frame follow   Behind me   see our videos from   beach and how.   let's tell very much   what is currently engaged in   we are now   floating in Avachinskaya   bay and go quietly   open, I would say   Pacific Ocean for this cause   what to get on   urns urns there   rookeries of sea lions   in fact in these   about 1000 fish   and they are listed in   the red book   came there often   three hours a brother and on   ways I suggest   Catch the men crab   Kamchatka   that here Michael will go   often catch on   scrub every even   be engaged in that   is able to do so   for a coffin meal is not   therefore I will say   good heavens are you my   Well, like me   has stopped   deep back   half a turn back   as all this is   all together all   within 10 minutes   michael caught us   dinner   we caught crabs   shear on it is caught   usually in a grid but we   now a couple   caught with their bare hands   and yet it is called but   collapse because he did not beat   on it it is right that   the meeting place wants to   here look how   beautifully yes I study   I understand what is this   I'll bring it to my brain   and coasts and   azure or south   italy is our   country then Kamchatka   it's very beautiful and   Kamchatka   reveals its   best sides of the toe   except in   three hours   I do not have houses and people   not civilization   the feeling is not touched   clean strong   nature and people   becomes simply a   ant   this is where   rookeries of Steller Sea lion they   do not really like when to   he comes a man   we so wanted   to imprint these fabrics   city ​​of high shock   where is your dad there   I guess I'm damn right now.   big sportsman   iron leave no what   are healthy   worked as a couple   eat what there scrub   what a typical meal   the inhabitants of Kamchatka are   of course crab   now we have brought water   to boil so on   circle and neatly   stack   we lay not simply   input and seawater   cover and   I think minutes 3 city   what did you do while I   brewed the krava I was catching   hedgehogs and now I have them   cleanse look this one   urchin   the mouth's teeth, they have   very needles   contrary because   if they come under   your skin and pull out   that they are very   break you forgive   look here at it   there is a screen for now   will try   on something fishy   so the color shows that   he is ready to   meat is good   moved away from the shell   tell a secret in   local residents after   how we welded   crab we lower it   cold water

and what I can to   in fact very   beautiful and it seems to me   Today, from the ocean to us   absolutely   other Kamchatka to me   it seems that very   important in any verse   especially in the wild   nature is always able to   tune in and   feel that either   other place when it   will open   On this our   travel to   Kamchatka is not   ended like us   stormed volcanoes   look in the following   video

apparently removed it   for our frame but   here near there is   caves to us   it is necessary   make footage we   just do not   surrender to go to   caves there too can   be very nice well   that the caves have gone   then the volcano is not   conquered next time   there is a reason to return   up to 10 kilometers and   a completely different kind   long day of descents   and ascents   love   help me come on   that let's help   you visually   change clothes 3 for   frame   Well there is not   we did not succeed   rise today to   burning volcano   watch it   craters   but a few   hours we got to

    It's been a long time that I realized that in isolation, "we" is just two separate letters. These two letters can only work when they're together. With you, camera has become a part of me. With you, I understood that...The moments are precious.     I've always been able to live in our moments. Capture them on camera to experience them once again. I wanted to take them with me. Time flew by so quickly. Rewind it a little... Who would expect it to turn out like this?   It seems like it was yesterday that I'd captured the uniqueness, ephemerality that once started the longest journey of our lives.     I see you, and I know that you're smiling even though you're looking the other way.   Today I finally came to an understanding that a good journey never has a precise plan. Neither can it have a clear aim. Move forward, act, discover, create, explore. For a journey of a thousand miles can begin with a single photo.
