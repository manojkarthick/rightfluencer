A cake with rippled mixture of butter  sugar  and vanilla baked onto it. Think: spun sugar. Cotton candy. Toasted campfire marshmallows. The burnt sugar lid of the best crème-brulee you’ve ever had. Then march straight into the nearest kitchen to get on this  your weekend deserves nothing less.. Grilled chicken  tzatziki  pitas  and a salad -- a great big help-yourself platter for a small or large crowd -- is what I want every big weekend meal to taste like  and has become a family staple around here.. Everyone knows that pink lemonade > regular lemonade  so why shouldn't the same go for lemon bars? Here  the pink comes from raspberries  and the result encapsulates all the spring-like brightness I'm going to need to get through this slushy week.. This pile of charred broccoli may not look like much  but is unquestionably the most addictive accident to come out of my kitchen. Still not convinced? Try one of the 7 suggested riffs (crispy egg and crunchy crumbs! burrata sandwich smash! fish sauce vinaigrette!) and you too can unleash your inner broccoli junkie.. My mom's chocolate chip meringues -- and the only thing we ever did with spare egg whites growing up -- sound like ping-pong balls on the outside and taste like marshmallows within  they basically dissolve with each bite  which is all the excuse we need to invent reasons to have spare egg whites. (Psst  they're also flourless.). A savory dinner tart version of my favorite soup  replete with the sweetly cooked onions  a hint of broth  and the nonnegotiable broiled cheese lid. This is the exact pick-me-up this dreary day needs  don't you think?. Just enough sunshine (a bright  tart  key lime cheesecake with mango on top) and comfort (a rich cake on a buttery  crunchy crust) to get us through the next March snowstorm.. Crispy  spiced patties with yogurt sauce  pitas  and sometimes a little tomato-cucumber salad too take all of 30 minutes to make and are always a good idea.. Let’s put chocolate in our fruit crumbles. Let’s put chocolate in everything. Seriously  can we talk about how good this was with a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream slumping over the melty chocolate chunks? I think you know what needs to be done.. Oh hi again soup weather! This mushroom farro (which you can seamlessly swap with the more traditional barley) soup is basically our House Soup  the one we make most often  with an intensity and depth of flavor that seems impossible from a heap of vegetables and whole grains. Also  it's done in an hour.. You are 34 minutes from homemade salty  crunchy  caramelized  buttery  and chocolaty candy that will be more memorable than the best gown or worst speech at the Oscars tonight.. Chex Mix  SK-style: The cereal is replaced with my crunch of choice  popcorn  the paprika is smoked  the butter is browned  there's a little powdered mustard and dark brown sugar too. It follows the core rule of snack mixes  which is that the stranger it sounds  the more delicious it tastes.. Psst  if you make this  you can have the first serving with a scoop of ice cream for an above-average treat  *and* have enough left for a week of unexpectedly good breakfasts with yogurt.. A few no-fail tricks to create tiny  crispy  golden latkes for all of your Oscar-viewing party needs. Top with fancy (creme fraiche  caviar or smoked salmon) or simpler but still elegant (cream-sauteed mushrooms  chives  bits of pickled shallot) stuff. Make them in advance; they rewarm and crisp fantastically in the oven.. The best beef stew we've ever had. If you've thus far found beef stew kind of bland and uninteresting  if you've been tormented by thin broths  unevenly cooked vegetables  and tough meat  this is just the weekend luxury for you.. A mile high  glossy and bronzed  with a coarse crumb from a tangle of coconut  cinnamon  brown butter and vanilla  this is impossibly delicious toasted with a pat of butter and light dusting of powdered sugar. I put off making this for seven years and have been making up for lost time since; don't let it happen to you.. New recipe  so fitting for the dreary weather outside  Luxe Butterscotch Pudding: Inspired by a very famous butterscotch budino  I decided my classic  homey butterscotch pudding needed an upgrade: this one is more caramelized  rich  and intense  and we eat it in small portions  with or without a puddle of salted caramel on top. Weekend hibernation begins now.. From a Rhode Island Italian restaurant via a Brooklyn pizzeria  a skillet-baked pink pasta that maximizes the essential charred edges and crispy lid. I cannot imagine a better thing to eat on this great mess of a late winter day.. A one-bowl recipe with almost double the berries of most blueberry muffins and a taller  more bronzed and crunchier lid. These muffins do not judge if the best blueberries you have right now are in the freezer  or you want to swap in another fresh (diced) fruit.. This is my take on a 10-minute noodle dish that also  conveniently  makes pretty use of whatever odds and ends lurk in our fridge  so we can spend warming days outside  not in the aisles of a grocery store.. For the softest-centered brownies with the chewiest candylike lid  no melted chocolate required.... Halfway to meatloaves but so much lighter  these baked chicken meatballs are a forever weeknight favorite of ours -- with a salad  grain or even slider-style in a bun with sautéed greens and just enough cheese to melt it all together. The leftovers are fantastic too.. New recipe  Quick  Essential Stovetop Mac-and-Cheese: We long ago covered the only decadent  party-sized casserole of macaroni-and-cheese you'll ever need. This is not for those times. This is for 15 minutes from now  or when an intense need for pasta with a sauce of salty melted cheese strikes and nothing else will do. And it's single serving  so when your craving has passed  you can return to a life of leafy greens  or  you know  do it again tomorrow.. An exceptional  reliable hamantaschen recipe that works as well as the traditional (and non-dairy) as it does with the dreamy innovation of vanilla bean  browned buttery  toasted hazelnuts and dabs of apricot jam. Who's hungry?. Burrata  freed from seasonal tomato tyranny and treated like the star it is  broken open and spilled out over a full meal of a salad  enriching everything around it.. 6 ingredients  1 bowl  no chilling required  and unlike the packaged ones  they taste abundantly like aged cheddar cheese. I only sometimes share with my kids.. This glorious balancing act of cubes of roasted squash  salty crumbled cheese  crunchy pepitas and lightly pickled red onion with a sherry vinaigrette is one of the best hearty salads I know how to make. If we make it today  lunch will be sorted for the rest of the week (even if nothing else is). Don't take this cake at face value. You may see lemons and blueberry but I want you to see a palette upon which you can paint your countless citrus yogurt cake dreams -- pretty much any flavor combination you can dream up works here. It sends the Sunday Scaries into fast retreat.. I shared a few things I love with NY Mag's The Strategist  and two of them are cheese.. What if we gave chicken the oven ribs treatment  that is thickly coated with dry rub and cooked until falling apart and then finished it with a sauce from the drippings? Indoor barbecue magic  is what.. I crave a good quiche with a luxe  bronzed finish like clockwork on rainy weekends. What sets this apart from other versions is a the unapologetic decadence of a great heap of caramelized leeks and sour cream in the filling.. A lush and creamy cheesecake bar with a buttery graham base  dulce de leche-sweetened cake  and a shiny chocolate glaze that is the exact thing that would kick this weekend off festively.. Pancakes for dinner? You don't have to ask us twice. Still not convinced? These thick but crepe-like pancakes take all of 5 minutes to prepare the batter and 15 more to fry up  and are loaded with greens and herbs. Around here  this passes for weeknight dinner magic.. This recipe requires no peeling  soaking  twice-frying  deep-fry thermometer  temperature monitoring or even stirring and uses a fraction of the oil of classically twice-fried frites. It really  really loves us.. These "melts" are built on a foundation of hearty sourdough with a schmear of Dijon-rich bechamel  a great pile of sauteed mushrooms and so much cheese on top that it spills onto the baking sheet in the oven and lifts off in crispy flakes. I say we go all in.. A velvety ribbon of a brown butter batter folds over diced pear and bittersweet chocolate chunks and tucks them into a famous little show-stealing cake that I lucked into the recipe for  so we can make it at home always.. I credit the bright salad-y finish of parmesan  lemon and sharp arugula with making this ragu feel surprisingly light -- cozy but not coma-inducing. It means we're going to make it twice as often.. These are  trust me  the perfect snickerdoodles: slightly cakey  crackly surfaced and with a sufficient enough amount of cinnamon and butter to make your home smell like the heavens crash-landed right smack dab in the middle of your kitchen.. Cooking your rice until it sticks to the pot (something I was already an expert in) is raised here to an art form  because the crunchy bits are the best bits. Lentils  caramelized onions  cumin  yogurt and lemon juice give it a mujardarra vibe that I find hard to share.. Every time we make this roast chicken  we are delighted anew by how quick it is to make and how shamelessly scene-stealing the dijon-wine-shallot-splash-of-cream pan sauce is. It's absurdly good with roasted potatoes and a green salad. It's even a little elegant  or at least  more elegant than my Monday nights usually are. Have you tried it? I hope you do.. Tiny black lentils and a little "French" finish make this taste like the most luxurious thing in the world without the gluttonous implications  hooray. Eat it soup-style or ladled over rice. Double it and be glad you did.. My friend makes the most incredible chocolate cake -- just a few basic ingredients  plus whipped egg whites  which give it an airy lift and an almost crackly meringue of a lid; the pot you melt the chocolate in is your bowl; it bakes in 30 minutes -- and I bet she regrets ever giving me the recipe because I couldn't resist fiddling with it: richer and more decadent. I regret nothing.. One of my favorite dishes on earth is lightened up here with a thinner  punchier sauce  rice noodles  a heap of cucumbers and fistfuls of roasted salted peanuts and fresh herbs. With mostly pantry ingredients and only 15 minutes of work  resistance is futile.. The antidote to winter comfort foods. Most are soft  rich  carby and white  this is everything but: brightly  crunchy and piercingly fresh. It’s nothing short of a sun lamp of a salad bowl; it improves winter morale.. https://smittenkitchen.com/recipes/fruit/citrus/?format=photo

53 bright  citrus-filled recipes  some savory  some sweet  to offset the drabness of a long winter.. Humble leftover mashed potatoes  raised to their most golden  crisp-edged flavorful calling are as welcome with an egg on top for breakfast at any time of the day  to a side dish for something more hearty. Could you put cheese in them? Could you add more thinly shaved vegetables? Could you freeze them for future meals? Could you tuck them in a school lunchbox? Yes  yes  yes and yes  and you should.. Little bits of cake almost saturated with bracing  boozy espresso then burrowed in cream (that’s ethereally light and fluffy for containing an unholy amount of mascarpone) and dusted generously with cocoa is my favorite dessert on earth  and sometimes (well  mostly on Valentine's Day) I even share.. 7-minute date night dinner: Around here  nothing says love like small clams steamed open in wine  butter and garlic with a tumbler of cold wine and a side of grilled bread. It feels like you're in a restaurant overlooking a beach sunset  no matter how far this is from your February reality.. New recipe  Korean Braised Short Ribs: Some thoughts on the great cooking robot of our times (the Instant Pot)  a new cookbook I'm enjoying very much  and these  so good we made them twice in a week.. A deeply toasted hazelnut butter cookie base and chocolate-hazelnut (coughNutella) filling  we think cold day baking projects should always be this cute.. A cake so rich and tender  you might forget that it's gluten-free  and so sunny and bright  you might forget that it seems like it's been winter forever. Or  at least forgive it for the duration of your next cake break.. Peel and smash: my favorite thing to do with soft-boiled eggs  preferably over a slice of generously buttered toast. Or you can nudge it ever-more-slightly into the sublime  as we do here  with a bit of minced shallot  cream  dijon  crumbled cheese and wilted spinach. Prepare put this on repeat.. Key lime pie is like an in-kitchen vacation  nothing short of luminous rays of tropical sunshine beaming forth from a graham crust. It's also astoundingly easy to make. I always forget I'm craving until it perfectly hits the spot.. A cold day craving: a double-batch of substantial warmth and old-school comfort  basically a hug in a bowl. I mashed up everything I love in other chicken noodle soup recipes (a slip of tomato paste  some dried thyme  a bit of parsnips and leeks  plus all the usual suspects) into one big pot that embodies all of our chicken noodle soup hopes and dreams. Not to oversell it  I mean  but we're all in.. Roasted pears and chocolate chunks are folded into craggy  hearty  tender-centered  crisp-edged  gorgeously bronzed scone that I have on authority are exactly what this dreary Sunday needs.. These sea salted  crisp-edged  fudgy-centered peanut butter swirled brownies are 100% guaranteed to improve all the days that they last.. Carnitas -- those tender bits of pork with caramelized edges and flavor for miles that are the king of taco fillings -- are ridiculously easy to make. (This recipe uses 5 ingredients you probably have around.). A mammoth one-pan breakfast with the works (eggs  cheese  potatoes  spinach) that can be made well in advance and left for guests to reheat and eat as they wake up  plopped in little hands before sending the "underfoots" out to their day's destructive work  or  you know  a week of weekday mornings sorted. Basically  it's kind of a breakfast miracle.. Because it will be 5 o'clock soon enough. Because the blood oranges are delicious this year. Because you'll be a Friday night hero if make these for friends. With love  Smitten Kitchen  Shameless Enabler.. Never underestimate the power of a golden  crisp  thin  fried-but-somehow-not-heavy chicken breast piled with a seasonal salad to quickly become the most popular thing you know how to make.. A mind-bogglingly cute excuse to stay in and bake on a day too cold to go out anyway? Happy to help! This is what happens when white chocolate brownies  dark chocolate brownies and a tiny heart cookie cutter get together for a (totally SFW) belly-swap.. In my neighborhood  there are a few spots that make okonomiyaki all day  and I had to try my hand at them. Heavy on the vegetable  light on the batter  charred at the edges and tender in the center  we ate these with a tangy barbecue-like sauce and toasted sesame seeds and they're all gone now and we miss them. Do yourself a favor and double the recipe.. Citrus -- and by citrus  I also mean butter and cream and chocolate in this beloved cake -- is exactly the pickup a day this slushy  gray and cold requires. I know there are people who don't like orange and chocolate together  but this cake isn't for them. It's for us.. Sizzling chicken fajitas scattered with The Works -- quick pico  avocado  black beans  lazy slaw -- are so popular around here  I have all but stopped asking my family what they want for dinner because they only ever request this. Consider yourself warned.

Tip: I make extra of all the "works" and marinate 2# thighs and cook half on day one  half on day two  to stretch the effort into two excellent nights of dinner.. New recipe  Slow-Roasted Sweet Potatoes: When slow-roasted  the flesh of the sweet potato gets sweeter  louder  and more nuanced than seems possible and the salty  lightly blackened skin skin becomes gets so crispy  you’re going to immediately retroactively resent all of the sweet potatoes you had before for not tasting like this. Plus  two serving suggestions in case "a pat of salted butter" isn't all you needed to hear.. Leave it to the French to master the no-fuss  foolproof  impeccably crumbed yogurt cakes. Leave it to David Lebovitz to figure out how to add chocolate to it.. A quite simple but very kicky (garlic! lemon! pepper flakes! pecorino!) approach to a farro salad that's as good cold (potlucks and desk lunches) as it is warm (with an egg on top  crispy crumbs  or even burrata) that I cannot wait to have for dinner tonight.. Popcorn is  hands down  my favorite snack. It's a vegetable! It's from the earth and stuff! It's... covered in a buttery  cayenne-flecked caramel and tossed with salted peanuts. Oh well  we were close. #notactuallysorry. The thing with this bread -- as if drenching a sourdough boule with sizzling garlic butter  three types of cheese and herbs wasn't awesome enough -- is that it flops open to look like a football  as if it has a mind of its own when it needs to be served. We love it with a big pot of meatballs and repeat this meal long after football season has ended.. "Why make any old banana bread when you can make it with a dark  buttery  trickle-down walnut caramel on top?" is the way we rationalize things on weekends around here.. Show-stealing  falling-off-the-bone (but just a little) ribs  no grill  smoker  or textbook required. These want to be your new football weekend ritual.. Unequivocally the the most popular thing at the Superbowl party (that is  after the commercials)  soft pretzels also make the breakfast sandwich of my dreams.. New recipe  Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup Cookies: I got ahold of one of the internet's favorite chocolate peanut butter cookies and couldn't resist playing: the chocolate is now really intense  the peanut butter a tiny bit salty  and everyone you know is about to be even happier than they already were to hang out with you this weekend.. Nothing causes a stampede like an open-faced Oreo cake  at least around the people I live with. That it's all of 4 ingredients  totally old-school and looks a cloud-shaped wafer wonderland  well  that's just for you.. Starring pillowy  fork tender  flavorful meatballs  buttery caramelized onions  melted gruyere on a toasted bun  I bet you can't remember when you last had a meatball sub this good.. For crunch junkies  sweet-salty-buttery dessert aficionados and grown-ups who used to put potato chips inside their sandwiches but claim to have grown out of it. (Uh-huh.). These are ridiculously easy and are a weeknight dinner savior at least three times a year. Why did nobody tell me wings are so easy to roast or grill on short notice  and that picky kids go berserk over them? Let's make up for lost time.. New recipe  Stromboli: A very layered one  inspired by the scaccia ragusanas of Sicily. This one is deeply American  however  with the flavors and toppings of a great pepperoni pizza and I show you two ways to make it: a humble packet that looks like a pizza croissant inside  and a rustic-looking loaf that is basically a pizza babka. Why choose? Make both.. Should you find yourself in NYC or  specifically  Brooklyn tomorrow  I'll be chatting with TASTE's editor-in-chief at Books Are Magic about deep-winter cooking  weekend baking adventures  and I'll be signing books too. Come say hi?. This is the three-bean chili of my dreams: it works with dried or canned beans  on a stove  slow-cooker or pressure-cooker  with fresh or dried chiles  a lot of tomato or a little. It works in thermoses or freezer packets for future meals  or kept warm in a  slow-cooker when friends come over  and if you make this  they probably will.. I consider it a moral imperative to periodically remind us that this cookie contains everything great about brownies (crackly exterior  plush  fudgy interior  distraction-free chocolate) in a one-bowl scoopable dough. Not that we would be into this sort of thing.. This lasagna has a creamy sauce  cheese  sauteed vegetables  and four layers of pasta and still manages to be one of the most simple  lightweight and completely addictive lasagnas I've made. Don't like mushrooms? Swap in another sauteed vegetable. Just don't expect me to share that curled and crunchy corner piece without a fight.. High on the list of citrusy baked goods we crave all winter are these: buttery  tender shortbread coins tart and intense with lime juice and zest  rolled while still warm in powdered sugar so they absolutely melt when you take a bite. Please tell me when you plan on making them so we can come over and ... "help.". Very Good Reasons To Have French Fries For Dinner Tonight  by Deb Perelman: 
* We're adults  or close enough  right?
* Potatoes are a vegetable.

* Did I mention that they're baked? And that they're as close to golden  glistening  crisp  and glittery-with-fine-salt fried ones as you can get in your oven? 
Hey  I'm just here to help.. I suspect that what we could all use right now is some chocolate pie with a raft of whipped cream on top. Plus chocolate shavings. I mean  this is no time for austerity measures.. New recipe  Banana Oat Weekday Pancakes: A fork-mixed  one-bowl whole wheat pancake that's miraculously not compromised in taste or texture that goes from assembly to plates and mouths in 15 minutes  which means even a human who slacks as much as I do most mornings can pull them off.. Who else sublimates their wanderlust in baked goods? Sit down  you're among friends. With whole wheat flour  lots of yogurt  two formats of coconut and all sorts of tropical variations (mango-coconut  banana)  you can use these as a stand-in for the warm weather to come.. It took an especially pretty and vegetable-laden stack to get me come around to the category of recipes we call "Mexican Lasagnas." Don't let it happen to you. You could save this for a game day snack  but should not  not when it could be dinner tonight. (See above: vegetables. Lots of them.) Repeat as needed  which will be often.. Nobody made you brownies yet today  either? Good thing we're just one bowl and 40 minutes away from making things right.. A celebration of the unapologetically inauthentic and a 10-minute  hearty  hassle-free hot and sour soup that's the best we've had. My only regret is not having made double.. Why does banana bread get all of the love? This simple cake makes magic of grated pears  vanilla  butter  and a little cinnamon for an easy Sunday night treat/Monday morning breakfast.. Craving some old-school comfort to stave of the Sunday scaries? Us too! My go-to ziti is simple  ricotta-free (it's dolloped on the side) and makes bronzed  crispy corners I will swat your fork away to get to  classy person that I am.. This hot fudge sauce takes less than 10 minutes to make  keeps seemingly indefinitely in the fridge  is forgiving of almost all human error  makes awesome gifts  and makes all days that include it better than those that do not.. Intensely flavored broth with succulent chicken and a tangle of rice noodles  topped with everything from scallions to slivers of jalapeno and crispy-fried shallots  basil and cilantro and heady splashes of lime juice  hoisin and garlic-chili sauce that nothing will ever be right without again. It can be hard to go back to just chicken and noodles after this.. Good morning! I have made all the biscuit recipes so you don't have to  and these are our absolute favorite: all butter  buttermilk  sturdy but tender  tall and bronzed and a pretty great consolation prize for being up too early on a Saturday.. Fragrant oranges  lightly caramelized  chilled in their syrup  spooned over yogurt and finished with mint for the breakfast/dessert that might even have the power to make you glad it's January.. Threads of vegetables  ribbons of egg  and a crunchy  zippy sesame dressing tangle with noodles in a big bowl of everything I want to eat.. Do you like Cozy Shack rice pudding? Has the rice pudding you fell in love with at a diner eluded you at home? This recipe is here to make all of your rice pudding hopes and dreams come true.. My favorite blondies are quick  one-bowl  require no butter to be softened and are infinitely adaptable with chocolate or nuts or dried fruit or peanut butter or  yes  all of the above.. New recipe  Sheet Pan Meatballs with Crispy Turmeric Chickpeas: One of the best dinners I've made in ages  this is packed with flavors  textures and color. We scooped it into bowls with lemony salted yogurt and lightly pickled onions and pita wedges and think you should too.
