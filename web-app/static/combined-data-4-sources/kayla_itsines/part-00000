www.kaylaitsines.com/app. pay NO attention to the number on the scales. That number doesn’t know how tall you are  how fit you are  how much muscle you have  how hard you train.

Your warmest DAY temperatures right now  are literally our COLDEST night temperatures in Australia haha! I GOT THIS ... I just need to workout harder to stay warm .. right?? Hehe www.kaylaitsines.com/app. LOL!! I couldn’t see a thing😂😂 ⭐️Skipping warm up !!! ⭐️ For the ladies new to my page  I regularly include skipping in my warm up before my workout! I skip for 3-4 minutes. Normally what I would do is put on a song and skip until the song has finished (because I can’t workout warm up ...or basically do anything without music🤣). Skipping is difficult if you haven’t done it before  the trick is to control the rope and not let it control you! You should know when the rope is near your feet because you have complete control (using your wrists to turn the rope). Also do not use your WHOLE ARM to spin the rope around. Work your speed up slowly!! It doesn’t take long to pick up  I promise ❤️ Also for the ladies asking about the Apple air pods  they are amazing and don’t fall out of your ears no matter how much jumping you do (highly recommend) www.kaylaitsines.com/app. I’m SO excited to have done a surprise workout to kick off to the #BeautyAndBalance month today at #WestfieldWTC with an intimate #BBG Bootcamp!!

It really doesn’t matter what kinda pet you have  laying on the floor with them is the best kind of therapy !! www.kaylaitsines.com/app. #bbgprogress @thewheytofit “What I’ve learned and grown from over these last 4 years is something I couldn’t be more proud of. I’ve learned to never give up on myself and learned to find happiness (even if it’s after the fact) in each step of the process! I’ve compared  judged myself and became my worst critic. Today- I love myself. Your journey is just that  a journey! Find what inspires and motivates you to keep moving forward…If I could encourage anything- find out what makes you happy and never stop chasing it." www.kaylaitsines.com/app. "We have all been placed on this earth to discover our own path  and we will never be happy if we live someone else's idea of life" www.kaylaitsines.com/app @j.diegoph. Earlier in the week I made a post about eating eggs for breakfast. For the ladies who didn't read it  I was just saying that you don't NEED to have eggs for breakfast to get your protein in. A lot of women think that eggs are the only good source of breakfast protein! There are lots and lots of foods that contain protein that you can have! Creating a beautiful bowl like this for breakfast is ALSO amazing. There is no "right/correct" breakfast that you MUST have  it just needs to be a healthy balance of whole foods and keep you full until your next meal (you shouldn't be hungry straight after). Get creative with your breakfast ladies!! www.kaylaitsines.com/app @the_smallseed_. Have you started to dread going to your workouts  when you used to love it? Or maybe you’ve started to feel like you aren’t really getting anything from your workout? It might be time to change it up.. #bbgprogress 💛💛 @thehealthhostess progress using my #bbg program 😍 She says “
BBG has given me results I never thought were possible! I’ve tried so many different forms of exercise  countless programmes & diets & you know what I’ve come to realise... as long as you’re doing something you love  being consistent & eating a healthy balanced diet then the results will come as you just keep living your life!

Here’s four that you can use to dress up that bowl of oats!. CLEANNNNN GYM!!! I do love @tobi_pearce ...but I must admit that the ONE positive of having him in a moon boot and wrist cast for the last 8 weeks (snow boarding injury) is that there are NO protein shakes or 60kg dumbbells laying all over the floor of the gym😂. The protein shakes end up stinking so bad 🤢🤢 🤣

When a child asks for help  are they weak? Not at all. Why as adults do we find it SO HARD to reach out. When in life did it become inappropriate to ask for help!?. Asking for help means you WANT to learn  to improve  to get better ... asking for help is NOT a sign of weakness - don’t ever think that.  www.kaylaitsines.com/app. #bbgprogress 💛@alexiswellness progress using my #bbg program 😍 She says “
For the #bbgnewbies reading this  I can tell you there were no perfect weeks...a lot of weeks I struggled for motivation  I was tired  sometimes lazy  sometimes it felt like a chore (especially in the beginning) but I stuck with it and kept pushing forward each week. Even if I only got 1 bbg workout in a week  I still moved on to the next week. Changes don’t happen overnight  but if you stay consistent  they will happen. You WILL get STRONGER. You WILL FEEL BETTER. .
Take your progress pictures...there is no better feeling then when you think you’ve made zero progress and then finally one week you compare the side by side and are pleasantly surprised to see all the hard work is paying off. Stick with it  you can do this! It’s not about perfection  it’s CONSISTENCY" www.kaylaitsines.com/app. I CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH THIS PHOTO!! I seriously love dogs so much.... to the point that the place I take Ace and Junior to for daycare (playtime with other dogs) had a position open for "Pack leader" (aka -manager) .......and I seriously considered applying hahahahah. The owners laughed and said I was funny... but I was NOT joking.  www.kaylaitsines.com/app @dallasthewalpig. Living a healthy lifestyle might feel like a big  overwhelming goal.
