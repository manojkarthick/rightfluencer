"NaN". "NaN". "NaN". "NaN". "NaN". From editor Ian Livingston (in Gokayama  Japan): There are 21 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Japan. The striking  once-isolated mountain villages of Shirakawa-go and Gokayama were together carved into the list in 1995. In their dramatic corner of Chubu  now just a bullet train and a bus ride from Tokyo  wet mountain snow falls by the foot upon the famed Gassho houses of Shirakawa-go and Gokayama each winter  which is why their thatched roofs are so steep. Inside each house  sweet-smelling wood smoke plumes out of an irori sunken hearth  around which extended families historically huddled for tea and company. Today electrically heated floors and Wi-Fi add warmth for those who still live here—and for guests from across the world. In Ainokura  a particularly still enclave inside Gokayama  six Gassho-houses-turned-inns ask for bookings six months in advance. http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/734 #visitjapanjp #undiscoveredjapan #enjoymyjapan.

From editor Ian Livingston (in Nagoya  Japan): In Japan you find udon noodles all over  the best of which are hand-mixed  -kneaded  -cut  and -pulled from just three ingredients: flour  water and (sometimes) salt. In Nagoya  the pride is in the local specialty of miso-nikomi udon. Ribbons of unsalted udon noodles are boiled in thick  slightly salty broth made from rich red miso and then served bubbling hot in claypots  usually with leeks  chicken  and a full egg. To endure the long simmer  the udon must be made right. At Yamamotoya Okutecho  the udon is made right  and the flour-dusted proprietors will give you a lesson in how they do it if they’re not too busy (which they often are). http://a-yamamotoya.co.jp #visitjapanjp #undiscoveredjapan #enjoymyjapan.

An excerpt from editor Ian Livingston's recent writing on Tokushima  Japan  where he spent two nights in December:

"I have heard it said many times that certain far-away destinations—like Japan—are not worth visiting from America without ample time. Two weeks  people say—that would be enough. Any less  and it's 'not worth it.' It's 'for another time.' The trip's over before it's begun.

Each time a trip is deferred like this  the light infinitum of another unwritten adventure  stuffed for even a moment with the possibilities of a thousand lifetimes  fades out forever. In the Japan example  those lifetimes include the world's best ramen  supermarkets employing robot sommeliers  tuna auctions fetching five figures a fish  wake-ups via onsen  and all the rest that has led at least one of your friends to long for the place with such urgency. As with anywhere  deferring Japan also means deferring places in Japan not yet known to you.

In December  I went to Japan for just four nights. I'd have preferred to stay maybe a year  or more nights than four  but I did not have that kind of time. With an invite from the Japanese tourism office  I simply went to Japan and took it from there. Jetlag beat me up  but I managed to make memories not only in Tokyo but also further south in Tokushima  a place I had not previously thought to visit. Tokushima is a prefecture of slow living on the eastern edge of Shikoku  one of Japan's main four islands. Its onsens and high sandstone gorges provided an amazing and steadying contrast to Tokyo's future-is-now bacchanal.

To be sure  you should go to Japan for longer than four nights. You should give Tokyo—relentlessly  bottomlessly exciting—all the time you can afford it  and you should read this post (https://www.johnnyjet.com/one-day-in-tokyo-japan) about a great day there. But you should also consider prying deeper. If four nights is all you have  Japan will still open to you adventures worth a 14-hour flight and then some—including in Tokushima."

accomplish all this stuff will be around please don't we can sign up for the meeting yes we talked about seatguru before this is that's the kinda thing you're talking about is yeah I mean having the right seat on the plane can make or break your trip especially run coach right so let's see girl pee which one which one is the best seat if it has a power port or not I always try to exit role or a bulkhead but before you fly you always check see I'm sure and find out in the right we find out the aircraft type alright then you go to see guru and you can you make reservation oh I'll probably talked it was fairly new but it's getting better and better because people are constantly in putting their data right never look at the airline's before we talk about it at 10 yeah those wings were presented okay baby steps baby let's get building we know let's say you book online yes but you want to make a change and you call the airline of it you can't it's gonna cost you some money wants 200 bucks but the most aggravating thing is calling the airline and listening to the voice prompts okay so you go to get human comm get human get human this will tell you how to bypass the automation thank you so for air to air canada you just press press one and then press 0 0 0 0 you go over 100 and going but some you can just press 0 or star but doesn't work otherwise sometimes I'm bringing it back to be doing so for US airways you have to press 41 you can know that so somebody and this they must keep it up-to-date to know what they did there's about 500 categories not just travel they have right pharmaceuticals like computer companies you I get way through the dell tech support and talk to a human I love it it's in there okay look up that was a couple get human got jipped human comm similar to get human is called got voice whatever no skype I'm a huge fan of scary andreas when you travel boy that's ready do it right yeah so it's what God waste does is that you lied on you put in your phone number it's a landline or cell phone line and if and what kind of provider it is okay and your passcode to your voicemail okay and what it will do is will email you daily weekly or just once whenever you want all your voicemail so who oversees you want to spend minutes you can just check your email and go good for me and I'll bring the wave file agree that's great takes two minutes to sign up this is fantastic and your trust in there with your voicemail one behind or steal your voicemail I had it like a voicemail from my dad I didn't want to keep the driver this is a way of saying yes that's what I love about it instead of trying to put up the quarter to it then plastic somebody was asking me the other day he said I have this great voicemail on my cell phone how do I get it off thank God was ok and you know what you keep in send messages out with them if you have a headset and you can send it to your boss so if you're over here overseeing a number you can do a silent if you're at home a consideration we smell anything don't ever write no I thought you bought yeah I can't come back my boss good morning sir ok everyone tells you when you travel you need to photocopy everything in your wallet including your path yeah right in the back how'd you go yes but now with the invention of scanners and the internet what I do is I scan everything and upload it to a web-based email a rarely ever use but if that's not secure enough for you there's a website called passport support com based in Australia for 12 australian dollars to give you a year service and their secure servers just to just to upload all your document all your travel document and you can always search that so wherever you are and that's an extra go whale that was a great idea it is but you're showing to support but you always keep a photocopy with you as well yeah the wine exited i do that probably the case on why am I I was in tried to stuff last summer with my buddies up in Czechoslovakia well it takes two Czech Republic check the pot that's right I'll shows my age and I reckon our traveling from Czech Republic Slovakia yeah and my buddy kind of bonehead but he's not watching it anyway we get all the trainees like oh my god and that's quite safe you're washed up and guess who's coming down the aisle Oh have full control we're like we had no idea what's going to happen right fortunately had a photocopy of it so to let them slightly that actually able to go to Slovakia than even on to Vienna and then visiting a zero yep and then they fedex them from the hotel while but also if you lost it now to go to the consulate xerox would help immense mental yeah bro or scan copy scan coming yeah that's what I do I should go my heart rather than a print out a copy whatever i'm gonna try anything yeah okay hang big pan it up okay so if you're going to go to New York or San Francisco or Chicago or Philadelphia or adding some major cities in the US you go to menu pages com menu pages don't save over 6,000 menus in Manhattan alone let's go go there before you're going but this will make you hungry it will but then you can search by neighborhood by type of restaurant or the restaurant and you can find out the prices or you can get me out if you're in your hotel room you don't throw it out everywhere New York City delivers come on yeah yeah say I know you've got a great pasta fazool I want it yeah they'll bring it right over to bring a domain awesome menu pages okay okay okay so if you're going that's amazing you've been collecting this for years 1999 it helps helps make the travel till smooth that's right light explorer com okay this actually fight xplornet sorry what does that come on the front you must be back on it's got net here but if I got it either way okay so if you want to track the flight this will show you exactly what I going down in the ocean let them know that i'll go to one whole hi Alice take a little bit of a version cuz of stomped all over there okay but it shows exactly with the weather is in Hawaii or what kind of took off and how much time you have left before they arrive so he's picking someone up at the airport yeah he's poised to go to the airline seconds you have to dig through and they don't give you a perfect official like that I really don't like this has all that pin data white explorer it off alright well how about if you're traveling overseas people always ask me what would plug ladies I have a french student with me and he says excuse me mysterion you have an adept up for my ipod and i said no all right now would I have an adapter for your french plug if you had God's up what gotta info even though i will tell you from here in canada where we are right now and then you can say where you going to go they were gonna go to Austria it shows you pictures exactly what kind of plug you need to play in the voltage let you know if I may to transform our or not right but if you travel a lot like me you can go to like radio snack or anywhere just buy a universal one will work anybody about this I could give it to my French bag because this has every friend everything he could plug his French thing in here and have it come out and normal oh this is normal I'm saying normal like ours is normal but these are just being a little bit more expensive than just buying a regular decker this is like a puzzle you can only be one of the time wow that's cool Johnny Jett he's the king the Guru of travel and that's something it stuff like this it makes it possible to do 30,000 miles in a month

the marina bay singapore 457 floors up this credible this is the sky / below me is nothing but the ground 57 story this is a karaoke room karaoke room across the hall it's not only a workout room a spa but you can get your hair cut you 
I'm Johnny Jett to travel insider I just had the opportunity to travel down under the Ozzy's proved to me that there's nothing like Australia we're on the Australian outback about to go on a wetlands river cruise here a mary river come with us we're cruising the Mary River looking for Crocs the saltwater crocodile is a largest living reptile in the world the Mary River is teeming with them we just saw two I thought they were monsters they said they're just little babies man I'm afraid to see what this one's gonna look like oh my god that is a monster located about an hour east of Darwin the wetlands are larger than some small countries so there's plenty of room for good times and adventure this is like Disney for nature lovers the lush mary river weapons are a thriving microcosm of exotic wildlife during the ecosystems especially beautiful ecosystems you got to come to Australia because this blows away anything I've ever seen you 
all right crowded skies and packed roads get used to it as a holiday travel season shifts into can we say very high gear a second now Chad Myers is in the CNN weather and travel center and he's checking on all of it for us hey Chad hey you ever heard of a guy named Johnny Jett I have her to Johnny Depp you know I just saw him there on the monitor I think he's ready to talk to you right he is and he has a great website Johnny Jett com his name is jaundice kiala and John has put this website together John Johnny Jett calm and I'm on it right now looking at all of the links and the things you can do do John tell us tell us exactly what you're expecting here and and how people are using your website well this year it's gonna be kind of crowded out there it's gonna supposed to be 39 million people taking the skies the next five days according to triple-a and they're gonna travel 50 miles or more 39 million taking the sky so actually not taking this guy's only eighty percent or taking the sky okay about 4.7 million are gonna take the skies thanks my days I'm good thank goodness okay so now what can we get from your website that is new are there any new TSA no nose oh for sure I mean I'm Johnny Jett dicom we have links to five thousand websites but there's some really good websites out there there's the DHS has a good website it will show you the wait times for each Airport so you can find out what the security weights gonna be like that has live those are live away times it's not alive it's actually historical data okay so what you want to do is you could just look at the maximum and figure that's probably what it's gonna be so let's figure out how long should people be getting how early should they get to the airport this year okay domestic travelers you should leave two hours in advance international three hours three hours really but but if you're smart you want to you want to check in online at home print your boarding pass and don't bring so much luggage you don't need to check luggage carry it on if you're carrying on John can you go and try to get on the earlier flight you know there's an hour there's a flight every hour from laguardia to Atlanta should you go try to get on the irritable you can try but you know what just get to the airport if you if you don't check baggage you can get to the airport later than normal you don't have to be there two hours in advance you can get there an hour and a half hour and 15 minutes and it'll make your experience so much better because most people they get so aggravated waiting in line and then they have the luggage lug bags all around and a lot of times you're sitting there waiting for your bag to come out it doesn't come out I lost my bag twice this year so I ship my bags now what do you think of those new kiosks I'm a big fan of them you know what one problem is people just stand around and they don't go right to him if you see an open kiosk go right to it don't wait for someone to tell you count the line moving the kiosk we're talking about they have self-service kiosks out there where you can actually go check in swipe a credit card whatever your your skymiles card whatever and you're actually get your ticket right there without actually having to talk to anyone but there are two types one carry-on only and one you go to that you can check bags they not get help later on right let's go faster it is but why do that when you can do it at home you can do it 24 hours in advance at home you can print your boarding pass you get your seat assignment that eliminates the chances of getting kicked off the plane anyway or bumped off if it's overcrowded cuz you already have your seat assignment you said something and I kind of skipped over but I really think it's important i'm telling people to do this all the time you ship your bags ahead of time you put it in a box and give it to what UPS or something actually I bring at the fedex ground I think it's cheaper and it takes about five days I actually ship my bag two days ago to go back home to California I'm leaving on Friday and my bag will be there I don't you guys don't you have like change of you know underwear and stuff right with your horse i bring you know you're going away for the weekend it's thanks coach come on i know i know you don't need that much come here people bring so much clothes with them it's for a weekend you don't need shampoo you don't need any liquids so don't bother even bringing that through security your family's gonna have it or the hotel absolutely that's that's one thing i do i check I check my my my shampoo it I got all the stuff and I get there and it's sitting there in the bathroom making a waiting for me when I get to my destination anyway so think about that when you're going to a hotel if it's if it's a decent hotel are gonna have shampoo no packet the three ounce thing the tell me about this this last thing the 133 thing what about the outer 311 okay you had to have it everything has to be under three ounces so if you are bringing liquids it's got to be under 3 ounces has to be in a one single quart bag and it can only be one bag toll you know what I got busted for 3.1 ounce deodorant if they already bring it hey that's you don't need the oderint yes I do sir alright Johnny Jett jaundice Calla from from Johnny Jett calm if you want some information on how to get around how to get around faster and maybe even cheaper Johnny Jett calm is the place to thank John thanks for having me did you know what yes top Josh's took travel segment to a whole other level is it a whole new low Wow you said it you said it but anyway that's so even though I mean you know I've heard people that do the ups and that's not even guaranteed as well because you've had UPS FedEx and you know the United mail service they all lose things as well so we don't want to say give a commercial for them and smart no one's that organized I don't do it online just don't take anything trouble with nothing and bare all there you go buy it when you get there that's a take a credit card that's what my way you guys all you needs a credit card charge it up all right thank you you I well

you can see this is not a normal operation of this fly we're going to be delayed about an hour what we're actually doing just make you guys comfortable we have a passenger work 940 who interrupted the flight when you guys were getting ready for take off due to missing a laptop that passenger has been denied and will not be traveling this evening all applicable fees will apply to that passenger as a result many of you expressed concerns about baggage feet on the aircraft what I'm going to do is just basically reiterate positive bag matches the wise to the National flights currently the TSA does allow for domestic flights in the u.s. slowly to Canada Hawaii domestic departures work bag people does not apply in this case since many of you expressed concern and it's ultimately up to the captain's we are going to we are going to have to dump the entire aircraft and then sift through the passengers bags which will take time which is different from the International fight which have the positive baggage dates and tag numbers associated with each passenger because this aircraft is free loaded it's going to be unfortunate regret it's going to take time keep you guys posted thank you

you take oxygen in the mouse to develop our mask on different scriptures and here on this wine you can feel like tobacco romance first knows and when you move the wine you have red fruit jam blackberries and when you take it in mouth you feel the city team and the balance which is important is a balance between the Italians and acidity on the fatness of the wine and you have to feel back the fruit that's why we do the oxidation and the idea after is to take time to see how long the wine stays in your mouth and the longer is a bit perfect

 welcome back to the full season Thomas great to see you say it's how you doing I'm doing will it's amazing this guy still remembers me after all these years my favorite view at singie is from my room here at the four seasons look at this this is incredible every night I go to sleep with the curtains open so when you check into a hotel room one of the first things you should do is go to the alarm clock and make sure it's off because you don't know how many times I've woken up at four o'clock in the morning because I'm turkey the night before said it he's gone and now I'm in here and I'm wide awake no matter where i stay in the world i always have sanitary wipes and everyone knows the dirtiest thing in the hotel room is remote controls cuz you never know who is staying here before you you wipe all the light switches especially the phone the alarm clock air conditioning takes me less than a minute after all rather have a wine food in the swine flu there is a way to save a lot of money instead of using a hotel phone use your cell phone if you're traveling domestically and if you're traveling internationally always use skype it cost two cents a minute or if someone else on skype it's free when you travel internationally don't worry about getting a whole bunch of converters just buy one and then bring a power strip that way you can charge all your electronics at one time I know that many bar looks good that you got to stay away from it because you're going to go home broke and allow these new mini bars the moment you pull something out they charge you so be careful and here's another tip the night before you check out make sure you take all your belongings out of safe so you don't forget about it and just in case there's a power outage you could have access to it if you want to ensure the best service make sure you tip your maid every day I usually need two dollars we do it every day not at the end of your stick when you leave your room be conscious of the environment shut off the lights it's not that difficult whenever I leave my hotel room I always put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door that way no one get into my hotel room 
I'm Johnny Jett to travel insider I just had the opportunity to travel down under the Ozzy's proved to me that there's nothing like us I'm going to nibble at National Park to check out katherine gorge a great way to see katherine gorge is by taking a boat tour the scenery is breathtaking where the outback meets the tropics and all you have to do is sit back and take it all in katherine gorge is actually made up of 13 separate gorgeous the dry season runs from april to october and it's the best time to visit the park the water is calm during this time invest of all free of dangerous saltwater crocs this makes katherine gorge a popular spot for swimming and kayaking hiking trails are an excellent way to get an up-close view of the ancient aboriginal rock art we got a beach we got a pool what else can a man ask for it's basically paradise 
and are you planning for a weekend getaway or maybe a summer vacation if you are we have the websites that can lead you straight to the cheapest airfares we have a live report coming up from san Diego's number one source for local news this is news 8 at five with fuel costs at an all-time high the days of cheap airfares are seemingly gone or are they tonight a popular website is getting plenty of traffic for offering one-stop shopping for bargain air travel traffic trap oh I should say yeah I'm not sure what I see News eights Tracy Hutchins is live event bird field to clear it up for me traes well stand in barbara Lee you know what spring break is right around the corner of course summer is just a few more months away and I think most of us are looking for those cheap airline tickets well we found one website that actually leads you straight to them it bought it takes though just a little bit of time and patience cheap tickets low prices discounts and deals you could spend hours searching the internet or make Johnny gedcom your one-stop for shopping there's no website out there that has the cheapest deals you have to shop around jaundice cali created the site to help Bruegel travelers just like him he's taken trips across the country and around the world and put together a directory of more than 5,000 travel friendly websites so here's how it works aside from the day's top picks the website has to search engines 14 hotels 14 flights the best part about this is you only have to put in your cities and dates one time and what pops up or seven different websites from expedia to hotwire click on each one find the cheapest fare and you may be surprised how quickly you get your results and the differences in prices a round-trip ticket from San Diego to New York on the same airline on the same days will run you three hundred twenty nine dollars on travelocity 354 on orbitz and 500 forty six dollars on expedia so a little time in research may save you in the long run but what if you're planning a last-minute trip Johnny gedcom can help there too just type in your departure city and a weekend getaway is at your fingertips at discount prices we link everybody the other websites will not link their competitors or anyone else they just want traffic to themselves so what we do is we show you you what websites you need to go to to find the best deal and obviously it's just not one website you just have to keep searching so every minute it's always changing in the travel world it is always changing here's an example of what you can find if you have a little extra money this weekend and maybe some time to you can book a flight from San Diego to Denver Colorado do a little skiing maybe for 266 what about mexico city next weekend for 308 that is round trip or possibly if you wanted to take a flight overseas a week from next Friday you could actually take a trip to Paris for about seven hundred four dollars for three nights that is airfare and hotel including so it depends on just how much time you have and how much research I just made some job I'll take that pack your bags stand thanks Tracy 
I'm Johnny Jett to travel insider I just had the opportunity to travel down under the Ozzy's proved to me that there's nothing like Australia we're in wine country it's not Napa it's not France it's not Portugal it's South Australia this is the barossa wine valley kid painted this picture i'm here with Ralph from life is a Cabernet so tell me about the barossa valley well the thing about the borough so that's really great is that sixty percent of all of the Aussie wine you see in the United States comes from this region here in la brasa there are 75 wineries because it's a transient destination you come here to go to Kangaroo Island you come here to go to the outback you come here to get off of the great train journeys alright but then they find out that it's a wine destination that's get absolutely lost in this great gourmet world's great wine world and so what we do is provide it varies one-on-one experience so we can take them on a tour that just suits them to actually pay for a wine is a rarity really oh yeah there are a couple of places that will charge for a tasting but they're opening to three hundred dollar bottles of wine I think we should go try something right now I listed let's go get someone come on in and try something here Johnny this is a typical wine tasting experience in the barossa very rarely as we said will you pay for anything but all the wild makers and their staff I have to show you all of the great juice Thanks and so we just have a nice little cross section of what they produce here can you get these back in America unfortunately you come we don't exploit any that once the United States at the moment you see that that's another reason why you want to come here because you can't get it back home I'm thirsty I'm there the Shiraz is made here comes from the oldest existing rootstock sharad there are no vines producing anywhere in the world that old so you're really looking at a microcosm of something that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world amazing what we have here is the spring stage because you can see these tiny little bunches of grapes starting to form those are grapes those are very shortly that's a bunch of gray there's a pinheads as these grow and more bunches for don't they'll decide to thin the crop out because they want the bunches they choose to just intensify it a flavor and so it's just like concentrated so these wines will be like nothing you're going to taste overseas we drive yes please these come from high altitude reisling grapes so this is just perfection and this is going to be one of the great reasons you'll have an aggressive alley cheers me I love this place 
alright so what's going on what's your name my name is Tony where you from I'm from Washington DC but I live in germany right now I'm Killy i live in belgium and i'm from south africa my name is antonio i'm from mexico and puerto rico and where are we right now we are in atlanta georgia boy Lana the world code and were you guys going everywhere yeah all 06 countries ya next year 206 countries pics of ethics has no unlocks somewhere over 275,000 miles yeah so I hope you signed up for frequent flyer program and what were you looking forward to going the most Japan yeah how about the least we say some of these countries are going to be a little harder to deal with but it's about finding happiness and if you can find little bits of happiness and everywhere that's basically our goal I agree with her even the countries that you're a little scared of got one a gold layer just to say hey I'm looking forward to all them the ND have any travel tips for anybody act like my biggest rally tip I can give to anybody is pack light pack light packed light roll your shirts really really tight stick it stick all right we learned a new travel tip today it's wipe everything down with some antibacterial cloth there and to make sure that you don't pick up any terms yeah so yeah 
we've come all the way here to Brussels Belgium for one reason and one reason only it's because of the chocolate so we come to a small independent shop run by Christian Manon his grandfather started in nineteen thirties and he's won awards all over the world we're about to go tasting chocolate so what makes your shop so special so I prefer to put mona and nothing to shock not in the packaging but i prefer to put mind goods and I hope you prefer to eat chocolate - so you make everything handmade everything's made by hands and can people come visit here and do it yes yes yes it's possible but I always want to see how the chocolates made me so dark chocolate is just three beans and sure that's it I didn't know that did you know that what it tastes good if you took a square and just do that it would taste like a very big cocoa beans this is just chocolate coming down yes to the recess so this is not going to waste this chocolate is going back knees go back okay and as this go all night long 24 hours not only can mister man and make chocolate in record time he also eats a half pound a day today yes look how skinny are you no wine no because I attended oxalates CIE no chocolate that's why I got a belly lighter in the program the marshmallow man oops already that's the caps and then there we could attend to this in the future how many caps in a day maybe 5,000 5,000 yes behind tis so have you ever had a Hershey kiss or there's no would you ever put nails in your mouth you would never put one of those in your mouth no no no how about like a Snickers bar I'm here at a Snickers yes you put that in your mouth no no I don't leave this room here so first the cap second the filling and then 20 minutes later there it is okay you want to try that when we love the choice so wait for the camera nobody can taste them it's so good I know unfortunately it's time to leave but I hope you guys enjoyed this tour as much as I did especially as much about Nellie did so thank you very much you're overcome and I hope that we get to come back to work or to only taste to both you can pay me in taste

hair 729 729 number one way ticket I was like that's ridiculous yeah so i put in a round trip yeah which is old-school thinking because in Europe you should cost twice as much right yeah but it costs two hundred twenty dollars what yeah so somehow their computers are messed up but that 18 that's just the old way of pricing lmf it's round trip you throw away the second the return ticket we don't take that so no but don't tell him I told you that because it's against airline policy and they can take away your miles they may not like it that you did they don't like that okay because it's kind of beating it but I still wasn't happy with the 220 you want cheaper than that cheaper alright so i went to which budget com whi CH budget com these guys have 115 airlines all budget in 120 countries
