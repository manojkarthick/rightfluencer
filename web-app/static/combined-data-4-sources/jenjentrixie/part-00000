okay hey it's jen from tater tots and jello and i'm showing you how to make it really easy envelope back pillow cover with cording so the first step you're going to do is you're going to want to find a pillow cover of the size that you want i'm using a 26 x 26 then you want to cut out the front of your pillow so for me I liked my pillow covers to be a little bit tight but my pillow the front is just about 26 inches i add about half an inch to all the sides for the seam allowance so it's 26 and a half all the way around so that is that number one step number two is you're going to make the back of your pillow enclosure so what you're going to do is you're going to measure the total of the front and add six inches to the back so you want to be six inches longer because it's going to fold over itself so you can put your pillow inside so there's going to be a three inch overlap so what I did was I took the 26 and a half inches i added six inches does at thirty two and a half inches long and then i cut it in half so these are the two halves right here so that is step number two step number three is for the cording so let's just talk about corny really quick quick there's a couple different sizes there's a big size and then there's a small size and for this project i'm using the big size so what you want to do because the coordinate is a very cute is you want to cover it with what kind of material you're going to put on your pillow and I have a contrasting kind of color that I'm going to use it's just a white material so I'm going to cover this so you wanted you want to have a piece of material so that you can put your trim inside of it and fold it over and stow it so for a small cordeen you could do this with about three inches of material and then you're going to fold it over and spill it right here like this but for the larger you want like four to five inches and so what you're going to do is you're going to put your your cording inside of the material and so with your machine and come over to my machine with me really fast and I want to show you something cool so almost any machine you buy is going to come with a different kind of a couple different types of feet so the foot this is the regular foot on a regular for a regular stitches so what we are using for the cording is zipper foot and that makes it so that you can get really close in to your cording and I'll show you I'll show you how I'm doing that in just a minute so when you point you so the material over your cording you are going to want to use that zipper foot if you can ok so I've done that that is step number three so step number four I have my my cording is done right here see if it looks nice and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to put the cording on to my pillow cover so here's my pillow cover I'm going to put my cording on what you want to do is you want to start at a corner you want to start coming not in the middle of the pillow either probably like about three-quarters the way down one side you're going to start it and you're going to show it but first we're going to pin all the way around and you want the court need to be on the inside of in on the right side up like this because once you put your back on your pillow like this you so it like this then when it's all stone it's going to be have the coordinate that's going to come out so that's why we're doing it that way so we're going to pin all the way on and another tip for when you're doing this it's kind of tricky to get around the corner of a pillow and what you're going to do is you're going to cut just before this you hit the theme and you're going to make some small little cut here come closer I'll show you so when you're pinning it on can you see that see how that makes it more forgiving on the edges so that's what we're going to do we're going to pin all the way around and then um we're going to sew it will sew it on to the front so this is that this will have a front on it with with the cording that's on it so reading so that next so that is step number four pinning step number five is sewing and then I will show you what it looks like so the last step that I talked about we attached the core Dean onto the pillow cover so here it is and I showed you that little trick of how to camouflage the ends see you can't even tell what's not look awesome so that is how you make the pillow cover continuous ok so the next thing we're going to do is the back of the pillow cover and it's an envelope of closure which is a lot easier than doing a zipper so what we did was we have our two pieces of material and I sewed the seam of both of the side so it won't unravel so what we're going to do is we're going to put the right side facing together and so this onto the pillow so we're going to pin it onto the pillow cover and like I said there you have the overlap see how there's see it's kind of fit like that and there's a little bit of an overlap and that's going to hold your pillow in so the next step is to sew this you're going to pin it first then you're going to sew it on and then when you're done with that you'll have your pillow cover and you can put the insert in so that's not that hard ok so we just finished all the corded pillows and I wanted to show you what they look like all done so here they are and it's much easier than I thought it would be i think if i can do it you can do it too and here's the back so it's really cool because you can just change out all the pillow covers and just make some for different seasons and it's just really easy to change it out and switch things up so see you later 
okay so one of my number one questions has been how to make the rosette jewelry and flowers so I thought that I would just do a little tutorial because it's kind of hard to describe in words and it might be easier for people to just see me make one so that's what I'm gonna do so the first thing you do just has to take a fat quarter a fabric and you cut about a 1 inch strip off of the fabric just like this and then you take your glue then you put a little dab in the center of that you fold it over and then you want to keep your fabric folded over and you want to roll it so you're gonna fold it and you're gonna roll and you're gonna do this probably about 10 times or so folding and you're rolling you're folding and you're rolling you know you can do it it doesn't really matter just this is the center of your flower so this is going to be pretty nice and it's height as tight as you can make it so it doesn't have to be perfect so it will look like this when you're done and a little center and then you just add a little bit of glue to it like that and you fold it towards the center of the flower so just fold it like this and that kind of holds it so that it won't unroll as you're twisting okay so now you're going to take your fabric and you're going to keep it folded and you're just gonna twist and hold and then twist and hold and do this around your flower like this and then every time you make one round will go once around the flower you're gonna put a little bit of glue on just so that it holds it in place so and so it's kind of looking like this fold it in half all the way around like this and so now after you've done this you're going to come to the end of your fabric and this is actually two 1-inch strips on a fat quarter so I've combined two strips to make it a little bit bigger then you're just going to glue down the very end of your material like this so you make it into little circle looks like a flower and then you're gonna take a piece of felt and you are going to put glue all over the back of your flower put it on the felt can be any color felt because you're gonna cut around this and then you're not going to see the felt so it on and then you just cut around the flower and if you want to make something with more than one rosette then you're gonna place all of the flowers on the felt and then cut around the whole thing so if you're making like a three rosette necklace or something then you put all the rosettes on at once and I cut around all of the rosettes but this is just going to be a pin so it's just a one whereas that pin so there it is looks like this and then the back and then you were just going to get on with some glue and you have yourself and that's how you do it it's real easy and if you're gonna make earrings you can just use the one inch strip just the one strip of material and that makes it about half the size or a ring and then if you use two rosettes and it makes a cute pin or you can make it like a three rosette necklace or there's just like a headband it could be all kinds of things that's a great way to make gifts so thanks here we are in my craft room you were making some little rosettes to give to as a thank-you gift to our guests for our show so I think you made a little spin off on the traditional these cute little braided rosettes and they're faster to make too and so she's gonna do a tutorial on her site pretty soon so you can catch them over on dollar short crafts in the meantime that's what we're doing today 
hi it's jen from tater tots and jello and today i'm going to be showing you how to stencil pillows with scotch blue painters tape and its really fun way to personalize a pillow and very inexpensive instead of having to purchase stencils use the Scotch blue painters tape to put on a design on your pillow so that's what I'm going to show you how to do today so here is our supplies that I'm going to use first of all I have the painters tape and then I have some different colors of paint i'm going to use and also you can use this this fabric medium i'm using martha stewart but there's a different brands also that you can buy and you just add this to your paint and it makes it so that your pillows will be washable and they're softer it makes the paint a little bit softer so i'm going to use that and then also you need a little roller and i'm using this little martha stewart roller but you can just use just any kind of foam roller above small size and and then i will show you how to put your pattern on your pillow covers these pillow covers are from ikea alright here's another pattern that i've done with tape and one other thing i wanted to mention was put something inside of the pillow cover before you paint on it that way if something bleeds through you won't ruin the back of your cover so i'm just going to put some paper inside of this pillow cover and then i will get started with the painting now it's time to paint so what I've done is I've I have my roller and then I put my my paint fabric medium and some paint and this little cup and mix it around and then poured it into onto just a plastic plate all right alright so I cover the entire roller with paint then it's pretty wet so I'll just take off a little bit of access on a paper towel so that is not super quick like however princess plane and I start shuffling papers the fabric and evenly quite faint each section like that first thing you want to make sure though before you start wrestling is go around each of the edges of your tape and make sure that the edges are seals really well and that way you will not get any paint underneath the tape and I kind of just push in from the edges of the tape and that way I'm not pushing paint inside of the tape under the table just like that so I I'll do that for the whole pillow and then let it dry and then I will peel the tape on the last thing to do is just to peel up the tape from the pillow revealing the cover underneath that's all there is to it and here are the pillows all done I think they're it's a really fun project and thank you for joining in the tutorial of how to make taped pillows with scotch blue painters tape and I'm Jen from tater tots and jello thank you bye 
hi this is jen from tater tots and jello I thought it might be fun to have a little holiday tour of my house so here we are at the very front entrance and okay I have my little wreath that I may even little pom-pom leaf right there and then I did a little garlic lock my door here a little believe slide bad let's go inside here we are inside and above my cabinet I have a little village see it will look up there it's lit up over here it's a living room yeah my mantel it's kind of like a colorful kind of and yet that I have going on in here we have ornaments on my coffee table right here okay now we're walking into my family room and here's my tree so and a little tree skirt that I made at a ruffle fabric and then I have some big giant stars that I like to put on my tree every year like big oversized ornaments if you can tell like these big giant balls and black I have these red and white kind of pics that I put in my tree a little candy canes and big giant snowflake so kind of fun and then this is my mantle over here and i made these little um fans that say merry on it but it would be really fun to do for new years to put 2012 on there i think that would be really fun so it's kind of just I have a lot of white lanterns that I used in some ribbon and things that match my tree and then I have a little subway art up here and i got from today's creative blog she had she has that you can download it for free so i think it's kind of fun because it matches my couch and I have this little pillow right here that i got from Target and I just like the tree and everything matches kind of fun and then next in my tree I have a little bit where I keep all of our Christmas books and we read one every night so that's fun and then up here I have the little sign that I made up there's Ella's santa hat off to move that but anyways there's a sign that I made and then I have this little advent calendar that I love little things in for my kids and then a little stripy straw wreath and I made right there so that is my family room now we're walking into my kitchen and I made this little wreath I i bought some vintage ornaments at a estate auction about 10 years ago and i made a little wreath to show them off so these are ornaments from the 1940s and i think they're really fun so I thought it would be kind of cool to show them off a little bit so i made that wreath and then i have my point side notes right here which i think are very festive and i have some open shelving over here and i put some christmas plates and there's our little elf on the shelf up there is hiding out so that's my kitchen I almost forgot about my ladder I made this lighter to display cards or a little advent calendar and I really like it because it's kind of just goes my decor and makes me happy so I have a few cards on it already and that's fun you can I put some hooks on the side so that you could hang stockings on it if you wanted that's kind of one of my newer things that I have out these are some little felt trees that i made last year with felt and lace and trim so kind of fun I just love decorating for the holidays I think it's just so festive and makes everything exciting so thank you for coming by and on my little house tour and merry Christmas to you all 
hi I'm Jen from tater tots and jello and i'm here at my 1905 cottage and i'm really excited because we finish the bathroom and this is the bathroom you feel so come with me and I'll show it to you okay here we are go in the front door there's a little bit kitchen it's almost done working on that here's the backward turn the lineup okay so this is what the bathroom looks like when we bought the house and then this is what the bathroom looked like after we started working on it which looked terrible we took the floor out because it was kind of squishy and then underneath the floor we discovered that the whole sewer pipe had collapsed so we had to put a whole new sewer pipe into the street and then we replace the floor and I really wanted to go with a kind of a classic kind of tile so these octagon tiles and they kind of just near the subway tile which we put on the wall we went all the way up to the ceiling with the subway tile on two of the walls of the room and then we put a really big shower in because what I want with this house is to make it so that anyone could live here so it's livable so we wanted to put a big shower in and instead of going with a traditional vanity what we did was we found a discount dresser and we turned it into a bathroom vanity all it's really easy to do all we did was we just put a hole in the middle and then I found this kind of kitchen farmhouse kind of seeing it's a little bit smaller and we just rested that on top and then we altered the drawers so that you can still use them this go-around we added these right here to go around the pipes so now they're usable drawers which is awesome so that's the vanity and then i just added a little hook right here to keep some towels and then we have down on the shelves and keep towels and then in the baskets are like toilet paper i think cleaner and things like that for the bathroom then i just put a little bench right here to keep some towels in just a little places to sit if anyone needs to go mirror right there there's the fan that plays music just pretty fun too so check that out because they're doing a giveaway for that right now so that is my mom my little bathroom also when we remodeled the house we discovered that they had dropped the doorways and so we brought the doorways back up again and put a little transom in the top just kind of we also a transom master bedroom so there's a transom there too which is pretty cool bathroom and I just love it i think these you know it's a really small small space but i think it's really usable thanks for stopping by 
hi I'm Jen from tater tots and jello and today I'm working on a really fun project I love to stencil rugs and I just got through with a nautical room in my for my daughter's room a nautical themed bedroom and I thought it would be fun to make a rug to go in her bedroom and so I'm gonna make a Greek key pattern rug and I'm using scotch's painters blue tape and I think it's gonna be really fun project so I wanted to show you what the what the pillow is I'm using as inspiration okay so here's the pillow I just grabbed out of my daughter's room and as I said it's a nautical room and I thought it would be fun to try to copy or mirror image this pattern this Greek key pattern on a rug so I got this rug at IKEA and I'm going to use scotch's blue painters tape and it has a really cool technology called edge lock and I'm excited to try that out on this rug so I'm going to take it and I'm going to come back here a little ways you can see the whole rug there you go so I'm gonna take the tape and I'm going to mask off that pattern and then I'm gonna paint it and I was thinking of painting it a light gray color just to be a little bit different than the pillow so I will keep you informed as I do that okay okay here is the rug all taped off it took a little bit of math to figure out how to do this and if you took me like a few hours I had to have husband help me because I am NOT a left and right brain person and a more creative than analytical so anyways but here it is and on the border what I did basically the whole thing is I taped the whole thing off with the two inch tape and then I just peeled the tape off in between so that everything was exactly two inches apart so I'll just show you how I did that so there's a little border right here so I just take my tape like this just peel it the middle part all the way around so the next step is stenciling the rugged I will show you how to do that in a second alright now I'm ready to stencil the rug so to stencil what I like to do is have a roller of some sort this is a Martha Stewart paint like craft paint roller a small roller I think is the best thing to use and then what you want to do is you want to roll it in your paint cover it and then you want to make sure that there's not a lot of paint on your actual roller and it gets better it's easier once you do it a couple times and your paint your paint gets a little more saturated than this but you want to make sure it's completely saturated but not dripping because if it's dripping it's gonna go underneath your tape and that is not good so then you come over to your tape is and you're just gonna roll this just like that straight up and down and do it on the entire rug so I will show you some more in a minute here is the rug after one coat of paint as you can see they're just little it's very it's has a texture so it's kind of hard to get all the paint in one coat so I'm gonna do one more coat and then it should be ready to peel the paint off the tape off okay the second coat has been put on to the rug and now it is dry so the last thing to do is just to peel up the tape and that I think is the funnest part my favorite part so just take an edge of the tape and peel it up and see underneath you will see your pattern let me just take it peel it up how great that looks look how great the tape did so we just do that on the whole thing and I'll show you what it looks like in just a second and here's the rug all done I've taken all the paint off and as you can see it turned out really great I'm really happy with it and the Scotch blue painters tape did a really great job you can see how crisp all the lines are from the tape nothing seeped under which is really awesome so I'm going to be putting this rug in my guest room and I'm really I couldn't be happier with the way that it turned out 
hey it's jen from tater tots and jello and i got something really fun in the mail the other day and i want to share it with you it is this really cool makeup kit from revlon and i'm so excited to open it up and take a look at it so here we go here's what's inside kinds of fun little things to try there is a I primer I've never tried that before they'll be fun to go to try photoready primer I love primer yay there's some colorstay nail enamel and different colors and clear and then look at these fun different colors of eyeshadow and then some lipstick ooh look at that red lipstick and cherry tart and then look at that red lip blast so I'm going to try these and I love revlon's new campaign that they are running right now it's called self expression and they just want us to be bold and try new things and so that's what I'm going to do today so here i am with no makeup right now and i'm going to try some of these things and I'll let you know what I think okay here i am in my bathroom yeah look at this cute little video camera that the revlon people sent me it's kodak and i love that it's so small that it has a lot of memory and also goes underwater so what they kind of trip sometime alright so i have all my things and i'm going to try the primer first because that sounds really cool so here we go all right what do you think I tried the bright red lipstick on and you know what I feel a little bit sassier right now so and then I also tried the the eye primer I can tell but it's really cool I can tell it's mattified like the top of my my eyes right here and I think that it will really help with the color that it out so now I just have to decide what color of eyeshadow and you know I i think i would probably go with the great but I'm trying to be bold so I don't know maybe the green if you knew the blue right here I am I kind of combined the green and the blue so it goes with my necklace and then I I'm a little bit in love with this blue nail polish the name of it smudge it indigo night so is a winner I love that I love the red lipstick and I don't know if I would wear the eyeshadow with the lipsticks a little bit much for me cuz I don't wear a lot of makeup but you know one or the other I think I would wear but i'm feeling very glam right now so thank you rough on and be express yourself take a chance like this you know even if it's just with your makeup do something unexpected you know get out of your comfort zone i think is what they're trying to go forward with this campaign and it's been really fun to push the comfort level for me with the bright lipstick and everything and i love it thanks 
hi I'm Jen from tater tots intello and I'm so excited to show you my favorite tool from the CH a show that I went to it's by a company called imagine s and it's called the I top and you can make little buttons with it so I'm going to show you some of the really cool little accessories that come with it and all the different kinds of projects you can make with it so on this board there's um just a lot of different ideas that you could make with I top and there is a an accessory that you can buy that goes with it and it has a little hook on the end so it's really good for like necklaces if you want to make a necklace you can make a little talk to it and this is the part that goes underneath the top so you can attach it to a necklace and then it also has a kind of back that's like a button so you can actually make buttons for like clothes if you want to or you can put little rings through it and make jewelry like this bracelet right here or these earrings and then there's another tool a lot of their backing that comes that you can buy that is a snap which is really cool and then they have accessories that go with this snap like this little hair clip and so this part just snaps right onto the hair clip and you can switch them out so you only need like one of the clips one of the hair clips and then you can switch out all the different tops and there's different sizes too so that's kind of cool and then another thing that I thought was really neat is this kind of backing that screws so it screws into like a headband they have a little part on here and this screws into this part on the headband so you can switch that out and you can add like flowers into the back of it like this and there's also a clip that has the screwing attachment 2 and then another thing that's just full of ideas is this backing that makes your you're covered button into a pin which i think is really fun so you could put make a pan like for your child's first birthday or like a teacher pin are like you're gonna have like a 30th birthday party could put like a 30 on your pin or something and then there's also this attachment that goes on the back that makes it into a brad so if you do a lot of scrapbooking you can make it into cards or things like that so there's all kinds of different things that you can do with these covered buttons and I'm going to show you a little demonstration now okay so I'm just going to show you a little demonstration of the I top what is really cool I think about this tool is that it has these heads that are the same the right size to go with the button the covered button tops and you can you can switch them out for different sizes so if depending on the size of the top that you have you can put it in like a 32 millimeter top like this or you can switch it for the smaller size and then you can also buy other size heads that don't come with your I top but for the different sizes of the button so here's some and if you wanted to change these out it's really easy all you have to do is just spin it off and then put the new size in like that so I think it's pretty cool so I'm just going to show you how to use it and also another really cool thing about this is that you can use it with fabric or with paper which i think is really cool because I've used I've made cover buttons before with the little kits that you can buy a fabric store and those are fun to use but they don't it's kind of hard to get all of the fabric into the button so that it's smooth on those and this has the top that's made exactly to make it smooth which is really cool and then with those kits from the fabric store you can't use fab you can't use paper with those and so this you can use paper which i think is really cool so what you want to do I'm going to show you a fabric one and then i'll show you a paper one so you take just a little circle of fabric you put the larger side of the button maker and then you want to get one of your Brad's so you want to get the brad that goes along with that size of the button maker and put it in the center of there and then you're just going to squeeze it make sure it's in the center then squeeze it like this and then you just tuck in the fabric and this size is a little bit big for this but let's just show you a museum full self then you get the bottom and you fold all the fabric in there think with the bottom on like this with the snappy part up and you just press it down the fabric and my fabrics a little bit too bunched up for this but you can see what I'm saying you press it in and then these little parts just fold back so you can pop it out and you have a little bit min that's perfect see even with all that extra fabric I could have made that circle a little bit smaller but that's what it looks like so and then they have this really cool little punches for the paper and they coordinate with the different sizes so this is a 22 millimeter top so this is a 22 millimeter a little punch that goes with it so you just put your paper in like this and then just punch it out and it looks like this is perfect so then you take another top and another bottom and you get your button maker put this in with the the right side to the book to the bottom and put your top in like this then you just push it down like this and the edges will curl up so it looks like this and then you take it and you just fold the edges down with a paper to put the top on cut and then you just squeeze that down and did you hear that it should pop like that and that means that it's done kind of makes a little popping noise so there you are and it's paper and it would be really fun to do all kinds of projects with I also love that you can use it for home decor so you can make like a little frame like this you know you can take your fabric scraps or if you had like somebody that you love that you wanted to remember you could take parts of some of their clothes or clothes from your childhood or something and make something like this out of it would make a really cute gift too and then also you can make pillows I mean there's all kinds of you know possibilities with this little contraption so anyways and then another really cool thing that I just want to share at the end is that all the different parts of the all of these different things they all coordinate so if you go into your craft store and you're looking to buy some things all of the different kinds go together so like these Brad's that these are called the snap daddys so they snap they will be the same color as like the rings that go with it and the clips that go with that these are all snaps but they also have you know the pins in the pins are different color and the Brad's are a different color these are the Brad's and the buttons are yellow so it's easy to like find the things that go together that way and then one last thing I just want to show you how cool so these are the snaps so you just put on the snap attachment on to the back and then you can just snap and you have your little clip or you can snap it and you can make it into a ring like this you can snap it like this and put this deal and the ring there's like so many different things you can do this okay that is the end of my little tutorial for the I top and I just wanted to share it with you it was my favorite tool from the CH a show and I'm really excited to let you know that there's going to be a fun giveaway coming up next week for three big sets of this I top tool with all kinds of little accessories so look for that coming up and thanks for

hi I'm Jen from tater tots and jello and I'm so excited to be giving away an ORAC error instant air pure fighter this is the top-of-the-line model and the auric people were so nice to send me one to try out and the reason I was so excited to try out an air purifier is I have asthma and so it makes it hard for me to breathe especially we have a lot of inversion and our house in the winter and so when the air is a little bit polluted or there's dust in the air and things like that it makes it hard for me to breathe and also my husband and all my kids actually have allergies and two of my kids have allergies all year round and so we were excited to be able to try something that might help with their health and so I have to say I we've tried some other things and this system is the best that we have ever tried it's really revolutionary the things that the or people have come up with and I wanted to show you a few of the things so come a little closer first of all I think it's really attractive so I keep it in my bedroom and I think it looks really nice it also has a little sound which is nice it's my favorite thing probably is that it's very very quiet so this is low and you really can't hear anything I'm low it's very quiet you can speed it up so this is medium and then you can hear a little bit louder but it's still very quiet and then the high is as high as it goes and even the high is quieter than a low fan setting if you have a fan so first of all can we just talk about how cute it is for an air purifier I've tried a few different ones and this is really cute now let's talk about a little bit about the settings it has a revolutionary Auto mode which has a particulate sensor in it so it's really nice because you can just turn it on and walk away and it will know what the air is and it will automatically clean it no matter how dirty or clean it is it will you know go up to low medium or high and you can tell you know as you're walking by what it's doing by the different colors that it will be in this little area here so if it's on the low mode it will be blue and then it you know changes colors depending on how hard it that it's working it's very quiet no matter what mode it's on but if you're going to sleep the silent mode and that makes it so quiet you will not be able to hear it and you can turn off the light and you can't hear it at all so that's really nice but it also has a smooth light which is kinda sexy that you can turn on and it's nice at night to have that on in case you have it in your room you won't trip over it in the middle of the night which is a good thing I also love that it's Energy Star certified so it is going to use the least amount of power that it can while it's working you won't have to worry about your power your power bill using the system and let's talk a little bit about the filter and how easy it is to change and it also has a five-year warranty and the filter has a three year warranty it's really cool I'm going to show you how you can change the filter really fast okay so you just open up the top like this and it's really me the way that it's held on it has magnets so it just will pop in or out and then the outside part of the filter this is just you know traps like really large particles and things like that this is the middle part of the filter and it is really me the thing that I like the most about it is you can take it out and you can wash it and rinse it out and then use it again and so this is a this whole filter system you don't have to replace this only once every three years and then inside of here is the part that traps the little micro sized particles which is you know smaller than things that you can see so it has three parts on it I'm excited about this unit and I love it and I can't wait to give it away to one of you 
hi it's jen from tater tots and jello and i thought it would be fun to share some of my favorite summer beauty ideas and products today the first one I wanted to talk about has to do with my hair this is what my hair usually looks like but in the summer I like to switch things up a little bit here's another picture of me and my natural habitat blogging and you can see it's a little bit lighter and then the next picture is my husband and I we went to Hawaii a couple years ago and I went really light and it looked fun with more of a tan no matter what color it is I love to deep condition my hair in the summer because I live in the desert and it gets so hot and dry here my daughters and I often use a hair oil to keep things sleek and shiny my favorite hair oil that I use is called Paul Mitchell super skinny serum and I just love the way that it makes my hair shiny and it gives it the moisture that it needs the second beauty habit and product that I want to talk about has to do with skin I love to exfoliate and I use a lot of sugar scrubs to keep my skin smooth in the summer but to keep a natural glow I like to use a self-tanner too because I think it's better for my body so for a few years my favorite has been Jergens natural glow and the reason is that it gives me a natural glow but it also doesn't streak and it doesn't smell and that's my favorite part also they have a product that's called Jergens natural glow for faces and that has SPF in it and I love the way that it just gives me a little bit of a glow so here's a picture that shows you how the Jergens looks I put some on one arm just to demonstrate the difference between my natural color and just using a little bit of the Jergens and of course I would normally used on both arms instead of just one finally because it's so hot and dry here in the summer we have to use a really heavy duty lotion to keep our skin moisturized and my daughters and I love body butter and it just really keeps our skin smooth especially you know how on your feet you can get really dry and it works really well for that the third thing that I would like to talk about it is one of our favorite family traditions every year we like to have a petty party to kick off the summer on the last day of school and it's a really fun thing that we do sometimes we invite friends to join us and sometimes it's just me my girls and we've done all kinds of different toes we've done glitter toes houndstooth toes even pattern toes and it's a really fun tradition it gets us all ready for a relaxing fun filled summer where we can go to the pool and have pretty toes and it's just something that the kids look forward to every year when school gets out so those are my top three favorite beauty habits for summer and thanks to jurgens they are having a really fun giveaway for five hundred dollars and all you have to do is go into the widget and it will tell you exactly how to enter so thank you and thanks for watching the video see you later bye you
