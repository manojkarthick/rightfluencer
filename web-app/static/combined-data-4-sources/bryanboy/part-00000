Imagine memorizing an astonishing aroma library of over 2 000 raw essences and extracts from various raw materials such as flowers  spices  leaves  plants  fruits  seeds so on and so forth from various places around the world. Tough eh? To create the perfect perfume  one needs to consider the harmony and balance between every extract they add to a recipe — one single drop can change the way a perfume smells! Some fragrances can have very few extracts  some could have 200 or more. The possibilities are endless! I was so excited creating my own perfume - I personally love florals and fruits so I combined a number of ingredients to create what I call “Le Burger” which  by the way  smells absolutely nothing like a cheeseburger!  I named it Le Burger because I asked Jacques whether it’s possible to recreate the scent of a double cheeseburger with bacon (the answer is yes)! Let me tell you  the whole experience is magical! I have a newfound respect to perfumers everywhere! #LVParfums @ Les Fontaines Parfumées. Greetings from Grasse — the city of perfume! Grasse is the birthplace of many of the world’s luxury fragrances. Immediately after the fashion show and to celebrate the launch of @LouisVuitton’s newest perfume  Le Jour Se Lève  the maison invited me to visit the Fontaines Parfumees  the creative workshop of Master Parfumer Jacques Cavallier Belletrud. What a delightfully educational experience! After spending the whole day with Jacques  I will never look at perfumes the same way again.

A special service announcement to all the fashion people complaining that Paris is cold — please my beloved dearest friends  get a grip and enjoy the fabulous winter temperatures! It’s February! It’s the second coldest month of the year. Y’all have been to NYC. Make up your minds! One day y’all cry a big song and dance number about global warming and then the next day you be complaining because mama nature decided to turn on the air conditioner a tad lower than usual. Here in the north I’m enjoying the lovely winter temperatures  tomorrow it’s gonna be -12 degrees so I’m gonna put my fur coat before I open open the door as soon as the  furniture delivery people arrive — someone’s gotta unpack her new couch and ottoman from the crates in the snow tomorrow morning (cause the crates won’t fit the front door) and that someone is not you! So yes  enjoy the mild weather in Paris and I’ll see you kids on Thursday! ❄️❄️❄️. Monday source of calm 💆🏼‍♀️💆🏼‍♀️💆🏼‍♀️. Motherhood 👩‍👧👩‍👧👩‍👧. Scandinavian Girls 👩‍👧👩‍👧👩‍👧. Life in the north ❄️❄️❄️.

She’s very calm so far — I’m so afraid she’ll snap at some point  hopefully she won’t. It’s 7:30AM — where’s that alcoholic beverage? I need one!. If it weren’t for my @MichaelKors Access smart watch  I wouldn’t have made it  uptown for the fashion show! It truly kept me in check. It’s a cool smart watch — I don’t have to check my phone to see all my social media notifications and calendar reminders. I could do it all on my wrist! Best of all  the watch is fully customizable through an app! #AllAccessKors #AccessItAll  @ Soho Grand Hotel. Hello from the Nordic side!

Natural fur  such as this gorgeous @Pologeorgis chubby jacket  can be ethically and responsibly sourced. Quality natural fur pieces have a lifespan and a shelf life longer than most garments. With the right care  you can even pass it on to future generations. A fabulous fur coat will most likely outlive you. Unlike much of the garment industry  quality natural fur pieces are not produced in obscene mass quantities by exploited workers. More often than not  these garments end up in a landfill. @WeAreFur #WeAreFur. In my element! In the snow  up in the north. It’s my destiny. Ja  jag vill leva  jag vill dö i Norden! 🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪. Motherly duties of a Scandinavian working mom 🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪. Bless the MTA for saving the day!

I used to stay here for years and years way before I even had an apartment in the city — come to think of it  I’ve been a guest for a decade now. Every time I’m here it truly feels like home. ❤️❤️❤️.

Bigotry and discrimination comes in many shapes and flavors. Most are blatant and straightforward (some get beaten up  some even get killed) but then there are times when it happens behind your back  behind closed doors. And if you do not conform to what society expects of you  chances are  you’ve experienced adversity one way or another. Until human beings collectively change their views  It will never be the the last time someone  somewhere will experience this. Every day  a lot of people  especially young ones  get targeted  bullied and excluded because of their inability to conform to the way society wants them to be — the way they act  who they love and yes  even the way they chose to dress. Many of us have been there — it’s human nature to be part of both (giving and receiving) sides of the stick. We’ve all said very unpleasant things in our time  so I’m the last person who will preach but yeah  I believe people can change — we’ve all come very far and the world is changing. Tomorrow is a new day and we all can change for the good. Homophobia  transphobia and racism should never  EVER have a place in society. ❤️❤️❤️❤️. Clothes are clothes. I’ve always thought of them as a self-enhancing tool that anyone can use to improve their life. Changing one’s appearance using fashion is something I’ve always found fascinating ever since I was a kid. It enables anyone and everyone to play a different character  to express one’s personality and emotions or to relay a message out. Some use fashion to define their sexuality or gender to people but I’ve always looked at clothes as genderless. Who cares whether something is from men’s or women’s? I’m not the type to confine myself in one box. There’s a certain kind of pure and personal joy I get from trying different things on  messing around with lewks — butch boy drag one day  full on weave queen the next. Sure  sometimes I look back how crazy and ridiculous it is but there’s never  ever a dull moment. And the joy is still there. 📸 by @mrfaceless_pl. When I was young  I’ve always thought of fashion as my personal safe haven — my old magazines were my imaginary best friends. They always brought me to a beautiful place filled with beautiful people wearing beautiful clothes and beautiful things. I would often fantasize about being part of it all and that’s what kept me alive  what made going to a Catholic school bearable  you know  the type of school which suppresses young people into conforming into strict ideals  complete with ugly school uniforms. Anyway  it was only until I started working in fashion that I realized that I wasn’t alone — it opened doors for me and it changed my life. That there’s a lot of former young boys (and also girls) who also fantasized about being imaginary friends with their favourite models and designers and wearing their lewks and now they are working in the industry in various  respectable capacities. The feeling to describe to find people who have the same interests as me and to develop genuine relationships and friendships is magical! Fashion is probably one of the very few industries where one could be a total misfit yet still find their people and place in life. 📸 by @mrstreetpeeper. Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short  wear shirts and boots because it’s OK to be a boy  but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading  because you think being a girl is degrading...  #SorryImWeird #MilanThrowback. Quality time with my baby girl @XeniaOverdose! 🇩🇪🇸🇪 #LegallyBlonde. Last night at the @GiambattistaValliParis Haute Couture show ❤️❤️❤️. Boom #Mafia. Paris in a nutshell: Caucasian Living.

Blonde Ambition at @ProenzaSchouler 💁🏼‍♀️💁🏼‍♀️💁🏼‍♀️ #SheEvenGotBlonderToday #BleachIsMyNewBestFriend. We all have family — whether it’s a familial unit that we were born into or a unit that we chose ourselves and nurture over time. Like long lost siblings  I consider my dear friend @VeronikaHeilbrunner as family. Sure  the differences between us are so stark and striking but you’d be surprised how we have so much in common and no  I’m not talking about our matching hair color. 

Whether we are running around key capitals during fashion month or going on spontaneous trips  there’s absolutely never a dull moment whenever we are together. She’s a true gem! There are countless times when all we had to do to communicate is glance at each other’s eyes for a second and we’ll burst out laughing. It‘s extremely rare finding people who get what you want to say without uttering a single word and when you do find them  you treasure these relationships for a lifetime  just like family. 

Veronika is family. Our family. #MYCALVINS. How can one not love this iridescent dress from @JustinOShea’s @SSSWorldCorp?. HAUTE COUTURE BEGINS TOMORROW! Speaking of couture  I had so much fun playing dress up at @AnnaDelloRusso’s apartment in Milan last week!
