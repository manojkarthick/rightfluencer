Whether it's for educational purposes or personal curiosity  here are the best math apps for Android.
so the trick to Android development is to choose the right tools for the job and to learn only the skills you really need to build the kind of app that you want to make I believe that the best tool for Android game development is unity it makes the whole process so much quicker and simpler so much so that in this video I'm going to show you how you can get something up and running in just seven minutes so unity is a game engine that means it handles things like the physics and controls it provides certain assets for you ready-made it basically makes the whole process of creating a game much simpler so you can focus on what makes the game unique and on the assets and on the design and that unity handle of the more advanced code you only need very little code to get started with unity and what you do use you can find tons of guides and references online to help you through that said unity is still very powerful very flexible and C used by a lot of professional developers in fact many of your favorite games from the Play Store were probably built using unity way to try and make a game in Android studio you need to learn Java you need to understand classes and libraries you need to create the physics engine yourself so you're handling things like gravity and collision whereas unity does all that for you makes it so much easier while still being as powerful as you could need even as a professional developer if you're someone would like to create an android game but you think maybe it's too difficult it involves too much code then I hope this videos gonna demonstrate just how quick and simple and easy the whole process can be I'm gonna really run through it though so if you want to slow things down and understand what each step does then follow the link in the description down below as you'll see though the process really is very simple you don't need any prior knowledge and as long as you've got unity and the Android SDK installed on your computer already then you'll be good to go okay so seven minutes let's go so the first thing you want in any game is probably play a character so you're gonna open up paint or whatever I mean obviously there's better tools to use for this foot this is all about the morality and the easiest and quickest player character to make is a square with a face full of attitude this guy you're gonna take squarey and you're gonna drop him into your game like that so he's a sprite we also need some platforms for him to walk on so drag your platform into your game in the exact same way cool thing is look you can drag and reshape this so if you copy that and then paste it you can make as many as you want select your player character squarey and then you gonna open up up here on the right the inspector and then the inspector you're gonna say add component physics 2d rigidbody 2d so this is basically 2d physics for your character what we're gonna do is we're going to drag the camera onto squarey like so in the hierarchy these along the top here are controls that you can use to decide what you want to do with your game objects and that one's used for moving stuff around if we place it right on top of squarey then it kind of makes more sense cuz you can click play and now he's in the center of the screen so anything that's a child of anything else will follow that thing around anyways enough talk work okay so it selects query the problem you can obviously see here is he's falling through the ground so we want to add another component and this time we're going to add physics 2d box Collider 2d I'm gonna do the same thing with the platform here add component physics 2d box Collider 2d once more and if we copy these now then we'll also be copying over that new Collider and the new physics okay so now click Play and hey that's starting to look more promising okay now the next thing we're going to do is create our first script so that we can actually start controlling what happens in this game but don't worry it's very easy so first of all go down to your assets folder in the project window here and you're gonna right-click anywhere and say create folder script now with that open right click and say create c-sharp script and we're going to call this player controls okay so double-click on that and it should open up the visual studio for you here all right this is your first script you'll see there's already some code here I'm going to reference here because I'm not no mister remember however I did write the reference so it doesn't feel like cheating alright so what we're doing up here is we're going to create a new object of the type rigidbody 2d like I say don't worry too much about this you can learn as you go it's gonna be that same rigid body that is attached to our player character so in order to move our character all we need to do is say RB which is the new rigid body which refers to the rigidbody attached to our player velocity equals new vector2 and that's a point that has two axes and we're going to say one that seems like a decent speed to start with and then RB velocity y okay so now open back up unity click on your player like that and then go to add component just as you did before and this time we're gonna say scripts and then there you have it you have your player control script that you made click play we should speed along well speed along is a strong word but yet is he's certainly moving make that three and then we've three times as quickly yeah that's challenging we want to open up our script again okay and then we're going to say during our method if input get mouse button down index zero then I'm gonna BRB velocity will why robbing be blustery equals new vector to the velocity X and then we'll make that three so the player clicks the mouse whilst the game is running then he should move upwards now we I know you're thinking you're saying Adam there isn't a mouse click on Android but that's the cool thing because a mouse click is equivalent to tapping anywhere on the screen bear with me we're just going to type out some variables and you don't need to worry about what these mean [Music] I will explain it all as we go on ground so our boolean are true or false statement equals physics 2d overlap circle ground check dots position ground check radius what is ground and I'm going to add one more thing here which is and on ground now we're going to create a new empty game object and we're gonna call that check around and this is an invisible object that we're gonna use to see if there's an overlap to see whether or not we're hovering over the ground of course we want it to move as square emu so just like the camera I'm gonna drop it underneath square e so that it becomes a child and now for clicks query you should see that's in the script we have some new options and the ground check is a transform and take a check ground and drop it in to ground check then I set the radius to 0.1 we want it to be nice and small and then now we're gonna create our new layer mask so select your platform and up here in the inspector you can see it has the option for layer and you're gonna go add layer and then you're gonna make this layer called ground if you click back to the inspector you can now select ground as your layer okay so now go back to your player and then the last public variable what is ground you're gonna set that to your new layer as ground now fingers crossed it should work unless we've have gotten something something's on the ground you can click click and he'll jump when he's not on the ground he doesn't jump there you go and that is the basis of a fun little game and if you follow my advice at the start this video and you went through the installation process and set up unity and the Android SDK you should now be able to test your game on your Android phone and it's quite a great feeling when you see it come to life on your device ok so it's something pretty basic but it's a great foundation to build upon and there's not that much more code necessary for handling things like enemies collectables next levels and tilt controls once you've done that you can just focus on designing your different graphics and dragging them dropping them into the scene so you found this video useful and interesting guys if you did then please leave a like subscribe to the channel if you'd like to

here's a good question for you where do you think a major Android device ranks in the top ten of Google's search trends for consumer tech you might be surprised fourth that's right fourth androids biggest most hyped largely successful Android device the galaxy s 8 ranked fourth in Google's consumer tech search trends for 2017 sort of is a jolt of reality and reminds us that we live in a little bit of a counterculture that even something as massive as the s8 isn't as mainstream as we might have thought and what's ranked 1 and 2 yeah first up is the iPhone 8 then the iPhone X followed by Nintendo switch and then Samsung Galaxy s8 followed by Xbox 1x Nokia 3310 the razor phone Oppo f51 +5 and Nokia 6 nylon 2 some good news surrounding a newer phone that could be a promising entry-level smartphone according to the antennae listing the honor 9 light sports and 18 9 aspect ratio a 5.6 5-inch 2160 by 1080 resolution that has two cameras on the front and two cameras on the back both Arrangements feature a 13 megapixel primary sensor coupled with a 2 megapixel sensor with the secondary sensor presumably aiding the primary sensor to create portrait images elsewhere even though the tenant listing only mentions an octa-core chipset at the heart of the honor 9 light odds are the chipset is Huawei's in-house kuren 6:59 the processor is paired with either 3 gigabytes of RAM or 32 gigabytes of on-board storage or 4 gigabytes of RAM with 64 gigabytes of on-board storage though a microSD card slot is present finally keeping the lights on as a twenty nine hundred million power battery that is recharged through the phone's microUSB port the honor nine light could be priced around $200 putting it in honor 7x territory we'll find out more on December 21st when honor is slated to hold a press event in China and finally the tech sector has not escaped the wave of sexual allegations specifically when it comes to the father of Android itself Andy Rubin after taking a leave of absence less than two weeks ago reportedly due to quote personal reasons essential founder and Android co-creator and Rubin has returned to the company if you recall it was reported that rumen had an inappropriate relationship with a female colleague while he still worked at Google the search giant reportedly looked into the situation in 2014 since it has a policy that forbids relationships between supervisors and subordinates Google concluded that Reubens conduct was quote improper and showed bad judgment unquote an essential spokesperson said that Rubin was quote never told by Google that he engaged in any misconduct while he worked at the company now it was reported by recode that Andy Rubin although officially took a two-week leave of absence from essential essentials shares the same workspace as playground another project run by Andy Rubin so he really didn't take off anytime at all even if he did take off two weeks I don't really know what that does what do you guys think about this let me know in the comments below or on Twitter 
hello I'm Gary Sims from Android or authority now every year when Apple release a new iPhone they generally release a new process at a new system on a chip to go with it and this year has been very much the same we had the release of the iPhone 8 the iPhone 8 plus and the iPhone 10 and all three models are using a new processor from Apple called the Apple a 11 Bionic now some initial testing on Geekbench and other benchmarks has shown that this is a really fast processor and seems to be remarkably fast compared to the process as we have in Android and that raises the question is it really that fast are the benchmarks a good way to measure it is it a fair comparison well let me explain so first of all a bit about the 11 Bionic it's a hexa-core processor musical 6 cores it's based on the arm 64-bit architecture it's been designed by Apple in-house as has the CPU and the GPU that go inside of the SOC it's got two high-performance cores and for power efficiency calls now there are some big changes compared to the a10 fusion the chip that came before it from Apple most significantly the high performance cores are up to 25% faster which is a significant increase but more importantly the low energy cause of power efficiency calls are 70% faster than the same calls that you find in the Apple a10 but most significantly this particular processor can use all six cores at the same time there's something we've been used to on Android for several years now but apples last post of the a-10 could was effectively a dual core processor or either used the two high-performance cause all the two power efficiency calls but now all six cores can run at the same time in the a 11 which is one of the reasons why we're seeing such a big boost in the multi-core scores that we'll talk about in a moment now if we compare the a11 Bionic with the a-10 and with a leading Android SOC like the Snapdragon 835 this is what we get the a11 is now built on the same process technology as the Snapdragon 83 5 has 10 nanometers the 18 fusion was built on 60 nanometers we've gone from a quad-core process which could really only use two cause of the time to a hexa-core processor of which you can use all six calls at the same time compared to the Snapdragon 835 which of course is an octa-core processor using for high-performance calls and for power efficiency calls and we can see the core scheduling there has changed its now per call which is also what we get on the Snapdragon 835 we've got a three chord G PU which Apple aren't telling us very much at all about from in the a11 Bionic and of course got the Adreno 540 in the Snapdragon 835 all three chips use the LDP less low-power ddr4 ram but of course when it comes to the benchmarks this is where we see the major differences the Snapdragon 835 has a single core score of just under 2,000 that was already been beaten by the a-10 fusion with its 3339 and now the single core score of the alien Evonik has jumped up to over 4,000 but the real jump we see here is in the multi-core test because of course the Snapdragon 835 was beating the a10 fusion with its score of six thousand seven hundred sixty-five because it had eight cores which you could form use at the same time the a-10 fusion was basically a dual core setup and therefore it was still performing remarkably well but 5380 but look at this now a doubling from the a10 fusion to the a11 Bionic we've gone from 5,000 to 10,000 and that's absolutely 10,000 compared to the 6,000 of the Snapdragon 835 so an absolutely massive increase there so the first question is why is the Apple 1811 by onek and in fact the a10 fusion in each generation why were they so fast what is Apple secret well first of all let's start with a bit of history up until 2013 everyone was shipping 32-bit ARM based cores and in fact Qualcomm were the leader in that area with their crate calls and they weren't really were fast for their time but in 2013 Apple basically took everybody by surprise by launching a 64-bit processor in the iPhone 5s now that was even before really that even arm itself of course defined the architecture had products with their 64-bit calls it in fact they were expected and 2014 so here we are in late 2013 an apple have already got a 64-bit processor in their smartphone and this we needed to take everybody by surprise and then over the years that come Qualcomm tried to battle that first of all they release the the chip with the Quartus 8:57 it then they had their own proprietary one which is the cryo and then the Snapdragon 835 we've got this kind of built on cortex technology which is basically it's understood it's a cortex a7 t3 but Qualcomm have been allowed to tweak certain things about it to make it a semi custom CPU but every time this has been happening Qualcomm have been first of all trying to play catch-up and then they've been going from the arm 1 to their own worm to the semi-custom one apple of year-in year-out been releasing a next-generation 64-bit CPU next generation 64-bit CPU and now the a11 Bionic is the fifth generation CPU that Apple have made so basically historically Apple are two generations ahead of everybody else and that's a significant lead when it comes to process of manufacturing so they really have got a head start and they are ahead of the field because of that early head start they had and everybody else has been trying to play catch-up and they haven't yet caught up with what Apple have been doing now that's one part of the story that have this leave but there's also other parts of the story for example Apple their entire process is integrated what I mean by that is the people that are working for Apple designed the processors the people that are building the iPhones work with the people that build the processors it's a tightly coupled scenario and everything from the next specifications for the next iPhone and its next poses that are discussed all in-house and they're all done together now it's slightly different to weight the way the rest of the world works because you've got core designs that are coming from arm they're maybe being implemented by Qualcomm or by Huawei or by mediatek and then those themselves have to come out and then I are shipped in phones so although these are good cause and they're high-performance that there is that lack of tight coupled integration that means that most Apple can shave some weeks off the development cycle but also it means maybe they can their CPUs to be specifically for what they need in those phones and that gives them an edge which we'll talk about more in a second because it doesn't it means they're not trying to sell to a general population and so this is a problem that people like arm and Qualcomm have they tried to sell their chips to a general audience and that general audience might be a router or a switch maker and in networking sonar it might be some rebuilding something for a television set or it might be someone's building something for a a smartphone now arm therefore and chip makers like Qualcomm media to produce many variations of their chips with more cores and less cores and more cash and less cash and higher clock frequencies and better GPUs and worse GPUs leave you just look at the Snapdragon range itself there are a whole range of processes that call core mate you know the 800 series in the 600 series in the 407 even the 200 series they've even got chips that they put inside of wearables now Apple will basically make one chip for one product so that's a very different focus when it comes to what they're doing but it also allows them to do something that other people like call comment and meet it can't do Apple's chips are basically I mean this is rough talk about twice the size in terms of silicon then everybody else's chips now why is that important well silicon is expensive so some low-end chip manufacturers would argue that their profit or loss is can be found in one millimeter squared of silicon the actual process that's where their margin is that's the profit they're going to make on that chip is whether they can shave off one square millimeter from that design apples chips are just double the size of everybody else's and that means that clearly Apple are putting in a lot of investment into the chip and they're cutting their cut making cut back to a design decisions elsewhere in the phone to compensate for that expensive CPU now they cause price it as a single unit they have the design and they have the CPU and that's the screens and the memories and everything else they going to do and at the end of it they come up with a price for that screen now maybe they are they can take away bits of profit and loss from other parts of the phone too compensate for such a big CPU now arm and call common and and Samsung the meet it can't do that because arm need to make a profit so they make their phone they make they designed and they send them off to be like Qualcomm Qualcomm need to make a profit because they sell those chips to people like Sony and LG and Samsung and of course in the smartphone maker needs to make a profit so they have to make money what they're doing so every stage here you've got people making money on what they're doing and they've got employees and their pension schemes and they've got you know shareholder and they've got all these things that need to do and each one of those is adding on there little bit on top and so that's a different business model a different motor networks because obviously Android is the most popular operating mobile operating system in the world there are some fantastic handsets out there but it's a different model to what Apple are using there's one more thing worth mentioning all that extra silicon space is actually in Apple's chips is being given over a lot of it to cash size so for example up until the a10 fusion Apple were using level 3 cache and if you don't know what cache memory is I've got a whole video on about it that I will link here in the description below but basically s main memory on the board lpddr4 is slow compared to the speed of the chip is running at so it has this cache miss intermediate memory where it can stick values so you can get them quickly without having to go back to main memory and that speed up performance and the more cache memory you've got that's high speed memory the faster your processor can go there are some rules of thumb about you know returning diminishing returns but basically if you can invest memory there you're gonna get the returns in the on the performance now applet chips have been using up until now even level 3 caches of up to 4 megabytes now armed and even support level 3 caches on the cortex a57 the cord is a t-72 in the call it 873 is only now being supported on the cortex a 75 which we haven't yet seen any chips for and not only were they using big level 3 cache those are using big level 2 caches so you find maybe 2 or 3 megabytes of level 2 caching whereas on some Android chips you might find down to maybe one megabyte or something like that and then no level three of course each silicon maker Qualcomm or meets it can decide what they want to do but the maximums of level two cache was only four megabytes and you couldn't get level three now funnily enough on the a11 Bionic Apple of shift to shifted away from a level three cache and they've only got a level two cache of cores and a small level one cache and the level two cache is eight megabytes so that's a huge amount of level two cache that's built in there on the chip and I'm sure that gives them a bunch but that's expensive it's really expensive to make a chip that big and maybe these chip makers don't have a business model where they can try to sell an OEM like Sony or LG such an expensive processor whereas Apple can incorporate that in their overall pricing so if we look at that there's there's a history Apple have got a head start they they really are two generations ahead of everybody because they went to 64 bit earlier than anybody else there's also because the chips are big okay and they've got big amounts of silicon on them which also includes big amounts of cash and also because they are the designer and the designer of the chip and the design of the phone there is a kind of tight coupling in their process which may be able to help them shave off time of a development cycle which of course in the end means that they're a heavy of the game again now does this mean that Android chip makers you know Qualcomm and media taken and others are never gonna catch up well I don't know I think there is a possibility of course that one year maybe Apple will release a bad chip it didn't go according to plan the performance increases aren't as good and that lead that they've got could be reduced that could happen it doesn't look like it's going to happen but that could happen second of course a chip manufacturer like Qualcomm or or mediatek or Samsung can actually produce a chip that is way advanced compared to what they've had a generational leak that would also reduce the catch-up that they've got and also probably this is where I'm think is really going to happen we are moving into a kind of a new era of where CPU performance isn't going to be as as it was before we've already caught seen that with GPUs you'll have a fast GPU doesn't matter how fast your CPU a GPU you're not going to be getting the graphics performance but now we're talking into the area of digital assistance of voice recognition face recognition and even Apple have got a neural engine the ki-rin 970 has got this new processing unit and maybe in the future we're going to see different parts of the the SOC function to be taken up by different parts of neural network simulations are going to happen inside the SOC and if Qualcomm and our almond and mediatek and Samsung and while we can produce processes that lead in that area that will maybe reduce the lead that Apple have but kudos to Apple it is a fast processor and that's just a fact so no point crying about it there's no point getting upset about it we should congratulate them for making such a good processor and then it should be a wake-up call to the people in the Android side to step up their game because competition is always good competition pushes people on to innovate more and to produce better but having said that don't think that the Snapdragon 835 will be equivalents from X and also the ki-rin 970 are somehow sluggers they're higher performance processors and they do an excellent job and when you use your smartphone the user experience will not be diminished by that but when it comes to raw numbers on paper the 11 Bionic is faster just a fact well my name's Gary central authority I hope you enjoyed this video let's have a good discussion in the comments below we don't want any Wars we don't want any nasty neurs let's just talk about the technology and let's talk about how things are progressing and let's talk about the benefits to the consumer let's talk about why we should applaud any

so over the last several years smartphone cameras have become increasingly more important especially with social media apps like Instagram snapchat and selfies becoming a thing and ultimately picture quality is always going to be the most important thing when it comes to smartphone cameras but what's really gonna differentiate one smartphone camera from the next are the features and the LGB 30 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 are arguably two of the best smartphone cameras on Android right now but what exactly do they provide in terms of features let's put these two side-by-side and see exactly how they stack up so I figured the easiest way to approach this video is to break things down into three categories we'll start off with the raw specs of each camera which is pretty simple and straightforward then we'll dive into the camera features and then cap things off with the video features which is where I think things start to really get interesting between these two cameras now as far as picture quality we'll save that for another video when we have a final production unit of the LGV 30 so make sure to subscribe if you aren't already and hit that notification bell so you don't miss out on that video when it goes live starting off with the specs of these two cameras you have dual camera systems on both the LGV 30 and the Galaxy Note 8 but on the B 30 you have a 16 megapixel main sensor at F 1.6 with optical image stabilization and the secondary sensor is a wide-angle lens at 13 megapixels and F 1.9 with no optical image stabilization but doesn't really need it because it's such a wide angle and the focus is set to infinity over on the Galaxy Note 8 you have two 12 megapixel sensors the main sensor is F 1.7 and the secondary sensor is F 2.4 and it's also a telephoto lens giving you 2 X optical zoom and they both feature optical image stabilization camera features can sometimes be underrated and while picture quality will always be the number one most important aspect of a camera it's the features that differentiate these cameras and make them a lot more fun to use starting with the LG v 30 when you open the camera app all the cameras shooting modes are under the mode button which you can find at the top of the viewfinder next to the Settings button or on the left of your whole the phone in landscape there are quite a lot of modes here which can look a little overwhelming at first but it's really not as bad as you might think because many of these are fairly self-explanatory or have been on android for an extremely long time that you probably already know what they are you have your standard auto mode of course which is the default and most commonly used mode for a good majority of people and then to the right of that you have the manual mode for photos that gives you control over everything like white balance exposure ISO shutter speed and has built-in focus speaking to make it easier to tell when things are in focus there's other typical modes as well which we won't really go to in depth with since they can be found on pretty much every Android phone such as slow motion time-lapse panorama and 360 degree panorama which is the same thing as a normal panorama but it takes a spherical image that will show you everything in front of you behind you and above and below you you'll also find a food mode which is specifically designed for taking images of food but it doesn't really seem to do all that much aside from giving you the ability to adjust the white balance if you're familiar with the LG g 6s camera there's four modes baked into the V 30s camera that you might recognize right off the bat you have snapshot mat shot grid shot and guide shot the only difference here is that they're a lot easier to get to on the V 30 whereas on the LG g6 the process of finding these modes were a little more convoluted but otherwise the modes are exactly the same and pretty simple to use snap shot lets you take a photo and instantly see the preview on the bottom half of the viewfinder with mesh shot you can take two photos simultaneously or one at a time which the camera will then stitch together and this can be done with a combination of both rear cameras one front facing and one rear camera or front facing on both grid shot is basically a super quick and easy way to make a collage of four photos for short three second clips or a mixture of the two finally with guide shot that's let you use an image as a guide to make it easier to take another photo with the exact same composition and framing the nice thing about all of these modes is that all the photos are taken as a where so they are instantly ready for apps like Instagram the last couple of modes that LG offers here are snap movie and pop out with snap movie tapping the record button will record a three-second clip and holding down the record button will let you record up to a minute of footage so this essentially is for those situations where you just want to record something quick and short and this mode makes it really easy to do pop-out mode on the other hand is a pretty cool mode that lets you add a few different effects like fisheye black and white vignetting or lens blur to the outer edge of the photo to make everything in the center of the frame really stand out you can also change the shape of the frame to a circle or hexagon and mix and match the effects giving you a decent amount of flexibility with this mode other features that you get with this camera are a bunch of predefined filters that let you change the look of your photo before you take it but the feature that I really like the most is the camera roll toggle that allows you to see a preview of all the photos that you've taken without having to jump into the gallery moving over to the Galaxy Note 8 the note 8 offers a lot of the same camera features as the V 30 but there are some features that the note 8 has that you won't find on the V 30 swiping in from the left will get you to all the cameras different shooting modes like Auto Pro which is Samsung's version of manual mode panorama slow-motion hyperlapse which is the same thing as a time-lapse and just like the V 30 the note 8 also has a food mode there's also virtual shot which isn't necessarily new it's been on Samsung's camera for a while now but unless you capture a 360 degree image of an object by circling around it and then you can later view it by tilting the phone left or right or panning around it with your finger the notates camera has its own set of camera filters which you can get to by swiping in from the right and you get a much bigger variety of them whereas with a V 30 the options are pretty limited the notates camera also lets you customize the photos with different stickers to add a little bit more personalization and if you're big fan of snapchat you'll love these snapchat s filters that's built right into the camera the newest feature to Samsung's camera is the live focus mode that's made possible by the no H dual cameras with live focus you can take photos with a background blur or get the fact but the difference between Samsung's take and other phones that have a similar feature is that you can adjust the background blur before you take the photo and after the fact the light focus mode also allows for dual capture which means you can take a photo from both the main lens and the telephoto lens simultaneously every time you take a live focus photo so as far as camera features and shooting modes these two cameras actually stack up pretty well but what really separates them are what they're able to do with video especially in the case of the LGB 30 the big highlight to the V 30 is its ability to shoot log footage LG is dubbing it sinha log and if you shot with a DSLR or a mirrorless camera you may already know what log is but in a nutshell that's lets you shoot a completely flat image for more flexibility in post and log footage has better dynamic range giving you more detail in the shadows and highlights if you don't want to mess with color grading and color correcting or any sort of post-production LG offers a more simple shooting mode called sinha video that offers a variety of color grading presets which makes it really easy to give your footage a certain type of appearance directly in camera another feature that's really cool what's in a video is the point zoom feature so with most smartphone cameras if you want to zoom in you can only do it along the center of the frame but with point zoom you can zoom in on any area that you select making it really easy to put emphasis or draw attention to a particular subject on the galaxy note a video recording isn't quite as impressive but there isn't any phone right now that can really stack up to the V 30s video recording capabilities there's no option for recording in log or any built-in color grading presets but the note 8 does offer manual controls for recording video and the ability to shoot in 4k so you do still have a nice set of recording options even if the note 8 doesn't put a direct emphasis on video as the b30 does so that wraps up this camera features comparison between the LG v 30 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 would you rather have the live focusing capabilities and these snapchat s filters of the note 8 or would you rather have the video recording capabilities of the LGV 30 and which one do you think is the better camera overall in terms of features let us know down in the comment section below and as always give this video a thumbs

HMV global got things off to a great start last year with their Nokia lineup and it looks like they're keen not to lose any of that momentum at MWC the company is announcing a lineup of five new phones for 2018 and there's some really interesting designs and features here to delve into first up HMT is bringing back another nostalgic Nokia classic the 8110 look I remember this quite as much as the 3310 but there you go this banana shaped feature phone will be running Kos with 4G support and like the revamp 3310 is positioning itself to be a great secondary device to take on nights out or use as a conversation starter at 79 euros that's a very affordable proposition and the device will be landing in May the first Android offering though is Nakia one which hmd hopeful services transition device for those moving from feature phones to their first smartphones so she'll be running Android Audio 8.1 Go Edition and is made to be tough with coloured polycarbonate surrounding the chassis looks a little bit similar to a Lumia it comes with a 5 megapixel rear camera 2 megapixel on the front and I'll be available from April 2018 for 85 USD a considerable step up though is the all new Nokia 6 other recent offerings this will be machined from a single block of aluminium giving it a durable and attractive design it looks and feels really nice and it's definitely very premium for a mid-range frame the new Nokia 6 hours will now get to benefit from the Zeiss optics and the both the dual sight made previously NECN nokia rate they'll also get 360 spatial audio and a bump up to the Snapdragon 630 to offer a 60% speed increase it'll also support fast charging there's a 5.5 inch polarized display will remain the same this one will also be available from April and comes with either three gigabytes or four gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes or 64 gigabytes of storage respectively it will set you back around 279 euros the nokia 7 plus meanwhile is an even more interesting proposition threatening to take the crown in the affordable premium space this device has once again cut from a single block of 6000 series aluminium but now it's also coated in six layers of ceramic paint this not only ensures it feels great in the hand but it also helps to hide any antenna lines the edges are anodized twice for even more colour variety and it's genuinely very slim and solid and premium feeling what's more is that this is the first Nakia device to support an 18 by 9 aspect ratio this creates plenty of real estate on that six inch full HD display it also gets a slight upgrade over the original Nokia 7 with its snapdragon 616 processor then comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage a bigger upgrade is in the kamek department which now brings us the same Zeiss optics here as well and the dual lens setup on the back combining a 12 megapixel and a 13 megapixel sensor with the latter being used for telephoto the pro camera application will provide manual control over aperture exposure white balance etc and provide real-time feed news to users to see what they're getting that's a lot of bang for your buck considering the asking price is just 399 euros this will also be available from April when you can be sure we'll be putting it through its full paces but there's still one more to go the nokia 8 Sirocco is poised to represent hm DS most premium design possible and to that end it's this time machined from a single stainless steel block which is reportedly meant to be able to withstand 450 pounds of pressure or 3 in grown men so this is the phone you can stand on with your friends if you want to another first for the Nokia brand is here as well - a 3d curved Gorilla Glass display which bends around the sides of the device in a manner similar to a galaxy this contributes to an incredibly thin side profile and the whole thing looks a lot more flagship II as a word than the Nokia rate of old other more forward-thinking features include a 2 KP OLED display ip67 wireless charging 128 gigabytes of storage and an impressive 6 gigabytes of RAM it features the same high-end camera specs as the Nokia 7 plus along with the same spatial audio capture seen on the original nokia rate the only things preventing this from being a home run is a the decision to includes the same snapdragon 835 seen in the last gen offering and the 16 by 9 ratio on that 5.5 inch screen it feels very strange to have a lineup where the most premium device is not also the tallest of course that's a matter of taste however and some people may appreciate the more compact form factor here and to be fair this is also considerably more affordable than your galaxy's at just 749 euros this one will be available from April as well hmd made a point during the presentation of committing to a pure Android experience repeating the mantra of pure sake and up-to-date to that end all their devices from the Nokia three upwards will now be part of the Android one program that means minimal bloatware and rapid updates which is something that the company has been very good about so far this will come as great news to many viewers and may even be a deciding factor for fans of the stock Android experience there's a huge amount to take in here and you certainly can't fault hit gem DS ambition these devices are undeniably well made and Panzers will be very happy to hear about the commitment to pure Android experience but is it a case of too much of a good thing is the lack of a clear nomenclature going to confuse buyers and would you rather see an 18 by 9 flagship most likely the hardware will do the talking here and of course we'll be bringing you a more detailed thoughts on that once we have more time with these devices however you cut it though this is an impressive showing from hmd global and we can't wait to try them out who knows maybe this does in fact mark the beginning of Nokia's climb back to the top so thanks ton for watching guys hope you found this useful and interesting if you did then please leave a comment please like it please share it around it helps us tremendously for more information and more coverage of MWC be sure to check out and radhaji com4 we are your source for all things Android 
so the idea of a foldable smartphone has been around for quite some time now and we've seen some concepts from companies like Samsung and Lenovo but that's all they've been so far is just concepts at least until now we finally have a foldable smartphone that is real and is coming to market and it's from a company that you probably wouldn't expect it's made by ZTE and it's called the axon M let's take a look before we dive deep into the foldable aspects of the axon M let's get all these standard smartphone stuff out of the way inside the axon M is going to be powered by a Snapdragon 820 one processor and 4 gigabytes of RAM not exactly sure why ZTE did not go with the Snapdragon 835 but the 820 one is still plenty powerful so I don't think performance is going to be that much of an issue it also comes with 64 gigabytes of internal storage and a micro SD card slot if you want to add more and yes the phone does have a headphone jack but it's not water-resistant like most phones that we've seen in 2017 I'm going to take a wild guess and assume that that might have something to do with the fact that it's foldable but don't quote me on that the power button on the axon 10 lives on the side and this also doubles as your fingerprint sensor it's going to ship with Android Newgate out of the box and it does have some customizations from ZTE but for the most part it feels pretty much like stock Android no word as to when it'll get Oreo but hopefully that'll happen sooner than later it doesn't have the flashiest of design since it's practically just a rectangle with short body lines but it is made completely out of metal so it does have a nice and sturdy feel to it the fact that the axon M is foldable is really what makes this phone special and a little bit different from everything else in 2017 but unlike a lot of those foldable concepts the axon M does not have a foldable display instead it uses a hinge sort of like a door hinge and it utilizes two separate displays that can be joined together to give you a much larger screen when the phone is folded open both of the screens are 5.2 inch LCD panels with 1080p resolution and having two screens on this phone does happen to make it quite thick at a little over 12 millimeters the hinge on this phone also makes it feel a little awkward I'm not gonna lie it's not uncomfortable to hold by any means but it definitely feels very differ from any other phone out there right now because this phone has two screens it's going to be pretty interesting to find out what battery life is going to be like it has a thirty 180 milliamp hour battery inside which is a decent size but we'll have to wait and see if that's actually enough for a phone rockin two screens so obviously with these two screens you can combine them and use it as one big screen to give you sort of a tablet like experience but ZTE software lets you do a few other things as well you can of course use just one display if you want like any other normal smartphone but you can also mirrored the displays to show the exact same content and because the phone is foldable you can put the phone in a tenth position and share content with your friends or family without having them uncomfortably huddle around you both screens can also be rent independently of each other which is great for multitasking purposes and because of this the axon M does not have regular split-screen multitasking as far as how apps scale when you're using as one large screen most apps will scale perfectly fine but for the ones that don't it's going to be up to the developers to update their apps but ZTE does have software built in to force apps to rescale to the larger screen if they don't properly rescale on their own now because this phone has two screens it actually eliminates the need for a front-facing camera and instead you only have one camera on this phone the camera is 20 megapixels at F 1.8 and when using it as a rear camera it uses the screen on the opposite side of the camera as the viewfinder and when it's being used as a front facing camera it uses a display that's on the same side as the camera we've seen a lot of interesting designs in 2017 and I think the axon M is definitely going to catch a lot of attention but what do you guys think about the axon M do you think foldable phones is going to be the next big trend in smart phones or is this going to wind up as they failed gimmick let us know down in the comment section below and if you want to know more about the axon M make sure to check out the written article which is also linked down below and give this video a thumbs up if you did enjoy it subscribe to the channel which is also down below and hit that notification bell so you don't miss out on future videos and of course check us out on social media instagram twitter snapchat google+ all that good stuff will be linked down below and check the website as well and Road Authority calm because we are your source for all things Android 
hello there i'm gary sims from andrew authority and i'm here to tell you which was the best phone of 2017 now when people talk about the best of something that can be pretty subjective if i asked you what is the best sports team or the best car or the best type of music i'm sure I would get whole load of different answers from you guys out there so when we've come to look at the best of android for 2017 we're trying to be as objective as we possibly can and to do that we have actually devised a set of tests that test these phones so we come to bat flies directly measuring battery performance when it comes to the camera we've actually got some camera testing equipment when it comes to audio we've used audio equipment to test the quality of the signals and so on now if you go over to the and authority comm website you're going to see all of our testing procedures laid out there for you in black and white and I really would encourage you to go over and read those so that you know that we have done the best we can to be objective about these tests now before we get into tests is time to talk about our finalists the top ten phones that we have pitted against each other for this year's best of Android 2017 now I'm going to list them to you in alphabetical order based on the OEM so we start with b4 blackberry now the BlackBerry key one is a fairly unique phone in this year's lineup because of course it comes with that physical keyboard something that Blackberry were very much known for in years gone by it's also got the weakest processor in terms of the Qualcomm lineup it uses a core comp six to five where's all the other phones that use cocom in this lineup have got the core comm eight three five however it does come with four gigs of memory it does have a four point five inch screen with greater than full HD resolution and of course it's got a 12 megapixel camera and a 3500 five our battery next up is the Google pixel to excel and that comes with a snapdragon 835 4 gigabytes of RAM the huge six inch display it's got at least quad HD resolution a 12 megapixel camera and a 3,500 and 20 milliamp hour battery next up with the huawei mate 10 Pro with its Kirin 970 processor it's the only device in this year's lineup that doesn't have a Qualcomm processor course you've got the nice six inch display a 2k resolution and of course the dual cameras a 12 megapixel camera and a 20 megapixel camera plus you've got that nice four thousand milliamp hour battery next comes the LG G 30 with the snapdragon 835 got a 6 inch screens but quad HD resolution got 4 gigabytes of RAM it's got dual cameras and it's got a 3300 milliamp hour battery next up is 30 novo moto said to force again with the Snapdragon HD 5 this time with 6 gigabytes of RAM 5.5 inch display quad HD and dual cameras with a two thousand seven thousand thirteen million power battery it's nice to see Nokia back in the android market and this year the Lafayette 8 has made its way into the finalists for the best of Android series Nokia 8 comes with a stamp dragon III 560 bytes of ram a 5.3 inch screen quad HD resolution and a 2 13 megapixel cameras all backed up by a 3019 milliamp hour battery no showdown would be complete without the 1 + 5 t again Snapdragon 835 8 gigabytes of memory 6 inch display greater than Full HD and dual 16 milliseconds and then for the power it's got a 3300 milliamp hour battery much has been said and written about the razor phone and it's also made it into our top 10 finalists razor comes with the Snapdragon 835 eight gigabytes of memory a 5.7 inch quad HD display dual 12 megapixel cameras and a four thousand milliamp hour Factory moving on to s4 samsung we've got the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 cause that comes with the Snapdragon 835 got six gigabytes of RAM but the huge 6.3 inch display got a greater than quad HD screen resolution and you've got module cameras and a 3300 milliamp hour battery and the other s in our lineup is s4 Sony the Sony Xperia x2 z1 and of course that comes with the Snapdragon III 5 4 gigabytes of ram a 5.2 inch full HD display and 19 megapixels single lens camera and a 2007 with milliamp hour battery so let's start with the display 4 of I devices this show our LCD devices that's the Nokia 8 the BlackBerry key one the Sony xz1 and the razor phone the rest are all AMOLED devices now which one offers the brightest display and of course that's important when you want to read the phone outside and actually it's the Nokia 8 and the BlackBerry key one that offered the brightest displays out of our lot and in third place comes the Sony Xperia X is 8 1 now when it comes to color representation we look at the color temperature and look at we display we found the keynote 1 the Nokia 8 and the LG G 30 all have the coolest types of displays and the others are much warmer and so once you consider all the different parameters including the brightness including the color representation our testing has shown that the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is the winner of the display category in second place comes the wild wave make 10 pro and it's great to see the Nokia 8 in third place now the quality of the audio that comes out of our devices is essential because if we're not speaking then at least we're listening to music or we're watching Netflix or YouTube or we're playing a game and all of them involve some kind of audio output now the loudest phones in our roundup are the pixel 2 XL and the Nokia 808 in terms of noise is the razor phone which actually had a minus 106 DB noise level which is very very impressive however close behind we have the Galaxy Note 8 the Nokia 8 the LG v 30 and the pixal to excel which all achieve - 100 DBS of noise and in terms of harmonic distortion the LGV 30 is the clear winner then the note 8 then the key 1 and finally the huawei make 10 Pro the devices that support the greatest range of Bluetooth codecs are the pixel to excel but make 10 Pro and the sony x8 1 now when you throw that all up together including the volume of distortion and the noise level and the codec support these are our winners in first place you've got the LGB 30 in second place you've got the Google pixel to excel and in third place you've got the huawei mate 10 Pro now when it comes to performance we've used a whole range of different benchmark when it comes to and 2 to the 1 + 5 t is the clear winner with a score of over a hundred and eighty thousand for GFX bench is actually the note 8 that comes out on top followed closely by the Sony Xperia x8 one when it comes to Geekbench the single core score go to the 1 plus 5t and then the multi-core score goes to the mate 10 Pro over at second place you do get the Nokia 8 and the Razer phone and finally looking at 3d mark the winner there is the note 8 followed by the Nokia 8 when you put all those scores together the clear winner in terms of performance is the 1 + 5 t so well done 1 + then you have the Razer phone and finally you have the note 8 from Samsung ok test the camera we've done two different methods first of all we've got a camera shootout which we displayed on the annual thority website with lots of different pictures of sceneries and low-light and different types of shots and you the readers of a garage comm voted for what you thought were the best pictures and secondly we did some technical testing we've got some very complicated software and we've got all these special patterns that you take pictures of and then from that you can check things like the color reproduction and the sharpness and amount of noise in the picture and so on so let's first of all look at the shootout results well as you can see here the readers have had their say and in third place comes the 1 plus 5t second place comes the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and the winner according to the readers vandura of course comp is the Google pixel to excel now with the technical testing there's a huge mound of data that we've collected and a lot of those results are published over at all andrew thority comm have a leader some of the highlights for you when it comes to color accuracy a number of phones did a really good job including the note 8 the pixel to excel the sony xperia x8 one the Moto Zed force to the huawei mate 10 Pro and none of the flagship had any problem in with noise when it was good light particularly the Google pixel to excel and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 when it comes to low-light things are a bit different and the winner in the low-light category was the five teeth 1 + 5 t in terms of sharpness in first was a note 8 then the Nokia 8 and then the 1 + 5 t and finally we did a test using 4k video which phone had the best sharpness for 4k video and that was the note 8 followed by the pixel to excel now when you gather all those results together the winner for the best camera in terms of its technical aspects is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 for a very closely behind by the mate 10 Pro and then the pixel 2 X L now back to life keys a key characteristic for many many of us so we've done lots of different battery testing and first of all for just doing mixed kind of activities that means a bit of gaming a bit of web browsing a bit of music a bit of video and so on the best phone is actually the key one from blackberry followed by the mate 10 Pro and then the z2 force however if you kind of just do more web browsing than maybe you do video or playing games then again the key one from blackberry comes in first place then again the make 10 Pro in second place and finally in third place is the Nokia n8 however if you are a heavy gamer then the 1 + 5 t will give you the best battery life followed by the z2 force and then the huawei mate pro- the kind of person that's always dashing around and you plug your phone in for just a few minutes to try and get that extra bit of charge before you - out somewhere else then the phone that charges that quick is is actually Lisette - force then actually behind that is the mate 10 Pro and finally the 1 + 5 t now overall when you have all those different types of battery tests the winner is the huawei mate 10 Pro followed very closely by the 1 + 5 t and in third place we have the is it - force now to judge the user experience we actually came up with 191 points available to be divided across a whole range of categories from hardware to software to camera and so on and we're looking at things like the screen to body ratio does it have a headphone jack doesn't have dual speakers does it have optical image stabiliser they have wireless charging clit support and micro SD card does it have any IP rating what version of Android does it come on and so forth so we tied up all the points and actually we found that in terms of user experience the LG TV 30 is the clear winner next is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and in third place you've got these huawei mate 10 Pro now before we get them to look at the final scores there is one more category and that is value for money now the blackberry key one cost just $500 was at the other end of the extreme is the note 8 which can cost over $900 there's a $400 difference between them so when you compare the features that these phones have with the price the overall winner for value of money is the 1 + 5 t their next comes the nokia 8 are generated nokia there in that second position and many third place is the moto z2 force okay so let's look at the final results now when you boil it all down there are just four phones that have shown themselves strong through all those categories the mate 10 won one category and was in the top three for four other categories the V 30 from LG won two categories but it didn't get a top three position in any of the other categories the 1 plus 5t itself one two categories and it was in the top three for a further one other category and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 one two categories and it was in the top three for two other categories so let's take the result in reverse order starting with third place in third place we get the 1 plus 5t and then in second place we have the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and the winner of the best of android award for 2017 goes to the huawei mate 10 Pro I'm going to endure authority and I really hope you enjoyed this video a big shout out to all my colleagues over and Resorts comm who put together this

hello again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe handy the Android authority app guy and 20:18 has some decent mobile games coming up and we wanted to talk about them just a little bit let's roll that intro and get started black desert mobile is an open-world action game with hack and slash elements it features five different characters seven battle modes and a bunch of minigames like fishing logging mining and other stuff it's a little bit reminiscent of gauntlet legends but with deeper gameplay better graphics more minigames and a longer narrative this one should be out soon if it isn't already however the first launch destination is South Korea with other places ostensibly coming later it should be one of the better games for action hack and slash fans in 2018 DC unchained is a giant drop of fanservice into the pool of existing comic-book properties it'll feature some of DC's biggest heroes and villains fighting alongside one another and against one another it has that freemium element of ignoring the whole good versus bad thing by letting you assemble teams of just about any character that you can get your hands on the gameplay doesn't look amazing but there should be lots of explosions this one will undoubtedly be popular even if it seems blatantly average based on the trailers still a good time waster never hurt anybody Final Fantasy 15 Pocket Edition is one of those mobile RPGs that console RPG fans might actually get excited about it's basically the entire console game refitted for mobile with simpler graphics and touch controls this game is broken up into ten episodes all of which will be available at launch unlike other episodic style games that's probably why the game has been delayed several times already this one should be out on February 9th but don't be shocked of Square Enix delays this one again grid Autosport is an upcoming racing game with some good potential it features above-average graphics tons of cars and tons of tracks to race through this game also sets itself apart by having a bunch of difficulty levels and potentially even hardware controller support it's already out on iOS where it Garner's a decent 4.1 rating the Android version should be out sometime in the first half of 2018 the iOS version is also a pay once game with some optional DLC and we really hope the Android version ends up being similar Harry Potter Wizards unite is among the top games when it comes to hype in 2018 and it's the next game by Niantic lab makers of ingress and the record-breaking pokemons go they bring their unique augmented reality style gameplay to the Harry Potter universe with this title that means it'll encourage players to explore the real world to get various spells and prizes while also fighting massive bosses there isn't a ton of details at this point and it might not even come out in 2018 we're also guessing that it'll be a freemium game like my antics other offerings it'll most assuredly be quite popular upon release paid a crime war is actually already successful on PC and console and the mobile port is likely coming sometime in 2018 the game features 4 vs. 4 pvp where one side plays the role of robbers trying to loot a place while the other side plays the role of the cops each round features various weapons and ability upgrades as you play thus there is a minor MOBA element as well it'll be interesting to see how they adapt the controls to mobile with this one and it should be one of the better FPS titles this year player unknowns battleground battlefield is the mobile version of the viral hit game from 2017 it features a lot of the same gameplay elements as the console and PC version you get dropped off on an island and you must be the last one standing at the end of the game the mix of fps and open-world actually gives the game a certain charm among fans of both genres the game is actually already out in China and we're not entirely sure if it's gonna make its way westward however given the popularity of the franchise they'd be stupid not to tech and mobile is an upcoming fighting game based on the popular console fighters of the same name that verbage is intentional because this really isn't a Tekken game it's one of those fighters that kind of plays itself like the popular injustice and Mortal Kombat mobile games it features 20 character as various special moves and a progression system however the mechanics seem to be little more than tapping cards during combats it'll be a good popular time waster but it might not be a good fighting game this game is available on Google Play for pre-registration right now Tom Clancy's shadow Break is actually on the brink of being released everywhere it's already on Google Play but it's only available in a few countries the game features real-time PvP combat FPS and strategy mechanics and a ton of freemium stuff like upgrades character collecting and the like the multiplayer is a little bit different from what we're used to seeing you play support in the back while your characters run forward toward the enemy however it does still pale in comparison to its console counterparts this one should make its way around the world sooner or later telltale Games's launching their final season of the critically acclaimed Walking Dead series the long story follows a girl named Clementine as she tries to survive in the Walking Dead universe and this last edition lets you shape her future as you decide what kind of person she's going to be the game made waves with its comic-book style graphics and those return for the final installment additionally it'll share most of the gameplay and storytelling mechanics from the previous three seasons this one doesn't have a release date yet but it should be in 2018 at some point there are plenty of other big-name titles floating around and we didn't have time for all of them we also didn't include games in beta because those are publicly available and we wanted to talk about the stuff that hasn't been made available just yet mobile games still have a ways to go but it feels like this year is going to be a lot better than it was last year as always if we missed a game that you feel should have been on this list leave us a comment and tell us about it and that about does it for this one folks if you want to read more we have the written version

how's it going everyone i'm adam alina and this is the new cat phone the s60 one now let's get this out of the way right now it isn't what I would call a pretty phone but that's fine because it isn't meant to be you might know caterpillar from their giant yellow construction vehicles but they're not new to the smartphone game the original s60 was the first smartphone with a thermal camera and the s60 one is an upgraded version that improves upon that functionality in a few significant ways the first is that it's simply a better camera so the image quality in the fli our thermal imaging camera is a little more refined than in the previous model the range was also increased so that it can pick up temperatures up to 400 degrees Celsius that's 752 degrees Fahrenheit for Americans like me it's pretty cool to use but the experience wasn't as snappy as I would have liked before I was able to go full snake mode and seeing thermal vision I had to deal with the app crashing twice but once I got it going it was definitely one of the cooler things I've seen here at MWC the slight lag is probably because the phone is running what I can only assume is some pretty resource-intensive software all on a fairly mid-range chip the Snapdragon 630 now the phone is running Android Oreo and Caterpillar promise that it's going to receive an update to Android Pop Tart when it gets announced but we'll have to wait and see how timely that happens besides thermal vision there are also some other pretty nifty tools built into the phone like a laser distance measuring tool and air quality sensor not exactly features that the masses will be rushing to the stores to get but for people that work in particular fields they're really useful features that you can have right on the phone in your pocket speaking of which if you haven't noticed already this phone is big and bulky and it feels like you're holding a small brick in your hand but it also feels built like a tank it's aluminum edges and hard plastic construction is not only durable with an IP 68 certification that means it's dust proof and can be submerged for up to an hour in 3 meters of water but it's also surprisingly grippy which should help to minimize drops though even if you do drop it Kat claims that it will survive falls on solid concrete up to 1.8 meters in height the display is 5.2 inches and made of Gorilla Glass 5 but don't expect any breathtaking visuals it was a good screen but not a great one at least from what we experienced on the show floor by default the phone comes with 64 gigabytes of storage but next to the SIM card tray on the left side is a micro SD card slot for expandable memory under that there's this yellow multifunction button that I find to be the best part about the phone design-wise I'm all for colored buttons like the ones on the pixel 2 and the fact that this one is the same orange yellowish color that you see at construction sites is pretty clever the selfie camera is 8 megapixels while the back camera is rocking a 16 megapixel shooter that's also capable of shooting 4k video now again this phone isn't much of a looker but I really didn't like the weird hump that it has along the top it could be because of the CIT branding but I found it to be a little obtrusive in a way that's too much even for a giant phone like this as far as actually using the phone I found the buttons to be clicky and responsive and they're spaced apart nicely so that even with gloves you probably won't have a problem doing what you need to do speaking of which the screen also works if you're wearing gloves so there's that now there are a bunch of other useful applications that we weren't able to set out on the show floor like built-in vehicle diagnostics and asphalt monitoring but overall everything that we tried worked pretty well now if this sounds like the perfect phone for you then you better start saving your pennies because it's going to cost 899 euros that's basically a thousand US dollars but I can't see construction companies buying these without a second thought just because of the durability what you sacrifice and aesthetics you gain in hardware saved for the chipset but it's good to see that sneech continued to be filled what do you think of the cat s60 one let us know in the comments down below and continue to follow us for more MWC coverage hit the subscribe button if you haven't already and of course click that notification bill so you'll be the first to know every time we upload a new video because we are your source for all things Android 
there's always a desire to save a little bit of money and one company that has really done a good job of it is honor with their budget smartphones they already have a presence in the West and now they're trying to hit the sub 500 dollar market with a high-end specification smartphone hey it's Josh Vergara what's going on everybody and this is the honor view 10 now for starters the on review 10 is only available in certain markets not necessarily available in the US just yet but this model in particular is used in Europe also I did something a little bit different with this review check the corner and keep your eye there just so you can see when that stuff happens for starters the view of the view 10 is really not all that bad we have this dark blue color here that shines real nicely and is a little bit understated until you give it a second glance and realize that dark blue is pretty nice it's also a very Spartan design as you don't have too many elements all around all of the buttons are over on one side and on the back you just have the honor logo with pretty much nothing else there other than the dual lens package both of those lenses stick out on their own and it provides a pretty unique look for the backing of this device the front is pretty much all screen all the time with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio and minimal bezels this 18 by 9 aspect ratio also allows for the phone to be pretty easily handled in one hand even though the screen to body ratio is quite good there is still a capacitive key on the bottom so it's not really all screen on the front but it does a good job of being as minimal as possible there is a fingerprint reader embedded within so that's where the fingerprint reader is but the capacitive key can actually be used for a number of different functions namely the ability to use it for everything that you would use soft keys for back home recent apps and you can even swipe up from the bottom of the screen to trigger a Google assistant that leaves more room for everything that you would do on that large 5.99 inch screen [Music] eighteen by nine aspect ratios are not necessarily special anymore but it is nice to see them coming in phones that are more affordable this is a full HD panel an IPS panel that comes in at a size of five point nine nine inches like we said before even though text and media all looks fine on this screen I did have to change the settings a little bit because at first because this is a full HD screen but it's a large screen some of the elements were a bit too big but it's easy to just jump into the settings and just shrink things down a little bit so it does look proper there is one thing I miss on this display and it's an always-on feature it's found on plenty of other phones even ones of the same price points and you kind of miss it when it's gone however there is face on lock which we'll get into a little bit later but it comes with it the ability to wake the device once you lift it up so when you have face unlock available you just lift up the device and it unlocks immediately once it recognizes my face pretty easy to get into the interface honor spares little expense and making sure the performance is top-notch we're now only seeing this trend start to occur more in the West but the storage and the RAM are really high you get six gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of on-board storage here it is also a dual SIM capable phone but one of those SIM slots can be used for a microSD card where honor takes it a step further is by putting in huawei's high-end chipset the Kirin 970 yes you heard that right the curé 970 that comes with a neural processing unit we're still in the early days of consumers seeing this kind of chipset so all of the benefits that the NPU is supposed to afford the performance aspect is yet to be seen fully the main place that we might see the NPU actually doing its job is in the camera when it's trying to select the proper modes for the scene other than that however the ki-rin 970 still does a great job of providing a speedy and reliable performance with this version of Android [Music] as far as connections go pretty much everything you would expect is here including NFC sand you can use the view tent for various payment platforms now speaking of connections I did use this phone which is a European model with the t-mobile network but because it doesn't really have the bands for it I wasn't able to use LTE connectivity instead I was on HSPA+ as far as battery life goes there is a 37 50 milliamp hour battery and here which is kind of impressive for a phone at this price point however the battery life is about where you would expect it to be and with that I was able to get up to 6 hours of screen on time but there's one thing that was clear it was able to get through an entire day on Wi-Fi in my case without any problems at all [Music] so we finally make it to the part that generally makes or breaks the full experience of an affordable flagship that's of course the camera now the camera has two lenses on the rear the main shooter has a 16 megapixel and a 20 megapixel monochrome sensor and together they're supposed to provide pretty sharp photos together with the potential power of the MP you making sure that you're using the right scene mode the combined camera package should be able to get some sharp and enjoyable photos and for the most part that was the case but the front-facing camera is a bit of a different story now I hesitate to say that the front-facing camera is actually all that bad in reality when you turn all of the modes off the pictures can actually come out fairly decent but it's when you turn all those modes that you realize that the Asian market routes this thing has greatly influenced the experience I'm talking of course about the beauty modes say what you will about a beauty mode about whether or not you would actually use it but it does do its job here as my freckles actually just disappeared from existence but of course in the West that's not really a priority when we want more detail and more clarity out of our photos the best I can say is that the front-facing camera is not really a bad shooter it's just it's priorities are a little bit different so it depends on what your needs are from a front facing potential beauty mode camera and if that's really what you want then the on review 10 actually does its job quite well those portrait mode and wide aperture modes are also available in the rear cameras even one year shooting video when used with some extra care the photos coming out of the phone can be pretty great sharpness is where it should be especially on the opposite end of the spectrum when compared to the front-facing camera and the colors are mostly accurate the camera does tend to overexpose a little but you just need to put a little bit of extra care with that evey slider and compensate for it there are plenty of other modes as well including HDR which is a mode and not a toggle which is kind of a personal pet peeve but there are also modes and more artsy modes if you want to get fancy what I do like about the video mode like I said is the ability to use the wide aperture mode while you're recording now technically these numbers don't really mean anything because the lens is already F 1.8 so you're going to get depth of field elements no matter what and as you've been seeing throughout this video I've been using clips to kind of break apart the review a little bit so you've already been seeing what the video quality can be like the main issue with the video is that there's no optical image stabilization so you if you have shaky hands then you're gonna get shaky video this lack of OIS is also bad for low-light shooting where the shutter has to be open for quite a while and you have to be incredibly still in order to get a well exposed shot but even if you move just a little bit then your shots might come out blurry so like with most cameras and most phones Rayleigh there is a bit of a give and take situation at this price point [Music] and finally we can talk about the software experience which happens to differ from many of the established Android iterations that are here in the West like I've been alluding to in this video there are some real Asian influences here and the software with the emui continues that trend the main thing you'll notice is there's no app drawer so you're going to have to make a bunch of folders or just put a third-party launcher on here but after that there are a number of other features that are available when you dive into the settings I already mentioned the navigation dock earlier where the one capacitive key can be used for everything that the soft keys would do and then there are also app centric abilities like putting access to some apps behind the lockscreen and then you can also have more than one instance of any application which is mainly used for social media apps speaking of social media there is a button in the gallery when you're looking at photos and video to just send it straight to snapchat when you click that button it will open up snapchat and you're able to get higher quality photos and potentially videos then the built in camera that snapchat has which we all know is pretty shoddy the face on lock setup is a little bit quick which makes me question its level of security sometimes however there is a feature here like we mentioned before that the screen will wake when you pick up the phone that allows you to have a seamless movement from prone position to getting into the interface just as long as your faces in view makes it for a pretty quick unlocking experience and so there you have it the honor view 10 honor is back and is providing a affordable flagship for the price of about four hundred and forty nine euros at least for this European version and then we'll see what the price is when it finally comes to the US overall it's a pretty good package that provides a good alternative to the one plus 5t which comes in at pretty much the same price point and provides a lot of the same features it's really that honors just putting its spin on it ends mainly the emui is the biggest change that you might notice from one to the other we'll do a comparison between the two soon but the bottom line is this honor has done a great job of bringing a high-end experience for a mid-range price and with potential improvements coming to the ki-rin 970 in the future this phone could maintain its relevance even longer than other flagship devices the rest of the phone is done well and at this point the whole package doesn't have to make this phone achieve more than just another on will mention so thank you guys so much for watching and hope you enjoyed this review of the honor view 10 now it's called the v10 in some markets and it's not available in the US yet but in Europe it does come in under $450 so that's something you can take into consideration when on or finally brings it to the United States otherwise you can keep it tuned to Android Authority for all of the best regarding honor its affordable

I got a minute maybe this whole AR emoji thing isn't just for the sheep maybe it's gonna be the best thing since gifts and don't put in the comments that are supposed to be gifs cuz I don't care but before we get into that let's talk about hardware cuz it's a big week in hardware news and we'll start off with the shamelessly named Xiaomi me mix 2's Xiaomi has confirmed that it will launch the me mix 2s on March 27th it also confirmed that the successor to the me mix 2 will have the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor the announcement is also showed off a mysterious number 273 741 have you got the geek cred to know what that is mmm I had to look it up you see this is likely a reference to the phone's possible score on the antutu benchmark tool if that's indeed the case it shows that the me max 2's will be a very powerful smartphone indeed now because xiaomi is branding this phone as a 2's is an indication that we're not going to see other major hardware changes in the phone other than the snapdragon 845 chipset this means we should remind ourselves that the me mix 2 has the current processing champion the snapdragon 835 inside along with a 5.9 9 inch display that has an 89th aspect ratio and a resolution of 2160 by 1080 it also has 6 q bytes of ram storage options for 64 128 and even a 256 gigabyte option battery sizes of Ida 3300 or 3400 million powers there's no word on pricing or market availability for the me mix 2's although it is likely to be launched first in China and India now for you Huawei fans out there the Huawei P 20 is actually the P 20 that's official but it won't be revealed at the Mobile World Congress this week a few days ago Huawei officially confirmed that they follow up phones to the P 10 and P 10 plus where the P 20 and P 20 plus the phones are unlikely to show up at the Mobile World Congress 2018 instead to be revealed at a separate Paris event in March the teaser video that sources this information is just 7 seconds long but it does throw in another hint towards three camera lenses in a very brief teaser video hence the looping while way shows a photo of Paris with an overlaid date of 2703 2018 the name of the device appears and then another hint that the phone will have count'em three cameras and then it's all over the three cameras rumor is curious though as we've got our hands on what we were told was a prototype of the Huawei p20 and there were definitely only two camera lenses on the device granted that the phone could be an early prototype model created before the decision was made to add a third lens so your guess is as good as ours now let's talk about specs we are almost certain that the Cure and 970 chipset will control the P 20 P 20 Plus which means both phones should have AI features onboard we also expect to see a choice between 6 or 8 gigabytes of RAM on microSD slot Android Oreo and a massive battery possibly as large as 4,000 milliamp hours of course this is all speculation and nothing will be confirmed until March 27th so let's talk about why I think potentially the AR emoji thing could be bigger than gifts and I think it's about precision well think about it for a moment you're on Twitter or messenger or Facebook and you're searching for a gift to express what words can't express as well as a visual aid but you can't find the gift that's just kind of accurate and right the way you want to say it well what of you could insert yourself in that gift and say exactly what you want to say or visually express exactly what you want to express without having to show your splotchy skin or a dirty background room right that's potentially if executed properly by the developers what AR emojis could do me likey what do you think I want to hear it in the comments below or in a more interesting way on Twitter with a gif tag me know if you want to get serious about branding yourself online our sponsor domain comm is over 300 domain name extension to fit your needs from comm tech club two dots pace and the guys of domain comm love the Android Authority audience so much they're showing their love by giving you 15% off an already really good price for domain names web hosting or email use our coupon code Android at domain.com check out when you think domain names think domain.com [Music]

created by Xiaomi powered by Google that's the pitch for the me a1 show meas first Android one smartphone it runs vanilla software has some pretty solid hardware and an affordable price this is Bailey Stein with Android authority and let's see if this promising smartphone really lives up to the hype so yes it is Android one meaning a couple of things one it's running totally stock Android there's no me UI here as Google handles everything in the software from the design to the features as you may have guessed this makes updating the software much easier Xiaomi has promised an update to Android Oreo before the end of the year in addition to regular security updates chummy's updates to their other mio i devices can be a bit hit or miss so this is pretty much the xiaomi phone to have if you care about software updates having used me UI in the past we were at first disoriented to you stock android on a xiaomi phone but it's something that we quickly got used to there are still some things that we miss from me UI and some we don't but we are overall very happy with the me a ones software experience perhaps the largest benefit of stock android over me UI is the slightly snappier performance with the me a1 everything runs quite smoothly apps launch quickly and it just overall feels faster than what we expect at this price hardware wise we're looking at shammies favorite chip aka the snapdragon 625 as well as 4 gigabytes of ram as we expected the power-efficient 625 chip combined with the stock android software makes for some very good battery life standby times were especially good so if you're more of a passive user you should have no trouble getting a couple of days out of a single charge the battery itself is three thousand eighty milliamp hours and can be charged from zero to 100% in two hours with the included charger that's pretty good although not overly impressive speaking of things that are good but not overly impressive let's talk about the cameras the me a ones dual camera setup is one of only a few in this price segment with it you get a 12 megapixel normal lens as well as a 12 megapixel telephoto lens this means that you can get up to two times to kazoom without losing any quality we've seen manufacturers type up their cameras time and time again only to be left disappointed when actually trying them out thankfully the camera here mostly left us impressed photos taken in good lighting look great there's plenty of detail and color reproduction is aesthetically pleasing dynamic range although not the best isn't too bad either the bundled portrait mode also does a nice job at correctly isolating the subject from the background in a few cases the effect felt a bit excessive but it's about as good as you're going to get at this price we were really only disappointed when taking it out at night images taken with less than ideal lighting lack detail and can be quite noisy so overall this certainly isn't a bad package it's just one that you should manage your expectations for as you may have expected the me a1 includes a dual nano SIM card tray for our American audience please note that you'll be limited to 3G with the me a 1 as it is not intended to be used here you can substitute one of the SIM slots for a micro SD card up to 128 gigabytes this is a great option to have if you don't think that the 64 gigabytes of internal storage will be enough for all of your pictures videos and music in case you're wondering yes the me a1 does still have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack when you don't have headphones on hand the bottom firing speaker can do a nice job at giving you a fairly loud minimally distorted sound when you'd rather watch on a television the me a1 has you covered with an integrated IR blaster which basically makes it a TV remote controller we always like to see manufacturers include this really cool feature as for the rest of the design what can we say we've certainly seen it before but it's elegant and premium nonetheless combined with a really great build quality we're really impressed with how Xiaomi was able to pull this off at this price the rounded edges and sleek side profile make it nice to hold on the hand the dual cameras do protrude a bit but it's no big deal the fingerprint reader is located below and off to the center of the cameras and is functionally on par with others in this segment xiaomi has opted for capacitive navigation keys which are illuminated and right below the display that display is a 5.5 inch 1080p panel and it's pretty good overall the glass is even slightly curved near the top which is a nice premium touch sunlight readability is actually really good too which is almost never the case at this price we would have liked to see slightly better contrast and more accurate color reproduction those are really our only complaints regarding the display 15000 rupees or about $230 that's how much the Xiaomi me a won costs for that price you're getting what may just be the perfect budget smartphone there's a lot to love about the me a1 from its premium build to its very good camera the clean stock Android experience with promised updates are quite attractive to sure the design could be more original and the camera could be better in low light but at this price those are some very small compromises if you're looking for a well-rounded future proof smartphone on a budget look no further than the Xiaomi me a1 and that will be all for this video be sure to subscribe if you haven't already and hit that Bell button if you'd like to be

is there such a thing as a dialed back version of a flagship device well that's exactly the kind of question that HTC wants to address with a more affordable in thus more accessible version of their flagship you 11 it's Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and this is the HTC u 11 life and I've been using it for the last few days quick disclosure I have had the U 11 life for a little bit now and though I was initially prepared to give a more casual take on what is basically a phone that tries to emulate its flagship original it slowly but surely became obvious that I needed to give it a closer look and that's because the HTC u 11 life started to succeed now two versions of the HTC u 11 life are going to be available in different parts of the world the original version that you're seeing in my footage is the version that has HTC software and additions but there is going to be a global Edition that runs Android 1 that version of course will not use all of the different software editions from HTC and instead has a very lean version of stock Android it is also going to be made to a much wider audience while the HTC u 11 life that I am using will be available in the US and will be on t-mobile at some point moving forward now some parts of the U 11 life are obvious downgrade from the original the shrunken down size of the phone is mostly due to a smaller screen 5.2 inches in its size with full HD resolution I actually quite liked the blue color of this phone even if it is really reflective and does get really smudgy the size is really nice though due to that screen as one-handed usage has been really easy on this phone and that also helps with the edge sense which is of course the feature from the U 11 that now makes it onto the U 11 life it is one of those flagship features that still makes it on the mid-range version and we do quite like having it you can do a quick squeeze in order to do one function and then squeeze and hold in order to trigger yet another function and even then HTC is trying to further the functionality by adding in a beta program in which you can use the squeezes inside of particular applications I've tried to use it in a few different situations with spotty results in most cases the original global trigger is what goes off instead of the in-app trigger but we will continue testing this moving forward especially since users can actually program specific tabs in pretty much any application for squeezing or holding the rest of the bits and pieces are all dialed back in the expected form the Snapdragon 630 power of the device and so far has been able to keep up with my daily usage and it's backed up by three gigabytes of RAM and only 32 gigabytes of on-board storage even though you do have an SD card slot for expandable 'ti i've already played quite a few games on this phone like shadow 4 and i haven't noticed the phone struggle to keep up at all the performance is actually noticeably smooth which is a feather in the cap of the phone specifications and optimization so far it doesn't really feel like you're sacrificing too much by picking the you 11 life and the same goes for battery life with a 2600 milliamp hour battery that is found in the u 11 life with my kind of usage that includes a lot of media some gaming and plenty of audio playing I was able to get four hours of screen on time which I thought was pretty impressive for a battery size like this and also for the kind of phone that I was using in fact it's part of what made me want to continue testing the phone to make sure that this experience is definitely the norm now audio has always been a focus in one way or another for HTC and the u11 life tries to soften the blow of putting away the headphone jack by including a pair of USB C earbuds these u sonic compatible earbuds can be powered by the phone for active noise-cancelling and this is all found inside of the settings and can be triggered in the notification shade it will try to cater the earbuds for a better perl file for noise cancelling and for the most part I've had a good time with these earbuds music and YouTube in particular have been a blast to enjoy due to this sound experience but there is something that we can't really let slide and while it's nice that these HTC earphones are included in the box there is no adapter in the box for using your own headphones instead of putting one in the Box users will have to buy an adapter separately for an extra cost we felt the need to really mention what could be a contentious choice by HTC now there's another place where HTC wanted to continue the high-end experience as much as possible and it continues in the cameras HTC put 16 megapixel cameras on both sides of this phone so that you would actually have some pretty high-quality selfies and so far that seems to be the case the rear camera is different from the 12 megapixel shooter of the original u 11 and both of these 16 megapixel cameras move up to an aperture of f28 for personally I have not spent enough time with the original HTC u 11 which is the reason why I want to give the camera a little bit more time in terms of testing I'm going to be getting my hands on a u 11 so that I can see how the quality changes from the original flagship to this more affordable life edition and finally there is the software which in my case involves HTC Sense now some people might not like HTC's take on Android but it's certainly less in-your-face than plenty of other iterations and you'll get even less of that with the Android 1 Edition which uses a very stripped-down version of Android that is made to make the phone even more affordable HTC Sense feed returns as well where social media posts can be accumulated in a grid format for easy viewing aside from that a number of features that you may be familiar with from other HTC devices returns here and we'll get into those more in our full review but the main addition that I want to mention here is HTC Alexa Amazon Alexa makes it onto the U 11 life as well so that you have more than one voice assistant available with this phone as an avid Google assistant user I'm still getting a further feel for Alexa as a potential daily voice assistant and it will be taken into consideration for our full review I'll try to use Alexa more than Google assistant and see if it actually provides a worthy replacement but nonetheless it is good to have a choice between two of the major assistance available now so for all that HTC is trying to do with this device the hope is that the you 11 experience can be had for less money and then of course is going to hinge on the price and as we mentioned before different versions of the you 11 life will be available with different types of software and in almost all cases the phone will sell for 349 dollars which is a pretty aggressive price for a phone that so far has been succeeding in being a reliable version of a flagship phone that doesn't sacrifice too much in the few days that I've used this phone as my daily driver I've been a bit surprised at how easily has handled my everyday tasks and usage it would be easy to just dismiss a lesser version of a flagship phone but real world experience with the you 11 life has me thinking a little bit harder stay tuned for my full review and let us know what you think of the you 11 life and indeed the other version of the you 11 that is not going to be making it to more markets but is still a new version of the you 11 flagship we'll see you all in the comments down below

hey Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and it's time to unbox and give my first impressions on the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL brought to you by audible now we're only doing an unboxing and first impressions today because we wanted to make sure we had enough time with these devices to bring you our full review which you can look out for within the next week but let's go ahead and get into the unboxing when I first got a glance at these boxes first thought that went through my mind was I wish I got the Panda 1 the pixel 2 XL is what we're unboxing here and it comes with a number of different accessories including a small tool in order to connect other devices to the phone in order for you to transfer your data after that you have a USB type-c cable and the USB type-c plug adapter this will allow for fast charging on the device so you never really have to worry too much about power draining out and then there is the one accessory that I think everyone is going to be a bit bummed out about the USB type-c 2 headphone jack adapter I'm sure a lot of you are ready to get right into the comments and talk about how you hate the fact that the headphone jack is gone from this device well I kind of share your sentiment I have wireless headphones that I love using but when those run out of battery I do hate having to have the adapter on me connected to my favorite pair of wired earphones just to be able to do things like play music or play YouTube or play some audio books from audible getting the device into my hand during my setup I was able to see that the pixel 2 XL is still a pretty attractive device it might not have too many bells and whistles but it has everything that you kind of need the essential is all available right where you need them like the fingerprint reader which is right underneath the glass panel that is sort of a calling card for the pixel design now now the smaller pixel 2 is obviously going to be the easier to handle one and slightly more accessible for a lot of users out there but you do miss out on the 18 by 9 aspect ratio screen that the pixel 2 XL can boast that aspect ratio makes for a device that is a little bit taller than it is wide and it's very akin to a lot of the devices we're seeing this year from the likes of Samsung and LG which have the same aspect ratio and overall the same kind of form factor the only thing that's missing here is the pixel to excels ability to get the screen to go as close to the edges as possible that might be a big deal to some of you out there but it isn't really that big a deal to me this does mean there's a little bit more to the chin in the forehead but that's because you have the front-facing camera and also dual front-facing speakers which all perform pretty well so far and another thing that I really love about this display on either of these devices is the always-on display this is something that has been missing on Nexus devices and pixel devices for a long time now and we've enjoyed it on other manufacturers devices now we have our own version of it and there's an extra feature the phone is basically listening for music cues at all times and when it recognizes a beat or a lyric it will start to search for what that song is and it appears in the always-on display and on top of all of that there's a little texture to the backing that is underneath this glass panel that provides a little bit of grip it doesn't just slip about in the hand too crazily and of course you're going to be holding the phone pretty tight because there's a squeeze feature now this isn't the first phone to have a squeeze feature and it does have one specific function opening the Google assistant even though it might have been nice to program this to other features I would argue that this is probably the best way to open up Google assistant at any given time and Google assistant can do a ton of stuff not only are you constantly googling things throughout the day potentially but it can also open applications or trigger functions inside of the device like opening applications like shadow of war it is pretty easy to trigger the squeeze depending on how you're picking up the phone for example if I was using my fingers in order to pick up the device off of a table I might squeeze it just hard enough that it triggers Google Assistant not a huge deal but something to keep in mind another exciting feature about these pixels is the camera experience the rear camera is only a single camera it's not going to have dual lenses whatsoever but it is going to use computational photography in order to use data that can help you get the best quality out of your shot I'm going to give you more camera samples and also tests on the optical image stabilization and other features of the camera in my full review later on but for now I want to talk about the front-facing camera an 8 megapixel shooter that actually has a portrait mode aside from the fact that the front-facing camera seems to be pretty high quality in and of itself turning on the portrait mode brings in that computational data in order to draw out the foreground and blur out the background making for while a portrait pictures in portrait mode tend to be really pleasing to the eye at least so far and we haven't tested it in low-light ditions yet but we're pretty happy with what we see so far you don't see any egregious problems with the foreground subjects getting cut out along with some background elements the pixel - and the pixel - Excel come with the snapdragon 835 4 gigabytes of RAM and large quantities of on-board storage depending on how much you pay there are different sizes in the batteries but I wanted to tell you about the smaller battery in the pixel - I do a lot of video calls these days and on facebook messenger video calls I went from 100 to zero on a very long call with somebody that went for about three and a half hours after that however I went back to normal usage that included some gameplay of shadow of warm YouTube Facebook social media browsing all of the above and I was able to get five and a half hours out of that battery so we're going to do more testing on these batteries but so far I actually think the smaller pixel 2 is a good indicator that battery life on these phones will be pretty good and finally let's talk about the software Android Oreo which is exciting because this is going to be the first time I'm using it on the daily all of the elements including text seem to flow about perfectly exactly the way they are supposed to in a stock version of Android and being able to just seemingly flow from different applications to the recent apps screen to even the picture-in-picture which is automatic for applications like YouTube just seems right I'm inclined to say that this is the version of Android that everybody should be experiencing and that has been true for pixels and Nexus devices in the past but with Android 8 there are a lot of great additions including even the battery life application that is built into the settings and shows a lot of great statistics as to what is really taking up your screen on time but let's pop back to that Sophia took a little bit ago and let's talk about google lens google lens is still going to be put into google assistant in the coming day so we can't really test that part out yet but it is built into Google Photos now and you can do really quick scans of photos that you've already taken in order to do quick Google searches but I want to talk about the selfie I took because when I put it through the Google Photos Google lense apparatus it was able to read the text on my shirt that you can see here which is a restaurant out in Maui that is an incredible restaurant and it was able to provide that search automatically we obviously can't judge google lens yet until we get the full version of it with Google assistant but I thought this was a really cool feature and I wanted to share that with you right now and so there you have it my first impressions on the pixel tube and the pixel to excel there are already some great features about this phone that I'm using on the daily and the battery life seems to be surprisingly good so far but we're going to give you all of our final thoughts in our final review as always thank you guys very much for watching and we

so my gaming rig is quite a beast it has a gtx 1070 graphics card so it can play all of the latest games on Ultra settings and it has a terabyte of storage so I can keep all of my music and videos in one place the only slight problem is it's upstairs and I'm down here fortunately technology is all about finding creative ways to be lazy as it would happen there are a ton of different ways you can stream your PC to an Android device that means you can access documents it means you can play games and you can do all this from anywhere in the house or even outside of the house and it's much easier than you might think - in fact I'm going to show you how you can do all that in just seven minutes so yeah in just seven minutes I'm going to show you how you can access any app or file on your PC via your phone I'm gonna show you how to constrain Steam games so you can play The Witcher 3 from anywhere I'm gonna show you how you can use your phone as a controller a media controller so you can pause and stop your playback and I'm gonna show you how you can wake your PC from anywhere in the house or even outside of the house via an app that's right seven minutes let's go to the first and most basic thing you're gonna want to do is to stream your desktop to your android device there are a few apps that can help you do this such as TeamViewer but the one I'm gonna be recommending is called Splashtop remote - so to get this up and running it's actually very simple and easy first of all you need to take the host device that's the computer and you need to navigate to the website and download the streamer then on your Android device you're going to head over to the Play Store and you're going to download the Splashtop remote - app and once that's all installed open up the app on your phone and make sure it's also open on your PC and you should be able to see a list of all your devices on your home network click the one you want to connect to and that way you can remote stream your desktop or even access the camera for a little bit of spying so Splashtop remote 2 is great for streaming a range of apps and media but what about for gaming for gaming lag becomes more of an issue and for that reason you might want to try a different app called remote rrah or remote or remote and then are this is basically an app that allows you to stream from Steam so as long as a game is added to steam or you installed it through Steam then you'll be able to stream it straight to your not only is it quicker and lower latency but you'll also have access to on-screen controls or you can use an additional controller so you will need a Steam account but as long as that's installed on your computer then the process is very simple to setup in fact it's very similar to Splashtop you need to download the software on the host side on the pc and you need to get the app on the Play Store for your Android device once you've installed both those things it's just a matter of connecting to the home network and then you'll see a list of your computers that are available through the app click the one you want to use select the game from the game library and you're good to go okay so how about a different scenario let's say you're enjoying a bit of Netflix and chill on the sofa downstairs with your partner and you're casting from your PC upstairs you want to pause it so you can go and make a cup of tea but that means going all the way upstairs and hitting pause on the computer and that is just far too much hard work wouldn't it be great if you could use your Android device to just pause play resume skip etc well if you might have guessed there is an app that let you do this it's called unified remote and setting it up couldn't be easier in fact it's pretty much the exact same process as it has been for the last two basically you just need to navigate your PC over to the unified remote website and download this server on the host side and for the app you'll get that from the Play Store and install it on your Android device okay so we're doing pretty well but you haven't achieved full laziness just yet because at the moment whilst we control our PC for my phone we still need to turn it on manually we still need to go all the way upstairs turn on the power button and then come all the way back downstairs and that's just not okay fortunately there is a way around this and it's called wake-on-lan and basically what this means is that as long as your computer is plugged into an Ethernet port and in a low powered state it can listen out for a magic packet sent over the home network and use this as a trigger to turn on when we want it to first of all like I say you're going to need an Ethernet connection the computer needs to be plugged in to a wired internet connection if you don't happen to have an Ethernet port in the same room as your PC don't worry there is a way around this you can use something called a powerline adapter I'm using one called tp-link and it works just fine for wake-on-lan you can even get a USB type-c adapter for Ethernet so that you can plug your smartphone straight into the wall for a much more stable connection and this is great for better performance when you're using something like core imatra so to set this up on the PC side first need to boot into the BIOS once in there you can normally find the setting to allow wake-on-lan fairly easily it should be under security or advanced or something like that okay next we're going to need permission from Windows to do this you're going to open up your device manager now expand the network adapters section right-click on your network card and select properties then go to the Advanced tab then scroll all the way down and click enable on wake on magic packet finally click power management and then make sure you've ticked the boxes that say allow the device to wake the computer and only allow a magic packet to wake the computer once you've done all that put the computer in sleep mode and then you're going to head over and download a wake-on-lan app on your mobile device just install that app open it up and you should see all the computers connected to your home network listed click the one you want to wake and if everything has gone well your computer should boot up from sleep as if by magic as if by magic packet but some of you might be wondering if there's any way you can do this remotely let's say that you're in a coffee shop or at work and you realize that you've forgotten an important file that you need for the day ahead so using the Wi-Fi in the coffee shop or your 4G connection is there any way that you can wake your computer up back home and then send that file over via Dropbox or Gmail well of course there is otherwise that would have been a pointless bit of schpeel so this is going to use something called port forwarding with port forwarding what you're basically doing is sending a message to your router back home and you're reto is then forwarding that magic packet on to the computer that you want to wake so to set this up you're going to need to access the advanced settings of your router normally you do this by pointing your browser towards a specific address and you should be able to find that address on the leaflet that came with your router if you've lost this and why wouldn't you have then give your broadband provider a call because you might also need a password or if you just need the address then look online so each of your devices have their own private IP addresses and then your router has a public IP address and that's the address that the outside world sees every now and then your Rooter will change the IP address of the private devices on your network and it does this via a process called DHCP or dynamic host configuration protocol of course if you want to wake up your device then you can't have its address changing all the time because you wouldn't be able to find it and that's why we need to set it as static IP so find the DHCP section of your control panel and then you're going to want to set yourself a reserved rule for the device that you want to wake up so find your device listed and then tick it and then normally you'll just click Add rule or something like that and then you should see it listed with a static IP address and MAC address and at this point I also want you to write those down because you're gonna need them later on okay the next thing you're gonna want to do is to set up the port forwarding and this basically means that your Rooter is gonna listen out for the specific message and it's gonna send that on to the correct IP address so find the port forwarding section in this control panel and then enter the following details so for the local IP address you're going to enter that IP address that you just noted down for the local start poor and port an external start port end port you're going to enter nine for the protocol you're going to select both and where it says enabled you of course want to set that to on once that set up you just need to find an app that supports one wall I'm using one called wall on to open up the app and then hit the plus button to add a new device so if the computer name just use a computer name for your own reference under the MAC address just use the MAC address that you wrote down earlier under route to IP or hostname you're going to use your public IP and if you don't know what that is then go to Google and search from what is my IP it should be the first thing that comes up for port you're going to choose 9 again and then just click Save and you're done and with that done you should now be able to wait your computer from anywhere so if you found this video useful and interesting

[Music] hey it's Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and these are our final thoughts on the one plus 5t now I say final thoughts because we've already done an initial review on the 1 plus 5t and we wanted to spend a little bit more time with it to make sure we brought you our real final thoughts and that's what you're getting today if you want to check on the initial review you can see the card that's appearing right now or go to the link in the description and if you want even more detail on this device you can head over to Andrew thority comm and read the full written review written by myself and David and Mel we are still enjoying the design of the 1 plus 5t and that's mainly because of the screen that now takes up all of the front there were a couple of changes that had to be made but the vast majority of this design still takes cues from the original 1+5 that includes the alert slider and all of the buttons are in the same place and of course you still have the headphone jack which is still a thing here on the 1 + 5 t and the USB C charging port down on the bottom the main change that occurred here is that the finger per meter is now on the back it's still the ceramic reader though which means it's a very fast and a very reliable fingerprint reader for just unlocking the device really easily by simply tapping on the small circle now found on the back but speaking of security there is another way of unlocking the device now and it is comparably quick to the fingerprint reader and it's called face on lock after putting your data into the device you will be able to just look at the phone and when you hit the power button it will go straight into the interface it is a bit scary quick but in our testing so far we haven't really been able to fool it which is nice to know however the face unlock will not be used for all of the different functions for security as in applications and certain other functions you will still have to use either a passcode a password or your fingerprint as they are much more secure and oneplus knows that so there really isn't too much else that we can say about the design of the 1 + 5 t but there is one not that we want to give to 1 + is dedication to first party accessories and that's because we got a bunch of cases with our review units and to be honest they're all pretty high quality there's a red case that we used for a little while that really makes the phone stand out but we did go back to the sandstone material for that case and that's the one we've been using on our review unit it's a bit of a throwback and reminds us of the time when these materials used to be what you actually got on the phone itself so we can talk about that display but it's a 6-inch display coming in at full HD resolution and it is an AMOLED panel which means that the colors look really great and oneplus has done a great job of tuning it for its version of Android oxygen OS if you do want to change the way that color is displayed on this screen then you can go into the settings and go to color calibration it does include a mode for srgb an adaptive mode and you can actually get a slider that allows you to go completely cool or completely warm it's nice to have this level of control over the display but there are also some extra features that return from the oneplus 5 one of the favorites is a reading mode which I've already used for the Amazon Kindle application and has helped in making a long reading session even more comfortable aside from not moving to quad HD resolution there's really only one other missed opportunity when it comes to the oneplus 5ts display and that is the ambient display it looks great but we think that just a little bit of tweaking could have made this a great always-on display as well but maybe not having an always-on display on here is one of one pluses ways of ensuring good battery life and to be honest our 1+5 teams have had great battery life with the 3300 milliamp hour unit in here we were able to get an average of over 5 hours of screen on time but in my experience in particular I actually got a few days where I had about seven and a half hours of screen on time throughout an entire 12 to 16 hour day and of course you can use - charging to get the phone back up and running in no time at all the rest of the hardware is still high quality like in the oneplus five and they are the best specifications that are available now the snapdragon 835 is backed up by either six or eight gigabytes of RAM and then 64 or 128 gigabytes of on-board storage you can also use dual SIM on here but there is no SD card slot some quality has been good across the board including with calls on facebook messenger or otherwise where we had clear calls and the people on the other side of the line said that we sounded loud and clear the headphone jack returns which is probably going to be good news for a lot of users out there and it's a pretty good yet standard experience if you have a good pair of headphones that are going to sound fine on here but you do get a little bit of control in an audio tuner if you want to change that up a bit and when it comes to Bluetooth headphones you can even select what kind of codec it outputs to your Bluetooth headset one thing I do want to give another nod to is the speaker it's a bottom mounted speaker which is not ideal but it still gets really loud without piercing the highs are muddling the lows now I actually tested this while like taking showers what I think a lot of people do from time to time and the one plus 5t turns out to be the loudest one that i've used without having a bad sound profile but i did have to make sure the phone was outside of the shower doors because this phone does not have an IP certification so finally we can get into the camera and this dual lens here does not have a zoom lens like before on the one plus five which had a two times optical zoom this time you have a 20 megapixel F 1.7 RGB sensor that is activated in low-light situation so that it can group four pixels together for even better low-light shots now that's a really lofty claim to make and we wanted to test it against other phones like the original one plus five but also mainly the pixel two now in our testing we found that the secondary lens simply does not activate unless you're in the darkest of situations which means that low-light performance doesn't necessarily live up to the claims that oneplus made now the reason why that's a bit of a bummer is because in all other situations the 1 + 5 t actually performs quite well ranging from decent to actually pretty great in broad daylight situations photos are nice and sharp the dynamic range is pretty adequate and the color saturation is not too far off the deep end the front-facing camera is a 16 megapixel shooter and it does not have a portrait mode but it still gets some pretty good selfies for those of you who prioritize that but speaking of the portrait mode it is still a good performer on the rear camera that you can use whenever you want to take a nice shot of somebody with a bokade background but without that optically zoom the lens there is a wider angle to it so you're gonna get more in the background behind the sharp subject we also tested the 4k video recording which yielded some pretty good footage that is helped along by EIS so that shaky footage will actually be stabilized a little bit better this time around so the 1 + 5 T remains a good and reliable shooter to have in your pocket but those claims about low-light performance go largely unrealized and that's a bit of a disappointment and probably even more so for those of you who wanted to keep that zoom lens we're gonna end us off with software and oxygen OS which pun intended it's a breath of fresh air oxygen OS has become one of our favorite versions of Android simply because it doesn't try too hard a new feature in this version of oxygen OS is parallel apps where you can have multiple versions of the same social media application if you do want to be able to change between them for different counts but aside from that there are some other features that return here but they've been refined and overall just the look of oxygen OS has been further polished it's as if oxygen OS is coming of age of you with the app folders have a distinct but simplistic look and the entire interface provides some customization options that are equal parts powerful yet subtle for example changing to the dark mode completely changes the way you look at oxygen OS and then changing the accent colors provides just that little bit of detail that makes it a personalized experience back at the home screens you still have the Shelf which is a great place to put some widgets so that they don't cover up the wallpaper and one plus includes a bunch of wallpapers that look wonderful on this AMOLED display on top of pictures that were actually taken with one plus five T's that double as great backgrounds as well and finally if you need some extra customization you can actually change the function of the soft keys so that you can change what they do if you hold on either of the buttons or double tap them oxygen OS refrain from having too many features or applications and thus it also keeps from having redundancies so it's a breath of fresh air to be able to say again that oxygen OS is simplistically elegant and this entire package comes in at a price that undercuts a lot of the main flagships out there at five hundred dollars for the base model you will be able to get a wonderful Android experience with a good camera and good hardware that screams premium and you won't have to pay an arm and a leg in a world where we're paying up to $1,000 for phones that have so many features in them that we might not ever use it's great to be able to go back to the basics and just provide an experience that is incredibly reliable and something that you might be able to use for the better part of the next year or two and you only have to pay 499 dollars for it so yes we do think that people would have a great time with the 1 + 5 t especially since it won't be so hard on the wallet keep it tuned to Android Authority for even more about the 1 + 5 t check out our initial review and also check out the full review over at Andrew 30.com written by myself and David ml and then stay tuned for even more content from us about the 1 + 5 t and about the rest of the smartphones that you've seen here in 2017 and then after that don't forget to

the story of flappy bird should be a highly inspiring one for any mobile developer or any budding mobile developer this is the story of an app created by just a regular guy a 28 year old guy called dong Yuen it was a very simple app something that anyone could really build but it just happened to be in the right place at the right time and he got really rich and famous from it so this just goes to show you that you don't need a huge budget you don't need to be a coding genius you don't need a massive publishing company behind you if you have a relatively good game a simple idea and you make it then there's a chance that you can still be successful thanks to the distribution platform that is the Google Play Store and this really would be an easy app for anyone to build even if you're a complete beginner and especially if you use a tool like unity which just makes the whole process that much simpler that much quicker so in this video I'm gonna demonstrate that by showing you how to make a flappy birds game for Android in just 10 minutes using unity you'll go from a completely blank screen to a fully working game and with just a few extra tweaks things like a high score maybe a menu screen you'd be able to release this on the Play Store and who knows maybe make your own millions actually remember me when you're rolling in piles of cash of course before we begin you are going to need yourself a copy of unity and you need to set that up with the Android SDK I'll leave a link in the description down below to show you how to do that there's also going to be a link in the description down below which will take you to the post that goes with this video that will share a lot more detailed instruction all the source code etc so if this is a little bit speedy for you then go there and you can get more detailed information and go at your own pace so we have much time without further ado let's get to it let's get to it or to [Applause] okay so first you're going to create a new project make sure it's a 2d project and I'm dragging in some sprites here into my scene that are ready-made if you want to make sure the sprites the same size as mine so you can follow along exactly then set the bird to be at position zero zero and point five scale and set the pipe there to four on the X&amp;Y axis we're going to copy that we're going to make another one that's going to be upside down like so I'm going to rename this one pipe down we're going to add a rigidbody to the bird so select that and then inspector so they've add component and I'm going to add the constraint on the z-axis that'll stop him from spinning around and rotating now gonna add another component that being a polygon Collider that's his bound so he'll bump into things and unity will know when he touches something and we want to tag him as a player this will help us to refer to him later in the code drag the camera onto the bird in the hierarchy there on the left and that make sure that the camera moves in relation to the bird now we're going to add the same Collider this time a box Collider to a pipe and then to the other pipe we only need the Collider there no physics necessary now I'm making three new scripts in a folder I've traded in the assets folder there c-sharp scripts that's character pipe up and pipe down so basically a script for each of our three sprites we have open up the character script first we're going to make a public midget body 2d so that is the the physics attached to our character now I'll make a public float that's a an accessible number that we can change we're gonna make several of these ones gonna be the move speed one will be the flapping height and we can change that later on you'll see we're going to create a public game object for the pipe up and another one for the pipe down so that means we can access those elements in our script so first we need to tell unity where the rigid body is so our B equals getcomponent and then that's the rigidbody 2d we have attached to our game object there okay and now in the update method that's a method that's called repeatedly with as the game refresh we're going to add some velocity to our rigidbody the script the physics script attached to the character so this is going to keep the character moving constantly to the right and we're keeping the y-coordinate the same see I say our PE bilasa T Y therefore the y coordinate we're basically saying whatever the Y velocity is keeping like that okay now we're using an if statement so that means that the following code will only execute if this statement in the brackets here is true and we're saying that if the player clicks the mouse button then we're going to add some movement going upwards so that's going to be a flapping motion now a mouse button is translated as a screen touch anywhere when you save this and run it on Android okay now we're gonna do another if statement and this time we basically want to just detect when our character goes too high or too low so when they're out of bounds then we're going to kill them because we don't want to be able to fly over or below the pipes that look strange and it's cheating okay so now we're going to create a new method and this one's going to be called death and that's where we're going to handle our player death so yeah our method is any piece of code you closed in curly brackets and you can call it from anywhere else within your script so we're saying public void death void means that it's not returning any data it's just performing a function and public music can access it from other scripts we're gonna remove all velocity because we want to be stationary when you respawn then we're just going to literally move him by taking the transform their transform being his current position and setting it back to zero zero now we're going back in here we're going to add the component the script to our player character change these public variables here in the inspector and then there you go so that's why you make public floats like that so you can change them from outside of the script okay now you're going into your pipe up script and I'm creating a reference to our character object and also to our other pipe up pipe down object so again we need to tell unity where to find those two the character is going to look for an object with the character script attached to it we just added that component to our character sprite then we're going to put another if statement in the update to method which remember happens repeatedly every time the game's refreshed and we're gonna say if the distance between the character and the pipe is bigger than 30 then what we're going to do is we're going to destroy our pipe and we're going to create a new one ahead of us so basically when the pipe goes off the left of the screen because remember the character keeps moving forwards we need to disappear and we need a new pipe a new challenge to appear in front of us so now we're creating three random variables and these are random numbers and we want that because we want the pipes been slightly different positions each time so we're getting a position for the X for the Y and for the gap the distance between the two pipes the top and the bottom one we want to make sure that we move the pipe the correct distance in front each time but also add a little bit of an random element just to keep things fresh and keep things fun now we're going to instantiate meaning create a new version of this game object what is a game object with a small G unity will assume you're referring to this game object that the script is attached to so we're creating this new game object using a vector that's a position and we're making it in front of our character 30 spaces in front but at the same time adding on that random element and then we're keeping the height accurate with a slight random element as well I'm going to instantiate the other pipe the pipe down that's why we added that reference to the pipe down up there at the top and the reason we're doing that in this script rather than in the pipe down own script is because we've generated these random numbers and this way we can make sure that they stay aligned with each other without having to do some you know do Hickory to make sure that the distance stays the same by sharing those random variables just makes more sense to put it here you'll see how it all works in a moment and then we're going to destroy this game object I want to create the new pipe ahead when used to destroy the old one who don't do that they're going to keep popping up ahead and it will take up a lot of memory ok now we're creating one more method and this is going to be one of the most useful methods you use a lot in unity is the on collision enter 2d so that means that when something touches the collider this happens and we're saying when the thing that touches it has the tag player remember we added the player tag to our character then we're going to call that public method from our character script called death so we're saying character death that's the great thing about public method that means that you can call that bit of code from other scripts attached to other objects so add the component add the script to the pipe up there same when you did before add component scripts ok click play and now each time you touch that pipe you respawn it kills you great now we need to do the same thing of course for pipe down except we've handled a lot of the code already and pipe up so this is going to be a little bit easier we just need to repeat a few of those same steps we used before so we've created a reference to our character up there and we're gonna tell unity where the character is we've done this before find objects of type character meaning it's looking for an object with that character script attached ok and then in the void update remember the method that is repeatedly called each time the game refreshes we're saying that if the character is a certain distance away from the pipe again and then we're just going to destroy the game object no need to be spawn it because it's being respond at the exact same time that the the upwards one is being created and then we can just copy that on collision enter script from the other place from the other script and there you go now creating a new folder called prefabs make sure you add that to the pipe down sprite by the way a prefab is a ready-made game object with all your attributes and scripts attached so I've deleted them from the scene and just put them into my prefabs folder there now you can see here in the pipe up script in the inspector I have that option to add my public game object and so I'm putting in there that pipe down so that means that the script will know where pipe down is and it will be able to find it and instantiate it and because doing it from the prefab that means that it's going to have all those important attributes attached as you can see it work there nicely so now I'm just gonna add in one more method called build level and this is where we're going to instantiate the first batch of pipes because you need to make sure we've got a good few pipes up there ahead so that they we're not gonna have spaces so that they'll fill the screen and if you use the same numbers that I did in the same sprites then you can just copy this fruit pause the screen and copy out but play around with way you want your pipes would be you can add random positions to start with if you want in the interest of good housekeeping would also be a good idea to destroy the pipes every time the player dies you can add that in later on but now when we press play because that's in the character script they're all going to be instantiated of course we need to add those public objects from the prefabs very important you as from the prefab not from the scene now when we click play those ones I've instantiate it in my build level script which is called at the start of the game and also when the character dies we'll be right here so for mine they're going to be in the same position every time and then as we go for they're going to start disappearing and reappearing in front of us and they go it works nicely so that's my flappy bird game it's so much fun I could do this for the days you know I don't want it don't want it to end really yeah there we go we've run through that all quite quickly I realize but you know slow it down when you need to and hopefully you've got to grasp the concepts if the only thing you don't understand then click the link in the description down below and I go through in a bit more detail and explain things like prefabs what they are they're just a really useful way of creating a game object with all the attributes already attached and also it means if you change an attribute on one it'll change those qualities across every instance of that object throughout your games you have to make lots of changes people said last time they want to see how you actually create an apk how you make this into a game that you can share let's do that you just need to go into build settings then you choose Android as your platform and then you choose switch platform then if you click player settings then I'll open up in the inspector a whole bunch of options where you can say things like them the package name the version the Android version you're targeting etc and then you just hit build and run and it will build it and one more thing you need to do before hit building run is to save your scene that's the level and then add that to scenes in build so there you go that's one way you can create a nearly fully working flappy bird game in just 10 minutes really was pretty quick and simple there's not much more you need to do to make that fully functional and release it on the store and who knows start getting some

hey judge Asha forgot what's going on everybody and you can see me here rocking the Asus zenfone 5 which has just been announced but the 5z is what we're talking about in this video because it was announced at their press event on top of the ones that you already saw in Lon's video so make sure you go and check that out it comes with a 6.2 inch screen about a 19 by 9 aspect ratio because one of that 19 is used for a bit of a notch at the top just for the notification area there is a nice little feature there where you're able to see the other notification icons if you just tap the top portion of the screen but everything plays underneath the notch so you still get a full screen experience aesthetically the zenfone 5 Z looks exactly like the zenfone 5 but it gets a bump up in its specifications the performance is powered by a Snapdragon 845 it comes with 6 gigabytes of RAM and a lot of storage you can get up to 256 gigabytes of storage on this phone making it an incredibly powerful phone you also get all of the same other features from the zenfone 5 including the stereo speakers and to the ability to play high res audio and of course all of the artificial intelligence features including a are charging AI scene detection ai portrait in AI boost and the same camera experience is available with a wide angle lens on the rear camera to bolster the already existing 12 megapixel shooter with an F 1.8 aperture now while coming out in June so you have to wait a little while the best part about this phone is that it's priced under five hundred dollars which is an incredible price for a phone that rocks all of this including the latest Snapdragon 845 that we have yet to see in more phones so far but here's a bit of a sward for you the zenfone 5 Z actually was not shown at the event we just wanted to make sure to have this video out so we can announce to you that it actually exists they kept it under wraps for the stage at their press conference and the phone that you've been seeing me use here is actually the zenfone 5 like we said it looks exactly like this n phone 5 Z but we wanted to take this time to bring you a video so you knew about the snapdragon 845 toting version of a Seuss's new zenfone 5 line if you need more about the other phones and more about the 5c you can keep it tuned to android authority and don't forget to watch lawns video regarding the other two zenfone 5 devices keep it tuned here to andrew authority for more about this powerhouse from masseuse and then head on over to andrew authority comm because of course here at MWC 2018 we are your source for all things Android 
Arai will these new pixels devices meet the big hope the big expectations I hope [Music] next pixel phones continued this week with new images that reportedly show the backs of both the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL prices for both phones were reportedly revealed as well the leaks come from droid life using unnamed sources and they claim that the LG made pixel 2 XL will cost 849 dollars for the 64 gigabyte version and 949 dollars for the hundred twenty-eight gigabyte model the somewhat blurry images of the phone that were posted with the article showed that the top quarter of its back where its camera will be has a dark black color the rest of the back which also contains its fingerprint sensor will be colored either in slightly gray or in white the official names of the colors will just be black and black and white thank you google for not giving us some sort of pretentious color like ocean gray the smaller HTC made pixel 2 as reported by drawed life will be priced at six hundred forty nine dollars for the 64 gigabyte version and seven hundred forty nine dollars for the hundred and twenty eight gigabyte variant the leaked images show that the top quarter of the phone will somewhat match the color of the rest of the back no panda phone for the pixel too apparently it shows a just black clearly white and kind of blue version will be available now what I'm about to say may be totally negated if the pixel device has come out with some sort of killer feature but I doubt that they will I hope that I'm wrong but here's the thing what is the point of pixel devices at all what's the point of google making an android phone of their own in the past when it came to Nexus devices they were meant to demonstrate to other manufacturers what is possible with an Android experience especially a vanilla Android experience and they would really push things and they really improved a lot of things and other manufacturers would follow suit and they made them affordable now the pixels are going to be priced at a premium level no problem but give us thing unique push the envelope do something whether in design or function operation I don't know what it is but why are you giving us kind of a phone for a premium price what's the point what are you doing I don't know what do you think let me know in the comments below what killer feature would matter to you did you really love the pixels I mean the the camera on the original pixel was fantastic yes but yeah I don't know if that's gonna be enough this time around let me know right here on Twitter or in the comments below [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] 
peices has always tried to tempt us with their high specs low price flagships and they she was really no different we got a chance to visit them at CES 2018 and they showed off their newest addition to the zenfone line the zenfone max plus now sure this thing isn't going to wow you with a snapdragon 835 and an insanely clean UI basis has always gone after the budget minded consumers who want a large amount of features at a lower price and that's exactly what the zenfone max is it's got three to four gigs of RAM 32 to 64 gigabytes of storage it uses a mediatek octa-core processor to power it but the real kicker here is the battery in the dual cameras the zenfone max is packin 4130 million powers of capacity which is enough to make anyone take a second look at this to the fact that you're using a full HD display instead of Q HD and you're probably gonna have a ridiculous amount of battery life out of this thing it's still using micro USB though so yeah no rapid charging this time around as I mentioned earlier this phone also has dual cameras now don't expect pixel two levels of quality out of this phone but for the time we had it it actually seemed to perform pretty well the second camera is wide-angle like the LG BT 30 so if you've been itching to get some wide shots on the cheap this might be worth a look it's also got a face unlock feature which seems to be pretty popular these days but I'd be careful how much faith you put into this feature it's not all rainbows and unicorns though the metal they use on the body feels pretty cheap and felt really tinny and slippery in my hand add that to the fact that genui is still pretty bad especially sentenced running on top of android 7.0 nukid you've got something you're really gonna want to skin pretty hard with a third-party launcher still at the price point asus is asking this is a pretty interesting device a huge battery and average screen will probably get you a ton of london Tiffa t if that's the most important aspect of your phone and the wide-angle camera lens can be pretty fun to play with if you're bored of the average focal length you'll be able to get the zenfone max plus in February of 2018 it'll come in deep C black in Azure silver make sure you stay tuned to android authority to keep up to date with all CES coverage because of course we are your source for all things Android 
and here it is the latest Samsung Galaxy S flagship the Samsung Galaxy S nine is Java gara what's going on everybody and we're here to take a look at Samsung's latest device and tell you everything that it brings to the table considering this is the ninth generation of an already high powered line of smartphones [Music] now when you look back on at the Galaxy S 8 and in some ways even the Galaxy S seven were already wonderful in their own ways and they delivered a number of different features that a lot of smart phones have now and what the Galaxy S nine Samsung is trying to continue that trend but we wouldn't be surprised if it was a little bit difficult which is why it was almost surprising to us that when we left our meeting taking a look at this phone for the time that we did we actually still had a lot to talk about when it comes to the design language it's all pretty much the same with the glass on glass design but there is this lilac purple color that you're already seeing in this video and yes we'll talk about in a second but there are two lenses on the back of this Galaxy S 9 plus that I'm using for the majority of this video now the overall footprint for these phones remains the same as before however the screen has been tweaked a little bit we don't really have a close-up of it but the screens don't really bleed all the way over to the edges anymore this is still the infinity display of what Samsung wanted to minimize the potential accidental touches that you'll have on the sides when holding the phone in one hand on top of that the Super AMOLED screen is made just that tiny bit brighter so it's something that you might notice especially in broad daylight but when you go around the body of the device that you realize there are a couple of key changes the first one we'll talk about and is one you probably saw already is the fingerprint reader it is now below the camera package and that makes it easier to reach with your index finger no matter which way you slice it this is better for anyone that wants to use their fingerprints as the main way of unlocking the device however Samsung is obviously moving towards other biometric meters like for example using the face scanner or the iris scanner and this time putting them together into what they call the intelligent scan basically you're going to scan both your face and your eyes and at any given time if it's not able to use one of the measures they will use the other so that you always have a way of unlocking the phone while you're just looking at it and in case you're wondering yes the headphone jack still remains but right next to it and past the USB type-c port is a new speaker and the reason for that is because that's one of two speakers yes stereo speakers are now available on the galaxy s 9 and they are certified by Dolby Atmos they get really loud and we did a small comparison compared to the single speaker of the galaxy s 8 and the sound is just louder richer and fuller and underneath the surface you get all of the bits and pieces that you would expect a bit of connectivity the snapdragon 845 is the bump up in performance and you also get six gigabytes of ram on the larger s9 + putting it that little step above the original smaller model the batteries are all the same as well from before you have 3000 milliamp hours in the smaller unit and 3500 in the bigger one but that brings us to what was really considered here in the new version of Samsung's Galaxy s flagship the camera you're going to hear a lot about this camera because we actually think that this new feature that we're about to talk about is something all manufacturers will be trying to do in the future and that is adding a hardware mechanical iris photo purists will probably like the fact that software is not dictating everything anymore as there's a bit of hardware actually I work here if you look closely the iris or the aperture is actually opening and closing there is an iris in there that goes at F 1.5 aperture which is incredible for low-light performance but then it can also close down to F 2.4 if you want to have a wider focus like for landscape scenes for example consider for a second that F 1.5 is still better than the F 1.7 that we had in previous models including the Galaxy Note 8 and speaking of that you have these enhancements in the main camera on top of the telephoto lens at F 2.4 that comes from the note 8 and is available on the s 9 plus now Samsung's processing is also getting a bump up here with multi frame image processing the S 9 comes with D Ram on the actual camera module so that it's able to store a number of different images that are processed for detail colors contrast and noise in a split instant the camera takes 12 images that are sorted into batches of four and the software then uses all the detail and information to produce the noise overall this happens a few different times gets three different best photos and then does it one more time so that those three photos become one final incredible photo that DRM is also used for super slow motion video which is a fun addition that we already have some fun using during our meeting at 720p resolution you now have 960 frames per second capture but what Samsung tried to do is make it easier by adding in an auto mode where the camera will figure out when the motion is happening so it knows when to capture that super high-speed recording and if you have any an emoji Envy then Samsung has brought their own version of something like that called the AR emoji the camera captures a face and then creates a sort of caricature of that person a little bit like a bitmoji if you're a snapchat avid user and that AR emoji can be customized with a number of different hairstyles from a plethora of different colors different eyewear different pieces of clothing and can be cater to the users desire when you hit say if it saves all of the options and you can use the front-facing camera in order to do an AR like Avatar where when you move your head and you move parts of your face the AR emoji does it all - it also saves something like 18 gifts to the phone's gallery so that you can easily share a number of different emojis literally to your friends the camera also helps enhance bigsby a bit as bixby has been updated to provide some better augmented reality experiences like for example live translation has been given some enhancements but one thing that we did see here is the ability to recognize food now it might not be super accurate all the time at one point it thought that the bagel spread was ice cream but we can see where that might be a little bit confusing so it seems that Samsung really put their work into addressing the main parts of a phone that people want the media consumption experience is already great with the infinity display but now the sound experience is even better we're looking forward to putting some high-powered headphones into that headphone jack and seeing how it sounds when you just want some private listening time after that you have the camera which is bolstered to have even more fun modes and that AR emoji is great for anyone that wants to fully express themselves in very unique ways and with all of the power and performance that these phones already had you're just getting more of that in the S 9 including with Bigsby and Google assistant both in there so you can have your own AI available at the ready three colors of this powerful phone will be made available in the US midnight black lilac purple and coral blue there's a titanium gray but it's not coming to the US it's not really a certain how much they will cost just yet but we want to be surprised if they get a little bit close to that $1,000 mark and the pre-orders will start on March 2nd ahead of it going on sale on March 16th if you happen to have a more recent Samsung device or even just a recent phone in general you could get the deepest discount on there by trading in that phone and getting up to three hundred and fifty dollars off the latest device and you might want to check it out because Sam might once again be pioneering another movement in the smartphone camera game especially with its hardware and mechanical additions that really excite us but then we're gonna go ahead and pose the question off to you what do you think of the galaxy s 9 and the s 9 plus let us know in the comments down below and our top comments might get mentioned in a future piece while we are here in Barcelona for Mobile World Congress let us know what you think of this phone of all of the announcements at MWC and sound off in the comments below so that we can see what you guys think of these great phones that are coming

hey what's up guys this is lawn from Andrew Authority and I'm here at MWC 2018 takes a look at a couple new phones that were announced here by a soos this is the zenfone 5 and zenfone 5 light but before we get to the light model let's just start with the regular zenfone 5 so I know what you're thinking this looks like an iPhone 10 and you wouldn't be wrong because it totally does it has a notch at the top just like the iPhone 10 the cameras on the back are in vertical orientation and shape just like the iPhone 10 and the phone even feels like an iPhone 10 with the same metal and glass design now to a Seuss's credit it isn't a 100% blatant ripoff of the iPhone 10 because it does have a headphone jack and there's a dedicated fingerprint sensor on the back the notch at the top of the display is a little smaller than the iPhone because it's not really housing anything other than the usual sensors and earpiece and a front-facing camera you won't find any fancy face ID technology but they did add face unlock as an alternative method for unlocking your phone otherwise it's more of an aesthetic decision than anything else and as far as I could tell apps don't actually wrap around or go underneath the notch and instead the notification bar just color matches itself just sort of make it appear like it does despite the iPhone 10 resemblances I still came away kind of impressed it felt really nice and comfortable to hold and the screen is pretty large at 6.2 inches with an aspect ratio of 19 by 9 and a 90% screen to body ratio the panel itself is IPS but the colors and contrast were surprisingly good it's not going to be quite as sharp as other panels on the market with a screen resolution of 1080p but it still looked perfectly fine to my eyes a soos made a pretty big deal about the AI on this phone and I say AI with air quotes because there's technically no real AI or machine learning involved a soos calls the display in AI display because it can stay on when you're looking at it and turn off when you're not and the color temperature of the screen will also automatically adjust based on the lighting conditions to make it easier to read if any of it sounds familiar it's because we've seen other factures do this already another feature that ESU's calls AI is the scene detection in the camera it can detect up to 16 different scenes and subjects to give you the best possible photo it does seem to work pretty well with detecting the subject but again this feature isn't exactly new these are just a couple of examples of what a soos calls AI but there were plenty of other features such as how you can boost the phone's performance for a faster and smoother experience or the way the phone can intelligently charge your phone based off your charging habits in terms of specs see zenfone 5 has a snap during 636 inside and comes with either 4 or 6 gigabytes of RAM depending on the storage there's also a pretty large 3300 milliamp hour battery which would hopefully be enough to get you through the day the zenfone 5 will ship with Android Oreo and Zen UI 5.0 which is still a very heavy skin but as sue said this is the cleanest version of their UI yet it has significantly less bloatware and they've gotten rid of all their first party apps that duplicated what Google was already doing a Seuss's other smartphone the zenfone 5 Lite will offer a pretty similar experience with identical software and a metal and glass design but there are some notable differences it doesn't have thin bezels like the zenfone 5 and it comes with dual cameras on both the front and rear there's a 20 megapixel shooter on the front that's paired with an 8 megapixel wide-angle lens and the rear is a 16 megapixel camera that's paired with the same eight megapixel wide-angle sensor no word on pricing and availability just yet but a sous says they will be priced very competitively for more on zenfone 5 and zenfone 5 Lite make sure to head on over to Android thorny calm and keep it tuned here for the rest of our MWC 2018 coverage 
your eyes do not deceive you that is the Razer logo on the back of what basically looks like the next bit Robin or at least the next evolution of it well you could say is that the next bit Robin from the ashes of what used to be that phone comes what you could call basically the Razer Phoenix this is the razor phone razor really wants to position this phone as a phone for gamers and that's an important distinction to make because this is not necessarily a gaming phone this is a phone that is made for the type of person that wants the best possible specifications in a device that can pretty much do anything and so far this phone seems like an absolute beast and that's no exaggeration what seems like a behemoth of a phone houses a quad HD 5.7 2 inch LCD panel made by sharp on a body that looks a lot like a beefed-up version of the original midnight edition of the Robin flatten angular all around the phone is easy enough to grip if not for its larger size and much like the next bit Robin there is a fingerprint reader embedded into the flat power button the screen has a lot more going for it than its size and resolution taking some inspiration from razors line of laptops the screen actually has a 120 Hertz refresh rate so that means that everything simply glides across this screen in a way that they call ultra motion this is something that you'll be able to experience not only in games of course but also in scrolling through websites like our own and of course going through certain applications like Reddit on top of that the sync rate is always synced to the GPU making it adaptable for whatever situation the phone is rendering the result is a variability that allows for the battery to be used only when it absolutely has to be so you're not going to get lower battery life just because it's always firing on all cylinders now as far as games go not all games will run at this super high refresh rates but razer has already gotten a number of partners onboard with more to come in the future a couple of names that were dropped included $0.10 which you might know from League of Legends and also Final Fantasy 15 mobile Edition by Square Enix and it's good that games look great on here because the performance is as top-notch as possible and we mean that the Snapdragon 835 powers the razor phone but as a bit of a surprise there's a massive amount of RAM on here at 8 gigabytes and razer has made sure that all eight gigabytes is used by the phone of course we can't really talk about the long-term performance of this phone as we bowling on a little bit of time with the phone thus far but we're pretty confident that eight gigabytes will go a long way especially in terms of multitasking and productivity and on top of that you can actually cater the speed of the processor in the game booster cap the frame rate at 60 or 90 frames per second if you wish change the display resolution that the game pumps out or even change the clock speed so you can get a little bit more game time out of the four thousand milliamp hour battery now you can't necessarily overclock the processor but razer did tell us that the max performance setting in the game booster already puts it at its max level above what it is already set at at default but for the sake of battery life it's nice that you can change the settings up so you can get a little bit more game time so let's get to the rest of the hardware 64 gigabytes of on-board storage is available by an SD card slot is also there in case you use of all 64 gigabytes available for all the games that you might install or maybe you aren't all about games if you want a media powerhouse that screen will certainly enhance the experience but audio has not been left out of the equation either in a partnership with Dolby Dolby Atmos for mobile helps power the dual front-facing speakers that sound incredible once again Razer derives from their laptop line in order to create speakers that are super high quality on a mobile device and these speaker grilles are a lot like the ones you would find on a laptop we cranked it up to max and not only did the lows and mids actually sound quite full but the highs were not piercing to the ear and it got really loud [Applause] but of course if you don't want to bother anyone else with the speakers headphones are always an option unfortunately there is no headphone jack on this device now let that bummer sink in for a second and then realize that the adapter that Razer adds into the box has a 24-bit deck installed this is a move I've been spouting phone manufacturers should do for a long long time it's great to see it finally happened and Razer is one of the first to do it unfortunately we didn't have any high impedance headphones to really test this out but we look forward to doing so once we get our hands on our review units we're pretty confident that the audio experience on here is going to be top-notch the next bit Robin was notorious for having a slow camera experience and that doesn't seem to be the case here but the camera software lacks a lot of options there are dual cameras on the back with a telephoto lens and both are 12 megapixel cameras unfortunately when you go into the application there aren't really a whole lot of options for you to mess around with not even a button for you to be able to change between the 2 lenses easily we still remain hopeful that this camera combo and the 8 megapixel front facing shooter will prove to be good cameras despite their lacking software but we wouldn't be surprised if this was the one part of the device that we weren't super excited about which brings us to the software and Razer again put some forward thinking into what they're trying to provide in this device by partnering up with a very popular third-party launcher that's right Nova Launcher premium is going to be pre-installed on here so you have all of the customization options that Nova has already given people who love it there are the typical green and black color motifs throughout the operating system but anyone that has used nova before will know what to expect Android tinkerers are given carte blanche to make it look the way that they desire so to RAZR this phone personifies the philosophy that they've always had with their gaming community uncompromising specifications high quality offerings and the ability to use their highly stylized products to achieve a myriad of tasks with that in mind they wanted to make a phone that was made for gamers even if it's not necessarily a gaming phone but of course it could blow away pretty much any game you throw at it if you're looking for the highest performance device ever then this might be the phone you've been waiting for with a large screen great specifications and performance that can help you get gaming productivity and media done today's announcement of the razor phone will also have another surprise the price this phone could have easily hit the $1,000 price point we thought but instead the phone is priced at six hundred and ninety nine dollars it is available for pre-order on November third on razors website and through select ecommerce channels with the phones making it to users hands around the 17th keep it tuned to Android authority for even more about the razor phone and we can't wait to get our hands on the review unit if you are a gaming person this might be the phone you've been waiting for but for everybody else this phone was going to provide as much as it can so you can enjoy it as well keep you tuned to andrew authority and we'll see what that result is and remember to subscribe to the channel if you haven't already because we are your source for all things Android 
Samson started it with the note 8lg quickly joined with the v30 of course Apple took it to a whole new level with the iPhone 10 and now there's rumors that even Google will join with their pix alignment as well I'm talking about this new trend of ultra premium flagships of course but what are they and why are they so damn expensive I'm Martin from toccata doing a guest episode for Android authority and let's find out so what is an ultra premium flagship I mean just half a year ago we already thought that flagships were you know premium like top-of-the-line it doesn't get any better premium but apparently we were wrong Apple Samsung and LG have all chosen a dual flagship strategy one flagship for the normal mortals and another ultra premium one for the more enthusiastic or simply more wealthy ones and people have been talking about gradually rising prices in their flagship smartphone market since forever but ultra premium flagships represent a whole new trend I think not only was the jump in prices much larger than in previous years I mean these phones went up from 6 to 800 dollars all the way up to a thousand now but device makers also seem to keep their regular reflections around to signaling that the regular and the ultra premium flagships were aimed at different types of consumers and should have different value propositions so what is going on here in one word luxury and before you go down and start throwing your Rotten Tomatoes at me I mean at your screen because it's too obvious let me unpack this term first this handbag from Louie Vuitton costs nine hundred and ninety five euros here in Germany in other words it is priced exactly like an ultra premium flagship did that shock you probably not given that it is one of the most popular fashion accessories ever made but now we have all accepted that luxury bags just cost a ton of money but if a bag costing a thousand euros didn't shock you at all then maybe neither should an iPhone or a galaxy see this back perfectly captures what luxury is about it's a piece of leather with a few zippers on it that holds your wallet your phone and a few other items it doesn't have any functional benefit over a $20 back ok maybe the quality of the leather a little better that design is a little nicer where it wouldn't go out of fashion like a regular bag would but to anyone comparing these two bags on a functional level the louisvil tone seems like a terrible deal and yet millions of people buy it features functionality and performance are what most tech enthusiasts including me think make a device valuable these objective metrics make comparing devices quite straightforward but they are not the only way to assess the value of a phone one plus adds value to their phones by having a thriving online community fair phone adds value by having really good environmental policies and by creating a more sustainable phone nokia adds value by playing with lost algin and by giving europeans like me a small glimpse of hope of a European company maybe regaining at least some little role in the consumer electronics of space people are willing to pay for these extras just like they're willing to pay for features and technology that these things also provide value is the key to understanding ultra premium flagship prices the less consumers worry about the basics the more companies can focus on these extras and when people can stop caring about the fundamentals completely the focus shifts nearly entirely on the extras this is perfectly illustrated by our Louis Vuitton bag functionality here is basically not a concern at all banks are functionally close to identical because of this consumers can switch their picki feature focused brains off which in turn leaves space for their aspirational social or emotional brain to make decisions people who choose this 1,000 euro bag don't do it because they excessively compare features between it and other bags or watch in-depth reviews instead they buy it for whatever is layered on top of the functionality maybe they value that Louis Vuitton has a long history of excellent that they have my stores or my staff or maybe they just like letting others know that they can afford a 1000 euro handbag so how does this apply to phones well just a few years ago switching that picky and feature focused the brain of yours off could have led to you ending up with a genuinely bad phone but as the smartphone market has matured that is becoming increasing unlikely phones now look really similar and they also have very similar functionality in real-world performance years of fierce competition have made sure that they are basically no more bad phones on the market sure we enthusiasts might net big but the average consumer that just wants to scroll through social media feeds and chat with friends all modern phones above a certain price range will work admirably well if you think about it phones in this regard are becoming more and more like bags and as people have to worry less and less about whether a phone will be able to perform its basic tasks well enough they will start carrying more and more about whatever is layered on top of that core feature set so companies with a little extra could benefit from this just think about their phone their concept is to use sustainably sourced materials and sustainable processes to build a phone that isn't terrible for the environment a phone that is repairable and so on this of course makes their phones much more expensive than comparable expect mainstream devices to end up with a phone that isn't prohibitively expensive fair phone has to use mid to low end specs four years ago when they launched the fair phone one mid to low end specs meant terrible performance two years ago when they launched a fair phone - it meant acceptable performance if they were to launch the fair phone three with the same strategy today or sometime in the future performance would probably be just fine mid-range specs today are great and low-end specs are fine too because of this many people who were interested in the mission of fair phone but were put off by having a really subpar experience before could become potential customers as the worries about the specs disappeared the added value of environmental friendliness becomes more and more attractive now I don't know how many people actually care about the environment enough to choose a phone purely based on this concern but this trend is pretty unmistakable which finally brings us to our ultra premium flashers while features might still be somewhat of a concern for low to mid-range phones they are certainly not an issue on the premium side of things anymore it is close to impossible to find a flagship phone that doesn't have a great camera a great screen and enough processing power to handle anything the average consumer wants to do with ease unless you have a very specific need for say an aspen or some other niche feature the decision you make when buying a flagship mostly comes down to personal preference and the extra stuff these companies are carefully adding on top of their devices they all have their own special blend of stuff of course like emphasizing the fact that they are an anniversary edition for example but one aspect that they all seems to push quite hard is simply branding and through it luxury especially Apple and Samsung have built incredibly strong and premium brands over time and they are leveraging them hard they want you to think that owning a one thousand dollar iPhone 10 where a note eight is a fashion statement the same way that owning a one thousand dollar Louis Vuitton bag would be sure phones don't last as long as fancy bags but they are with us 24 hours a day so they are great at making a statement they are increasingly not just tools but objects of desire and prestige now I'm not saying that ultra premium flex shirts aren't technically better than some cheaper phones or that they aren't more expensive to make but most of the increased price can be explained by the fact that they have become objects of desire and prestige so what does this mean for the future of phones I think we'll go from the industry simply focusing on building the most functional phone possible to having a much larger variety of value propositions price conscious consumers will of course have an endless sea of well priced options to choose from there always be companies catering to that audience and they'll have an easier time than ever because making a cheap smartphone that doesn't suck is easier than ever at the same time I expect an explosion of phones that focus on the extras phones that are good for the environment firms that care about your privacy forms that make you feel luxurious you name it the smartphone industry will become a little more like that of backs or clothes in general where you can buy a t-shirt for five dollars or another functionally similar one for 500 so I'd like to know what you think about this topic and also whether you'd like to see similar types of content on Android authority from me again let us know

a lost phone and their goal is to find Laura the phone's owner this is accomplished by digging through the phone to find out information and there's a note-taking app a gallery a messaging app and a whole bunch of other stuff to go through it's a sleuthing game and that means there aren't any difficult mechanics to learn however it is a lot of fun figuring out what's going on the game runs for three dollars and forty nine cents with no in-app purchases Batman the enemy within is the latest game from Telltale Games it follows a new story of Batman in a fight against the Riddler the game follows many of Telltale's hallmark mechanics and those include point-and-click mechanics and episodic adventure narrative and fun comic book style graphics the game comes with five episodes the first episode is free while subsequent episodes run for $4.99 or you could just buy them all at once for $14.99 into the Dead 2 is the sequel to the popular into the Dead game this game has a lot of the same flavor as the first game you run you kill zombies and you try to survive this new game adds a storyline more varied gameplay mechanics and a dog companion to the mix it also comes with various challenges decent graphics and a lot more it's a freemium game however it's otherwise a very solid title Middle Earth shadow of war is the latest Lord of the Rings game it follows the story of talian and his fight with saurons army the game is freemium and you should expect some freemium elements with this title additionally the game includes action RPG combat mechanics various loot to collect and various Lord of the Rings characters to collect as well other than that the graphics and sound are decent and the mechanics are fairly simple to learn it's already fairly popular and it's worth a shot Knight Run is a new infinite runner game it features minimal graphics and a simple premise your health trains as you run and your goal is to collect hearts in order to remain alive while also avoiding other the obstacles are a little difficult to get used to at first however it does come to you over time unlike most this one isn't a freemium title there is only a single $0.99 charge in order to remove the ads otherwise is a clean fairly decent little time waster Pokemon Playhouse is a new Pokemon themed kids game it is nothing like the prior Pokemon games and the age recommendation for this one is ages three to five thus you won't find anything challenging or difficult whatsoever there isn't even any dialogue to read that makes it great for kids and probably a little boring for adults the mechanics are dead easy to learn plus the Pokemon are absolutely adorable in this one it's totally free to download with no in-app purchases or advertisements stranger things the game is exactly what the title says it's a game that takes place in the stranger things universe you play as various characters from the show and each character has their own special abilities you use those abilities to solve puzzles in order to progress through the storyline it has retro graphics delightfully smooth controls and simple gameplay mechanics it's also entirely free with no in-app purchases or advertisements and might be the best game in that category taps is an interesting little puzzle game players have to game boards to start with and the idea is to tap tiles on one board until it matches the other board each tap adds one to the tile count as well as the adjacent tiles the game's difficulty scales the further you go up and it also features four hundred levels variable difficulty settings leaderboards and a whole lot more the free version of the game does contain ads but the pro version removes the advertising symbol we'd park is a comedy adventure game with a new our theme you play as five random people who show up in a weird town one day for some reason your goal is to figure out that reason the game comes with retro graphics plenty of jokes and five playable characters you also get two difficulty levels a hint system and more jokes the narrative drives the game forward and it is a bit expensive at $9.99 however there are no ads or in-app purchases Wreckers revenge is a puzzle platformer from Cartoon Network you play as gumball and the idea is to launch him from platform to platform without getting yourself killed the goal is to save all of your friends complete the various levels and obtain cash for in-game pow or UPS the mechanics are a tad wonky but otherwise it plays fine is definitely not the deepest game ever but on the flip side of that coin it's also difficult to knock a free game that doesn't have any in-app purchases and that about does it for this one folks as usual you can check out any of these games for yourself in the

have you ever heard of the uncanny valley well it's a term used in video games to describe characters and avatars that don't quite make it all the way to being truly realistic there's just a few things about them that you can't unsee and thus it kind of breaks the illusion well for a phone that's supposed to be made for gamers I thought that this was a poignant term to use to describe it it's Josh of Agora what's going on everybody and this is our full review of the razor phone comparisons to the next bit Robin are going to be pretty obvious here after all the company was acquired by Razer and what you have now is a phone made for gamers now that's different from being a gaming phone but that also means that razor's influences are clearly seen here nonetheless you have a phone that is actually a bit unique in design compared to other competitors and it's also a bit reminiscent of the original next bit Robin you have the angular corners and also flat sides all around making for a blocky device which is a design aspect we don't really see a whole lot these days but one thing I want to tip my hat off to is the symmetry of this phone the speaker grilles on top and below the 5.7 inch screen take up the exact amount of space in those particular areas the power button on the right has a fingerprint reader embedded into it much like the original next bit Robin and it was actually pretty easy to use even when using my middle finger on my left hand in order to quickly unlock the device after pressing the button the USB type-c port on the bottom is centered as it should be but there is no headphone jack here instead you get an adapter that you plug into here or a headphone jack but it does come with a 24 bit DAC installed and we'll talk about the audio experience in a little bit and finally on the back there is the camera optic package dual lens is over in the corner on top of the razer logo that is prominently displayed on this black slate design it's actually a very handsome device but the main problem we have with it is just the handling with a 16 by 9 aspect ratio screen it's a little bit wider than it probably should be and mix left to right or right to left handling in one hand a bit difficult this is certainly going to be a two-hander especially when you're trying to type but that screen is one of the main draws of this phone and it is a quad HD IPS display that includes ultra motion technology now that means that this display can get up to a 120 Hertz refresh rate but it is also synced up with the GPU in order to give the best possible experience no matter what kind content you are using I've played a lot of games on this device and there are quite a few triple-a titles I take advantage of everything the razor phone provides there are some games that don't quite take advantage of the full spec list but they still look great because of that ultra motion technology so if you're playing a game that runs at 30 60 or 90 frames per second it's going to look great on this display still because the refresh rate adjusts accordingly but the great motion in this display which is derived from razor's own laptop displays is really apparent even in simple tasks like scrolling through Google now or through websites like Andrew Authority comm or going through apps like Reddit it's really easy to see how high quality this display is and razor might just have unlocked a new trend and smartphones moving forward the only problem that I really had with the display was its brightness this is an IPS display but it's somehow doesn't get as bright as other IPS screens in the market this is mostly noticeable in broad daylight situations where we pump to the brightness to full but still kind of had to squint or move the phone around in order to see certain elements but it is a small price to pay for a phone that is overall of beast and the specification list shows that the Snapdragon 835 is backed up by eight gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of on-board storage that does include a micro SD card slot you have the very best specifications here that is only really matched by the one plus 5t currently thus work in place speed along swimmingly so that gamers aren't the only ones who are going to enjoy using this phone on the daily you also have a lot of power for multitasking as we use multi-window for YouTube and other applications but of course when Android Oriol finally makes it to the razor phone you'll also be able to enjoy picture-in-picture we've already mentioned that gaming is great on here no matter what game you're playing but the Triple A titles that are supposed to come out that take advantage of the razor phone specifications are still a little bit limited for example Final Fantasy 15 is still not out on this phone and it was one of those games that they really hyped for when it came to using this phone to its fullest potential but that's not to say that the razor phone isn't finding itself in the best possible position when it comes to mobile gaming because it truly is publishers like Sega and Nintendo are getting into the mobile space putting not only games from their previous library but also putting in new games like Nintendo's newest offering in Animal Crossing it's a great time to be a gamer and it's great to see Razer getting into the mobile space at this time of course those games are not just a visual aspect there's also an audio aspect involved and razor put a lot of thought into it in a partnership with Dolby and their Atmos app you have dual front-facing speakers that provide a great amount of sound seriously this is some of the best sound that we've had from a smart phone ever it's enough to actually replace cheap Bluetooth speakers so you don't have to have it in your arsenal all the time it certainly past the shower test but it still has to be outside of the shower doors because there is no IP certification but there is a little bit of a compromise in the audio experience when you talk about the headphone jack now this is a contentious point for pretty much anybody but what I do adore about razors approach to it is that they finally did something I've been saying everyone should do the USB type-c port on the bottom also powers a 24-bit DAC that is built into the adapter which provides a great sound especially if you're using high quality headphones this is another instance where Razer might be setting an example that we might see more of from other manufacturers moving forward call quality for the most part was good on the razor phone at least in my experience and I was using it on the t-mobile network but I do have to mention something about the microphone when it's right next to my mouth for more conventional calling everything sounded fine but when the phone is farther away from me for video calls and also for speaker phone calls the people on the other line said that I was noticeably quieter that tells me that the microphone needs a little bit more sensitivity but you know mileage might vary on this we've heard differing reports from multiple sources about what the call quality is like on the razor phone so things might be a little bit different with different units so maybe your experience is gonna be different and finally we have a large 4000 milliamp hour battery which razer claims was possible because of the exclusion of the headphone jack i was never really able to get more than 5 hours of screen on time at least on average which is not great but I was doing a lot of gaming on this device if you turn down the settings in the game booster you might get a little bit more out of it or if you're just using it as a Productivity device then you might get more screen on time but of course your experience might be different speaking of which that game booster app is one of the only additions that Razer put into the software suite here the game booster allows for tweaking of everything from the display refresh rate to the clock speed of the sesor and you can also change it for full performance or for full power saving modes and you can go into each game in the application in order to change the different settings this allows for a little bit more control and it also shows that razer was really trying to put its best foot forward in providing performance and customization and personalization into the razer phone experience and that continues with the software suite that has been out sourced to a great third party in the Nova Launcher now the best part about the Nova Launcher here is that you get all of the great benefits of it including a pro license that gives you access to all of the different features that Nova provides if you pay a little bit of extra money which you don't have to because it's included with this phone you have all of the customization options like animations on the home screen icon packs even gestures that you can do on the home screen itself and you have a lot of different options to really tweak this operating system to make it look like your own so overall we've had some really good things to say about the Razer phone and it looks like the company has done a great job in the wake of next bits acquisition in order to bring a great first attempt into the smartphone space but then we have to talk about that uncanny valley and we're gonna talk about the camera now you have dual 12 megapixel cameras on here that have F 1.8 aperture in the regular lens and F 2.6 aperture in the telephoto lens and unfortunately we already had some qualms with the camera in our hands on when we noticed that there weren't that many modes and there wasn't even an indicator to show you which lens you were using and how far you were zoomed in for how much time the razor phone has had up until market release it's a little bit of a bummer to see that razor hasn't really added a whole lot to the experience and even then the camera app is one of the slowest that we've used especially if you use HDR and it does not have an auto setting you're going to have to hold the phone very steady especially in lower than ideal lighting situations and if you move even just a little bit you're going to get some blur in the photo now in broad daylight situations you could get a pretty good photo but those are the only times that you can really do so and that's kind of the mark of a subpar camera the fact that it can only work in the brightest of conditions unfortunately for the razor phone it's just not a phone that we can mention in a list of good cameras in the Android space especially considering in the last year or so we've been having a continual rise in photographic quality and so there you have it the razor phone this is a powerhouse powerhouse is a great term to describe this device because it does so many things right but it just falters in one very key aspect after all the razor phone looks and feels like a flagship device it even looks like a beloved phone from days past an expert Robin there are certain things that you can easily look past even the lack of a headphone jack considering that great adapter they have in there and the size of the device is something that you could for the most part get used to but the biggest issue with the phone might be described best by the uncanny valley it's just the one thing that you can't unsee and unfortunately it's one of the most important parts of a smart phone and it's the camera experience so that makes the camera this phone's uncanny valley as always thank you guys very much for watching I hope you enjoyed this review of the razor phone razor claims that they're going to put a lot of updates out for the camera and hopefully they're going to change the experience at least a little bit but as smartphone history has shown us updates don't really change too much about the camera experience even further down the line but from there without the camera you have one of the best phones that we've used this year and that display technology is something we hope to see in a lot more smart phones moving forward keep it tuned to Android authority for even more about the razor phone and maybe a couple of comparisons after all one of its main competitors in the spec sheet is the 1 + 5 T so you can look forward to that and even more from Android Authority com head on over to the

I believe that the best tool for Android game development is unity it makes the whole process so much quicker and simpler so much so that in this video I'm going to show how you can get something up and running in just yep that's me so you're probably wondering how I got here what it all started a few years ago hey there guys thanks for tuning in so I've been making videos with under Authority for about a year now but I still get comments on video sometimes asking Who I am where I came from who is this guy what does he know who does he think he is so I thought I'd take the time to introduce myself and say hi so my name is Adam schnitz ki it's very nice to meet you that's a Polish name in case you're wondering I'm half Polish quarter German but born in England I currently live near Oxford in a town called mr. with my lovely wife Hannah we've lived here about a year and prior to that we were living in London before that I lived in Bournemouth which is where I was born and raised and I still visit back there very often I also do a lot of commuting into London it's a nice easy trip from where I am now so most the time you'll find me in coffee shops in Oxford or London or Vista or you'll find me in my office upstairs working for agile Authority or working on one of my many other projects when I'm not working things I like include going to the gym Electric Light Orchestra writing programming computer games comic books tuna sandwiches synth wave music traveling when I get the opportunity to seeing friends nobody your hobby is it lamp love my Nintendo switch at the moment technology in general gadgets reading Dragonball 80s action movies wrong psychology and neuroscience nootropics calisthenics Alice Cooper m83 Schiller martial arts Wells do I like there's probably loads of other stuff I like but my main hobbies are definitely Fitness and Technology and I'm quite lucky in that I've managed to make those things into my career so my interest in technology goes a long way back probably I was about six my first buta was a ZX Spectrum I also had a Tatem Einstein and I kind of missed those days when technology was less user-friendly when it was all green screens and you were just greeted with a prompt to enter basic code instead of you know a nice touch friendly interface I found it a lot more exciting that way it was like this hidden world that other people didn't necessarily understand I love to Sonic the Hedgehog my friends all had sega mega drives but I wasn't allowed to play computer games so instead I decided to start making my own and with the help from a kid at school I started to learn a little bit of basic that I could use on my ZX spectrum to that end eventually I was allowed a proper laptop and I got a AST 486 and I learned to programming qbasic on that they also developed into a love of gadgets and technology in general my first phone was either the Nokia 3310 or 3210 but after that I got some more exciting and interesting stuff I got the Nokia ngage running Symbian which was quite a cool thing back then I was really into the ipact devices from the likes of HP and I had one with a stylus and an attachable keyboard and I installed games like Tomb Raider on it in many ways that was a smartphone before smartphones my first actual smartphone was when I was on placement year at university and I got a iPhone actually but then after that I got much more interested in Android because it had that whole hacker appeal of being out the tinkerer and changed things just like those old green screens back in the day and the first Android device I got was a Dell Streak and this was a huge phablet I've always liked unusual looking technology I hate the fact that every phone looks the same today the Dell Streak was a phablet before even the first note meanwhile whilst I was going through school and sick form I got really into fitness I really wanted to be an action hero or a superhero really I never grew out of that likeness of postie so I started bodybuilding in inverted commas in my bedroom curling little dumbbells doing lots of press ups and I eventually one teen bodybuilder of the week on bodybuilding.com which was actually quite a big deal at the time and I got loads of fan mail and emails and that led to me having my first a website built for me for free and that was my first foray into web design then as I went into university I decided I wanted to continue with that kind of self-improvement angle so I took psychology and also just because I really enjoyed that at sixth form whilst I was there I carried on working on websites I had a friend who was very into internet marketing and he taught me how he could monetize a website how you could place ads on it a little bit about SEO so I started to build that site make a little bit money on the side and just understand how that whole industry works University was great that's where I met many of my best friends to this day it's where I met my wife she wasn't my wife then and we also had this thing where you take a year out into a placement year experience the real world get a job before coming back to finish your degree so I did a year working in Leeds at writers news so I got some experience as a journalist I was also really into writing at the time and I loved that and then I came back and graduated during my final year like most students I was struggling a little bit with money and I decided I could try and earn a little bit of extra cash on the side so I already knew that I could make money from a website although it wasn't really earning that much and I knew how to write now and I thought well if I can make money from a website than other people obviously camp - I'll write for them and charge per words so I did that I put an advert out online on a website called digital point forum and then I got some work and I started just writing sending off articles that I've written and getting paid per word for those and the more I write the more I earned and then when I left University I realized I don't actually have to get a proper job I can do this on a full-time basis so I started just writing I moved out of my mom's house and moved in with my mate booth and I got to extend my kind of a university experience because I could write at any time of day again writing in coffee shops I was living in Bournemouth by the beach sitting in cafes watching the world go by typing up and then going out with friends visiting my wife who wasn't my wife at the time who lived near Oxford and I could just live the lifestyle I wanted I got to travel a little bit more working online was great my main topics were fitness and technology and that's what I got paid to write the most but unfortunately I also had to write an awful lot of dross on topics had no idea about like bricklaying and car windows and things just for companies that needed Internet content in order to get their site to the top of Google so I wasn't really enjoying that side of it and it was ghost writing so it wasn't very rewarding sobs I wanted to work on my own project on the side so one of those projects was to developed my coding skills I used a tool called basic for Android or B for a to build an app for Android called multi screen multitasking and the idea of this app was to create a way around the fact that at the time you couldn't do split-screen between two apps still remember being at a party and I was checking sales of the app on my phone and I suddenly saw them spike and I realized they were climbing and climbing and I got so excited it wasn't great fun at this particles I just kept checking them and thinking wow this idea I've had has taken off and the world is excited by it that party then turned a little bit dark and weird but that's a different story and escaping the inspiration as well to work on other apps and ideas so I learned Android studio and Java how to create apps the proper way not using basic and launched a few more different projects some of which were fairly successful some of which weren't so successful and then my big next idea was to work with the YouTuber cold fusion who'd inspired me when I first got into Android so I approached him and said would you like me to work on your boxers app and he said let's go for it so he did the design and had the idea and I just handled the code and he was he's a fantastic designer so the app looked great it was the nicest guy and he has a big audience already so the app was again a little bit of a hit in while I was also working on my own website cuz I still want to talk about fitness and training and performance and neuroscience and I added the YouTube component to that which wasn't a big hit at all but it was just something I loved doing and then I think that combination of things attracted the attention of Android Authority the fact that I'd made an app that was quite successful the fact that I've worked with ColdFusion the fact I had a YouTube channel so they got in touch and said would you like to do some work for us so at the begin with I just started writing articles for them mainly development articles but then eventually they said would you like to make some YouTube videos as well would you like to attend some events and I was like yes please so that was awesome so I've been working here with them for the last year and it's been fantastic I got to meet a lot of the team recently in San Francisco and there's a nicest bunch of guys they've helped my video skills a lot as well as my writing and yes it's been a fantastic experience I've loved some other devices getting to play with gadgets getting to write getting to make youtube videos like this one so yeah it's been it's been quite a ride and I've been very lucky I've had a lot of cool opportunities and I've somehow managed to avoid doing any proper work for coming up for eight nine years and I still got loads of other products on the go I recently had my first book published on unity development making games for Android I'm currently making educational videos for a publishing company I still run my own website and blog and blog and in fact the YouTube channel that I was talking about has become fairly successful I'm reaching 17,000 ish subscribers there I talk about fitness bodybuilding neuroscience if you'd like to check that out you can find me over there as well just search the bio near on YouTube and you'll find it will go to wwww on and yeah and I'm still writing for clients as well on the side and I just love having my finger and lots of pies doing all these different things and getting all these great opportunities by the way you can also follow me on social media if you'd like to i'm sure the links will be in the description down below i'm the bio near on Twitter and Instagram and I'll be messaging there whenever I upload something new to my channel or anvil Authority and also just chatting about general stuff would love to see you over there and that's really what I love about technology is the fact that you can be you can have an idea and you can make that idea on your computer and then click send or done upload and then the whole world sees it and it can lead to incredible things it's just amazing what you can do with the internet you know the world is your oyster and just if find what you love I put it out there keep doing it put in lots of effort you know make sure it's really your passion develop your skills and anything's possible and that's also why I like Android so much in particular because it has that customizability has that open nature so it means anyone can tweak it anyone can release an app anyone can make their phone do exactly what they want to they can you know I do a lot of work from my phone i chat to these guys on slack and yeah it's just you know the world has opened up so much and it's all thanks to technology androids a big part of that and I'm so excited and privileged to be able to talk about it with you guys so thanks a ton from watching I'm still also very new to all this I'm still definitely learning still finding my own style my own workflow so please bear with me recently been doing these seven-minute videos I've been doing how to's for a while and open to do more reviews so let me know in the comments down below what you think how I can improve and I really appreciate all the comments you've left safer on these videos and if you have any more questions that I haven't covered in this video then likewise hit me up in the comments down below and I'd love to meet you guys so please introduce yourselves and I'll see you down there on one fun fact about me I was once on the English version of x-factor so thanks ton for watching guys I hope you found this interesting some waft I hope I didn't ramble on too long and boy to sleep if you did please hit like subscribe to the channel if you want more on Android

[Music] what makes a good phone great is it a smoke bomb across the board is a revolutionary new design is it a bigger battery a better camera maybe it's the latest version of Android and more power than you know what to do with if that's what it takes then the HTC u11 truly is a great fine it has all the specs in numbers you could ask for in the 2017 flagship from 6 gig of ram 128 gig of storage and the snapdragon 835 - microSD expansion and an ip68 rating there is no headphone jack of course but that shouldn't come as a surprise seeing as HTC was among the first to abandon it also absent is a secondary camera and this is where we have to start asking ourselves a few questions does a secondary camera really matter the pixel 2 does perfectly fine without one and so too does the u 11 Plus HTC doesn't go in for any fate portrait mode blurring of the background so it's really up to you if you think the additional hardware really makes that much of a difference on other phones but the U 11 plus is still perfectly capable of capturing lots of detail HDR boost does a great job of pulling dynamic range out of some pretty tough lighting and colors are insanely poppy and generally very accurate you won't get a wide angle or zoom lens here but you will get reliably good quality images and for many that will be perfectly fine the 11 plus features a single ultra pixel 3 lens at F 1.7 aperture with optical image stabilization and dual pixel face detection autofocus what all that means is a nice natural-looking bokeh first focusing no real need for super steady hands and excellent low-light performance you know it does creep in in very dark environments and there's the occasional blown out highlight at night but right now it's a toss-up between the mate temp rode the pixel 2 and the u 11 plus for my favorite low-light shooter well everyone else has been adding a secondary camera play lots of other companies including HTC have been steadily removing the headphone HTC clearly recognizes the choice has unpopular so the you 11 plus includes a pair of very decent you sonic active noise-cancelling earbuds along with the USB type-c 2 3.5 ml adapter when you plug those you sonic buds in you can map the inside of your ear to better suit the you Elevens audio to your particular hearing profile the 11 plus has 30% louder volume than the you 11 and it sounds every bit as awesome I'm not a huge fan of the placement of the bottom firing speaker because it's all too easy to cover up with your hand while gaming throwing that delicate balance between the woofer and earpiece tweeter out of whack that HTC has always done better audio than most and you've 11 plus is no exception another thing HTC has traditionally been very good at is smart phone design from the iconic One m7 to the new liquid design language in the you 11 series but ACC also had an unhealthy addiction to flat bezels in the past about how that the company has finally begun to kick in the U 11 plus the six inch qHD plus IPS LCD Grace's the front of the U 11 plus providing a crisp if not exactly bright workspace HTC hasn't gone in for rounded corners on the display but it has adopted the new 18 to 9 a speck ratio that is quickly becoming the new normal that's not AMOLED here either so VR fans will have to look elsewhere but the LCD panel does haven't always on display mode and you'll still get plenty of screen on time from the 11 plus that brings me to the single greatest flaw with the U 11 plus other features like a secondary camera or the headphone jack might be a deal-breaker for some but just as many people can live perfectly fine without them but the U 11 plus has the single dimmest display I have seen on a smart phone in a long time it's almost unbearably dim to the point that outdoor legibility isn't impossible even at 100% the HDR 10 update that rolled out a little while back did nothing to improve the max brightness of the Super LCD 6 display and while it looks great inside going outside turns it into a bit of a nightmare people with that display bumped uploaded the 3930 milliamp-hour battery will keep you going for quite a while I get my display at about 50% while I was inside shooting this review and I reliably got over seven hours of screen on time assisted by the default battery saver mode on the 11 plus if you keep the display cranked up all the way or disable battery saver for some obscure reason then you can expect much lower results but even with occasionally having to bump the screen brightness right off I could still get through a solid day and a half of usage despite the glass backing of view 11 plus there is no wireless charging here so be aware of that if you're a fan speaking of the glass vacuum the Gorilla Glass 5 they coach the front and back of the you 11 plus is insanely slippery put this phone down on the wrong table on either side and it will slowly migrate itself to the floor while you're not looking there's an included case in the box and I'd advise you to make use of it if not to limit that you 11 pluses suicidal tendencies then at least a protective gorgeous and very slippery foam that same buttery smoothness appears on the inside of the 11 plus 2 with Android aurilla out of the box and HTC Sense skipping along on top like a stone on a frozen lake HTC has always made fast and reliable software and senses stop like interface an unloaded feature set makes the U 11 plus about the fastest Android experience outside the pixel to edge sensors onboard so you can map very short cuts to squeezes of the smartphone frame some finest gimmicky that I actually find a pretty intuitive and handy an interesting new feature on the 11 class is the edge launcher app I will shortcut pickin that's kind of like Samsung's edge panels but in a form that you might actually use you can assign up to 55 shortcuts here from your favorite apps and contacts to quick settings toggles a couple of intuitive gestures borrowed from elsewhere have also made their way to the U 11 plus where a swipe up on the home screen will open the app drawer and a swipe down will summon the notification shade they make using a phone as tall as this much more manageable and as always with HTC software they implement it very well HTC lets you add up to five buttons to the nav bar on the home screen and there's an entire second bar to the right that can have another five shortcuts on it there's a whole bunch of other great features included on the HTC u 11 but despite all the positive things I can say about it there's one big issue that stops it from being the truly great phone that HTC sorely needs like they're saying that the best camera is the one you have on you the best smartphone can only be one that you can actually buy and that's where HTC HTC EVO 11 plus displayed it being the best smartphone the company has ever made they did themselves a great disservice plain not making it available in the US market if you live in Europe or Asia where the phone is available then I'd wholeheartedly recommend it it nails the basics incredibly well from camera and battery to performance and software it even kicks HTC's love of big bezels to the curve it will work on AT&amp;T or t-mobile if you want to import one but not making this phone full in North America was a big mistake on HTC's part at 699 pounds or 799 euros it's cheaper than the pixel 2 or galaxy si and right in line to the may 10 Pro its most obvious competitor well we can only imagine how awesome the 11 plus would have been as a pixel it's still an incredible phone in its own right the only problem is getting ahold of one hit that like and subscribe button if you've enjoyed this video make sure you ring the notification bell

hey Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and we're here to take a look at the best products at Mobile World Congress here in Barcelona Spain MWC 2018 was an incredible show and we want to show you what we thought took top honors here at Mobile World Congress you know what we should just start off with the big one the Samsung Galaxy S 9 yes I have an S 9 plus in my hand right now but there are a lot of reasons why this phone gets one of the top honors it comes with a dual camera on the s9 plus along with dual aperture in the main cameras for either of the phones now that mechanical iris is an incredible feature something that we see in DSLRs but now it's something we see unsmoked of course it comes with all of the same enhancements you would expect from a flagship along with a brand new feature a R emoji which is a new way for you to express yourself back at CES we did take a look at a concept phone from vivo that put a fingerprint sensor underneath the screen we took a look at that phone again here at MWC but it had more tricks up its sleeve including a pop up camera that is used to make the bezel as minimal as possible but still have a front-facing camera for your selfies this particular phone is a wonderful concept and we can't wait to actually see a put into future phones especially from vivo the Alcatel One X the Nokia one and the ZTE tempo go while we're not really giving an award to any one of these devices but the whole line of them in Android go Android go provides an apparatus of Android or EO that is incredibly lightweight on phones that are maybe $100 or less what this proves is that it's possible to have all the same security features and all of the same general features in a cheap smartphone without having to pay an arm in the leg and that's why we give Android go one of our awards you might not have heard the name Nokia in awhile but they're definitely back and they're trying to be a major player in the Android space with the Nokia 8 Sirocco they have their best foot forward all of the major specifications you'll want are here but also a dual camera setup with a wide-angle the glass on glass design looks great and underneath the surface you get Android one the most stock like version of Android you can possibly get we actually think that the Nokia eight kind of looks like Nokia's play on the Nexus program so that's one of the reasons why it's incredibly exciting for us for any fans out there of truly wireless earbuds like myself this one might be incredibly important for you Qualcomm has added to their qcc 5100 chipset Qualcomm true Wireless Stereo technology now typically true wireless earbuds require one of them to receive the signal from the phone and then transmit it over to the other earbud with some delays happening from time to time it's probably something you're familiar with but this time both of the earbuds will be able to receive information from the chipset so that they can share the work and then of course you have left and right stereo quality machine learning and AI features that you might be seeing in phones that get close to $1,000 in the price don't necessarily have to be a thing of the future the Helio p 60 by mediatek is trying to bring a lot of those features into phones that would end up being priced around $500 or less that's an exciting prospect and if AI is going to move forward it has to be ubiquitous this is one way to do this one might seem like it comes out of left field but the cat s60 one definitely impressed us it still has the same thermal camera from last year along with a number of other tools for those of you who need to use it in let's say construction situations like for example plotting the distance between two points using lasers on the phone now there's one thing about the cat s61 that we have to mention it's using Android Oreo 8.1 out of the box even the Samsung Galaxy S 9 can't say that a seuss is not pulling any punches or in this case any notches with the zenfone 5 Z now there is a notch at the top where all of the front-facing bits are but this has a 19 by 9 aspect ratio screen where one of the 19 is used primarily for notifications that's kind of cool of kind of clever way of making a notch for an Android phone but you get a lot of different specifications on top of that including the snapdragon 845 great amounts of storage great amounts of RAM and all of the power that you would want from a phone that is priced under $500 and that's really what makes us so excited about this phone don't worry about all of the AEI stuff that they're talking about the fact that this is a sub 500 euro phone you want to look at and so there you have it all of our top honors for Mobile World Congress 2018 here in Barcelona Spain thank you so much for watching all of our coverage remember to stick around we have a lot of content coming including ones on this right here the galaxy s 9 so you can stay tuned for that once again I was Joshua Vergara

so in some of my previous videos I've talked you through how to make games and apps in just seven minutes and hopefully you've seen that it can be quite easy to get something decent up and running but there's quite a big difference between making a simple app or a game and actually understanding a whole programming language and mastering the art of coding that's quite a bit more difficult and unfortunately it's also particularly difficult when it comes to Android development because with Android you need to learn Java which is already quite a complex programming language and object-oriented programming language with classes and methods you need to understand XML which is the code use for the layout files you need to understand the product structure how to use the Android SDK and yeah it's a bit of an uphill struggle learning how to develop can be a daunting process for anyone starting out and it's easy to get put off before you really get started so in this video I want to share some tips that can help you to make learning any programming language Android development in particular that little bit easier so whether you start first of all it makes sense to start with a good book I learned to program from a book but I would say you want to approach using a book in the correct way so find yourself a basic introduction to Java or Android development and read it but don't read the entire thing as you read the first few chapters you'll hopefully you ever take some notes and understand the basics of how things work understand things like if statements and variables but as you get further into the book things are going to get a little bit more abstract of choose and you might find yourself starting to struggle so what I'd say is often a good way to start is to read the first couple of chapters make some notes and then when you stop understanding what's being said that's when you stop and take a break from it and it's at that point I think it's a good idea to start making a simple project so that's my second tip is to start making some kind of project really early on because Java or C sharp or any other programming language that's a massive subject matter you're never going to completely master any single programming language there's always going to be new techniques new commands that you aren't familiar with instead then instead of trying to learn how to program for Android instead of learning Java learn how to build the thing you want to build so can't with a simple project and just learn what you need in order to make that project so perhaps be a calculator or perhaps it could be a quiz which I've recently talked you through on this channel and by doing this what you're doing is you're contextualizing what you're learning you've got an end goal in mind you're seeing how those statements and how those principles work in practice instead of just thinking of it in an abstract arbitrary sense this also gives you motivation and it helps you to see how everything works together and get familiar with the tools you need to use the IDE etc and it's great because at the end of it you'll have a program and an app that you can show your friends and you can try yourself and that's quite a rewarding feeling too so instead of just trying to understand the Java set out to make yourself a little game a little project and that is the key word here is little simple you need to make sure that first project isn't anything too ambitious cuz a lot of people will say to me I want to learn how to program and I'll say why they say because they want to make an app that will revolutionize the way people use their money and I'm like well no offense but that's such a huge owned undertaking it involves collaboration with many other people it's gonna be cloud-based it's just far more complicated than you should be using for your first project so build up to that grand scheme you've got in your head sure but for your first project count something really simple learn to make that and then from there you'll find you need to learn new things and that's when you start to make these projects more more complicated and then you'll learn more and more stuff and as you go you'll find that hopefully you pick up more and more knowledge until we get to the point where you can say yes I do understand Java tip number three is to reverse engineer to ask questions to approach programming in a collaborative sense and I like I say not to try and master the entire programming language don't get too disheartened if when it comes to resizing a bitmap or something else like that you need to look online and find the method that someone else has done and say can I use this in my project because that's how a lot of programming is done a lot of us don't actually remember every single statement we're going to use we just google it like anyone else you need to have that basic knowledge and a basic understanding of how programming languages work and how to structure the particular programming language that you're interested in but beyond that there's nothing wrong with borrowing code with reverse engineering and picking things apart with reading online with checking how things work with looking for better ways to do things always do your research often you'll find yourself head against the wall trying to solve a problem one actually could have solved it with just a single line of code because someone's already written a class that does that job for you so like I said don't be afraid to reach out and don't expect to know everything and to do it all yourself we all need a little help from time to time as we develop and get more advanced you're going to need to find more resources to pick up more information and it all depends on what kind of learner you are but for me I find the easiest way to grasp a new subject or to build a new app is to find the video online that will talk me through it a video tutorial and the great thing about that is that you'll see them using the same tool as you and you can literally follow along as they're doing whatever they're doing you can see how they set things up you can follow the code as they do it any errors they make them explain and explain everything as they go and say there's no way you can miss a step because it's so annoying when you try and follow something from an article or from a book you build something and then it doesn't work and Yorkshire white whereas with a video you can rewind it and see exactly what they wrote exactly what order they did it in and how they use the tool so annoying what song goes insert this and you're like where's the insert button I don't know so that's why videos are so useful for learning to code and learning to use any tool for that matter one more piece of advice is that when you're looking for information either on Google or on YouTube make sure it's up to date and relevant because Android in particular is constantly developing new techniques are always being introduced new features and if you find an article that was written a year and a half ago it might be completely obsolete at this point so when you're searching on Google a quick tip is to go to the tools and make sure that you're searching for content that was added in the last year and that way you know it's up-to-date and you won't have any issues with things being deprecated or just obsolete at this point also important is that as you're learning make sure that you do the groundwork and you learn the basics and don't get too ahead of yourself that means things like learning to use debugging tools learning correct formatting and good practices whilst this might not be the most fun or exciting part of programming it will stand you in good stead for the future and you'll find that if you get into good habits now it'll make life a lot easier once you start working on massive projects and it's easier to prevent yourself getting into a bad habit than it is to fix a bad habit trust me I know my programming used to be really interesting debugging being particularly important of course because it means that if you've done something wrong you can find out what you did wrong rather than just staring at the code for hours and hoping that the solution will magically come to you which is again how I used to go about things another tip is to break things down and to learn them in a sensible order like I say unfortunately developing for Android is quite difficult because it involves lots of different components and sometimes it's hard to know am i learning Java at this point or am i learning to use the Android SDK and instead of trying to learn the whole thing at once then it can be a better idea to learn a bit at a time and in particular it's a good idea to learn Java first if you're struggling to dive straight into Android development maybe take a time out and learn how to use Java so you can find loads of Java IDs these are the tools you use to program job or a great one is bluej that's completely free you can download it and then you can write little programs they'll just print things out to the screen or work with numbers or ask the user questions and by getting familiar with that you'll then be able to see how that works in the context of Android development so when you come to use Android studio you've got a little bit more familiarity with it and it might even make sense to learn a completely different programming language altogether as I say Java itself is actually unfortunately quite a complex language to pick up it's very strict with its syntax and its structure if you make any small mistakes won't run at all and it doesn't read particularly like English and it's an object-oriented programming language so all of this makes it quite complicated to pick up for the first time even before you add the Android stuff on top of that so instead you could choose to learn the simple language to begin with just to familiarize yourself with some of the basic concepts of coding so I learned basic first and this is a much easier programming language it reads a lot more like English with big if-then statements and go to 10 pythons another very good one for beginners and c-sharp looks a lot like Java has only a few differences but I find it personally a little bit easier to pick up of course Android studio now also supports development with Cottman which is basically a slightly easier and more beginner friendly version of Java so that's another option this is the book I learned to program from by the way it's programming in quick basic quick basic being a version of basic that used to come packaged with DOS and old Windows laptops it's been well-loved like an old teddy bear with no cover coffee stains water stains it couldn't look more ancient but it's thanks to this book that I'm here today say there you go and of course if you really stuck with Android studio in Java then you could just make the leap to a completely different IDE that's an integrated development environment so that means that you're using a different tool to build your apps and some of these let you use different programming languages say for instance unity development is useful for making games and that lets you use c-sharp and some people find that much easier B for a or basic for Androids is a tool that lets you make Android apps using basic there's xamarin there's tons of options out there there's even game makers and app builders that will allow you to make tools and apps with very limited coding knowledge and the best of these are the ones that involve a little bit of coding understanding because that way you can then translate that idea and build on it to eventually make the leap to using the official tools from Google so everyone learns differently and of course you've probably got your own ideas of what can make learning to code easier if you do then please share them in the comments down below and I'm sure other people would like to read them I hope that some of these tips have been helpful for you and if they have

today is all about giving love to one-handed operators why cuz I don't want to live my life like this I want to live my life like this and then have my other hand free to do other stuff hold a drink walk a dog use a remote drive car no I don't do that well I do that you do that too we should both stop so just shut up and admit the fact that one hand operation matters and because of that I have a lot of anticipation for the smaller of Google's two pixels smartphones it sports a 5-inch screen with Full HD resolution it's a high-end device that's powered by a Snapdragon 820 one chipset and has four gigabytes of RAM easily this is the most powerful of all the small Android phones on this list making it a great option for power users that don't want a massive display for whatever reason aside from the high-end specs and one of the best cameras that you can get in a smartphone the Google pixel also offers a stock Android experience a lot of users simply love I know I do however the design of the device hasn't been all that well received just because it's kind of generic the pixel also definitely isn't the most affordable of the small Android phones you can get your hands on as it retails for $649 for the 32 gigabyte version and $749 for the hundred and twenty-eight gigabyte option and yes I know there are new pixels coming out very very soon and it's very likely that the smaller of those two new pixels would be on this list to watch out for that but let's talk about a lesser-known option and that's the samsung galaxy a3 from 2017 it is a compact mid-range device thanks to its 4.7 HD display it was announced in January and sports a metal frame with a 3d glass back and is water and dust resistant thanks to the ip68 rating in case you're wondering this means that it can be submerged and up to one and a half meters of water for around thirty minutes you'll find the Exynos 7870 chipset under the hood along with two gigabytes of RAM the smartphone runs Android 6.0 point one marshmallow with Samsung's custom skin on top other things worth mentioning are the 13 megapixel the twenty three hundred and fifty million power battery and a fingerprint scanner located on the front below the screen in terms of design it looks very similar to a lot of other Galaxy smartphones which can either be a good or bad thing depending on who you ask it retails for around $280 US and comes in quite a few different colors while not the very best of these small Android phones on the market if you're a Samsung fan this is looking pretty good and of course we've got to talk about Sony's Xperia xz1 compact this is the most compact of the small Android phones on this list as it features the smallest screen measuring at four point six inches the Xperia X z1 compact is the successor to the earlier xperia x compact and it also happens to be one of the first phones that will launch with android 8.0 Oreo pre-installed even though it is small it is powerful it sports the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor it also has four gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of on-board storage a twenty seven hundred million power battery in addition it has ip68 dust and water resistance and a 19 megapixel rear camera with Sony's new motion eye technology which is supposed to capture photos a couple of seconds before the user actually takes the photo for better visuals the phone has an eight megapixel front facing camera which can switch between a 22 millimeter focal length and a 90 degree field of view for tight selfie pictures and a twelve point five millimeter focal length and a hundred and twenty degree field of view for group selfies like all Sony phones in the US it will not have a fingerprint sensor although other parts of the world will now as of today Amazon is selling this device unlocked for $5.99 now let's talk about a device many of you know even less about and that's the Nokia 3hm D global relaunched the Nokia brand for smartphones earlier this year with several different models at the moment the smallest of these devices is the Nokia 3 with a 5-inch 720 display inside there's a mediatek mt6752 bytes of internal storage and an 8 megapixel camera on the front and back it also comes with a twenty six hundred and thirty million power battery and it runs Android 7.0 new game but an update to Android eight o Oreo is planned to be released before the end of 2017 and the good news is that you can get the Nokia three for as little as one hundred and eighty three dollars unlocked from Amazon in its black color but the price goes up to 187 for silver white versions and 219 for the all-white Edition it's a worthy addition to the best small Android phone list next up the sony xperia x a the xperia x sports a 5-inch display with small bezels on the left and right sides that really look nice and make the device look more compact although its specs won't blow your socks off exactly the xperia x se is still a great device it's powered by the mediatek mt6752 set has two gigabytes of RAM and is equipped with a 13 megapixel primary camera as well as a dedicated camera button on the right side it runs Android marshmallow with Sony's custom skin on top and packs a 2300 million power battery that supports fast charging unfortunately it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor on board now the Xperia x8 was released in the u.s. back in July 2016 and retailed for around 280 the device which comes in graphic black white lime gold and rose gold can now be yours for as little as a hundred and sixty eight dollars on Amazon now I have a lot of first-hand experience with the next best bang for your buck option and that's the Moto G 5 the Moto G 5 is a mid-range er that was announced at the Mobile World Congress 2017 it features a 5 inch full HD display is powered by the Snapdragon 430 chipset and comes with either 2 or 3 gigabytes of RAM unlike its predecessor it features a metal body that makes it look as well as feel premium you'll find a fingerprint scanner on the front of the device that supports various gestures you can for example swipe left to go back or swipe right to open recent apps the Moto G 5 also sports a removable battery with a capacity of 2800 million powers a 13 megapixel camera but doesn't have NFC it comes in fine gold lunar grey south I blew in some regions now we've had multiple Moto G's here in our family and they've been fantastic they're great mid tier best bang for your buck options they're more than enough for the average Android user my wife currently has this phone and she likes it no complaints whatsoever and you can get it for $250 you asked right now here in Canada unfortunately it's not selling in the US at this time but if you can get it sweet deal well as someone who runs an online business I can tell you that I look for tools that make my life easier and our sponsor fresh books not only makes this show possible but they make online payments and accounting much less painful and how do they do that exactly well you can send clean and professional-looking invoices in about 30 seconds and in about two seconds you can set yourself up to receive online payments and you don't have to manually input your receipts you can take pictures of your receipts with your phone using fresh bookses mobile apps and for a 30-day unrestricted trial you can go to fresh books com4 which lasts Android and in the section where it says how you've heard about us Phil in Android authority best to check out the show links in the description below for the full article where it talks about more options in that same article what do you think about my list let me know in the comments below or on twitter verse do you have a better small one-handed option phone out there let me know I'd love to hear [Music] 
hey it's Josh Arikara what's going on everybody and in this video we're going to talk about a gimbal an update to a gimbal that a lot of you out there might be using already I'm of course talking about this the DJI Osmo mobile 2 now the original Osmo mobile is something that you might be familiar with already and it has been a viable tool for creatives that use their smartphones primarily for photo and video but the DJI Osmo mobile 2 comes with a few enhancements one of those enhancements is the weight of the gimbal it's now lighter than before and that is achieved by removing the spare battery compartment which used to be down here but there is a trade-off here as there is now eight quarter twenty thread that allows you to mount this gimbal onto any tripod there have been other changes to the design mainly in the controls once you have the phone mounted in your using the DJI Go app all of these controls can be used to trigger the shutter or to move the gimbal around however there was a trigger on the original Osmo mobile that was used to change the modes you could tap it in order to change the mode or to lock the horizon and you can double tap it to reset the position of the phone that is now a function that is on the front in a face button that has a big M on it there's a zoom slider on the left opposite of micro USB charging ports that we do wish was USB type-c but at least it powers the big battery that's inside that can go for up to 15 hours now 15 hours is a lot of time that you might end up using for something like a live stream and one nice thing about this gimbal is that it also doubles as a power bank so if you're going to try doing stuff like a live stream you would be able to power your phone using the built-in battery of the Osmo mobile - so the design has been somewhat refined but there is one huge addition to this that might make this a very affordable gimbal as we'll get into that later incredibly useful for even more than just creative smart phone photographers and videographers and that is the portrait mode right now I have the gimbal in the usual position which is where you would get a landscape orientation but also this clamp is now spring-loaded which is a little bit of a pain to use sometimes because you really have to wedge your phone in there but once you loosen this back portion you are able to rotate this into a portrait orientation which is huge but there is one problem that I have with this portrait mode the clamp only rotates in a certain fashion so that you have to remove the phone in order to change the orientation and then of course when you change the orientation you have to reset your adjustments in order for it to be balanced now I know what you're thinking stabilization has gotten better on smartphones over the last year or so so why would you need a gimbal well there is one place on the phone that doesn't have that kind of stabilization and that is right here on the front facing camera using a gimbal like this just makes things a lot smoother and you can get a little bit more reach because there is a handle so you can get the camera a little bit farther away from you for a better shot there are some things to take into consideration though remember when you're using a gimbal like this and you want to have smooth movements not necessarily fast or rapid because the motors might not be able to keep up with you and even then some of the phones even though this gimbal is able to take on bigger phones some of the phones might be a bit top-heavy or just heavy in general so if you have it in portrait mode like this here's an example of what might happen you go a little bit too far in the access to the point where the motor can't really keep up anymore obviously the main function of a gimbal like this is to just stabilize the phone so that you can use whatever app you want you can for example in the pixel to just open up the camera app hit record and then you have really stabilized video but to get the best experience out of them Bosma mobile - it's best to use the DJI Go app now unfortunately this is where I have to give you some of my frustrations because I have been using a beta version of the DJI Go app now that's an important disclaimer to give because the software could get better and if I give DJI some credit the DJI Go app is a lot better now than it was back when the original Osmo mobile came out but DJI does have a history of shoddy Android development and if you've ever used a DJI product with an Android phone then you know what I'm talking about there are times when the app will just crash or it might not even connect to the product that you're trying to use and unless you're using the latest Android phones you might have a give and take situation here sometimes it's going to work perfectly like it did with me back at CES or it would be like yesterday where the app pretty much didn't work about 80% of my day now again I was using an unreleased beta version of the DJI Go app but if you go to the app in the Play Store it already has support for the Osmo mobile - so what is beta is technically not beta anymore and the reason why is because this is going to be on sale at the Apple Store exclusively for at least a short period of time and then it will be open to everybody so when it works the app is actually the best way of getting the most out of the Osmo mobile - not only does it trigger all of the different controls that you can use but the app itself has a lot of great features you have a couple of features for photos including a an automatic panorama mode that moves the gimbal around in order to get a perfect panorama shot and of course you have manual control so you can change your ISO your white balance and you can change whatever you need to get the perfect frame for video there are a number of really creative and fun modes that you can use like time lapses or you can add in some motion by having the gimbal move in a very smooth motion and still have the aesthetic of a time-lapse and then of course you have hyperlapse which is when you would take the same time lapse photos but you yourself are moving so it makes a very stylistic video there's a level of convenience when you're using the controls down here especially with the shutter button and also being able to move the gimbal around if you want smooth movements so if you're able to get past the loading screen of the DJI Go app then you might be able to have one of the best experiences with this gimbal the way it was meant to be used but of course with this portrait mode you're probably going to end up using a gimbal like this more often in places like I do stories open up Instagram and go into the stories area hit record and you have a stabilized video that allows you to really step up your social media game what you're seeing right now we're a bunch of clips that I used while we were at CES and while we were in downtown Vegas where I was able to get some really awesome shots and really people were asking what I was using in order to get these awesome shots and in reality I was using a smartphone a pixel - but it just happened to be on the Osmo mobile - so as with most products there is of course a give and take with this and I will admit that I was incredibly frustrated with the app itself and hopefully that is going to get better over time however for now the DJI Osmo mobile 2 is available as a straight stabilizer and I think that a lot of people will want to get this because in the past it was a creative tool but now it's something that pretty much anybody can use especially if you're into social media so with the price points it's actually kind of a no-brainer for a lot of people who want to have more stabilized footage and that's because the DJI Osmo mobile 2 comes in at 129 dollars that's an incredible price and even with the kinks that still have to be ironed out you could get a great stabilizer that really gives you some more ops when it comes to your video content so as always thank you guys very much for watching and hope you enjoyed this review of the DJI Osmo mobile - I still really enjoy using this gimbal even if it's just as a stabilizer at those times when I can't get the app to open so like I said hopefully the app will get better and DJI has improved it over the last couple of years since the original Osmo mobile but for now this is a really affordable gimbal that you can use to make your social media videos that much better like what you're seeing right now keep it tuned to andrew authority for even more about the DJI Osmo mobile -

okay Google Open Sesame [Music] those of us lucky enough to have Google assistant on our phones get to take advantage of a whole host of voice commands and cool features we can search the web start navigation open apps change settings send texts all without lifting a finger but whilst Google assistant is admittedly awesome there are still some things that can't do and there are those people who don't have Google assistant at all so in this video I'm going to look at some ways you can add more voice commands to your device so we can turn it into freakin Jarvis they're actually a ton of really cool apps and settings you can tweak in order to get more voice functionality on any device and it's a lot easier to set up than you might think in fact I'm going to show you how you can get all sorts of cool stuff working in just 10 minutes okay Google begin a ten minute timer in just seven minutes okay so the first and easiest way to add more functionality to Google assistant is just to add shortcuts and this is very easy to do all you need to do is to open up the Google assistant head into the settings and then scroll down to where it says shortcuts and here you can add more voice commands and then tell Google what you wanted to do when you add them so you can't add new functionality to Google this way but you can just shorten the commands you use to access that functionality this is also a cool way to hack Google assistant into saying some cool stuff because you can always use the repeat after me phrase in order to get it to respond to different commands however you want this is a good way to prank friends etc that's pretty basic though if we want to get to javis levels of cool then we're gonna have to use two new apps one is Tasker which you may be familiar with and the other is auto voice these are both paid apps but you're only paid once and there's no recurring fee annoyingly in order to access the full features of auto voice you'll need to unlock it via a separate app store called auto apps once again it's just a single payment and it is fairly simple to do if you like this kind of thing so basically Tasker is an automation tool and this lets you set up a whole range of different events which act like triggers and then tasks which the phone carries out in response to those events this means we can control all kinds of different features of our device that we don't normally have access to through Google assistant and we can set up Google assistant as the trigger by using auto voice whilst those are installs head on over to Tasker so click plus on the profiles tab and then choose event and plugin so in task you have profiles and profiles or events that trigger tasks so the event is your input your trigger and this can be anything it can be your device connecting to a home network it could be it reaching a certain time or in this case we're listening for a third-party app by using a plug-in and that plug-in of course is gonna be auto voice now choose recognized meaning that we're listening out for when auto voice recognizes a command and then click the pencil icon to edit the screen that comes up this will open up auto voice and there you're going to choose commands and enter the words you want to access your triggers you can put in several and separate those each with a comma so what some kind of functionality we can add to Google that it doesn't already have well what about some kind of captain's log this could be something that lets us take a voice memo and it'll be a great opportunity for us to look at how to get quite a complex sequence of events working from a single voice command so for our command let's say Captain's Log and for our response let's say listening click the tick in the top right once you're done and then click the back arrow on the event edit screen of Tasker a little pop-up will ask you to create a new task so go ahead choose that and give it a name let's call it captain's log to remember in Tasker a task is the output this is what you want your voice command to trigger and you can choose all sorts of different things and better yet you can stack multiple tasks so that you carry out a long sequence of different processes from a single voice command we're gonna choose a media for our task and then record audio you need to give your file a name I've called mine log and then choose the maximum size in the format click back so now we have our first task in captain's log but we want to add a few more because we want to be able to stop the audio after a few seconds so first add another task and call it wait and you'll find that in the task category and then wait then set that to 10 seconds that's long enough for a little voice memo then we're going to add another task from the media category and that will be of course record audio stop so now it's starting to listen it's waiting for 10 seconds and then it's automatically stopping finally we're going to add one more media task and that's gonna be music play and here you're gonna put the file name that you set in the record task and the location and that way we can hear our memo being played back to us to make sure that it's works and it's captured all the information we want so ok Google asked Auto voice Captain's Log listening record this message for me and play it back ok so as we can see it's actually recorded the end of the message from Google assistant so to improve this we might add a wait at the start of the tasks and we might also want to put in like a little beep to tell us it's time to talk but otherwise that's working pretty well at the moment in order to access the features we've added via Tasker we need to ask Google to ask for Tasker and that's kind of cumbersome it's a bit like Chinese whispers but luckily we already know how to create shortcuts on Google assistant and there are a ton of different plugins you can get for Tasker which can give it more functionality and which we can access using auto voice one of the coolest ones is wake-on-lan and I talked about this last time wake-on-lan allows you to wake a computer from a sleeping State and that means we can say something like Open Sesame and use that to boot up the computer another cool one is join and joined synchronizes your PC with your Android device that has a task of plug in as well and that means that we can tell Google to open a web page on our PC ok Google open Android authority okay and whilst it's not a task a plug in Google assistant also works with IFTTT which will allow you to do all sorts of things like send messages on social media or turn on your hue lights or set the nest thermostat to a certain temperature but that's something you see quite often there are tons of tutorials out there on that and I did say we're going to look at some ways you could add more voice functionality to your device without needing Google assistant or as it happens this is very easy all you need to do is to go into your settings and set Auto voice as your default assistant this way holding down the home button will bring up auto voice and you can use any of the commands that we've set up or anymore that you want to create without having to go through Google assistants if you want to get really advanced you can actually make your own apps for Google assistant but these are called actions on Google and to get started you can either check out the article I've written I under the authority calm or just open up the actions on Google console and then there you'll see the option to make a new app there's a ton of different options but the simplest ways don't require any coding basically all you're doing is linking to a spreadsheet on Google Drive and that spreadsheet will have a host of different questions and the answers you want to give for them using this method you can make quizzes personality tests and flash cards for remembering things [Music] [Music] so thanks ton for watching guys I hope you found this video useful and interesting if you did please leave a like and comment down below and let me know what voice commands you're adding to your device and what methods you're using to do it and well aware that there are lots of different ways to do this so I'd love to know what tricks you guys know that I missed if you'd like to see more like this then subscribe to

hey it's Joshua for Gaara what's going on everybody and this is the HTC u 11 life now we already have a review of this phone here at Android authority done by Chris Carlin and he reviewed the Android one edition many of his positive thoughts I echo in this video so I figured I would do something a little bit different from this video review let us know what you think about it in the comments down below now the main difference between my version of HTC's new device and the one that Chris Carlin reviewed is the software experience because his was Android 1 and I have HTC Sense but this is the version you also get in the US while the Android 1 Edition is available in more places outside of the States so with that in mind let's talk about the software experience first HTC Sense obviously is what you get here about one really nice benefit that I actually just experienced in the last few days was an update to Android 8.0 Oreo what HTC Sense does benefit from some of those additions that we might have already enjoyed on devices like the pixel 2 for example pressing and holding on an icon in the home screens allows you to get to a few quick functions in these shortcuts on top of that you also have the ability to do picture in picture with an application like YouTube you would be able to play a video for example and when you press the home button you'll get a version of the video that floats on top of your workspace so you would still be able to do other things while you're still enjoying something like a YouTube video this also works with applications like Google Maps so if you're going to get navigation done you can do even more on top of it and that comes on top of software you might be familiar with from HTC including blinkfeed which has always been a part of sense and it is a good agricultural media feeds into just one easy to look at an easily scrollable feed but if we are going to talk about features that this phone has alongside the pixel 2 then of course we have edge sense what you can do here is squeeze the phone and it will bring up any number of functions and it doesn't necessarily have to be a Google assistant like I have here you're able to set it to pretty much any app or any function that it provides but you can also squeeze and hold the device in order to do some other functions as well in my case I have it set to taking the screen shot which I actually do quite often so it's nice to be able to do it quickly as you can see here there are also some options in order to do app squeezes so you can do something like going to the camera and squeeze it in order to take a photo you can go into maps and squeeze it to zoom into the map or you can program your own with a beta function that allows you to provide some taps and holds inside of these applications in order for you to program them to a squeeze and finally we're going to go outside the Google ecosystem a little bit to show the other assistance that HTC originally programmed for the simple squeeze and that is HTC Alexa that's right Amazon Alexa does come on this device and it is another way for you to get what you might already enjoy on an echo in your household on a portable device and that's the main function of it I personally found that HTC Alexa didn't really provide as many functions that I'm used to using on Google assistant like opening up YouTube to watch certain videos or opening up my music apps to play music and podcasts so those are the main differences between the two versions of the HTC u 11 life but let's take a look at the actual device itself the rest of the body is made of plastic and does not necessarily scream premium and of course because you have a glossy back here you are going to get a lot of fingerprints which is basically the case here and these are all fingerprints that I just got while filming this video the phone doesn't scream premium by any means but HTC has found a way of mitigating that as there is a ip67 certification for water and dust resistance so even if it doesn't feel like the strongest phone out there it can take more than it lets on but of course we get down to the bottom and this is where a lot of points of contention might be discovered you have a USB type-c port that is over to the side which is a little bit odd and it's a bit of a throwback to much older HTC devices you have a bottom mounted firing speaker here which is a single unit it doesn't really get too loud it gets pretty loud but it also doesn't sound too great so even if the speaker experience might not be the best you do get some great headphones in the box and they are these u sonic compatible earbuds that provide really punchy bass and actually a very enjoyable soundstage so what you have here is probably the best set of headphones I have ever been included or bundled with a particular phone inside the box they do have a USB C connecting port here on the bottom which means that these are the headphones that you are expected to use with you 11 live at all times now the reason why I say that is because the phone does not come with a headphone jack adapter and that's a kind of big bummer because it requires you to spend a little bit more than the affordable price for the phone by getting the adapter on HTC's own website and this is all powered by a specification sheet that should tell you what the performance will basically be like now while this phone is going to falter a little bit in terms of performance compared to the snapdragon 835 and other phones with even more gigabytes of RAM that doesn't mean that it's not a reliable performer even though there might be that little bit of slowdown with applications we still found that this phone was enjoyable to use on the daily and it got us through pretty much any task that we threw at it no matter what even gaming even if it takes a little while for an for a game to load up and there might be some slowdown where you're doing multitasking like the picture-in-picture we mentioned earlier and finally let's talk about the camera now this is one area where HTC made sure not to skimp out on the specifications one of the main issues with the camera is just in the app itself now this has more to do with the performance than anything else but you do get a number of modes here it's just that the app is still a little bit slow there is some shutter lag and you might need to have some patience before getting that perfect shot after you're fiddling with the exposure compensation and maybe trying to find what mode you want to use and waiting for it to actually load that up but the you 11 life has proven itself a reliable companion because of its good color reproduction and sharpness in all but the low-light situations things do fall apart pretty easily even when you're indoors where there's less light but with the steady hand you can still get some good photos without the stabilization I compared pictures between this and the original u11 and found that the U 11 life still provided some pretty comparable quality photos the main reason why the U 11 life falters is because of its higher aperture and also the lack of OIS like we've already mentioned the original u 11 obviously gets better specifications overall but the lower specifications of the u 11 life proportionally reflect what its overall prices and that's actually the story of the U 11 life in general now this is a phone that takes the flagship experience and just proportionally brings them down in order to reflect the price point there are times when the camera might actually remind us that we're using a budget device but HTC has done a good job in making sure you don't feel like you're really missing out that's the best part about this phone that comes in at 300 and $50 $349 to be exact or $300 outright if you happen to be on the t-mobile network and if you are looking to get a phone on t-mobile for a cheap price $12 a month is kind of one of the best entry points or a device like this so it's refreshing to approach the end of the year when the high note struck by a phone that only cost that much no matter which version you pick the cents Edition or the Android one Edition the main story here is the phones value for money HTC has made a mid-range version of their flagship device that shouldn't actually make anyone feel like they're missing out and we think that that's the best part of it as always thank you guys very much for watching and we hope you enjoyed this review of the HTC u 11 life again I tried to do something a little bit different with this video so make sure you go into the comments section down below let us know how you feel about this format and let us know if we should try it out again in the future it's just

[Music] hey guys it's David Emmel with Android authority and yep this is it one plus five T now if you've been following oneplus for the last couple years you know they tend to release two phones every single year one comes out about halfway through the year as a numerical upgrade and the other one comes out near the end which takes the same phone and makes it a little bit better we saw this last year with the three T which upgraded the SOC the battery in the front-facing camera but also shifted the price up by 40 bucks this year we've got the five t and if you were expecting a major spec bump you're not gonna get that here the inside of the phone is pretty much the same as the one plus five save a few minor tweaks of the cameras it's still got the Snapdragon 835 it's still got six to eight gigs of ram and it still got 64 to 128 gigs of storage well this phone does differently though is pretty obvious yeah it's the sweet it's got that new 18 by 9 aspect ratio which keeps it up with the new phones on the market but the panel is still basically the same it's still a 1080p Samsung AMOLED panel it's just a little bit bigger the better capacity is the same two with 3300 milliamp hours of the juice + 1 + says you're gonna get the same battery life out of it but I'm remaining pretty skeptical for now the screen is filling a lot more space on the front of the phone so oneplus decided to move the fingerprint reader to the back now if you like the fingerprint reader in the front you're gonna have to get used to it in the back those probably won't be coming back until they can figure out how to read your fingerprint in the screen on the bright side though oneplus wanted to stress how fast this thing actually is figure your hands on with the phone oneplus mention that the reader should unlock the phone within a fifth of a second but of course that's something we're gonna have to look at in our full review if you don't like unlocking your phone with your fingers oneplus actually added a new face unlock feature so saying this can unlock your phone from up to a 45 degree angle I'm pretty hesitant to see how secure this actually is but it was really really fast during our time with the device so it's always convenient to have at least the camera on the 5t is also a little bit different the dual cameras are still there with a little extra bump but the telephoto lens is gone instead the 5t is packing a 20 megapixel F 1.7 sensor which uses their intelligent pixel technology from the three T's front-facing camera to apparently do better in low-light circumstances they said they swapped these out because users didn't really notice the difference between hardware and software zoom but I'm not really buying that you're gonna have to decide if the better low-light performance is a worth the omission of that 2 X optical zoom the 5 T is gonna be 499 bucks for the base model and 559 for the SPECT out version so there is a $20 price bump here if you're waiting for the oneplus 5 to come back in stock there's really no reason not to go with the 5 T but if you were thinking of upgrading your 1 + 5 you're probably gonna want to save your money unless you've got to have that screen overall and I'm paraphrasing Josh here the 1 + 5 T is same same but different so that's been it for our hands-on if you liked the video tap the like button and follow us on social media and stay tuned for the full review and other news the minute it hits because of course we are your source for all things Android 
hey guys this is Daley Stein with Android authority you're watching our video review of the Mizzou Pro 7 plus [Music] the pro 7 plus is really just a little bit better than the pro 6 plus so a lot of what we said in that review also applies here well there is one big change and you already know what it is it's the secondary display basically amazing I slapped down a 1.9 inch AMOLED display on the back of the phone so what does it do well there are three main information panels that you can swipe between time pedometer and weather if you swipe up or down on any of the information panels you get to the viewfinder mode here you can take considerably higher quality selfies with the rear cameras in addition to these on-demand core features the screen also shows things like new notification event times and titles and alarms you can activate the screen by either turning the phone around or by double tapping on the glass it's really nice to see meizu seriously innovate with this secondary screen of course just like with any first generation technology there is a room for improvement the good news is is that the hardware implementation is great it's just the software that could use some work in the meantime the secondary screen just doesn't add much functional value it's still a very cool feature though and you'll enjoy it for its uniqueness and all the conversations that help start flip the phone over and you'll see the 5.7 inch quad HD Super AMOLED primary display and boy is it a beauty coveri production viewing angles sunlight readability they're all great it's an all-around excellent display we really enjoyed the size to 5.5 inches is a great middle ground but it's nice that May's it was giving you the choice between a smaller 5.2 inches with the pro 7 and a larger 5.7 inches with the pro 7 plus if you're going to go with the larger model you'll especially want to consider using a case Mesa includes a plastic one on the box and for good reason the soft aluminum unibody while very premium makes the phone quite slippery thankfully the superb build quality should make any drops a tad more forgiving you can choose between a number of attractive color options when getting the pro 7 plus or quite happy with how the matte-black looks and recommend it if you prefer a minimal look it's a very clean design overall from the discrete antenna lines to the flush curved and cornered secondary display glass smaller details like the integrated light and proximity sensors in the earpiece and symmetrical top and bottom bezels further solidify mazes keen attention to detail there's really only one big design flaw and that's a lack of water and dust protection that's pretty typical at this price but if it's something you want know that you can spend just a little bit more to get it one of our favorite aspects of mazes smartphones is their single key navigation configurations so instead of a three key layout like you're probably used to and touch on the pro 7 plus lets you navigate as well as nothing to gate with fingerprints with a single button for navigation you just tap it to go back press it to go home and swipe up from the neighboring bezel to multitask this setup can take a day or two to get used to what you'll end up loving it you'll also love the low key excellent audio setup you can get loud and clear 32-bit - I do with the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack no headphones no problem the bottom firing speaker is actually really good it's very loud with minimal Distortion one of the nice things about Mesa phones is that they're all unlocked and dual SIM so you can use two different nanos since simultaneously with the pro seven plus just don't plan on using them in the US as it doesn't have proper band support for either AT&amp;T or t-mobile if you think you're going to need more than the base metal 64 gigabytes of internal storage you want to go with the 128 gigabyte model is there's no expandable storage option the pro 7 plus is packing a 3,500 milliamp hour battery and it offer a similar longevity to the pro 6 plus our tests were conducted over HSPA+ instead of LTE so please note that our numbers may be a Chad inflated on average we got about 5 and a half hours of screen on time we are a bit concerned with a high standby usage possibly due to the helio x30 still you can probably expect around four and a half hours of screen on time with a full day of moderate use when you inevitably do need to tap on you can do so with M charge 4.0 we were able to go from zero to 65 percent in just 30 minutes that makes the pro 7 plus the fastest charging phones available standard a performance is excellent - although only marginally better than the pro six pluses it's using media Tech's flagship Helio X 30 10 nanometer chip but that's not the whole story the six gigabytes of RAM fast ufs 2.1 storage and well optimized software also help ensure smooth performance maizes software changes extend greatly into the foreground - well the pro 7 plus runs android 7.1.1 nougat maces fly me six skin offers a unique user experience fly me isn't for everyone but it's one of the most well designed Android skins to date and is great if you're looking to try something a bit different slimey's clean design fun animations and extra features are commendable you can expect a very intuitive user experience UI is colorful bold and responsive there's also a strong level of consistency in mazes design language throughout the software from the menus to the system apps we also really like how fly me includes some extra security features for example there's a secure payment mode which temporarily makes some common sense changes while you're using an app like PayPal there is something to keep in mind about the software though since maze of system updates focus on changes to fly me more so than Android versions it is slightly unlikely that the pro 7 plus will be updated to Android 8.0 Oreo we understand how this lack of Android support might be a turn-off for some for the cameras we're working with two sony IMX 386 12 megapixel f 2.0 shooters one for RGB and another for monochrome that's one more camera than the pro 6 plus head but the pro 7 plus does lose a few features there's no more laser autofocus the 10 LED ring flash has been replaced by 2 LEDs and most significantly there's no longer any optical image stabilization sample images came out pretty similar to those taken by the pro 6 plus the color reproduction is excellent there's a good level of contrast and images are very detailed it's about what we expect at this price although we do miss OAS as it would have prevented some of our sample images from coming out a bit blurry this time around Mesa has implemented a dual lens blur mode this mode works by isolating the subject from the background and then by applying an artificial background sometimes it does a good job at doing so other times the edges aren't totally accurate and the amount of blur can be too much or too sudden we're hoping that Mesa will improve this feature with future software updates unfortunately low-light performance isn't quite as impressive as daytime as you can see colors aren't as punchy there's a loss of detail and there's a fair bit of digital noise it's fine considering the price but it could be better in case you are wondering there's still a 16 megapixel F 2.0 front-facing camera for standard selfies and video calls selfies come out quite nicely but keep in mind that you can always use the better quality rear cameras instead thanks to that secondary display 4k video recorded with the pro 7 plus also comes out quite nicely colors look pretty good and there's a good level of detail one of the nice features from the pro 6 plus that has made its way to the pro 7 plus is the ability to double press the home button to access the camera even when the phone is locked as far as the camera app goes it's a pretty standard setup so meizu pro 7 plus how much does it cost well the global unit should retail for around five hundred thirty dollars the smaller pro seven will be slightly less expensive at four hundred thirty dollars this is easily one of the most unique smart phones that we've reviewed this year Mizzou not only managed to deliver a great overall package but has also implemented a very cool-looking secondary display which helps the pro Soudan plus standout but you shouldn't buy this phone just for the secondary display well it's useful at times it's still very much a first-generation concept you should think of it as a bonus item rather than a sole reason for your purchase that's not to say the pro suom Plus isn't worth the money in fact it's well designed software an excellent hardware make it very competitive if you're looking for something genuinely unique I can get past its quirks the pro cylinder plus is an excellent choice and that will be all for this video please be sure to subscribe if you haven't already and hit that Bell button to get notified when we release new videos also be sure to check out the android authority website is where your source for all things Android 
so you're concerned about securing your phone and you should be so is it iris scanners fingerprint scanners or pass codes what's the best way to lock it down now I know it's pretty self-evident but first we got to talk about the difference between biometric and non biometric data non biometric data is your password your passcode that you use to lock down your smartphone biometric data is when you are your password whether that's through your fingerprint or your iris or through some other biometric means we use to prove our identity to our phone now for a smartphone biometric security works like this you first begin by providing a biological sample that is digitized and then stored as read-only information on the device as you may have guessed it's stored as read-only so it prevents the information from being compromised and when you need to gain access to your device you have to provide another biological sample that is checked against the sample that is stored initially if the samples match you've proven your identity and gain access but if your sample does not match you've been unable to verify your identity and therefore get denied now some of you might be thinking why not just use a pin code or password which must simpler and faster right well in some ways they are inherently less secure this is because there is only a finite number of possible alphanumeric combinations that can be used for any given password so a hacker with enough time and tenacity could in theory figure out your password through a process of elimination or through a program that he or she writes or else a potential attacker could watch you input your password or pattern and after gaining access to your device attempt to follow along with your movements to satisfy your device's authentification requirements granted there are ways to mitigate this somewhat including by putting a limited number of times in which an incorrect password can be entered but this type of precaution is far from absolute for this reason fingerprint sensors are all the rage right now and becoming a standard feature even in mid to low range mobile devices now I know what some of you are thinking you're thinking Jace I have a thing fantastic password it cannot be guessed by anybody it's not simple super complicated with special characters capitals just crazy stuff no one's gonna hack that thing or guess it well let's hear from an expert this is bill burr a former manager at the National Institute of Standards and Technology no not that bill Berger in 2003 burr created an 8 page guide that would go on to inform the password creating guidelines but which we all are forced to abide by today but Bert recently came clean and admitted that he had a very poor understanding of how passwords actually worked at the time and he's very sorry that his misguided treaty is the reason we must make these unnecessarily complicated passwords that don't make our devices or accounts any more secure we now know that using a string of simple and unrelated words is actually more secure than using a shorter password in which there is a mix-up of upper and lower case letters numbers and special characters there was a well-known comic strip that explains this best illustrating how a computer could take 550 years or at least 1,000 guesses per minute to figure out a password consisting of four simple words like correct horse battery staple while something like rub four or and three would just take three days at the same rate now there is a saving grace for alphanumeric passwords and I know you're gonna groan because it's a pain in the butt it is two-factor authentication basically rather than immediately granting entry with the input of your password two-factor authentication means that input of your password will trigger a one-time temporary code to be sent to you typically a numeric code sent via text message or a phone call and you can only gain entry once you've inputted the temporary code in the login window now what about patterns is that any better one of the biggest issues with patterns is that others can watch your finger moves across the devices display to decipher your pattern it's particularly easy since there are only nine points on your device giving hackers a much better chance of figuring out your pattern than if they were trying to detect the letters you were hitting on a keyboard for an alphanumeric password and almost half the lock screens started in the upper left-hand corner according to some data so that means that biometric security must be inherently more secure correct well to some degree yes when it comes to fingerprint sensors it creates a virtual image of your fingerprint by inferring the pattern from the different levels of a charge between the ridges and valleys of your print while something like an optical fingerprint scanner can be fooled with a high-resolution photo of your fingerprint capacitive scanners are more secure because they measure the actual physical structure of your fingerprint as such using your fingerprint to secure your device is probably going to be the most secure method available to you but how secure is it really well not even biometric security is completely infallible in fact kyle lady senior R&amp;D engineer of dual security doesn't consider biometric security on smartphones to be really any better than non biometric security methods according to Kyle biometric technology on smartphones represents a shift mostly in accessibility and offers quote a different set of properties to passwords not better or worse but different how is that possible you ask well a professor at University of Oxford professor Rogers had his students attempt to fool each other's authentication methods available on smartphones accordingly they have managed to best every single one including fingerprint sensors for no more than the cost of a cup of coffee during a conversation we had with Professor Rogers he explains how they manage to trick the fingerprint sensor which they did with so-called gummy fingers basically gummy fingers our fingerprint replica is made of rubbery silicon like materials that are able to capture significant fingerprint detail in order to fool the capacitive sensor which of course leaves us with facial recognition and iris scanners while the consensus seems to be that facial recognition isn't quite in the same league as fingerprint sensors when it comes to biometric authentication because facial recognition can often be circumvented with a photograph god this is starting to sound like a doomsday show it's not meant to be that way the point is is that no security system is infallible anything can be but on the other hand as we progress it is getting harder and harder to hack these systems case in point I know there was a big scandal I did a show about it after the sa was hacked like a month after it launched but come on that German team put a lot of effort in hacking that most people are not going to be troubled going through that much hassle to hack your particular phone so use your common sense what do you think about your fingerprint scanner your PIN code your passcode your iris scanners I know I've seen some people use facial recognition where family members are using the facial recognition to get into a family member's phone has that happened to

in a world where AI is at the forefront of innovation smartphones are becoming more sophisticated but isn't a I first approach right for a modern-day smartphone let's find out it's near a 400 thority and this is the huawei mate 10 and mate 10 Pro the mate 10 follows the trend of other 2017 flagships and comes with a full view displayed that essentially means it has smaller bezels than previous years the mate 10 has a 5.9 inch qHD IPS display with 16 by 9 aspect ratio while the mate 10 Pro comes with a 6 inch full HD Plus AMOLED display with 18 by 9 aspect ratio both screens also support HDR 10 so you'll be able to watch HDR content natively through apps like YouTube and Netflix the switch to smaller bezels have resulted in other changes to the design both devices come with curved R is to improve the in hand experience as well as a signature horizontal stripe across the camera most noticeable change however is the fingerprint sensor while the May 10 Pro keeps the fingerprint sensor on the rail like previous years the mate 10 has squeezed it below the screen on the front the biggest star of the show is the kieran 917 which is the first smartphone chipset to come with a dedicated neural processing unit for AI while way says the MP u allows you may tend to see what's around you and react accordingly and this is most noticeable in the camera when pointing at a subject the NPU recognizes the type of subject such as plant food or flower and adjust the image accordingly both while taking the picture and in post-processing talking of the camera both devices come with the next generation of lekha dual cameras the main sensor is a 12 megapixel RGB sensor with OAS and the secondary camera is a 20 megapixel monochrome sensor the mate 10 is also the first smartphone to offer F 1.6 aperture on both lenses which tops the LGV 30 which offers it in its main sensor only under the hood both devices come with a flagship specs list but the differences are quite pronounced the May 10 comes with four gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of expandable storage while the May 10 pro has 6 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage that can't be expanded the May 10 comes with a 3.5 millimeter audio jack while the May 10 pro relies on USB C digital audio only the May 10 supports LT cat 16 which offers data speeds of up to 1 gigabit the second automate impro offer speeds of up to one point to bigger bits per second the make tempo also comes with ip67 dust of water resistance which is the missing on previous Huawei flood ships both devices are powered by a four thousand milliamp hour battery and support Huawei super charge which charges to 50% in just 30 minutes the emui interface is often the most polarizing feature on huawei smartphones and last year's emui 5.1 was a welcome step in the right direction this year while he has jumped to emui 8.0 as both devices are running Android Oreo out of the box the company has also designed parts of the interface with AI in mind and these are most seen during day to day use so we'll need to wait for the full review to truly test these out that said the MPO is said to offer contextual suggestions such as enabling the reading mode to dim the blue light when reading a book and offering to save details when taking a picture of a business card alongside this one is also introduced a new floating navigation table it can be moved anywhere on the screen and offers easy navigation options such as one tap to go back a long press to go home and swiping left or right to activate the recent apps menu it's a little confusing but you can enable the on-screen keys if you'd rather have a more traditional experience Huawei is also trying to appeal to business users with the addition of a single cable projection mode that lets you make 10 connect to a secondary screen the dock less-experienced can either mirror or extend your smartphone screen and you can navigate the interface either by pairing a Bluetooth keyboard a mouse or by navigating using the mate 10 screen itself when projecting your screen causing other sensitive content won't display on the big screen to ensure that your privacy is respected the make 10 will be available in black champagne gold pink gold and my personal favorite maka Brown while the make 10 pro will come in mocha brown titanium grey pink gold and midnight blue the make tenon mate temp Pro offer an interesting insight into our ways overall smartphone portfolio an AI first approach suggests the company believes AI can allow its smartphones to stand out from the competition but the actual benefits of this won't be clear until we've spent enough time with each device we'll find out in our upcoming review of both devices but for now what do you think of the make 10 and do you plan to buy it let us know your views in the comments below and head over to android authority comm for a more in-depth look at huawei's new flagships once you're done head back

hey it's Josh of agarra what's going on everybody and wanted to bring you guys a look at the LGV 30 and it's video recording capabilities now we did just do a vs long did of the V 30 versus the Galaxy Note 8 in terms of their camera performance and the camera capabilities so you can make sure to check that out too the links will be in the description below but I just wanted to give you sort of my experience using the LG v 30 as a main camera while I was in Berlin for Aoife and also in China about a week or so ago now standard caveat I do need to tell you guys real quick that the LG v 30 that we're using right now is a pre-production unit some things might change when we get our final production unit so hopefully within the next couple of weeks but as I said I just wanted to give you my experience and my thoughts as to why the LGV 30 is one of the most fun cameras that I've used in recent memory so a quick rundown of what kind of footage you might be seeing in this video I did use it for a couple of trips and I did use it mainly as a vlogging camera so if you're looking at the LGV 30 as a potential main vlogging rig well I do have a few tips that could probably get you started and to give you the best experience that you can get out of the v30 all right so this is the vlogging rig that you might see a lot of youtubers use however I'm not using a regular camera on the top here I got the Joby Pro clamp in order to securely fasten the LGV 30 to the top of this gorilla pod one of the reasons why I really love using this is because with the wide-angle camera you won't be able to capture log footage instead you'll be using the regular angle camera so I want to get some distance between me and the camera so that I can still get my framing just right and as long as you're keeping the camera basically in the right general area you will be in the frame properly and with that distance you'll be able to put yourself in the middle without cutting off the top or bottom of your subject also top tip if you are going to be vlogging or using the LGV 34 a lot of footage using the rear cameras because let's be honest the front-facing camera is just not all that up to par when it comes to quality and of course you can't do log footage with a front-facing camera go to manual video mode and the volume buttons become the button force for triggering and also stopping the recording kind of like this but of course if you do want to use the wide-angle camera it's still going to get some pretty good color accurate videos and with that wide angle you don't have to worry about not having your subject in the scene you can even just hold the phone hit record and then turn it right around and you'll pretty much get everything in the scene even if your hand is a part of it so let's talk about one of the features that will dive into more in our full review this is the cine video mode where you get a flat profile to begin with because that is the log format profile and then you have a bunch of different color filters that you can put onto the video so that you can record it using that color profile already this is a little bit different from the usual filters you might see in plenty of other cameras or other applications and they are very stylized so you can get a very particular look for your footage and it's pretty nice to have it but it's really that wide-angle first off that does a great job of just sort of making the footage that much more fun to watch you are able to turn the phone around and then just get a full-on perspective much like you would with a GoPro because the wide-angle view is a lot like an action camera but it's just on a phone and if you want another top tip you can record in 4k video and just have a big micro SD card inside of the phone so you don't run out of space and the reason why I say that is because you can record in 4k and if you render out in 1080p you will be able to crop into the 4k frame pretty easily if you didn't necessarily get the framing that you want now a couple thoughts on point soom there are a couple of shots here that I used four-point zoom but I found the effect to be a little bit cheesy it's kind of like those old kung fu movies where it seemed into the actors eyes like a little bit too tight in also but I get that it is a useful tool especially if you have the phone stationary on something like a gorilla pod like I'm using right now that way you're able to zoom in to a particular part of the frame without having to move the phone itself as you're zooming this camera is super fun to use and if you're going to be using this phone for social media for example then just have the phone uprights for different areas like snapchat or IG stories and it's going to import right in perfectly and you can use the wide-angle camera on the main camera before importing that footage into whatever social media platform you choose you might actually recognize some of these clips as they were on our Android authority IG story but it was during my trip to China that I decided to use log footage as much as possible you might be hearing this a lot over the next number of weeks and log footage is essentially a color profile or rather a type of video that is shot at a very flat profile you don't get a whole lot of saturation in it and also all of the different settings for sharpness contrast anything to that effect has been dialed down in order for you to put that in during post-production I use Premiere Pro for editing video so you would be using something like the loo metric colors in order to do general correction and then add some stylized colors or different levels of contrast maybe mess with the highlights and the shadows in order to get a very stylized look but for the most part I just tried to recreate the accurate portrayal of the scene when I do color correction I will say one thing log footage has a steep learning curve when it comes to getting it just right and what I will also say is that it's very important to get your settings just right if using the manual video mode when recording the log footage and the LGV 30 the LGP 30 is good at compensating for changing conditions but when you're trying to grade log footage you don't really want the exposure jumping in and out throughout the video and you obviously don't want to have the white balance changing because that will change your color altogether but overall I couldn't really get over just how detail the videos were there was a very low level of noise and I really enjoyed what kind of videos I was able to get out of it it's just amazing the kind of package you get in the cameras for the LGV 30 you're able to do log footage and then stylize the footage of yourself in post-processing with color correction or you can use one of the built-in color profiles to get that stylized look as you are recording and then of course you have the wide-angle camera which is just simply always fun and if you've never used a wide-angle camera before this might be the time to try it out on the LGP 30 it is just an incredible amount of fun so that's gonna go ahead and do it for this video I just wanted to bring you an example of the LGV 30 as we move into what could be our main review period when we get our final production units I had hundreds of clips from my trips to Berlin and China over the last few weeks so I just wanted to share some of that with you guys and give you an example of what the V 30 can do we're looking forward to getting our final review units and we're going to bring you that review and final thoughts on the camera when that happened so remember to stay tuned to android authority for that and even more drop us some likes on the video and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and from there stay tuned for more about the LG v 30 and more because we are your source for all things Android 
if there's one thing that the Galaxy S nine brings to the table that is probably revolutionary it would have to do with the camera and we're gonna take a closer look at it for those of you who only want to see what these camera features are it's jaja for gara what's going on everybody and these are the new features for the cameras of the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus let's go ahead and start off with just some fun here slow motion is not really a new feature as it appears in a number of recent Samsung releases mainly in the form of 120 frames per second video but with the updated camera of the s9 4k footage can be captured at 60 frames per second making it a beast for videographers but when you do the math you're able to get 120 frames per second at 1080p and then go all the way down to 720p at 960 frames per second however Samsung has put in an auto mode that allows the camera app to figure out when the motion is happening and then it begins capturing that super fast motion we tried this one or two times and the video that came out of it was quite enjoyable when you go to it inside of the gallery it'll actually add music or even a couple of effects before you actually share it with anybody else and then here come the AR emoji one for all of those people that have an emoji envy Samsung has brought its own brand of special emoji to the galaxy s 9 and they are quite customizable using either camera faces can be captured and transformed into an avatar that resembles kind of like a bitmoji if you are a snapchat user the face capture results in more of a caricature rather than a really accurate depiction and even then people can customize the AR emoji to be beyond recognition for example there are a ton of hairstyles and you can change the colours to a number of different options and I was able to get my long hair back because of that and lunch just wanted to have bright white hair so that was his prerogative there's a variety of eyewear and all colors can be changed to what you want clothing options were a bit sparse but we're sure that updates will provide even more settings for this and we want to be surprised if there were themed or even sponsored elements of the AR emoji that people can use as you've seen with other avatar creation systems once you're happy with your AR emoji just hit save and the camera will save all the options so that when you use let's say the front-facing camera it will provide you with your AR emoji and you can actually move your head around make the face do things like raising your eyebrows or opening your mouth and making it make faces that you are actually making in real life but that's not all the mode will actually save over a dozen different gifts that are locally stored for easy sharing again this is probably something that will grow over time as more gifts can be created by this mode and Samsung can easily just update this feature in the future and we go from that into the nitty gritty the stuff that real photons might actually really be excited about and we're talking about aperture it doesn't sound all of that fun but it's a little bit more technical and when you think about it inputs this smartphone closer to proper DSLRs than ever before as you can see here the opening of the lens is either wide open or closed down depending on the setting in aperture terms the closed setting is f 2.4 and the open setting is f 1.5 let that sink in for a second you're able to choose between these two aperture modes this is a hardware solution where as you would see the same effect in a lot of software solutions in the past but in order to get more light into the lens you can go to F 1.5 and you'll also get much finer depth of field focus but if you have a wider scene like let's say a landscape the F 2.4 will be better suited for that but it won't allow as much light to get into the lens purists will probably be happy that not everything is relying on soft or for once but of course if you want to do that soft focus is still a mode that is available and finally let's talk a little bit about multi frame processing this is something that you might have seen in mainly the Google pixel phones with HDR plus it's the same general idea but of course Samsung doesn't have the massive machine learning library that Google does hit the shutter and at any moment the camera will capture 12 photos usually in three groups of four and all of the frames will be processed for their detail for their contrast and for how much noise needs to be reduced or just in general processed we were told that this has done a few different times in a split instant made possible by the memory the DRAM built into the actual camera module itself the results are hopefully going to be exceptional though we're sure that the camera will still be a high performer given the track record of the Galaxy S line you're seeing some examples of these pictures right now but of course we will give you even more of our thoughts and you can give us yours after we give our full testing in our full review and so there you have it a specific look at the cameras of the galaxy s 9 and the s 9 plus by the way the s 9 plus camera does have the telephoto lens on there now bringing some note 8 flavor to the line but the rest of what we've covered above is available in either phone which is a great prospect for users who don't really need the zoom but don't want to feel like they're missing out on anything else by picking the smaller of the two devices let us know how you feel about these camera updates and if it might be enough for you to actually pick up the latest Samsung device yourself keep it tuned to Andrew authority for more about this phone and we're gonna be pitting it against a lot of other devices just to see where it stacks up against the competition keep it tuned here to Android authority and don't forget to head on over to Andrew 30.com for even more from MWC because we are your source for all things Android 
hello I'm Gary Sims from Andrew authority and some of the buzzwords at the moment are machine-learning ml and artificial intelligence AI and there's a whole question about the ethics of the decisions that are made by AI and m/l systems now we don't actually have any ants at the moment but there are certainly lots of talking points so if you want to find out what are the problems with ethics and AI please let me explain now of course the whole area of ethics and morality is in itself absolutely huge so we'll just put that to one side for the moment and let's just deal with how AI and ML deal with the area of ethics and morality for example in business you can have a business that is ethical or a business that is unethical now the problem is that not everything that is legal is ethical and not everything that is unethical is illegal so for example they might be strong lobby groups that Lobby a government to make the laws in a certain way or maybe a weak government doesn't actually address certain things and therefore a business can function and that business can itself be with inside the bounds of the law however its activities are unethical and certainly one thing we don't want in the future is an AI or a machine learning algorithm that is staying within the bounds of the law but it's pushing as hard as it can to see how far it can go but actually remain inside the law itself in fact when it finds a loophole it will go through that loophole and expose it because that will be its principal gain to fulfill its goal and if his goal is fulfilled through a loophole that's exactly what that system will do well my favorite examples of ethics is the idea of fairness now I have three children and I have raised them together with my wife and we have tried to give them an ethical and moral standing about what is right and what is wrong but one of the things we never needed to teach them was what is fairness they always knew when something was not fair and they were not receiving the fair portion now it was a different thing teach them to always be fair to others that was a whole different lesson but they knew intrinsically when something was not fair now will an AI or a machine learning system know that something is not fair because it might be the most efficient it might be the most cost-effective it might be the thing that reaches the goal quickest has been programmed with but it's completely unfair so how does the ml system know that let me give an example let's say we had an ml system a machine learning system that was controlling emergency services so we're talking about you know ambulances and paramedics and fire engines and maybe even you know sort of first-aid and maybe hospitals and emergency rooms okay and this machine learning system is there to try to optimize the use of all of those resources now that's a really good idea but the problem is that if you set certain goals then the machine learning algorithm will shortcut those goals it will cheat to fulfill those goals so for example if you said that the goal of this system is to treat as many people as you can well if that was the case then maybe the machine learning system would give more priority to people with ingrowing toenails or to people who've got cats stuck up a tree because very quickly the appropriate resources can be given the problem can be solved and then the next case can be taken so the throughput the number of people helped actually goes up quite high the guy who needed a ten-hour operation is put to one side because there are 10 people who can have a 45-minute operation is quick and cheaper and therefore 10 people get treated rather than one and of course this has no ethical dimension to it it's purely a numbers game and you can also get the opposite way around if you say well we're tweak the machine learning so that doesn't do that well actually then you can find that all it does is treat people that need ten-hour operations and then people that are in less risk situations never get treated cuz they're not going to die they're not in harm's way so why should they be treated at all so setting the goals is really really important and a machine learning algorithm will look at the data and look at its goals and it will find the quickest way to achieve that goal and of course made treatment and treating people is incredibly complicated because not only are you dealing with risk you're also dealing with a whole bunch of factors including age and the severity of an illness and you're looking at maybe other secondary issues that affect the primary issues like lifestyle maybe income diet you know the kind of education they've had the kind of way they treat their own body all these things come in to the factors that play in how you treat people now of course a machine learning algorithm could make the wrong decisions that are unethical but according to a dangerous being given it was the right answer and one of the problems is that all ml systems are based on data so the machine learning algorithm actually gains his experience from the data that has been given now if that data is itself biased that it will itself create biased rules and it will follow those rules even though they are biased and we're assuming therefore incorrect or one of the reasons the data set can be biased is because it's missing data so you may have a whole bunch of characteristics and factors that are listing in the statistics but actually there's something that is missing that would actually change the characteristic of the whole data set and of course there are a whole bunch of built-in intrinsics that we know about that actually are not expressed in data so for example the value of life or the value of another person and this brings us to the next question which is who is to blame when a machine learning system makes the wrong decision for example let's say you bring a friend around and you say to your smart speaker tell me a joke and it tells a joke that is not appropriate it tells a joke that is offensive who is to blame for that is it me as the owner of that smart speaker did I have something do I do something wrong to make it behave like that is it the producer of that you know is it the the manufacturer of that particular smart speaker is it the programmer do I have to kind of take a guy called Fred to court to say you know why did you let your smarts be could do that or is it the data set person or the people who provide the data said you they provide a data set that was not a ethical because I was talking about jokes but of course when you multiply this up to be indifferent knows education and health care and business practices self-driving automation all these things then these mistakes that get made can be much more costly than just someone being offended by a joke they didn't appreciate and then of course that leads to the flipside of the question if in the future we have machines that are you know fully autonomous and they are making decisions based on their programming if they commit a crime are they guilty can a robot be guilty of a crime do robots have any rights so these are all interesting areas that are to do with morality and ethics because the bottom line is data doesn't give us except thing that can't be gleaned from just a set of data points I'm going

hey its structure for Gaara what's going on everybody and this is the Google pixel book and our hands-on at the event in San Francisco now Google released a ton of new hardware but what we see here is the pixel book their newest version of a laptop line that uses Chrome OS however you could say that this pixel book is the one that's really trying to break it into the mainstream it's a 12-point 3-inch foldable laptop that runs Chrome OS but has full support for the Google Play Store which means that all of the place for applications you might already enjoy on your Android smartphone can be used on this laptop and that includes applications like Adobe Photoshop Lightroom mobile and also snapchat so you can use the camera on this laptop in order to do some pretty amazing snaps when you use what is bundled with it the pixel pen now the pixel pen does allow the pixel book to have a little bit more of a creative application however the Google assistant is still like with all of the other products at the helm of this product even a button dedicated to launching the Google assistant is found on the pixel book and it allows for basically the usage of Google assistant the way you would use it in any other apparatus you would bring it up ask it a question using the built-in microphones and then you will get your answers but using the pixel pan you would actually be able to not only select text and be able to bring that into the Google assistant but you can actually circle just about anything on the screen and be able to search for it using Google's own search algorithms you can see in this example that we circles even just a picture of Ryan Gosling from a recent movie poster and it showed us that it was Bladerunner 2049 and you can do that with pretty much anything on the internet if you need to figure out just what the heck you're looking at but what really gives a pixel book a ton of capabilities is it's convertible nature when closed you get a great look at the wonderful design that comes in at only two point four pounds and it's an incredibly thin laptop but you also get a look at the design language that you would see on a regular pixel with that glass panel at the top open it up and you can use the device as a traditional laptop fold it all the way back and you would be able to use it like a tablet which is handy when you have the pixel pen or you can just fold it back maybe 80% of the way and put it in what we would call the 10th formation it's also no slouch in the spec department the baseline model is running the Intel KB Lake Core i5 processor and there is one with an i7 processor with a gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of on-board storage that is expandable to up to half a terabyte not that you're going to need that much since chrome OS mostly lives in the cloud overall the pixel book looks like the Chrome OS laptop to beat especially with its very sleek form factor and it's convertible nature we will take a look at it in the future when a full unit arrives with us and we'll give you our full review somewhere here on Android authority keep it tuned to Android authority for all of the best from the Google event here in San Francisco including our hands-on with the Google pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL and then remember to bring it on back here for more because we are your source for all things Android 
LG seems to have lost its compass so much that LG said that they were gonna do away with the name LG G 7 altogether and call it the LG G spot but then they thought I M not gonna feel right honestly that's at least partly true but first I want to talk about a giveaway something I want to give to you used to do giveaways all the time but I want to give more away than just a t-shirt I want to give away at Google home Mini all you have to do is answer a simple question who loses their phone in today's show the name of one individual all you have to do is watch carefully for the whole show and find out who loses their phone at the end I'll tell you how you can answer the question ok so back to LG news coz LG buddy you're confusing me you see earlier this year the CEO of LG mobile claimed that they were gonna do away with their current flagship plans to create something to better distinguish themselves from their competitors they don't want to make a phone that just looked like everyone else's then the usually reliable Evan blast added to that story by saying that LG would release another flagship phone in June of 2018 codenamed Judi with me so far good cuz now it gets a little bit funky I say funky because look what showed up this past week at their Mobile World Congress an lg device called the LG G 7 neo under the hood the g7 neo features the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor up to six gigabytes of RAM up to 128 gigabytes of storage and a 3000 milliamp hour battery we presume the phone runs Android Oreo out of the box but no official word yet there's also no official word on the g7 neo itself the phone seemingly came out of nowhere and is pretty much an enigma to all of us so what's really going on here is this just a backdoor way in to promote their actual flagship phone the LG G seven neo or is that just a prototype that are never actually gonna sell and the real phone is coming in June we don't know it's clear as mud what do you think alright so have you figured it out who lost their phone if you have the answer follow the link below in the show description and submit your answer you also have to follow me and Android Authority on Twitter that's at a minimum if you want to increase your chances you can follow us all over social media Facebook Instagram the whole bit and those will increase your chances because they give you additional entries into the raffle the more entries you have the greater chance you have of winning the Google whole mini and I will ship it to you anywhere you are in the world it's a totally international contest good luck and follow me right there now if you want to get serious about branding yourself online our sponsor domain.com is over 300 domain name extension to fit your needs from ComTech club two dots pace and the guys of domain comm love the android authority audience so much they're showing their love by giving you 15% off an already really good price for domain names web hosting or email use our coupon code Android at domain.com check out when you think domain names think domain.com [Music] bah 
yes we've got some updated goodies on the 1 plus 5t you see the co-founder of one plus Karl PI has been tweeting up a storm showing off the supposed photos of the 5 T by tweeting things like what phone is he taking that photo is well it's likely the 1 + 5 t and according to rumors it will have a similar camera setup to its predecessor but instead it will get a speck bump 2 to 20 megapixel dual cameras this isn't the only photo shared by pi though he recently took to Twitter to share another great picture which featured a low-light disco ball he captured the picture cool photo must have come from a great camera CEO and co-founder Pete Lau was also getting on the action with his own picture which you can see here he says impressive photo must be a great camera another piece of sweet news is that the 1 + 5 T is said to keep the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack in a Twitter posting earlier the company asked fans what all of their previous phones had in common it would seem like a pretty cruel joke to remove the headphone jack on the 1 + 5 t after a post like this now clearly 1 + 5 t is trying to compete with this puppy the Google pixel - and this is the smaller version that I've recently acquired and the phone camera is fantastic in portrait mode it is it is amazing I mean it produces portrait quality photos that are as good or better than my $2,000 professional DSLR yeah sadly the rest of the phone is underwhelming at best let me know what you think about the 1 + 5 t are you excited about it are you gonna get it let me know what you think in the comments below or as usual on Twitterverse well as someone who runs an online business I can tell you that I look for tools that make my life easier and our sponsor fresh books not only makes this show possible but they make online payments and accounting much less painful and how do they do that exactly well you can send clean and professional-looking invoices in about 30 seconds and in about 2 seconds you can set yourself up to receive online payments and you don't have to manually input your receipts you can take pictures of your receipts with your phone using fresh Brooks's mobile apps and for a 30-day unrestricted trial you can go to FreshBooks com4 which lasts Android and in the section where it says how you've heard about us Phil in Android authority [Music] 
so just how bad is the repeal of Obama's net neutrality and what our tech companies doing about it unless you've been living under a rock over the past several months you knew that this vote on net neutrality was coming it played out as many people expected and the FCC voted to reclassify Internet service providers like Comcast spectrum and Verizon the vote removed restrictions on the companies that many felt were vital to have an open and fair internet now Google responded by pledging to continue to follow the policies of net neutrality quote we remain committed to net neutrality policies that enjoy overwhelming public support we've been approved by the courts and we are working well for every part of the internet economy we will work with other net neutrality supporters large and small to promote strong enforceable protections now what does Google mean by strong and enforceable protections because there are less protections or there will be once this passes partly we have to trust in companies like Google to protect our interests not just theirs Facebook is another company that voice support for strong net neutrality regulations and that quote from Sheryl Sandberg today's decision from the Federal Communications Commission to end net neutrality is disappointing and harmful an open Internet is critical for new ideas and economic opportunity and internet providers shouldn't be able to decide what people can see online or charge more for certain web sites we're ready to work with members of Congress and others to help make the internet free and open for everyone I love what Sandberg said because it was a lot less lawyer speak than Google and she also pointed out how it's going to affect people like you and me more on that in a moment let's move on to Netflix we're disappointed in the decision to gut net neutrality protections that ushered in an unprecedented era of innovation creativity and civic engagement this is the beginning of a longer legal battle Netflix stands with innovators large and small to oppose this misguided FCC order damn Netflix tell us how you really feel they also remind us that this is just the beginning of a long legal battle and it will be some time before these new regulations take a also with its repeal Amazon's chief technology officer took to Twitter to share his statement and a quote I am extremely disappointed in the FCC's decision to remove net neutrality protections we will continue to work with our peers partners and customers to find ways to ensure an open and fair internet that can continue to drive massive innovation now let's just sit back for a moment and talk about why this matters so much to people like you and me and it's not just about companies charging you a little more to get to your content it's much deeper than that it speaks to the very root of a democratic open free society so let's just sit back for a moment and imagine that the Internet is a whole series of highways roads bridges and buses and trains okay and different companies own different aspects of the transportation system and they say hey you know Jace you can go to this mall over here and drive there on our fast train for free and once you go there you can shop on all those stores that we have partnerships with or we own a piece of but if you want to go over here to this other mall where you're gonna charge us 1099 each time you go on that bus or train or Road yeah now those malls are not competing with each other on equal footing anymore are they no it's not really fair and it's stifling innovation because this mall over here could create a wonderful experience but they can't compete with free fast transportation to the free mall right that's not fair that's not a free and open transportation system we want a free and open Internet what happens when you take that and it becomes the Internet that's our highway for information and knowledge and cultural exchange well now you can decide what people see and what information they get and if you're really good at it you can manipulate what people begin to believe right I mean we saw a lot of this in the last election in the US and 2016 where countries or companies you know were manipulating information we called it fake news and of course each side had their own a set of fake news it's really dangerous stuff and although these companies have a case to want to make more money and and scale up their business it is a very slippery slope when you are able to manage information in a way that suits your own business and is not in the best interest of public and society at a heart you should care about this and you should care about it a lot let me know what you think in the comments below and on Twitter like me do you

double the play double the fun and potentially double the work but the story is not as simple as it seems an undoubted leak ooh look into our smartphone future or what it could be gets bogged down by problems we are still having today it's Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and this is our full review of the ZTE axon M obviously this phone is a foldable device with two screens comprising the outer shell and at first glance when it is closed it might look like the original Nintendo DS revealing the two displays shows the 5.2 inch full HD IPS panels that can be used either independently or together like one large canvas and that yields an effective six point seven five inches of what can be described as a tablet like surface we'll get into the actual experience of using these displays a little bit later but one thing I do have to say is that these IPS panels are decidedly average now take it on their own it's 5.2 inches at full HD resolution and the resolution doesn't bother me a whole lot it's more about the color reproduction for a film that's supposed to be literally all displays all the time it doesn't really scream eye candy when the experience of looking at these things for media or gaming hasn't exactly been on par with plenty of other flagships there's very little to say about the inner portion after all the camera's not even found there it's found atop the main display and it is used for both rear and front facing functions all of the buttons are to the left of the main screen including the power button which has a fingerprint sensor embedded in it unfortunately if the power button is a little bit recessed into the body of the device which makes it a little bit awkward to press especially if you're using your right hand and you have to use an index or middle finger to unlock the device there's also another button down here that can be used for triggering the shutter in the camera and you can double tap it to even launch the camera but since this is an 18 T exclusive device what AT&amp;T wants you to know is that you can program holding this button down to trigger Direct TV in a mode called TV mode now I wish I could say more about TV mode but basically it's just a shortcut to opening any programmable media application it actually doesn't change the functionality of that app or the way that it is shown in the display a whole lot overall it's the heft of this device that lends it a sturdy feel and when used in the closed configuration it is a little bit thick which means that it feels pretty secure in one unfortunately there's one big issue with this a lot of users out there might complain that a glass panel on the back gets really smudged up by one's fingerprints well that's the same case here except that glass panel is an actual display so the more you use this phone in this configuration the more you're just smudging up something that you potentially will be looking at so before we get into the experience of using a dual screen phone let's talk about the specifications and one of the reasons why I'm doing it this way is because the specifications are actually not the best the Snapdragon 820 one is what powers this with 4 gigabytes of RAM expandable storage beyond the included 64 gigabytes and a 30 180 milliamp hour battery we've seen plenty of other phones this year with single screens have 6 gigabytes of RAM or even 8 gigabytes of RAM and Rock the Snapdragon 835 so ZTE is kind of shooting itself in the foot for not trying to put the absolute best specifications in a phone that might have to pull double-time and as far as battery life is concerned using the phone in the close configuration with just one display brought about four hours of screen on time which is kind of typical for a full HD display phone like this however opening up the device and using it as much as I could throughout the day in a dual screen fashion kind of cut that battery life in half and it kind of tickled me a little bit how much that made sense I got about two and a half hours of screen on time when I was trying to use the phone as much as possible with both screens so let's get the camera out of the way as well because it is made up of just one unit that is above the main display a 20 megapixel shooter that lacks a number of enhancements that are kind of necessary for most flagship cameras the main issue here is the lack of optical image stabilization the app does feature quite a few different modes and is actually somewhat robust in its manual mode but unfortunately it's a bit of a pain to have to flip the phone around every single time when you want to take a selfie or just a regular photo but the problem is that this shooter while seemingly powerful on paper just doesn't get the job done without stabilization pictures had blur in all but the brightest conditions alongside this main issue is the cameras trouble with dynamic range even with HDR on the lack of stabilization also shows in video capture where shakiness tends to break the otherwise decent 4k capture while it can be a decent shooter in the brightest of conditions the way it falls apart and even medium lighting is hard not to look at the rest of the phone is fairly standard including headphone jack and a speaker that is powered by Dolby Atmos it's not the best speaker out there in terms of sound quality but it does get decently loud so if you're sharing content with one other person for example in the tent formation that you're seeing here well you might have a pretty good time sharing content with them this tent configuration and using the mirrored mode so you can show the exact same thing on either display is one of the cooler aspects of using a dual screen phone like the ax on em but how about all of the other uses for a dual screen device all those possibilities are designated by the M in the soft key bar which changes the display mode it is actually possible to only use the left screen even when the phone is unfolded there's also a stretched mode where both screens in portrait are used as one big canvas a mirrored mode like I just said for the 10 formation and finally a dual mode where either screen can be used independently for multitasking now for the kind of user that quite literally wants to dual monitor Android this is the only device that can do it and multitasking is definitely a good thing to do on two screens of the axon M for power users out there who want to be able to do as much as possible at the same time well here's an example I'm reading my script over on the left and then here is YouTube on the right showing a piece of video content it's something that I did very often with this and there a couple of other scenarios where this multitasking was actually fun and came in handy one of my favorite tasks has been for gaming in this example I used Final Fantasy 9 I promise I'm gonna finish it eventually on the main screen while the secondary display showed a walkthrough that I referenced whenever I got stuck one of the issues I did get into sometimes was Android pulling focus with an app like YouTube that is made to work in the background if you have YouTube right especially it will continue to play no matter what however if you have something like Netflix clicking on the Netflix panel will then pull focus from the other application and vice-versa meaning that the Netflix video might actually pause when you're doing something on the other screen in another mode both displays can be used together as a whole canvas as the software stretches applications out and you can force this on pretty much any app this is the most interesting but ultimately the most flawed approach however where on the one hand you have the double screen real estate but on the other hand there is a distracting line of bezel that cuts right down the middle another thing I did notice with the display is that the second display plays a little bit of catch-up with the first display if you're scrolling up and down applications like Reddit for an example you can see that there's a tie tiny fraction of a second delay on the right screen as you're scrolling on the left one it doesn't really destroy the experience of using this display however it is something that you can't unsee once you notice it this extended mode definitely has a bit of a WOW factor but even those people that were impressed by it when I first showed them it got a little bit annoyed by those same nagging issues the second time around and that's kind of the story of this device I later realize that what I was doing here was tolerating some of the bigger issues and those issues all had to go back to the same reason the software not even mentioning the fact that the performance specifications don't lend themselves to the best multitasking in general the software turned out to be less equipped for the task it comes down to that lack of attention to detail for example why not make it so that the phone could be used in a single screen mode but switch to either display at will so you can flip it around or when in the stretched configuration why does Instagram require the phone to be in landscape mode all the time even when auto rotate is off and while we're added why is the original multi-window Android function disabled even when using the single screen maybe I don't want to unfold the device but I still want to be able to multitask a little bit and even better imagine the possibility of having three or even four applications open at once even if the specifications are already kind of cut at the knees so if you have include into it by now the ZTE axon M is a story of trade-offs you get two screens on here and multitasking could be a joy on here but it requires users to adapt and to have a lot of patience now we give ZT a lot of credit for even making this device and we really wanted to like it but putting an extra screen on a phone like this doesn't really change things if you don't work on the core experience first and that in a nutshell is the problem with the ZTE axon M now if you're looking for this kind of form factor this kind of multitasking this kind of experience specifically then that's fine but for everybody else having a phone like this is just not going to dramatically change your existing Android life as always thank you guys very much for watching and hope you enjoyed this review of the ZTE axon M now I know I sounded a little bit harsh on the phone in this review but the first dual screen smartphone comes with a lot of expectations and the fact that the X on em doesn't really meet most of those expectations hit a little bit harder than we expected it to still we'd like the device we think it's a great concept and we're excited to see what comes next and if you really want multitasking the axe on em just might be the phone that you're looking for even if it doesn't fulfill too much else otherwise but nonetheless you can stay tuned Sandra Authority for more about the axe on em and more about all of the flagships we've had in 2017 as we're drawing this year to a close so with that in mind happy

so the BlackBerry key one was a pretty successful smartphone for blackberry it brought the modern Android experience and combined it with the classic BlackBerry physical keyboard but it definitely wasn't a phone that appealed to everyone and not everyone wants a physical keyboard and that's where the brand new BlackBerry motion comes into play it basically takes everything that made the key one so great bumps up the specs in a few key areas and does away with the physical keyboard one thing that I really appreciate about blackberry right now is that they're not afraid to do things differently in an era where dual cameras bezel is displays and curvy sleek pebble like designs are all the rage the BlackBerry motion sort of bucks all those trends and it all starts with a phones design it's made completely out of metal so it's still very high quality and it feels great in the hand but it has completely flat sides and chamfered edges and it has a very sharp and angular look to it it's also a very asymmetrical design the top is rounded whereas the bottom is completely flat and the top forehead is a lot smaller than the bottom chin but the bottom chin is a lot bigger for good reason it has a front-facing fingerprint sensor designated by that blackberry logo and this is actually a physical clicking home button versus a solid state home button which I thought was a little bit interesting but it's also flanked by some really large capacitive keys which I liked a lot because some smartphones have really tiny capacitive keys and they're very hard to press so I appreciate that these keys are nice and large and they're really easy to find on the back side there's a faux carbon fiber pattern which not only looks really nice but it's also very soft to the touch and gives the phone a lot of grip the buttons on this phone are also really high quality they're made of metal so they're very clicky and tactile and they all live on the right side which I don't mind you have the volume rocker up top the power button in the middle and blackberry signature convenience key which has a nice Ridge texture to it but I kind of wish these buttons were in a slightly different order because when you hold the phone your thumb naturally rests on the convenience key instead of the power keys so I kind of wish the power button and the convenience key were swapped because blackberry motion doesn't have a physical keyboard taking up a ton of space that gives you a lot more room for a larger display so what you have here is a 5.5 inch LCD with 1080p resolution and it's not the most attention-grabbing display but it is a pretty good-looking screen it has vibrant colors good viewing angles and outdoor visibility is not really that big of an issue my biggest problem with the screen though is that it has this durability coating which is meant to protect the screen from scratches but it makes the screen really hard to keep clean from fingerprints and it's also very tacky to the touch it's almost as if there's a screen protector sitting on top of it even though it's just pure glass inside it has the same exact specs as the BlackBerry key one so Snapdragon 625 and 4 gigabytes of RAM and it's not the fastest performing phone it's not gonna blow you away in terms of benchmarks and yes you will notice the occasional stutter from time to time and certain applications like snapchat don't perform quite as smoothly as they do on other flagship smartphones but generally speaking it's a very good performing phone it still launches apps quickly and it still plays all the graphically demanding games extremely well so even though there are the occasional stutters I never felt like it broke the experience the biggest benefit to the Snapdragon 625 is the battery sipping properties and when you combine that with a huge 4000 milliamp hour battery you get a recipe for some very long lasting battery life and I love the battery life on the motion it easily last me a full two days with a consistent six hours of screen on time which is really impressive and that's even with pretty heavy usage with a lot of gaming a lot of YouTube watching a lot of viewing streams on Twitch so I really love the battery life on this thing there's no wireless charging though even though it has a non-metal backside but you do get the standard Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 whenever you need to fill up as far as hardware is concerned you'll be pretty happy to know that it does come with the headphone jack and it also has expandable storage via microSD if you need more and it's also ip67 water and dust resistant so it has all the bells and whistles of a 20-17 smartphone or at least all the bells and whistles that we would expect from a 20-17 smartphone the cameras on the BlackBerry motion are exactly the same as the cameras on the BlackBerry key1 so you have an 8 megapixel camera on the front a 12 megapixel camera on the rear and the camera itself is very simplistic you don't really get a whole lot of shooting modes outside of the basic stuff like panorama and slow motion video you're not gonna find any fancy background defocusing effects or portrait mode on this camera and the camera itself is just ok you can get some pretty nice-looking shots in well-lit or outdoor situations with vibrant colors great contrast and pretty nice detail but it's very quick to fall apart in low-light situations photos are very noisy very washed out and they're typically overexposed especially in the highlights and the camera is just very sluggish and low light it's slow to capture and it also constantly hunts for focus that it makes it very cumbersome to use in low-light my favorite part about any blackberry Android phone has to go to the software not only because it's really close to stock Android but also because BlackBerry's customizations are all really useful it starts with the BlackBerry hub which aggregates all of your social media your text messages your emails etc all into one place making it really easy to check so you're not jumping back and forth between multiple applications just to check all of your notifications there's also a lot of other really nice touches like the swipe up on app icons to open the apps widget and the privacy shade which basically blacks out your entire display except for a small little window to make it harder for other people to read what's on your screen and of course with this being a BlackBerry you get BlackBerry's best-in-class security software with DTEC which always ensures that your phone is secure and your data is always encrypted the biggest drawback to the BlackBerry motion right now is its limited availability it's currently only available in select markets like the Middle East and Canada no US availability just yet so hopefully that's coming soon but like I said the BlackBerry motion is a key one without a keyboard and a few upgraded specs and if that's exactly what you're looking for the BlackBerry motion is your answer let's just hope it comes to more regions sooner than later because it's a pretty awesome smartphone that I think a lot of people will want to get their hands on so that wraps up this review of the BlackBerry motion I hope you all enjoyed it and found it helpful if you did please give it a thumbs up down below we definitely appreciate it and subscribe

all scream all the time that was basically the philosophy behind the Xiaomi mean mix but now Xiaomi finds itself in a marketplace that might be a little bit oversaturated with small bezel designed phones that they kind of pioneered with their original device but now we have the sophomore attempt and we're here to review it because it's jar Trafigura what's going on everybody and this is our full review of this yummy me mix - now one of the first things that you will notice about this device is the screen and for good reason you still get a very high screen to body ratio on the Xiaomi me mix - and it's still one of the most pleasing devices to look at just like the original one was but once you look at what's around that display you find that quite a few things have actually changed mainly the size you have a 5.9 9 inch screen on here which makes the entire device that much smaller the curves that have been added to the me mix - might make the phone feel a little bit too familiar compared to other phones that have minimal bezels and we're going to harp on the grip of the device because the ceramic returns on the backing and it's still one of the best materials that we have ever felt on any smartphone and sámi is the main company that still uses it on their devices on that backing is the same finger parameter in a good spot and under it the me branding that keeps everything looking pretty minimal however the same compromise that helped this become a reality on the original me mix returns again and it's that large chin on the bottom that also includes the front-facing camera in probably one of the worst positions that we've used in any smart phone not only is it easy to cover up the camera with one's right hand it makes for an odd angle that selfie experts will not be too happy with sure the camera app tells the user to turn the phone around when it comes to taking a more conventional selfie but that's not something that you can do in apps like Instagram and snapchat but the vibration speaker that we didn't really like in the original me mix for the phone calls has been replaced with an actual phone speaker it's a small driver that points upward and it actually sounds so much better than last year's alternative so thus this phone addresses a couple of issues that made the original one a little bit less accessible however if you ask me this already pretty phone would have been made better if we could get our hands on the special edition the special edition of the me mix 2 comes with a ceramic unibody so that it doesn't have to cut the material to make room for a metal frame it's all ceramic wrapped that beautiful screen and then there's actually a version that is completely white which makes it one of the more unique devices that we've looked at in recent memory Xiaomi claimed that this white version is a lot like a perfect piece of jade and this is definitely the addition of the me mix to that I would rock because of its crazy good looks the size of the display makes it pretty good to handle though getting up and down the phone with Han gymnastics will still be part of the experience and brightness is pretty much where it should be for an IPS display when out in broad daylight you can change the color profile in the settings and there is a reading mode to sort of make things a little bit easier on your eyes especially during the nighttime honestly the only misstep when it comes to the screen here on the mix too is that it is still full HD plus resolution it would have been great to see quad HD on here because what we're looking at here are supposed to be one of C Ami's main flagships but keeping up with the flagship game is not tough when you look at the internals the Snapdragon 835 is accompanied with overachieving bits like six to eight gigabytes of RAM that come in at different price points storage is also not a problem for a phone that doesn't have a micro SD card slot as 64 128 or 256 gigabytes of internal storage are available so I really had no problem with everyday performance on the mix - zipping between applications despite the actual software itself being a little rough around the edges as this is a global ready phone Google Play services were pre-installed on this device so I could use it to its fullest extent here in the US more radios are in this phone than any other device in Android thus far which makes this a phone that you can use pretty much anywhere across the globe so when I use the phone on my t-mobile account I had no problems with calls and call quality on that GSM network sound in other situations is a bit of a mixed bag unfortunately without a headphone jack users are forced to use a USB type-c adapter to use wired headphones with the mix too but thankfully I do have my own solutions for that with a truly wireless set of earbuds but that wasn't really quite as upsetting as the external speaker outside in noisy environments this just didn't get loud enough and then if I lowered the volume to around 50% or below it felt like there was a noise gate there so that lower ends of the audio we're kind of getting cut off and it made for a really odd listening experience now one real bright spot to the original me mix was the battery life maybe it's because of the full HD plus resolution in the screen and also because of the upgraded internals but this 400 milliamp hour a unit was able to get me to five hours of screen on time without any issues and that was a pretty consistent metric and that screen on time was throughout the course of a 12 to 16 hour workday most of those days and of course you can charge the phone with quick charge 3.0 but it wasn't something I felt like I had to do at least in the middle of my days so that brings us to the camera experience which unfortunately Seon me kind of took the more conventional route when you see them kind of doing more experimental things with their other flagships well this doesn't really take into account the front-facing camera which is itself unconventional and like I said before just simply odd I do a lot of video calls these days and that was when I found the camera positioning to be far less than ideal on a number of different occasions I was told that I was basically looking away from them because the camera is down here and I was looking above at their face on the screen so it was a little bit distracting they admitted but also if I tried to look at the camera itself it also felt a little bit odd and most of the time if I'm holding the phone in a regular way I got a weird upward angle and I kind of think that Xiaomi knows that the positioning of the camera while unavoidable is kind of weird because they even made the camera optic black enough to blend in with the rest of the device now the rear camera is a 12 megapixel shooter that boasts 4 axis optical image stabilization and not too much else while the stabilization does help with some of the 4k video recording that I did and it helped a little bit in low-light shooting it's about the only thing that is special about this camera that said the app does have quite a few different modes and I found myself using the manual mode a little bit more often to try to get some stylized shots for example I wanted to get some light trails in these photos so I slowed the shutter speed down so pictures in general are pretty good though it's no surprise that it kind of falls apart in low-light the HDR captures another pet peeve of mine because it is a toggle rather than in auto mode but it does do a decent job of getting better exposure and adding a little bit of color to scenes even if it does make the shutters of file speeds a lot slower the main story here is that the camera did nothing to really blow me away some pictures and videos came out really well but the same amount of them kind of came out a bit subpar I'm inclined to say that the camera is average then especially since Xiaomi is trying harder with their other phones that have dual cameras and finally make it over to the software and the you eye which is rocking Android nougat as its base now if you have used the me UI at all before then you know that it doesn't have an app drawer and a lot of users kind of find that a little bit hard to get used to but if you have used the me UI before not a whole lot has changed that said there are quite a few features at the new UI can boast like the quick ball it's a small convenient way of getting to the core functions of the phone without relying on the soft keys there's also the dual app which allows for multiple instances of the same application and you can take that even further by putting an entirely different second space on the phone for an entirely different experience on top of the one you already setup now the main issues that I have with the software are ones that I've seen before just like the features I just mentioned and mainly the biggest issue I have with the me UI is that it requires a little bit more polish parts of the OS don't seem to be completely finished or properly translated from Chinese and the notifications in particular are a bit off overall the me UI has come a long way and continues to be supported by the user forum community meaning that updates can come quickly but after one maybe two generations of flagships from Xiaomi I'm a little bit miffed to see that the me UI hasn't drastically changed which makes me think it's just simply not ready for primetime in the West if you are going to get your hands on this device and so there you have it the Xiaomi me mix 2 while I'm still excited to be able to use a ceramic phone again and it is another me mix unfortunately the luster of the original device has kind of worn off by now if you really want it to stand out from the crowd maybe the best way to do it is to spring for the special edition of the phone which will come in at around seven hundred and twenty dollars u.s. when converted from Chinese currency now consider that for a second that the special edition white ceramic one is seven hundred and twenty dollars u.s. the six gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes internal storage version is almost $600 making it over three hundred dollars less than plenty of the flagships we're seeing now that get close to $1,000 in price so see ami still does have that feather in its cap the fact that its phones are still about as affordable as they possibly can be so depending on your stance regarding the lower resolution display the single camera and the Chinese software experience this might be one hell of a steal and thus we want to blame you if you wanted to go back to the phone that got us all wanting all screen all the time you simply just have to find a way to get your hands on one let us know what you think of the me mix too and don't forget to drop some likes on this video and to subscribe to the channel if you

in this video we take a look at ten of the best products that we saw at CES 2018 imagine a world where your smartphone powers your laptop now why would you need that well as our smartphones get more powerful fewer and fewer people need a larger computer but a full keyboard and a bigger screen can be helpful and that is why Razer with their project Linda is trying to merge the razor phone into one of their larger laptop concepts you simply slide the razor phone into a trackpad area of the customized razor blade stealth chassis and it automatically starts powering the laptop you almost get a one-to-one view of what you would be seeing on your Android phone but you can use the screen of the razor phone as the touchpad Razer plans on making the laptop display mirror the 120 Hertz quad HD display of the razor phone that way you can get high resolution playback of pretty much any piece of media and you'll be able to have a much larger canvas in order to do all of your work and play there are a few use cases here including using the larger apparatus as a way of finishing projects that you originally started on the razor phone or while the razor phone is docked it can play a video while you're getting that work done on the bigger screen sure it's just a concept for now but it's a really cool one speaking of concepts we finally have a tangible example of what an under glass fingerprint sensor would look like now we know that they were becoming this year but vivo started it off with a partnership with synaptics this wafer-thin optical sensor sits just between the display glass and the actual all LED panel and Peaks through the pixels in order to register your prints wake the screen and a small portion on the bottom of the phone will tell you where to land your fingerprint synaptics ensures that clear ID is just as secure as current sensors that you might find on plenty of other smartphones but it is marginally slower in practice if you're able to get past that slight delay you'll also realize that nothing about the phone needs to change in order for you to still have fingerprint security so for certain phones this might be the way that we can get all screen all the time by not having to cut the bottom in order to have a fingerprint sensor home button no matter what your opinions may be on smart watches it's good to see that Skagen is coming out with their first touchscreen enabled smart watch on top of all of their already great hybrid offerings the Scoggin falster runs Android wear but it also looks incredibly nice because of this minimalistic design that it's Skagen is known for now it is missing a few features that other Android wear vices bring to the table like a heart rate monitor built-in GPS and LTE connectivity but if you're looking for a classy smart walk shot also doesn't break the bank well the Scogin falster might be one of the prettiest and smooth uh smartwatches that we've seen so far VR is still running strong and this daydream VR headset is a standalone unit from Lenovo The Mirage Isola is powered by the Snapdragon 835 with four gigabytes of RAM and microSD expansion is available you still get the daydream controller and to seven hours of battery life and six degrees of freedom all without cables or even a smartphone it also has a much better weight distribution because it's not hindering itself on the weight of the smartphone so that it feels a lot more comfortable than plenty of other daydream headsets Lenovo is tentatively pricing it at under $400 and it will go on sale in quarter two of this year at first there was Google wallets and then there was Android pay and up until now they have been living side by side we're awarding Google pay a best of CES 2018 award because well Google is starting so finally understand mobile payments and also they're starting to understand proper naming conventions our next award goes to a potential competitor to the one plus 5t the honor view 10 sports a six inch full HD plus display has the Kiran a 90-70 processor six gigabytes of RAM and dual 12 and 20 megapixel cameras making it a beast on the spec sheet and at CES 2018 honor just announced that it's coming to the United States we were already impressed with the view 10 during our brief hands-on time and pricing availability might still be on the way but we expect this phone to launch at around five hundred dollars adding to an already good library of honor phones that are pretty affordable watch out for this phone in 2018 one of the biggest stories coming out of CES 2018 is the fact that Google assistant is appearing on so many different devices and that includes smart displays now these displays are supposed to be Amazon echo shows biggest competitors we've already seen a couple from Lenovo but this is one we're really excited about made by JBL there's an eighth inch of 720p display two front-facing 10 watt speakers a rear-facing passive radiator for even deeper bass along with support for 24-bit HD audio streaming the only unfortunate part about the JBL link view is that you're going to be able to buy one this summer we can't wait to get our hands on it and you can stay tuned for our review of it once we're able to use it during those summer months let's not forget a putting Google into your big TVs with Android TV you now have the Asus rogue PG 65 what is being considered a big format gaming display this is a 65 inch 4k g-sync Android TV with 120 Hertz refresh rates ultra-low latency and has a Nvidia shield built-in now the price will no doubt be high when it goes on sale but considering that it means you don't need a gaming monitor and then a smart TV also you put the boat together it might end up seeming kind of reasonable and of course you'll be able to play PC games on it as a monitor or just jump into the actual shield that's built in and be able to play any other games that you want from your couch rather than your desk there are a lot of

hello I'm Gary sim from Andrew authority do you want to know about the snapdragon 845 well let me explain so call comic just had their technical summit in Hawaii and we've just been getting all the great new details about the next year's flagship system on a chip that's the Snapdragon 800 and 45% during eight four five so what is it well first of all it is a 64-bit system on a chip that's going to be found in Android phones and also probably in Windows laptops and we'll talk a lot more about that in a moment now inside of it there are lots and lots of different components that's what a system on a chip means it's not just a CPU in there you've also got a GPU you've got an image processor for the camera you've got a DSP for doing signal processing and also for doing some heavy computation like neural network stuff you've got security you've got all the connectivity modem and of course Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and that's all built into just one chip so looking at some of the components individually it's start with the CPU know the CPU in the snapdragon 845 is the cryo 385 now it's built on cortex technology that means that Qualcomm have taken a core design or two core designs from arm and then they have tweaked them a little bit maybe some of the internals may be in how it fits into the rest of the chip that lay out physically on the on the silicon and then they've allowed to brand that as their own chip design which in this case of the cryo 3 8 5 now it's probably that it is the cortex a 75 and the cortex a 55 now if you remember the court is a 75 and a 55 are the two new core designs from arm that used dynamic and the great thing about dynamic is that these cores are now together in the same cluster which means they can share a lot of the same buses and all of the same input and outputs to the rest of the chip without having to be separate and then kind of working independently now here we've got four high-performance cores caught it's a 75 cores running at 2.8 gigahertz and we've got for power efficiency causes the cord it's a 55 running at 1.8 gigahertz so each of the cores have l1 cache and l2 cache the l2 on the bigger cause is slightly larger 256 K per core and is 128 K per core for the a 55 power efficiency cause but beneath that there is an L 3 cache of 2 megabytes now that l3 cache of 2 megabytes works across just the cause it doesn't work across the GPU and the DSP as well so what Qualcomm has added in another layer of caching which they're calling system cache which is a further 3 megabytes and that means that when the CPU and the GPU want to talk to each other that data can be cached on chip without having to go out to main memory looking at the main memory is slow because these are all relative terms so we made up all that caching 3 megabytes across the system core and then 2 megabytes across the l3 cache and then l2 cache with one megabyte for the high performance cause half a megabyte for the power efficiency cause that's six and a half megabytes of cache excluding the l1 caches now that's a significant amount of cache and that's going to be part of the reason why they've managed to bump up the performance here by 30% of course also the a 75 and a 55 are much more much more faster performant than the previous generation anyway but a 30% increase in distilling it's not as much cash as you find in the 11 Bionic however we're getting close to that kind of level now if you think about a 30% performance increase that's absolutely amazing if I said to you that you could buy a new car or a new television or a new microwave that in its measure of performance it was 30% better than the last model that that's pretty impressive now talking about memory for a moment this system on a chip uses LP low power ddr4 it runs at 1.8 gigahertz and you can have a maximum of 8 get gigabytes in a snapdragon 845 phones we're not going to see any 16 gigabyte phones next year and looking at the GPU that comes in the Snapdragon 845 it's the Adreno 630 Qualcomm asset and the next generation they've done a lot of work from the ground up to build this new GPU it's 30% greater performance while using 30 less power which is quite amazing and also it has a 2.5 times a display throughput so significant gains in both the CPU and the GPU performance so the DSP in the subject in eight four five is the latest generation hexagon DSP it does more than just digital signal processing and also do lots of vector calculations it's a third generation of vector engine inside this DSP and Qualcomm are positioning this for all of their neural network processing so it doesn't have a dedicated NPU or neural engine they're saying you can do this on their DSP and so that's in the DSP support all the common neural networking frameworks including tensorflow light and also now support halide that programming language that's being used for image processing which you'll find also in google's pixel to smartphone and the update this will enable that of course was in android oreo 8.1 and then also you've got the spectra 280 ISP which is the image signal processor which of course is used when data comes from the camera how you protis all that information and turn it into movie files and JPEG files that we all like to use now the spec the new spectra is pay can record 4k at 60 frames a second that's a lot of bandwidth they put in there it supports a 10-bit color gamut for video recording so you can actually record in this new HDR mode which will give you ten bits of color and also it can do 480 frames per second slo-mo but only in 720p now the the new DSP in the ISP actually present a problem for Samsung funnily enough because now that there's so much extra stuff going on on the Qualcomm s SOC not just a CPU and a GPU boot got these extras that are doing a lot of multimedia work a lot of processing work a lot of neural network stuff what happened when Samsung want to release their next phone and some of them are using Samsung's Exynos chips and some of them are using Qualcomm's where are they going to draw the line for the lowest common denominator that's going to be a real pro bar coding problem we'll see what Samsung released next year and see whether they've kind of chipped down taken down the Qualcomm processor a peg or two so you can't do this fantastic slow mode or you can't do 10-bit color recording if their new occipital supported we don't know yet so we instance to see what they come out with the new external chip - because these two have to work side by side in two versions of the s9 or the note 9 or whatever samsung release also built onto the chip is called comms acoustic chip and that's acoustic a cue stick acoustic and that supports apdex aptX which of course is the bluetooth codec from kokum which delivers greater audio quality than the standard Bluetooth codec and talking about you've also got bluetooth true Wireless which is a proprietary standard from Qualcomm that allowed two Bluetooth streams to come independently to maybe a left ear bug on a right earbud and they both come independently from the phone rather than one being the master and it kind of copying the information over to the other one and what we're talking about Bluetooth is also full support for Bluetooth five built into the Snapdragon 805 three more things worth mentioning one is that it's also got the new X 20 LTE category 18 modem which means it has a potential download speeds of 1.2 gigabits per second a lot of people get very excited about the LTE modems I don't quite get so excited because it really does depend on what your carrier provides and while these manufacturers are able every year to bring out a new phone and bring out a new modem it's a bigger difference to change a whole country or a whole state to have the latest LTE network on it so we're always kind of a few generations behind what the actual phones can manage however for the future that's a really good sign the sse also supports quick charge for which is qualcomm ladies quick charging technology and it's backwardly compatible with USB power delivery and if you want to know what mirrors be power delivery is then please do check out my video on this channel where I go into great detail about what it actually can do for us as consumers and the last component worth mentioning is the new security processing unit that's basically a way of kind of keeping things like fingerprint data and passwords and all education process is very separate from the cpu so even if some kind of malware managed to get on to the low levels of your CPU here's now another barrier that protects this biometric information and protects your digital information it actually has its own CPU probably a cortex m3 it runs its own little operating system and the CPU will talk to it and say hey let's do some authentication here and it's a separate entity so overall I'm pretty impressed with what the Sundering 845 is offering in terms of the specifications got the latest CPU or using dynamic from arm you've got the latest GPU from quark on themselves and on top of that you've got the DSP and the ISP and the acoustic chip audio processor and then you've got the security processor you've got access to eight gigabytes of lpddr4 Ram it looks really really impressive cause we won't know how impressive it truly is until we see phones launched next year but talking of phones being launched Qualcomm did make it very clear that this chip is optimized for Android and for Windows running on arm so with this year we've just seen the launch of the laptops running Windows on the snapdragon 835 and next year absolutely we're gonna see laptops running windows on the snapdragon 845

even though it's only ten days away from the official announcement of the s nine we're still getting new leaks and rumors so we needed an update just like I need a new mango lassi now if there is reasonable truth of these following rumors I think Samsung is making a smart play by trying to please both the geeks and the sheep according to Koreans et News the leak claims that the galaxy s 9 will have the ability to make 3d emoticons using the front facing camera the an emoji feature of the iPhone X was one of the most talked about features of the phone so it's no surprise that this has made its way over to Samsung's upcoming flagship it's basically a feature that creates 3d emojis using the facial expressions of the user the name of Samsung's version of the feature is currently unknown but that's for the Sheep for geeks there are rumored dual stereo speakers now let's talk pricing and it's gonna hurt according to a leaked from phone arena the s9 should start at approximately 884 dollars to 920 dollars u.s. by comparison the galaxy s 8 began at eight hundred and twenty five dollars so it looks like we might see anywhere between a fifty to a hundred dollar increase from last year's model and for those of you who are new to this leaks and rumor game let's review what we think is under the hood the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and s 9 plus won't have any major upgrades over their predecessors according to a report from VentureBeat they'll come with the same curved displays as the s8 series this means we'll see a five point eight inch and 6.2 inch Super AMOLED panels with qhd+ resolution and an 1859 aspect ratio ET news reports that both the s 9 and s 9 plus will use Y octa display technology which integrates the touch layer in the encapsulation layer of the OLED display rather than using a distinct film type layer like older generations of Samsung displays why octa was only used on the samsung galaxy s 8 but with the new generation both the s 9 and s 9 plus will take advantage of it y octa displays our thinner have better optical properties and a reportedly 30% cheaper to manufacture the galaxy s 9 plus is said to have 2 gigabytes of RAM more than its smaller brother will have six gigabytes versus four gigabytes it might also feature a dual camera setup while the s9 should only have a single shooter on the back but let's talk about the variable aperture shall we an image of an alleged to Galaxy S nine retail box which you can see here gives us additional info regarding the specs of the s9 it suggests that the camera could have a 12 megapixel sensor with oh is and variable aperture that's an f-stop of 1.5 for low-light shots and 2.4 when there's more light available we've already seen this technology on Samsung's high-end flip phone called the W 2018 which launched back in December you can check out what the variable aperture looks like here so what do you guys think good great not so much well I think you can expect huge leaps of innovation every year they really want to take advantage of the tech that they already have unless of course Apple really pushes them and paints them into a corner but the camera is a different thing that camera is making changes in every flagship every year right I mean pretty much every manufacturer really wants to push that camera technology the design may stay the same the specs may stay relatively the same but that camera has got to keep marching forward let me know what you guys think in the comments below or on Twitter I will be reading them see you in the next one know if you want to get serious about branding yourself online our sponsor domain comm is over 300 domain name extension to fit your needs from comm tech club two dots pace and the guys of domain comm love the Android Authority audience so much they're showing their love by giving you 15% off an already really good price for domain names web hosting or email use our coupon code Android at domain.com check out when you think domain names think domain.com I'm not sponsored by MC dairy but MC Jerry you want to hook a brother up I will make you famous and you'll make me fatter 
hello there I'm garrison from Andrew authority now you've probably heard about these sort of CPU problems that we've got moment will melt down and spectra and so the question is what is the fundamental problem with today's CPUs that it's causing all of these problems well let me explain now of course you can read some really fantastic details on the neck about the real nitty-gritty of what the problems are but really what I want to do is explain it to you in the simplest possible terms and try not to kind of get too deep into the technically but to understand what this fundamental problem is and why really CPU design going forward and that's probably CPUs we're gonna see launched in 2019 onwards are really gonna have to have change the way they work at a very fundamental level so we're gonna do this in four stages and let's try to get through this simply number one and normal computer has a set of instructions that it follows load up this number from memory add one to it put that result back into memory and it's just basically a sequence of instructions and that's how computers work now I've got a whole video on instructions per cycle which would go much deeper into the things I'm going to talk about pipelines and decoding and all that so if you want to watch that and I recommend you do of course I would say that I'd recommend you watch all my videos okay but here's the link to that you really should go and watch that now what happens is is that when computers do these instructions we it's actually pretty obvious that it doesn't do them just one at a time it doesn't just load that thing and then wait around while the others are doing nothing because today's computers are so fast that actually the CPU can run faster than it can take to get memory information so in that time it's waiting something come back for a memory it's actually just sitting there saying well nothing to do now so what they decide to do is split up the execution of instructions into a thing called a pipeline and the instructions come down the pipeline and each little bit of the pipeline is a tiny bit step closer to actually executing the instruction and they kind of the the easiest way to show that is that you basically do a fetch sex next instruction from memory you decode it to actually work out what it is and then you execute and that would be a three-stage pipe but actually the pipes can get much longer you get 10 11 12 stage pipes in modern CPUs now as it's going along it's becoming a step closer to actually executing the the thing and the the actual instruction when it's finally executing the registers has changed and the state changes inside the CPU that said that the instructions have been retired that means it's actually been always through that pipe drops on the end of the pipe and it's actually been executed actually been retired now that's all great if programs just ran in a straight line is they just kept running from one instruction one instruction to talk to the three hallway raid down and never ever jumped anywhere never branched off to another place that pipeline would be fantastic the problem is computers branch all over the place all the time it's one of their main things they do for example if you say you had a game and the little character was bouncing along and it gets to the edge of the screen at some book you say if he's at the edge of the screen then do something different you know bounce him back the other way or he dies because he dropped off the edge of the chasm so at some point there has to be a thing in the program it says if this thing has happened they branch off here and do a different bit of code now if you think about if the computers been filling up its pipeline with all the instructions that are coming ahead of it and then suddenly the computer branches off now all those instructions in that pipeline are no longer needed and that means they have to be emptied out of the pipeline completely cleared out and they call that having a bubble in the pipeline like an air bubble stuck in your pipeline because there's now a void where nothing actually happens and the computer has to wait around until it gets in the next set of instructions that are actually where the the program jumped to now to try to reduce the number of bubbles and reducing the number of bubbles is seen as one of the most important things you can do to increase performance they have a thing called a branch predictor now the branch predictor says actually which way is the program going to jump in three instructions time it's gonna jump is it going to jump back up on itself to keep on repeating or is it going to jump off somewhere completely different than the branch predicted tries to find out where the program's going to go and then in doing that it loads up the instructions ahead of it where it thinks to program is going to go and therefore when it does jump the right instructions are already in the pipeline and there's no bubble brilliant but there's a problem with this approach and that is is that instructions can be executed or half executed half-baked half travelling down the pipeline that I never used and they get discarded but if that that process of discarding them was completely atomic with completely black a box had no effect on the rest of the CPU then it would be greatly doesn't because in the moment that it has to fetch something from memory even though these structures never been executed it preemptively it's kind of ahead of itself is speculating what it needs it goes it gets that memory and it brings it in and in doing so it alters the cache now I've got a whole video on cache memory cache memories fast memory that's at the same space in the same space as the CPUs you can run very very fast and there's a link here to go and find out about cache memory and this is our fourth point the side channel access is that the cache can be altered and then doing some very clever stuff with timers you can go and get the same piece of information again and then if it took a long time you knew what was there if it didn't take a long time you knew that it wasn't in the cache and that basically means you can use this kind of a secret backdoor to examine the cache and take out things from there from instructions that were never executed and because they were never executed the checks on whether they're allowed to be executed whether that memory is actually accessible or not we're never done that means you can start trolling through the computer memory other users parts of the kernel whatever you like taking out passwords taking up cryptic every keys taking out whatever you like because the check to whether the program was actually allowed to do it or not he's never done until the instruction is actually executed and because the program the instruction is never executed because it's all disregarded then the printer computers at all I didn't do anything wrong I I've not broken any access barriers here I have not given you access to anything you should have actually I never actually read that instruction but it did in its pipeline and then by using these cache timing tricks you can work out what was in the cache and hence the whole memory becomes that available to any program and that's the fundamental problem I'm going since

hey Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and this is the 1 + 5 T now the reason why you're seeing an initial review right now is because we've used this phone for enough time to bring you some very positive thoughts on 1 + is best device yet however we wanted to spend a little bit more time getting to know the camera and also putting it up against some of the other flagships in the game now you're going to see a follow-up review sometime after this one and we're going to give you as much information as we can in the video you're watching right now so starting off with the design the 1 + 5 t obviously takes a number of cues from the original 1 + 5 the main change of course is that entire screen on the front you don't have any element except for a display on the front with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio and that means that the fingerprint reader that used to be below the screen is now on the back this fingerprint reader might be in a location that some people don't find ideal but it is still one of the fastest fingerprint readers out there just tap on the ceramic sensor and you'll be able to get the phone unlocked in fractions of a second there is another way of unlocking the device and it is the face unlock and it's kind of scary quick just have your face data be put into the phone using the outline in the settings and then when you're looking at the phone at least the camera should recognize that your face is in front of the phone when you hit the power button it's going to basically unlock straight into the UI the angle of recognition also seems to be pretty wide so I could have the phone wake up away from my face and then slowly move in you can tell exactly one it recognizes that my face is in front of it the security of the face unlock is a little bit questionable for some users but at least one plus does put a disclaimer that face unlock is not as secure as passwords or the fingerprint unlock now around the device you solve all the same bits and pieces including the alert slider which is one of the unique features oneplus has over any other phone in the market today the AMOLED display is doing a great job so far and having so much of it on the front has been an absolute joy it adds to the eye candy effect because colors are punched out pretty well so that all of the oneplus wallpapers that they put into the 5t are so good that I could pick any one of them and it would make the phone look wonderful text has also been enjoyed to read on this device not only because of the trademarked oneplus slate font which we are fans of but also because oxygen OS does a good job of tuning the text so it doesn't bloat out on a full HD resolution screen of this size if there is one thing I wish oneplus did with this AMOLED display it's make the ambient bleh be and always on display the way that oxygen shows its ambient display is one of the more attractive ones out there and I wish it was available at all times the only other change here is in terms of the camera not just the fact that there isn't a telephoto lens on there anymore but the fact that the camera bump is coming out a little bit more this time it's still nestled in the corner and you might be scared of scratching it from time to time if you slide your phone on services but we don't think it's that big of a deal now since we're on the topic of the camera we can talk about that for a bit there's no telephoto lens on here anymore like with the 1+5 so you don't have optical zoom capabilities instead you have a secondary 20 megapixel RGB sensor that tries to use groups of four pixels in order to absorb more light for low-light shots now we're spending more time with the camera to see just how it fares in the overall flagship space and one of the things that we did already was put it up against the pixel to now portrait modes aside what we see here is that Google's own algorithmic procedures in post-processing still yield a better looking shot that's not necessarily the case with the 1 + 5 t instead it does a pretty good job of enhancing the photo but doesn't quite get all the way there the way the pixel 2 does that said in regular - even really bright light situations we had a really good time with the 1 + 5 t thus far and underneath the surface you get the same specifications - with a snapdragon 835 and 6 gigabytes of RAM in the base model but you can still tear through a gigabytes of RAM if you pay a little bit extra money you also get upgraded storage there at 128 gigabytes as compared to the 64 gigabytes of storage in the base model the final bit of hardware is of course the battery 3300 milliamp hours is what you get here just like in the original 1 + 5 and having a larger screen might bring down the battery life but so far that hasn't been the case I was able to get 5 hours of screen on time on average on days when I was listening to a lot of music through Bluetooth earbuds getting navigation done and also using mobile networks but on a day that I was just using Wi-Fi for the majority of the time I was able to get over 6 hours of screen on time which is really impressive and of course the high quality accessories that come with the phone include the - charging cable and the plug adapter which helped to get the phone back up to speed in no time so the rest of the change is what the 1 plus 5 team might seem kind of subtle but I would argue that they are some of the most significant changes yet and is in the software you have the newest version of oxygen OS here and it's a version that hasn't made it onto the original one +5 yet it might get there eventually but for now this is the best version of oxygen that we've seen ever the best way for me to describe this current version of oxygen OS is through a phrase I used to use all the time simplistically elegant there's virtually no bloatware on here except for an application that gets you straight to the oneplus community and then there are a number of features that show that oneplus has put a lot of attention to detail in here one such feature is the parallel apps feature which is new to this version of oxygen and to the 1 + 5 t you're able to have two different versions of most social media applications including snapchat which is probably the main one to use here because many of the social media apps that you're seeing have multiple account support there are some returning favorites here like the Reading Mode which is a personal favorites it makes the display go black and white a lot like an ePaper display on a Kindle so if you actually use the Amazon Kindle app it's going to be one of the best ways of using it aside from actually owning a Kindle it also works for scrolling applications and websites it's just a lot easier in the eyes and makes this a better reading experience aside from that you also have the app folders which have that nice little header with the red line underneath that you can also change in the settings because you can customize what the accent colors are and it comes all the way down to even one plus his own trademarked slate font it doesn't look that much better than Roboto but what I did notice is that it utilizes the space even better and also fun fact not only does it look good it makes Android auto look good as well because it actually shows when I plug it into my GTI whereas oneplus devices in the past might have been reliable speedy and had great performance due to high-end specifications the software just lacked that little bit of polish that just took away from the overall experience just that nagging little bit this time around though the oxygen OS on the 1 + 5 T is just one of the best-looking ones and it does have that level of polish and it just makes this software a joy to use and so there you have it's the one plus 5t in our initial review here now we tried to give you a lot of information as to the experience of using the 1 plus 5t and if you can't tell by now we have very positive feelings about it the battery life is really great and the AMOLED displayed despite being full HD resolution does a great job of providing a high-end experience nonetheless even though this is just our initial review we would still wholeheartedly recommend the 1 plus 5t already the camera is already performing pretty well and the main thing we want to highlight is that it's 499 dollars for what feels like a phone that should cost even more than that now that's not necessarily something that we've been able to say about oneplus for a while it doesn't really hit the 349 price point of the high-end oneplus one from back in the day but then again very few phones do that these days anyway this is the closest that we're going to get to an affordable flagship that does a great job of keeping up with the pack at the very least it's a healthy and very welcome addition to the oneplus family and the 5 T might actually make one plus five owners rethink their purchase you might be a little bit miffed that you didn't wait out for this one but at least it's here now and you might strongly consider upgrading as always thank you guys very much for watching and we hope you enjoyed this initial review of the one plus 5t now we're going to be spending a little more time with the camera and you'll be seeing other videos and other pieces of content on android authority comm regarding the camera especially in comparison to phones like the pixel and the note 8 so you can stay tuned to andrew authority for that and even more because we are your source for all things Android 
so this is the LGB 30 this is LG's big flagship for the second half of 2017 and the LGV series of smartphones has always been about photography videography and audio and that's what makes the LGB 30 so exciting and we'll get into all that stuff but first let's get all the basic smartphone stuff out of the way starting off with these specs you have a snapdragon 835 processor 4 gigabytes of RAM and it also comes with 64 gigs of internal storage standard but there's also a plus model which will vary by region that comes with a hundred and twenty eight gigabytes of internal storage but there's also a micro SD card slot if you need more now as far as performance goes it's very fast it performs just as well as you would expect for a flagship phone it's fast its fluid it's very responsive it's fast to launch apps it's quick to multitask it's also really good at playing graphically intensive games without any stuttering or slowdown so I've had no issues with the performance of the V 30 it performs extremely well in day-to-day use and even in heavy use like most phones that we're seeing in 2017 the LG v 30 is water and dust resistant it's IP 68 which means it's protected for up to one and a half meters for up to 30 minutes so this means you can use it in the rain or drop it in a puddle of water and it'll be perfectly fine the fingerprint sensor of the V 30 is on the back and it's nice and centered so it's easier to reach with your index finger and it's a very fast and accurate fingerprint sensor I haven't had any issues with it but what I really enjoy about LG's implementation with their fingerprint sensor is that it also doubles as the power key and this is something that LG has been doing for a while now and I kind of really wish that more manufacturers would adopt this feature like previous LG V Series smartphones the V 30 is military 810g transit drop compliant which means it's much more durable against drops but I still don't recommend dropping this phone because it's a really pretty looking phone now unlike the v10 and V 20 which arguably had a more industrial and more unique design the V thirty's design is a little bit more elegant and more mainstream and is very similar to a lot of smartphones in terms of design and what we're seeing in 2017 so it has glass in the front glass on the back and a metal frame that wraps around the sides and I really like the design of the v30 I think it's a very good-looking phone it feels extremely comfortable in the hand as well with the rounded corners and the slightly tapered back the glass back obviously does mean that it collects a lot of fingerprints but that's just sort of to be expected when you have a phone that's made predominantly of glass this new design also means that the battery is no longer removable which to me is not that big of deal and battery life on the LGB 30 has been extremely good it has a pretty decently sized 3300 milliamp hour battery which has been enough to get me through a full day whether I'm using the phone more casually with a lot of texting web browsing and social media maybe a couple YouTube videos here and there or even if I'm using it really heavily and playing a lot of games watching a lot of YouTube taking a lot of photos it still lasts me comfortably all day and screen on time typically hovered around the 5 hour mark on the front LG has made some pretty significant changes to the display it is now a six inch OLED display with quad HD resolution and an aspect ratio of 18 by 9 LG is calling this the full efficient display which is really just a fancy buzzword for a screen that goes edge to edge and has really thin bezels around all sides now the 6 inch screen may sound really massive but because of the thinner bezels and the aspect ratio that makes that screen less wide it actually doesn't feel like a 6 inch screen smart phone in your hand the screen itself looks absolutely gorgeous and I'm really happy that LG has gone back to using OLED the screen is very vibrant and colourful it has great viewing angles it's pretty easy to see outdoors as well and everything just looks incredible on this display and the corners are rounded just like it was on the g6 but they're actually properly rounded this time whereas the g6 looked a little bit funky but this is a beautiful looking screen and can easily give Samsung a run for its money it is that good of a screen the other big difference with the v30 screen is that it no longer has a secondary display like they'd be 10 and the b20 did and because the secondary display is gone now it's actually been replaced with a software feature called the floating bar and I actually like this a lot better because the floating bar can be repositioned to where you can easily reach it whereas the secondary display it was always at the top or was kind of hard to get to and it was little bit uncomfortable and the floating bar does all the same stuff that the secondary screen did so you still have access to app shortcuts click contacts meeting controls etc and because it's a software feature you can actually disable it if you don't want it whereas the secondary display you are pretty much stuck with it whether you liked it or not the rest of the software is pretty typical LG the icons are still very bright and colorful and the whole entire UI is still somewhat cartoony and there's still some weird animations like the stretch effect that you get from swiping between home screen to home screen but you can however switch things up a bit with the theme engine and sort of change up the look and feel of the UI if you don't like the way it looks by default and something I also really enjoy with the v30 is the always-on display feature it's highly customizable with a bunch of different clocks and there was also a ton of pre-loaded images they can use to customize the always-on display or you can use an image from your own gallery which I thought was really cool it's running Android new get out of the box right now which I thought was a little bit weird especially since last year they were able to launch the b20 with the latest version of Android but I guess they couldn't pull the same trick off this year so hopefully it'll get updated to Android Oreo pretty soon now the two big centerpieces to the v30 is audio and the camera let's start with audio first and for starters yes it does have a headphone jack so no adapter required here to use your favorite pair of headphones and this year the headphone jack has been moved to the top whereas the B 10 and B 20 had it on the bottom I personally prefer it at the bottom I think it's a much more convenient location but it's not really that big of a deal just something to keep in mind there's also a 32 bit high 5 quad Daken side and unlike the g6 where it was a region exclusive all versions of the V 30 will have a quad AK and all of them will also be tuned by bno some of the benefits that you get from the quad DAC is less noise less distortion and much better dynamic range and can also properly drive a high impedance pair of headphones and you don't necessarily need a pair of high impedance headphones to hear the difference but that will give you the best audio quality possible and audio quality on the b30 is just absolutely incredible it sounds amazing and it's pretty much unparalleled by any other smartphone with the exception of maybe the you 11 but the audio quality is fantastic I think a lot of audio files will really enjoy what the b30 can provide with that quad DAC another feature on the V 30 that a lot of people really like is the support for mqa which stands for master quality authenticated and this basically allows you to stream high res audio at a much smaller file size so it's not going to kill your bandwidth and right now there aren't a ton of streaming services that support it but title is one of the most notable ones so if you have a title subscription and you have the proper subscription tier you can take advantage of this feature right away FX HD support is also on board which is Qualcomm's high res audio codec for wireless or Bluetooth devices Android or EO has this feature natively built in but LG was able to implement it regardless so you've want high res audio over Bluetooth devices you have that option as well alright so let's talk about those cameras so you have dual cameras on the back the main sensor is a 16 megapixel sensor with F 1.6 aperture which makes it the brightest lens on a smartphone right now and it also has optical image stabilization the secondary sensor is a wide-angle lens at 13 megapixels at F 1.9 no OAS here but it doesn't really need it because it's such a wide angle and the focus is set to infinity there's a couple of new features with this camera the biggest one is the ability to shoot log footage and log footage is something you typically find on a DSLR or a mirrorless camera and this basically lets you shoot a completely flat image that has much better dynamic range so you can manipulate it a lot heavier in post in terms of color grading and color correcting but the log footage on the B 30 is not really all it's cracked up to be it's really nice to have but the bitrate is extremely low and it also is a very green it's very tough to color grade very tough to color correct it's hard to get these skin tones and everything to look natural and because the bitrate is so low it's kind of hard to push things around without the image falling apart so it's definitely not all it's cracked up to be and it could have been a lot better if you don't want to deal with post-production which I don't think a lot of people do there's another feature called Sena video that allows you to apply color grading presets directly in camera and it's very simple very quick and easy to do and gives you the desired look that you want in just a couple of seconds as far as picture quality goes the photos are vibrant colorful with plenty of detail and I don't think the v30 over sharpen is quite as much as previous LG phones but the dynamic range is definitely not as good as something like Samsung's camera it does have the tendency to overexpose in a lot of different situations now as expected the wide-angle lens is not as good as the main sensor in terms of quality but it is a ton of fun to use I really enjoy using the wide-angle lens because you can get some really breathtaking lancia shots group photos are a lot easier to take as well there's just a ton of situations where that wide-angle lens really does come in handy it does struggle a lot more in low-light the photos are a lot softer and the white balance is not quite as good but they did at least fix the barrel distortion you don't have that GoPro like look the photos look a lot more normal now which I really appreciate but if you're really concerned about quality and low-light I definitely recommend sticking to the main sensor as the photos are a lot sharper they're more detailed and the white balance and overall color is a lot better pricing for the lgbtq starts around eight hundred dollars and that price will vary depending on carrier and it's pretty typical flagship price and I think the LG v 30 is worth every penny it has a beautiful design a gorgeous display and the audio photography and videography experience is just on a whole another level when it comes to smartphones and a lot of people have been underrating the V series over the last couple of years and it's about time people paid attention to it because the V 30 is doing a lot of really big things and it's doing them extremely extremely well so give it B 30 a look you might be very impressed by what you find so that wraps up our review of the LGB 30 I hope

hello that I'm guessing from Andrew authority now last year Qualcomm took the wraps off the Snapdragon 845 its newest flagship processor and we were there at the launch event and we've got a couple of videos here on our channel about the new 8/4 I'm particular I've got a whole in-depth look about the internals of the April 5 and even I'll link to that just up here but now we've had a chance to actually do some performance testing using a Qualcomm reference device so if you want to know how fast is the Snapdragon 845 please let me explain ok so a few of my colleagues have been down to call calm and they've been looking at a whole bunch of things that call con we're doing including in the area of 5g but while they were there they also got a chance to play with the Snapdragon 805 built into a quorum reference device and there's reference device is basically a smartphone that Qualcomm make for their own testing also they share that with their partners to help them build the next generation or the smartphone so this particular device comes with a Snapdragon 845 he's also got 60 gigabytes of RAM and of course in the 845 is the Adreno 630 GPU now while they were there they were able to run some benchmarks like antutu and geek bench and so on and we've rerun our tests on some current devices so that we can have a comparison between the phones that are coming in 2018 and what we had from the best of 2017 so devices with tested against our the HTC you 11 plus the picture too from Google the note 8 from Samsung the LG v 30 plus and of course the mate 10 Pro from Huawei now three of those devices are running the Snapdragon 835 which of course is last year's flagship processor from core concepts the HTC v LG and the pixel 2 from Google and then inside the notates you've got the X naught 8 8 9 v from Samsung and inside the mate 10 Pro you've got the Kirin 970 which of course has got the four cortex a53 calls McFaul cortex a7 t3 calls along with a Mali g72 GPU so try to get the best scoring we can we've run the test multiple times on each device and we've taken the average score that we managed to get during those series of test runs so without further ado let's dive in and see what we can find out about the Snapdragon 805 so our first test is antutu and you can see here that the winner of the last year's devices is the mate ten pro with two hundred and twelve thousand eight hundred and fifty three now let's add in the score for the Snapdragon 845 and there you see 256 thousand eight hundred and five now that's a 20% increase in the antutu scores compared to the best phone of 2017 so next up is the geek page for scores now the geek pitch scores are in two parts first of a single core score which tells you how fast a single core the fastest core inside the processor can run and then you've got the multi-core score which tells you what happened when it uses all the cause in a multi-threaded application and they're all going as fast as they can what kind of speed can be achieved so let's look at last year's phones so from last year the fastest single core score was from they mate eight with 2019 and the fastest multi-core processor was the ki-rin 970 in the make ten with six thousand seven hundred and eighty seven now let's add in the Snapdragon 845 scores and there we can see that the single core score has gone up to two thousand four hundred and thirty nine that's a 20% increase over last year's note eight with the Exynos 88-90 five and four the multi-core score we've now gone over eight thousand six thousand seven hundred eight and seven before past seven thousand up into eight thousand eight thousand two hundred another twenty percent increase on the overall scores so I think you'll agree me 20 percent here across and two two and the two geek fate schools is a really promising start for the Snapdragon 845 now next up we've run some tests using GFX bench which is a predominantly 3d test which of course will really strain the new adrene six-thirty GPU it's just worth noting that all these tests are actually going to be off-screen tests that means the GPU is doing all the work it needs to do but it's not actually output to the screen in the end and that saves there any discrepancies because of different screen resolutions but it gives us a very good idea about the power of the GPU behind the screen so we start with the t-rex off screen test and the note eight scored the best score last year with a hundred and six frames per second and now here we can see the Snapdragon 845 manages a hundred and fifty-one frames a second that's a 42% increase in raw GPU power next up is the car chase test also from GFX bench last year's winner was the note eight to 25 frames a second and now the Snapdragon 845 can manage 35 frames a second so that's another 40 percent increase in the GPU and our final GFX bench test comes in the form of the Manhattan tests that are built into that test suite all running at full HD we've got two tests here some using OpenGL ES 3.0 on and some using OpenGL ES 3.0 and lastly the winner for OpenGL ES 3.0 and 3.1 again was the note eight with the Exynos 88-90 5 which of course has got the Molly G 71g per unit a 20 core Marlee g71 GPU in it and it's got 55 frames a second on the 3.0 test 42 frames a second on the 3.1 test but now look at the Snapdragon 805 results with the new Adreno GPU in it we've got 83 frames a second on the ES 3.0 scores and 61 frames a second on the ES 3.1 score so that's a 50% and 45% increase across the board so here we're dealing with some very very impressive speed increases in the GPU so the new G you the Adreno 630 is definitely proving to be the GPU to beat for 2018 and finally to round things off we've ran the jet stream JavaScript benchmark which you've run inside the chrome app on the phone of course the Qualcomm Snapdragon device a reference device was running was running Android last year's winner actually for the jet stream javascript test was the HTC u 11 plus with a score of 62 point three one and now this year the Qualcomm reference device made an eighty five point nine nine which is a thirty eight percent increase compared to last year now if you take all those scores and kind of do an average across all of the phones from last year because in some cases to make ten one in some cases are no eight one in some cases the UT for the HTC One and so when we've taken an average of all those what we've worked out is that the snapdragon 845 on average is 33 or 34 percent faster than last year's phones so of course we've got some big flagship devices coming up this year which should be running for snapdragon 845 and i think we're gonna see some very impressive performance numbers from these devices and this is only the reference device from Qualcomm so will be really great to see what the OEMs can do with their devices so I'm really pumped about this it could be great to see what we get from 2018 to smartphones well I'm Gary sim for Android I really hope you enjoyed this video if you did please do give it a thumbs up it's really good if you could subscribe to our Channel hit that

hello I'm Gary Sims from Andrew authority now you may have heard of open source you may even know that Android is based on open source and you may have heard of a license called the GPL sadly you may also over learned that some companies don't respect the GPL license so what is all this about on what does it mean for us well please let me explain now whenever a program at writes a program for any platform they start by typing in the programming language into a text file and this text file is known as the source code and the source code then goes through a compiler and out the other end pops an executable the program that she sort of double-click on or you tap on to run inside of your PC or your laptop or your smartphone or whatever now there are two ways of which software can be developed one is a proprietary closed system which means that you have programmers they write all the code and everything remains closed everything remains private and secret to that company and they just ship the binary the final executable so if you think about companies like Microsoft and Apple and Adobe when you run their programs when you run office when you run Premiere Pro you're only just running the executable they've given you and that's plays an important part in the ecosystem that we have today but there's an alternative way to developing software which is called the open source model and with the open source model after you ship the final executable to the user you also ship the source code and say here is the source code that we use to create this product now just because you ship the source code doesn't mean it goes into the public domain it means that you can attach a license to it saying these are the conditions for this source code that we have put out there for you to see now there are two main types of licenses that govern how this source code is controlled the first one is called the good new general public license the GPL and basically the GPL is a social contract between the users those who actually use this software and the developers those who develop the software and the contract is this will give you the source code you can run it you can modify it you can study it you can you can ship it and develop it and send it off to other people you can do what you like but with one condition and that condition is that the changes you make to the code also has to be shipped on in the next stage and what that basic as it protects the developers that their work remains always out there under the GPL and it will always be under the GPL because every project that is based on that that continues that the develops that also remains under the GPL now there is an aspect of the GPL that sometimes catches people out and that's this if I write a million lines of my own proprietary code I have rip put a lot of effort into it and I want to ship a final product but I include GPL code inside of it then actually under that license all my code has to be released under the GPL you can't mix proprietary software and GPL software together now because of this it's actually sometimes come under quite an attack in fact in 2001 Steve Ballmer who was then the CEO of Microsoft said that Linux because of the GPL was like cancer and everything it touched was infected now actually that's not really true but the point he's trying to make is that you can't mix GPL code and proprietary code together it's just unfortunate that he use those kind of terms now mainly when developers have mixed the code either by mistake the suit is pointed out they remove the GPL code and write the code themselves so they can continue shipping their product in a proprietary fashion and that's absolutely fine now there's a second type of license which is much more permissive license and the most popular one is called the BSD license and BSD for Berkeley software distribution which comes from the University of California Berkeley map was used one of the original versions of Unix that was shipped now under the BSD license he says you can do whatever you like in this code you can modify it you can change it you can improve it you can run it the only condition is that if you distribute it my further on you need to maintain the notices that say this was originally developed by this user and that you have modified it that basically means you just have to keep the copyright notices intact inside of the program and in fact because of its permissive use you find BSD license source code all over the place it's included in Mac OS is including the iOS it's including lots and lots of places in fact if you open up the knowledge moves file inside mac OS there are pages and pages and pages of acknowledgments that are basically just reproductions of this bsd license code that acknowledges that some of it was written by this person's eyes ribbon and it's pages and pages and pages of it but the point is this permissive license allows you to do whatever you like you can mix it with proprietary software code and it there's no consequence just as well as your knowledge where you got that code from now the other license to be aware of is the Apache 2.0 license and that's because the majority of the Android open source product is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license it is a permissive license like the BSD license and basically says you can do whatever you want with it but it also grants the everybody a worldwide royalty-free right to use that software and because Android is based on that that's why companies like Samsung and LG and Sony and whoever can take the Android source code and produce their own version of Android and nobody comes knocking on their door saying hey give us the source code for how you tweaked Android give us the source code for how you implement that feature because I don't have to because that is the license that Google intentionally chose for Android now while the android framework is under Apache 2.0 the Linux kernel that runs at the heart of Android that interface between the hardware and the rest of the framework is actually licensed under the GPL now if you want to sign what role a kernel plays I have a video all about kernels which I recommend you watching I'll link it just up here now because it under the GPL it basically means that any company that uses Android with Linux has to publish their changes also under the GPL now what happens is sometimes there are OMS who ship Android handsets which means they have developed a handset they're using Linux they're using Android and they are selling these for a commercial gain for profit and they're not publishing their changes to the limits kernel which means they are a GPL violator now of course there are a whole bunch of legal reasons why this is not good because it is a license that they accept when they start to ship these products but actually the more important thing is that this is a social contract and the social contract is simple the companies have stood on the shoulders of giants people who before them have developed for 20 years now the Linux kernel and they have sweat in sometimes I'm sure they've cried and they have banged their head and they have worked on this Linux kernel and they have developed this amazing system that we use today and the majority of the contributions have not been paid living in their own free time doing it because they wanted to do it and when an OEM comes along and starts building a handset building a product and start selling it for profit and the Chairman's getting rich and the shareholders are getting rich and everybody's doing what they're doing from a commercial point of view and they're not shipping back their changes they are breaking a legal contract yes but they are breaking a social contract and when you break a social contract you are eating away at the very fabric of society you're eating away they're a fabric of community it becomes a social injustice how come a guy who worked ten years ago writing a piece of Linux kernel in his own free time how come they get to stand on his shoulders and they don't even bother to respect the license that he freely or she gave that source code into the open source community so companies that break the GPL are actually companies that are unethical and immoral it's not a big thing all they're asking is you've got all of the android framework for free you've got all of that software for free you could always compatibility with the Play Store and all these things for free all they're asking is that the changes you made of the kernel at the very bottom get published and if you can't sum up the energy just to publish those changes then there's something seriously wrong with you so to sum up then open source is a model whereby people who write code publish it out there for people to see but that publication is governed by a license and there are different types of licenses GPL BSD apache2 there's other ones like Netscape and Mozilla and MIT there's a whole bunch of them but the main principle is that if you're using the GPL the requirement is that you publish your changes we could put it another way freely you have received so freely you must give and a company that can't even respect that one ethic needs to take a long hard look at who they are on what they're doing my name's go since Ryan Groth wrote

so the BlackBerry key one was a pretty successful smartphone for blackberry it brought the modern Android experience and combined it with the classic BlackBerry physical keyboard but it definitely wasn't a phone that appealed to everyone and not everyone wants a physical keyboard and that's where the brand new BlackBerry motion comes into play it basically takes everything that made the key one so great bumps up the specs in a few key areas and does away with the physical keyboard one thing that I really appreciate about blackberry right now is that they're not afraid to do things differently in an era where dual cameras bezel is displays and curvy sleek pebble like designs are all the rage the BlackBerry motion sort of bucks all those trends and it all starts with a phones design it's made completely out of metal so it's still very high quality and it feels great in the hand but it has completely flat sides and chamfered edges and it has a very sharp and angular look to it it's also a very asymmetrical design the top is rounded whereas the bottom is completely flat and the top forehead is a lot smaller than the bottom chin but the bottom chin is a lot bigger for good reason it has a front-facing fingerprint sensor designated by that blackberry logo and this is actually a physical clicking home button versus a solid state home button which I thought was a little bit interesting but it's also flanked by some really large capacitive keys which I liked a lot because some smartphones have really tiny capacitive keys and they're very hard to press so I appreciate that these keys are nice and large and they're really easy to find on the back side there's a faux carbon fiber pattern which not only looks really nice but it's also very soft to the touch and gives the phone a lot of grip the buttons on this phone are also really high quality they're made of metal so they're very clicky and tactile and they all live on the right side which I don't mind you have the volume rocker up top the power button in the middle and blackberry signature convenience key which has a nice Ridge texture to it but I kind of wish these buttons were in a slightly different order because when you hold the phone your thumb naturally rests on the convenience key instead of the power keys so I kind of wish the power button and the convenience key were swapped because blackberry motion doesn't have a physical keyboard taking up a ton of space that gives you a lot more room for a larger display so what you have here is a 5.5 inch LCD with 1080p resolution and it's not the most attention-grabbing display but it is a pretty good-looking screen it has vibrant colors good viewing angles and outdoor visibility is not really that big of an issue my biggest problem with the screen though is that it has this durability coating which is meant to protect the screen from scratches but it makes the screen really hard to keep clean from fingerprints and it's also very tacky to the touch it's almost as if there's a screen protector sitting on top of it even though it's just pure glass inside it has the same exact specs as the BlackBerry key one so Snapdragon 625 and 4 gigabytes of RAM and it's not the fastest performing phone it's not gonna blow you away in terms of benchmarks and yes you will notice the occasional stutter from time to time and certain applications like snapchat don't perform quite as smoothly as they do on other flagship smartphones but generally speaking it's a very good performing phone it still launches apps quickly and it still plays all the graphically demanding games extremely well so even though there are the occasional stutters I never felt like it broke the experience the biggest benefit to the Snapdragon 625 is the battery sipping properties and when you combine that with a huge 4000 milliamp hour battery you get a recipe for some very long lasting battery life and I love the battery life on the motion it easily last me a full two days with a consistent six hours of screen on time which is really impressive and that's even with pretty heavy usage with a lot of gaming a lot of YouTube watching a lot of viewing streams on Twitch so I really love the battery life on this thing there's no wireless charging though even though it has a non-metal backside but you do get the standard Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 whenever you need to fill up as far as hardware is concerned you'll be pretty happy to know that it does come with the headphone jack and it also has expandable storage via microSD if you need more and it's also ip67 water and dust resistant so it has all the bells and whistles of a 20-17 smartphone or at least all the bells and whistles that we would expect from a 20-17 smartphone the cameras on the BlackBerry motion are exactly the same as the cameras on the BlackBerry key1 so you have an 8 megapixel camera on the front a 12 megapixel camera on the rear and the camera itself is very simplistic you don't really get a whole lot of shooting modes outside of the basic stuff like panorama and slow motion video you're not gonna find any fancy background defocusing effects or portrait mode on this camera and the camera itself is just ok you can get some pretty nice-looking shots in well-lit or outdoor situations with vibrant colors great contrast and pretty nice detail but it's very quick to fall apart in low-light situations photos are very noisy very washed out and they're typically overexposed especially in the highlights and the camera is just very sluggish and low light it's slow to capture and it also constantly hunts for focus that it makes it very cumbersome to use in low-light my favorite part about any blackberry Android phone has to go to the software not only because it's really close to stock Android but also because BlackBerry's customizations are all really useful it starts with the BlackBerry hub which aggregates all of your social media your text messages your emails etc all into one place making it really easy to check so you're not jumping back and forth between multiple applications just to check all of your notifications there's also a lot of other really nice touches like the swipe up on app icons to open the apps widget and the privacy shade which basically blacks out your entire display except for a small little window to make it harder for other people to read what's on your screen and of course with this being a BlackBerry you get BlackBerry's best-in-class security software with DTEC which always ensures that your phone is secure and your data is always encrypted the biggest drawback to the BlackBerry motion right now is its limited availability it's currently only available in select markets like the Middle East and Canada no US availability just yet so hopefully that's coming soon but like I said the BlackBerry motion is a key one without a keyboard and a few upgraded specs and if that's exactly what you're looking for the BlackBerry motion is your answer let's just hope it comes to more regions sooner than later because it's a pretty awesome smartphone that I think a lot of people will want to get their hands on so that wraps up this review of the BlackBerry motion I hope you all enjoyed it and found it helpful if you did please give it a thumbs up down below we definitely appreciate it and subscribe

okay so there are some scenarios where learning-by-doing isn't such a good idea abseiling lion-taming flying a plane these are scenarios where it's better to really know your theory before you jump in but in coding or development getting started on projects is often the best way to really understand all that fear me to sit in context and how it all works that's what makes all the difference so whilst it's a good idea to do some background reading as soon as possible you should start trying to put that theory into practice and come up with some kind of beginner project and I think a great beginner project is to create some kind of quiz because a quiz is a simple project that you can make easily it's something rewarding you can play on your own or with friends and something you can change and develop and turn into all kinds of other things in this video I'm going to show you how to make a Star Wars quiz because everyone's in a stall with mood right now but you could easily turn this into any other kind of quiz or you could turn it into some kind of brain training program or a maths game or an app that shows you information so follow along and hopefully you'll learn something hopefully you'll enjoy the project and read the accompanying article to get a better understanding of what everything does so this project is aimed at beginners yes but beginners with a little bit of background understanding regarding Java regarding XML and Android if you have no prior experience you can still play along but I highly recommend you do some reading in order to understand some of the things that I'm going to skim over I will explain a bit but for a much better understanding follow the link in the description or just do your own background reading the whole thing is going to take seven minutes because that's what I do and if you get stuck of course just use the force okay so in most new apps you're going to have an activity and activity being a page or a screen in your app and this will be made up of a Java file in this case mainactivity.java and a layout file in this case activity underscore main dot XML and the great thing is that if we use the design view by making sure you're on the design tab down the bottom here that's the text tab then you can simply drag and drop the different elements you want to onto the screen and if you select a view then on the right here you can change the attributes in the attribute window you can also change the name of a view by changing the ID and this will allow us to refer to it later we're going to call this one question now if you want to add another textview we simply drag and drop from here like so and we're actually going to have four more so we're going to name these answer one answer two and answer three always a good idea and that will be called outcome that bottom one you need to anchor all four sides to either the edge of the display or another view that's anchored and that's nice and easy we are going to add one more thing though and that's an on click for these so we want to click view all attributes in our attribute window here and we'll call this on answer one click what this is going to do is allow us to refer to what happens when someone clicks on this in our code can you guess what this one on the called on answer to click and on answer three click okay so there's lots of different ways we could approach making a quiz but I think we should use a map and seeing as I'm kind of in charge that's probably what we're gonna be doing so okay so with that in mind we need to create our map and we do that like say so we're saying a map with two strings that's the key in the value we're gonna call our map questions I'm gonna say new hash map string string brackets now you'll notice these are red if you find things red like this just click on them and press alt + enter that imports a new class I won't go into what that means okay next we're going to create a new integer which is a whole number I'm gonna call that question no and as you can probably guess that's going to refer to which question we're on and the next thing we need to do is create our views text view outcome text view question text view answer 1 ok next we need to tell our code that those views are the ones who defined earlier in the XML and do that by saying find view by ID our meaning resource answer one remember we used capitals there let me can do the same thing for answer two and answer three I'm also gonna want to do the same thing for the question we're gonna want to do the same thing for our out to come okay now we're going to need to populate our map that means putting in our questions and answers and we do that by saying questions remember that's what we called the map put and then we can say question one that's the key and then the value might be what is kylo ren's real name there so I made earlier you can steal mine from the article on the site or writing your own notice that I've got write one wrong a one wrong b1 so we're using this number and we need to be consistent with the naming conventions here and you're gonna see why in a moment okay so now we're going to create a new method set question so that's read for now because that's not actually a normal command I'm going to say private void which means that it's a method that doesn't need to be accessed by other parts of the program so to assign those questions and answers to our views we go like so question set text which is a way of changing the text questions get so questions remember is our map and then we need to use our key to retrieve that we're going to get that with question and then plus question now so that's going to change as the question goes up and then we need to do the same thing of course for the answers I'm gonna do one more thing here as well and that's to set a tag for answer one and that's going to be correct okay the next thing I want to do is to create another method this won't be a public method because we're using it from outside this script and it's called on answer one click and it has view V there as well and here we're just going to say if answer one get tagged is equal to correct then we execute this bit of script which is to say on our outcome set text well done and then we're going to reset our questions but only after we've iterated the question number so now it's moved on to question two or three and then we're going to say accept question again otherwise else outcome set text try again to our view which just means whichever view happens to have been clicked and the reason for that is because it makes it much easier for us just copy and paste this and put in our announcer to click and on answer three click again there are quicker and better ways of doing this we could for instance have a global on click and then look for that tag and that's really the reason to be doing that however I'm keeping things simple here just so you can follow along and this is the easiest way to do it okay so all that's really left to do now is to change the order so that it's not always the same and for that we're going to need a random number you'll need to import that class by the way and we get that by writing this dot next int three there we go and then we can say if the value one equals zero so that's going to have a value of zero to two because it starts at zero three options starting at zero in quantal equals there okay and then we can say else if the value 1 equals 1 then we put our correct answer and our tag in the second position and else if the value 1 equals 2 then the correct answer and tag go in the third position it doesn't really matter where the wrong answers are and there you go and of course again there are better ways of doing this what I would actually do is enter that data into a list and then shuffle the list using a good random algorithm but again for simplicity sake this will work just fine and there you have a complete working quiz in just seven minutes today it Reds at the bottom now well done and you hope there's more to do obviously at the moment we'll crash when you get to the end of the list so you need to do something about that and of course we want to make it look nicer and you'll do that in the XML and you can change the background and I set a Star Wars logo at the top you can do that by just using an image view for instance and you can mess around with your colors by going to the values and go to the colors XML change the scheme mess around with it as you like well that's the basic bones the bare bones of your quiz and of course it can change the questions and the topic to be anything you like but if you make a horticultural quiz that you can probably assume you're going to have fewer people wanting to play so you found this video useful interesting guys if you did then please leave a like please share it around and let me know in the comments what you thought if it gets stuck or if you have any

Google's initiative to bring a high quality experience to affordable entry-level devices with Android Go made a pretty big splash here at MWC 2018 while the high profile devices from companies like Samsung typically steal all the attention at Mobile World Congress it's important to pay attention to emerging markets especially when Google believes its next billion users will come from countries like India Android go is a super lightweight version of Android that's optimized for phones with lower specs and a gigabyte of RAM or less so none of these phones are really going to blow you away in terms of raw numbers but that isn't the point Google has created less intensive versions of many of their apps to ensure that the performance is smooth on this much more mundane hardware and for the most part you're not losing out on much with the go versions of their apps there were several Android go devices shown off here at MWC like the Alcatel 1x and although the hardware of Android Go phones aren't necessarily eye catching this one does come with an 18 by 9 display then there's the Nokia one again another pretty uninspiring design but it's a sub $100 smartphone and it's hard to complain about anything at that price there were many other Android Go devices that made their presence here such as the g m8 from general mobile lava Z 50 and tempo go from ZTE but we're expecting to see more Android Go devices from other high-profile companies such as Huawei the big drawing point to Android Go devices will always be their price some are sub $100 and some will even cost less than $50 and that's extremely impressive for phones that are capable of offering a decent experience simply through optimization of software you're also getting the latest version of Android out of the box and the promise of timely updates that's not something you can typically say about smart phones in this price range these phones aren't flashy but what they are is practical and cost-effective and for users in emerging markets those qualities are more important google has made a very strong presence here at MWC 2018 with Android go but we want to know what you guys think about Android go so leave your thoughts down in the comment section below and as always if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up we definitely appreciate it and keep it tuned here too and yorda thority for the rest of our M you see 2018 coverage 
hey guys Chris Karla from Android Authority I'm here to show you really quickly what the Google pixel to launch it looks like on the Galaxy Note 8 it'll actually work on any phone running Android lollipop and above so we'll show you how to do that in just a little bit but let's take a look first like the new pixel 2 phones you'll see that the Google search bar appears on the bottom of the home screen just above the navigation buttons but the familiar swipe of app drawer is still in place at the top of the screen we've got the new at-a-glance widget which shows the date and the current weather conditions but it'll also alert you to upcoming calendar events about half an hour before they occur and current traffic conditions both of these can be disabled from the home screen settings if you only want the date and weather displayed though hopefully some more options will arrive in an update in the near future like upcoming reminders maybe flight information or even parcels that are about to arrive if you tap the date it'll open up the calendar for more information and tapping the forecast opens more detailed weather info the Google search bar of course works the same but it'll actually open the search bar at the top of the screen while your keyboard pops up at the bottom if you want the google app to live on the leftmost home screen then you'll actually need to install the APK as a system app if you just install that APK as you normally would then you won't have this functionality to install the old launcher as a system app you'll need root access of course so just download the app and then move to system slash app once it's there just change a couple read/write permissions and reboot your phone one other thing that's worth mentioning is that a couple of features are not going to be available if your device isn't running Android Orio like on the galaxy note here you'll see that I'm missing a few options that are present on the pixel running Orio including the toggle for notification dots the ability to change the app icon shape and whether or not you want to add new apps to your home screen of course because the pixel to launcher is just a launcher it's not going to affect any other additional functionality other features like the s-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 will still work fine so pop the pen out and you can use all those features as you normally can there's a couple of other google pixel to apks floating around right now including the new google camera so be sure to hit the video description below for some links to android authority well we will take you through everything that's new as always guys thank you so much for watching hit that like button if you've enjoyed this video be sure to let us know if you want to see more videos like this subscribe to the channel hit that notification bell trackers down on social and stay tuned Android authority because we are useless for all things Android 
this video is brought to you by minimal case for your exclusive discount on the pixel 2 cases check the description box below what's up guys lawn here from andrew authority and we're taking a quick look at Google's brand new pixel 2 XL versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 these are the two biggest flagship phones that both of these companies have to offer and will most likely draw a lot of comparisons for that reason alone so on the inside they're pretty similar they're both powered by a Snapdragon 835 processor and there's more than plenty of RAM on both with 4 gigabytes on the pixel and 6 on the note 8 you also get water and dust resistance on both but with Samsung you're also getting micro SD card expansion and wireless charging which Google just isn't offering right now with the pixel line on the outside the pixel has a metal design with a small glass window towards the top of the backside and it's slightly more rounded along the corners whereas the note 8 is much sharper and more square and of course the note 8 is made mostly out of glass but does have the metal frame wrapping around the sides one thing that you won't find on the pixel this year is a headphone jack which Samsung is still keeping around at least for right now but you do get dual front-facing speakers which isn't that comment on smartphones anymore and Google is at least nice enough to include an adapter in the box as far as the displays go the pixel 2 XL has a 6 inch display and the note 8 has a slightly larger 6.3 inch screen they're both quad HD AMOLED displays with always-on technology and the pixel 2 XL has adopted the tall and narrow aspect ratio of 18 by 9 that we've been seeing a lot this year the pixel 2x cells bezels are thin but they're not quite as thin as the note 8 due to the front-facing speakers on the backside the pixel 2 XL has a 12 megapixel camera F 1.8 aperture and both OAS and E is this time around and over on the note 8 you've got dual 12 megapixel cameras with the secondary serving as a telephoto lens for 2 X optical zoom the interesting thing about the pixels camera this year is that it's capable of doing portrait mode or background blurring effects which the note 8 can also do but Google's approach this is slightly different so it's only working off of one lens it uses machine learning to make all this happen with this being a pixel of course you get android oreo out of the box with all this new improvements like notification dots native picture-in-picture support etc and it'll be the first Android phone to support google lens which uses the camera and machine learning to give you information about anything you point your camera at similar to what Samsung attempted with Bixby vision another neat feature on the pixel this year is that you can squeeze the phone to access Google assistant at any time similar to the squeeze feature we saw on the HTC u 11 over on the note 8 you've got these Samsung experience on top of Android nougat but the standout feature on the note 8 is the s-pen that lets you do a variety of different things like jot down notes create drawings and translate sentences and this is ultimately what separates the note 8 from every other Android phone out there but what do you guys think about the pixel 2 XL and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 which one would you guys choose let us know down in the comments section below and as always if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up we definitely appreciate it subscribe to the channel which is also down below if you haven't already hit that notification bell so you don't miss out on future videos and of course check us out on social media and of course check the website as well and Jordan thorny calm because we are your source for all things Android 
Google's first foray into the headphone category has a quirky design good sound and put some Google assistant flavor in your ear it's Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and these are the Google pixel buds let's start from the beginning with the pixel buds still in the case now the case itself already screams Google from the get-go with a design language that is reminiscent of recent pixel devices there's a fabric all around the clamshell case and it is charged with USB C cables and then of course there is the G logo in the middle open it up and there are the pixel buds themselves nestled inside of the little crevices that are also magnetized and the cord is wrapped around the edges now wrapping the cable around the edges when you're charging the earbuds takes a little bit of getting used to but once you get it down it's easy to do without even thinking about it and as far as charging these earbuds go the 120 milli amp hour unit is charged by 650 million powers inside of the case itself which allows the earbuds to work for pretty much the entire day a single button above the right ear bud area shows you what the charge level is of the case or of the earbuds if they are inside of the case but the initial setup does require use of that button you do have to pair the earphones to whatever phone you're using that has Google assistant on it by holding down on that button while the buds are inside now one thing I do want to mention real quick is that Google does claim that the pixel buds work best with the pixel 2 and while I did use it with them and it was perfectly fine I actually used them mostly with this 1 + 5 t I will admit that the pairing process on the 1 + 5 t was not completely seamless as it still prompted me with a pairing request on the pixel - this is not the case but once you have the pixel buds paired to whatever smartphone you're using they will always connect to it the moment you take it out of the case without any delays at all Google's design language permeates throughout the headphones themselves the court is made of a fabric material as well and it even extends past the ear pieces themselves more on that in a second the problem I have with the cord is that it's just not long enough more length on it would allow the ear buds to just securely hang around my neck but even during the recording of this video I've had to fix the cord so that it wasn't always slacking more on one side and at worse they would just fall off my neck and that happens more times than I would like I've heard a myriad of different opinions on how comfortable the buds are ranging from positive to downright upset personally the buds fit just right in my and the way that they make them fit is actually kind of interesting that extra bit of fabric cord that goes past the ear buds can be pulled or slacked in more in order for them to just sort of nestled underneath a portion of the ear that way they don't come out too easily now if you look closely the ear pieces do have an open construction and that means they are different from plenty of other earphones you might be used to that have a piece of rubber or silicone at the end that you would then insert actually into your ear now this is a little bit more like the Apple earpods and it does change the sound profile quite a bit but I'll get to that later the left earbud is simply for sound as the touch sensitive control is found on the right ear bud where you can tap hold or swipe for various functions and to be honest the gestures of the pixel buds are one of the main highlights interactions come incredibly naturally hit the right earbud to play or pause or to respond to a google assistant prompt hold it to talk to assistant or swipe forward and backward for volume control there's no control for changing tracks but that function is pretty easily replaced by just asking Google assistant to do so just hold on the right ear button and then you can ask it and it doesn't right away it literally happens that fast in opting for a more open configuration the pixel buds mainly lose an immersive level of bass but there was a good enough sound profile that I still enjoyed listening to music and also they get pretty loud so you are able to immerse yourself in the music at least to that level but it's the lack of a seal that I think most people are going to get a little bit upset at because they're used to just blocking out the noise of the outside world and while that is a very valid concern I also think that's kind of missing the point as a new way of having Google assistant on at all times it's a bit obvious that Google kind of wants you to have at least the right earbud in at all times if possible it might not sound particularly appealing but consider for a moment that Google assistant on the buds is actually the best iteration of it outside of the smartphone itself holding on the right earbud and asking to speak a different language launches the app on the phone and it begins listening you will be able to hear either the foreign language or your own translated accordingly in your ear but it will still be displayed on your device in order for the other person to read it and for you to read their response now this is a great function to have but it is only as good as Google Translate itself if you've used it at all in the past you would know that it goes for the more informal phrases so if you are traveling a lot with the pixel buds and with Google Translate just know that you might be talking more casually to people than they would used to currently the pixel blood support a number of different languages including Japanese French Spanish Korean Vietnamese and Thai but on a personal note Filipino is not supported so that was a bit of a bummer and to be honest if you have Google Translate installed on your smartphone a lot of these functions are still available to you so the pixel buds provide more of a convenience in terms of doing translation rather than actually being an essential part of the process but it's when you get into a dialogue with the pixel buds that it really finds its aha moment here's an example I double tap the right earbud to get Google assistant to do its usual tasks first it tells me the time and then it tells me if I have any calendar events coming up third it begins reading off my notifications on my phone if it hasn't already covered them this is a kind of literal part of the experience the notification that you would read on your phone in the notification drop-down becomes exactly what you hear verbatim in a slightly robotic way if you don't have anything playing already on the pixel buds the notifications will be read in real time which again is a reason why the open construction turns out to be useful if you happen to have one of these in your ear at all times so you don't miss notifications at least you're not sealing off the world and you have more awareness so that well you can be safer and finally Google assistant will sometimes hit a messenger application read out the message and give me time to respond five chimes or seconds in which I can hold the right earbud to voice dictate a response Google assistant repeats my response back to me and then I can tap the bud to send it or hold it in order to record it again I'm completely convinced that this is the point of the pixel buds not only has it been nice to have assistant always available but interacting with it through the earpiece has proved to be more natural than the alternatives let's face it talking to our wrists in order to respond to messages was kind of cool but ultimately not practical and definitely not foolproof the pixel buds simply do this a lot better now because of this the audience that will enjoy the pixel buds are ones that are going to already use Google assistant on the daily for everyone else these headphones will simply fall short they're not the best sounding they're not the best designed and they are not the best priced at 1:59 the question is whether or not the smart functions are worth it everyone else should still pay attention though because these are a lot like the original Google pixel assistant was a new exciting yet cautious move forward in Google's first in-house smartphone but soon it found its way to pretty much every I wouldn't be surprised if this was the same story with the butts in which the great gesture controls the maturing Google assistance and even more find their way to more headphones wireless or otherwise and it would only be a matter of time before a headset arrives that is the opposite of the butts instead of great smart functions and decent sound it would have incredible sound and it would happen to be enjoyably smart and now that would be music to our ears so as always thank you very much for watching and hope you enjoyed this review of the Google pixel buds they are an enjoyable sound experience but an even more enjoyable Google assistant experience and I think everyone should be paying attention because this is the way that headphones might mature and become smarter over time and honestly I'm really excited to see what comes next I wanted to give a shout out to some top comments on my last video which was the 1 + 5 t review so let's give you guys a shout outs and good job keeping the conversation going

and here it is the latest version of the venerated Samsung Galaxy S line hey it's Josh of agarra what's going on everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy S 9 in this case the s9 + [Music] if you had oldness took this phone for the Samsung Galaxy s8 that came before it we actually wouldn't really blame you the glass on glass designed is so common now for samsung devices and really only a couple of elements have changed all of the buttons are done the same places including the bixby button over on the left and as far as the ports in the bottom gulp the headphone jack of course remains the phone does have a little bit more heft to it compared to the previous generation which is nice and the main change that you're going to see is on the s9 plus particularly because on the back you now have a dual end setup and the fingerprint reader is in a much better spot the fingerprint reader is below the camera module now which is the same for either of the devices but of course it's pushed down even more due to the dual end setup of the s9 plus okay there are a couple of caveats I want to give with the design of this device and one of them you're probably expecting already because this is a glass on glass design well you're gonna get fingerprints and smudges on it incredibly easily and this is a phone that I'm constantly having to clean for this very video but another issue did arise and it's with the gorilla glass on the front the very top layer of the Gorilla Glass 5 is already eroding for a phone that's supposed to be really high build quality and has the price point to match it you wouldn't think that this would be a common problem but this is something that I've had happened to a couple of other Samsung devices in the last couple of years but speaking of that screen you still get a beast of a display in the infinity display this Super AMOLED quad HD resolution display with so many features to pack with it there's still that immersive experience with the sides curving downward into the body of the phone but it doesn't bleed all the way down anymore the way it did in the last two generations the reason why is because Samsung didn't want there to be any palm presses anymore so this does minimize that accidental touch the Samsung Galaxy S 9 has a 5.8 inch screen and this s 9 plus has 6.2 inches in its screen which means that there's a lot of screen real estate for work and play and the AMOLED screen provides great vibrance and wonderful colors the saturation is exactly where you might want it to be but of course you can dial that back in the settings and then there's everything else that the screen can do the OS on display is customizable you can put a number of different elements on there including an image that you provide yourself and you're able to get to those in the lock screen menu in the settings underneath that the lock screen can be set to a 15-second video so if you're able to edit it in such a way that it fits perfectly on the vertical screen then you have an even better looking lock screen and something that is incredibly personal and you're still able to enjoy everything from media to work to even gaming on here as I've definitely played my share of games on the galaxy s 9 plus so far and speaking of gaming performance is still where it should be with the best possible specifications that are available right now underneath the hood you have the snapdragon 845 and the galaxy s 9 plus gets the added benefit of 6 gigabytes of RAM over its 64 gigabytes of on-board storage that is expandable with an SD card speaking of the RAM multitasking is still a treat on here there are multiple ways of having more than one application running and you can have plenty of them running in the background but Android or EO is what brings picture-in-picture to here so you can have a YouTube video just floating above your workspace and you can always have that media playing whenever you want so a theme that you're probably familiar with in the review of any galaxy device is the fact that Samsung is really trying to please just about everybody and when you look at the hardware that's certainly the case with the s9 dual stereo speakers certainly bring the volume but the sound is also pretty rich and full thanks to Adobe Atmos certification it certainly passes the shower test and on top of all of that you can actually use this as your Bluetooth speaker in a way because this phone has ip68 certification so it's not going to die under the water but if you want to use headphones the headphone jack still returns and it provides a lot of options inside of the menu you are able to change the sound using equalizers Dolby Atmos enhancements and you're still able to adapt the sound so it will automatically figure out the best way to output that audio and on top of that the phone comes with a gray pair of AKG headphones just like the last couple of iterations you get all of the proper connections on here including NFC for payments for example and of course Bluetooth which provides apdex HD audio support which means that bluetooth streaming on here is going to sound really great and if you have a good pair of bluetooth headphones then you'll be able to enjoy audio coming from this phone wirelessly we already mentioned the fingerprint reader and yes it is in a much better place but so there is also an array of front that allows for other biometric meters two of the main ways of doing that face unlock and the iris scanner have now been put together into what is called the intelligent scan intelligent scan basically means that when you turn on the phone you wake the phone before unlocking it it will scan for your face to begin with and then it will move to an iris scanning if the conditions aren't really met where this makes a lot of senses in low-light situations like at night or right before bed when you want to use your phone but it's not able to recognize your face because it's too dark to do so the infrared light comes on and then it starts scanning for your iris and then it will be able to unlock it fairly quickly after that now as we get into battery life it is important to note that we did not have a galaxy s 9 unit to really test here we had the larger s9 plus that has 3500 million hours in its battery compared to the 3000 in the smaller unit the short story here is that the battery life is exactly where you would expect it to be if nothing exceptional nothing extraordinary here what you can expect is that the phone will last an entire day maybe a day and a half if you don't really use the phone a whole lot but in the days that I have been using the s9 plus I have really put this thing through the ringer now that's considering that the battery was being used not only by having the screen on but also by the camera app and in conjunction I was able to get about three hours of screen on time while running around Casa bio in Barcelona recording everything that you see later in the camera section but on other days when I was doing more media based stuff like watching YouTube and Hulu or doing video calls I was able to get six hours of screen on time which is a little bit more expected for a big battery despite the big screen on this phone now when you do get a little bit low on battery life you can always turn on the power saving modes which not only bring down the clock speed of the processor a bit but the main thing it does is it lowers the resolution of the screen you can get all the way down to HD plus resolution which obviously makes things look a little bit weird but at least you're going to get at least an hour maybe two hours more of battery life depending on your usage and then of course there's the ultra power saver that minimizes the UI and a lot of the features down to just its bare minimum with a few applications like Twitter that you might use if you absolutely need it but thankfully it is easy to charge this phone pretty quickly you're able to get a bit of the battery back in no time at all using the included charger with the full charge maybe taking about 90 minutes there are a number of other ways to fast charge this including fast wireless charging or my favorite power delivery which is the standard built into USB type-c alright so that finally brings us to the main focus no pun intended of Samsung's enhancements to the s9 and the s9 plus that's of course the camera let's start off by doing something kind of fun so here I am coming to you as my AR emoji now this may or may not look like me you can always let me know in the comments down below what AR emojis are basically the way for you to express yourself as a digital avatar this is Samsung's take on the nmo G's from the iOS side of things however what the way that you do this is by detecting your face using either camera and from there it will create a caricature of your face it may or may not be completely accurate that you can then customize with different hairstyles different skin tones different hair colors eyeglasses of some sort and also a few different options for clothing one of the main things that is nice about this emoji is that it provides 18 different gifts that you can use to send to pretty much anybody on any platform so since we're on the topic of self-expression let's talk about the front-facing camera the front-facing camera is an 8 megapixel shooter that is very similar to the one you found in to the previous generation one particular addition is in the form of selfie focus which is its take on the front facing cameras portrait mode you take the picture and then the software will figure out where the cutout is of you and it will be able to blur the background in a nice depth of field or bouquet manner so between that and the AR emoji there are some enhanced Beauty mode features the main one being a co-opting of the big speed a our makeup feature you're basically able to put on a full face of makeup in augmented reality and then just look fabulous when you hit that shutter button and I've mentioned this before but on top of those new enhancements and the auto focus in this a megapixel shooter you're still able to record 2k video on the front which is great for vloggers like myself so the finally brings us to the rear cameras and on the s9 plus like I've mentioned a couple of times already you get the enhancement of a second lens the telephoto lens comes in at F 2.4 aperture and it supplements what enhancements are put into the main shooter the 12 megapixel main Lance with multiframe processing made possible by actual RAM built into the camera module again this is kind of in the same Avenue but still different from the Google pixel - which uses a lot of the same functions but has the ability to use Google photos huge database for that same amount of data processing you're already seeing some great results as I'm talking right now with all of these photos that I took out in Barcelona and also back home but there is a feat of hardware engineering at work here and it's in the form of the dual aperture the 12 megapixel camera now has actual blades in it that can close down the iris 2f 2.4 aperture but that's not the main story the main story is that the wide aperture is at F 1.5 F 1.5 aperture allows for a ton of light to come into the sensor and in low-light situations it is heads and shoulders above anything Samsung has made before but the question remains why would you want to have two different apertures on here well it's basically Samsung's way of undercutting what F 1.5 means yes it does allow for great low-light shots but it also provides very fine focus sometimes you don't want that to be the case especially in broad daylight shots so f 2.4 aperture just undercuts at that little bit so that you don't have too many things just incredibly blurred out in the background but of course you're able to change between these two apertures by going into the pro mode and just swapping the two sightings out anyway so the main lens does a great job and in auto mode that aperture will change without you even knowing it however some extra optimization might still be required when you're using different apertures the rest of the settings have to change accordingly and it seems like this camera app still opts for slower shutter speed over higher ISO and when you do that the slower shutter speed could mean that you have some motion blur in some pictures so the Samsung camera may not be perfect but it does its best to get the job done for just about everybody and if you really want to have every tool possible for your smartphone photography the s9 plus is probably the one you want to look at and that's because the telephoto lens provides something that the s9 proper does not have a proper portrait mode this live focus mode uses both lenses to get a narrow focal length while making it easier for the camera to figure out where the cutout is this is different from the selective focus mode that you only get on the samsung galaxy s 9 where it's software-based and the cutouts on there can be pretty hit or miss just like with the selfie focus on the front-facing camera and finally when it comes to video you have 4k 60 frames per second video capture on the rear which is great to have if you want to have beautiful motion in your videos however when you do the math that 60 frames per second video capture means that you can get 960 frames per second super slow-mo at 720p resolution and in those cases when the moment is tough to capture the camera app can go into an auto mode and tries to figure out when it should trigger the slow-motion capture what's great about this camera is that Samsung found a way to please just about everybody the casual user will really love a are emoji and probably get a kick out of super slow mode but seasoned photographers are going to find ways of exploiting and taking advantage of the dual apertures and overall it just shows that you can get the best of both worlds in the s9 or the s9 plus if you really truly need that zoom capability speaking of trying to please everybody we can finally talk about Samsung's version of Android 8.0 Oreo now 8.1 is where we're at in Oreo right now and it's just not found on this just yet which might mean that Samsung has a bit of an update problem but they don't have a problem when it comes to features because this is still incredibly stacked there are the obvious redundancies with a number of applications developed by Samsung that are pretty much covered by Google anyway like Google Photos or the Samsung gallery I will give the gallery app some credit however because it does come with a couple of extra features not only are you able to change the different ways that you can present the bouquet in the background of a live focused photo but you are also able to create gifts out of it essentially a six-second capture out of any video that can be made into a quick gift big speed is still in that button on the left that you can deactivate you can't really change it to anything else still but Bixby does have a few added features on top that might entice you to use it you're still able to hold it in order to do voice commands but there are some live augmented reality based features that have been added in like live translation and the ability to have live food recognition even if the live food recognition is a bit hit or miss I have to give it some credit because it's really trying even at this bakery I was able to figure out that this was an egg tart even if it thought that my coffee was just a cup of milk and this is all on top of things like the game launcher that provides a do not disturb mode and locks the buttons for example and you'll still have Samsung held Samsung notes and pretty much any other app that you've already seen on the most previous Samsung Galaxy S or Galaxy Note devices even if these redundancies are kind of annoying it is nice to see that if one doesn't work the way you wanted to you still have the option of using the other and so there you have it - the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and the S 9 plus the S 9 and the SN plus are on pre-order right now at prices of 719 and 839 dollars respectively that's a really hefty price point especially for phones that definitely have some quirks but if you had to choose between the two of them I'd actually recommend the galaxy s 9 both are great phones it's just that you get a small bump down in some specifications and if you really want to have them then you can go ahead and pay that extra 120 dollars but a lot of what Samsung put into these phones that is new you get in either phone anyway the AR emojis the dual aperture in the main lens and if you don't need the telephoto lens for things like a proper portrait mode then you don't really have a whole lot enticing you to get the larger less easier to handle and definitely more expensive s9 plus but as is generally the case with samsung galaxy releases they do tend to be the best phone for most people out there and that's because Samsung has this unwavering desire to create phones that appeal to just about everybody and it seems that with the galaxy s 9 and the S 9 plus they've probably succeeded in doing that better than ever before so as always thank you guys very much for watching hope you enjoyed this review of the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus in particular we'll get our hands on the smaller galaxy s 9 and do some more testing on that but you'll also get a lot more coverage on this Samsung flagship device as we put it head-to-head to other phones in the Android space and potentially against the iPhone 10 in a more comprehensive review we would

hello I'm Gary sim from Andrew authority do you want to know about the snapdragon 845 well let me explain so call comic just had their technical summit in Hawaii and we've just been getting all the great new details about the next year's flagship system on a chip that's the Snapdragon 800 and 45% during eight four five so what is it well first of all it is a 64-bit system on a chip that's going to be found in Android phones and also probably in Windows laptops and we'll talk a lot more about that in a moment now inside of it there are lots and lots of different components that's what a system on a chip means it's not just a CPU in there you've also got a GPU you've got an image processor for the camera you've got a DSP for doing signal processing and also for doing some heavy computation like neural network stuff you've got security you've got all the connectivity modem and of course Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and that's all built into just one chip so looking at some of the components individually it's start with the CPU know the CPU in the snapdragon 845 is the cryo 385 now it's built on cortex technology that means that Qualcomm have taken a core design or two core designs from arm and then they have tweaked them a little bit maybe some of the internals may be in how it fits into the rest of the chip that lay out physically on the on the silicon and then they've allowed to brand that as their own chip design which in this case of the cryo 3 8 5 now it's probably that it is the cortex a 75 and the cortex a 55 now if you remember the court is a 75 and a 55 are the two new core designs from arm that used dynamic and the great thing about dynamic is that these cores are now together in the same cluster which means they can share a lot of the same buses and all of the same input and outputs to the rest of the chip without having to be separate and then kind of working independently now here we've got four high-performance cores caught it's a 75 cores running at 2.8 gigahertz and we've got for power efficiency causes the cord it's a 55 running at 1.8 gigahertz so each of the cores have l1 cache and l2 cache the l2 on the bigger cause is slightly larger 256 K per core and is 128 K per core for the a 55 power efficiency cause but beneath that there is an L 3 cache of 2 megabytes now that l3 cache of 2 megabytes works across just the cause it doesn't work across the GPU and the DSP as well so what Qualcomm has added in another layer of caching which they're calling system cache which is a further 3 megabytes and that means that when the CPU and the GPU want to talk to each other that data can be cached on chip without having to go out to main memory looking at the main memory is slow because these are all relative terms so we made up all that caching 3 megabytes across the system core and then 2 megabytes across the l3 cache and then l2 cache with one megabyte for the high performance cause half a megabyte for the power efficiency cause that's six and a half megabytes of cache excluding the l1 caches now that's a significant amount of cache and that's going to be part of the reason why they've managed to bump up the performance here by 30% of course also the a 75 and a 55 are much more much more faster performant than the previous generation anyway but a 30% increase in distilling it's not as much cash as you find in the 11 Bionic however we're getting close to that kind of level now if you think about a 30% performance increase that's absolutely amazing if I said to you that you could buy a new car or a new television or a new microwave that in its measure of performance it was 30% better than the last model that that's pretty impressive now talking about memory for a moment this system on a chip uses LP low power ddr4 it runs at 1.8 gigahertz and you can have a maximum of 8 get gigabytes in a snapdragon 845 phones we're not going to see any 16 gigabyte phones next year and looking at the GPU that comes in the Snapdragon 845 it's the Adreno 630 Qualcomm asset and the next generation they've done a lot of work from the ground up to build this new GPU it's 30% greater performance while using 30 less power which is quite amazing and also it has a 2.5 times a display throughput so significant gains in both the CPU and the GPU performance so the DSP in the subject in eight four five is the latest generation hexagon DSP it does more than just digital signal processing and also do lots of vector calculations it's a third generation of vector engine inside this DSP and Qualcomm are positioning this for all of their neural network processing so it doesn't have a dedicated NPU or neural engine they're saying you can do this on their DSP and so that's in the DSP support all the common neural networking frameworks including tensorflow light and also now support halide that programming language that's being used for image processing which you'll find also in google's pixel to smartphone and the update this will enable that of course was in android oreo 8.1 and then also you've got the spectra 280 ISP which is the image signal processor which of course is used when data comes from the camera how you protis all that information and turn it into movie files and JPEG files that we all like to use now the spec the new spectra is pay can record 4k at 60 frames a second that's a lot of bandwidth they put in there it supports a 10-bit color gamut for video recording so you can actually record in this new HDR mode which will give you ten bits of color and also it can do 480 frames per second slo-mo but only in 720p now the the new DSP in the ISP actually present a problem for Samsung funnily enough because now that there's so much extra stuff going on on the Qualcomm s SOC not just a CPU and a GPU boot got these extras that are doing a lot of multimedia work a lot of processing work a lot of neural network stuff what happened when Samsung want to release their next phone and some of them are using Samsung's Exynos chips and some of them are using Qualcomm's where are they going to draw the line for the lowest common denominator that's going to be a real pro bar coding problem we'll see what Samsung released next year and see whether they've kind of chipped down taken down the Qualcomm processor a peg or two so you can't do this fantastic slow mode or you can't do 10-bit color recording if their new occipital supported we don't know yet so we instance to see what they come out with the new external chip - because these two have to work side by side in two versions of the s9 or the note 9 or whatever samsung release also built onto the chip is called comms acoustic chip and that's acoustic a cue stick acoustic and that supports apdex aptX which of course is the bluetooth codec from kokum which delivers greater audio quality than the standard Bluetooth codec and talking about you've also got bluetooth true Wireless which is a proprietary standard from Qualcomm that allowed two Bluetooth streams to come independently to maybe a left ear bug on a right earbud and they both come independently from the phone rather than one being the master and it kind of copying the information over to the other one and what we're talking about Bluetooth is also full support for Bluetooth five built into the Snapdragon 805 three more things worth mentioning one is that it's also got the new X 20 LTE category 18 modem which means it has a potential download speeds of 1.2 gigabits per second a lot of people get very excited about the LTE modems I don't quite get so excited because it really does depend on what your carrier provides and while these manufacturers are able every year to bring out a new phone and bring out a new modem it's a bigger difference to change a whole country or a whole state to have the latest LTE network on it so we're always kind of a few generations behind what the actual phones can manage however for the future that's a really good sign the sse also supports quick charge for which is qualcomm ladies quick charging technology and it's backwardly compatible with USB power delivery and if you want to know what mirrors be power delivery is then please do check out my video on this channel where I go into great detail about what it actually can do for us as consumers and the last component worth mentioning is the new security processing unit that's basically a way of kind of keeping things like fingerprint data and passwords and all education process is very separate from the cpu so even if some kind of malware managed to get on to the low levels of your CPU here's now another barrier that protects this biometric information and protects your digital information it actually has its own CPU probably a cortex m3 it runs its own little operating system and the CPU will talk to it and say hey let's do some authentication here and it's a separate entity so overall I'm pretty impressed with what the Sundering 845 is offering in terms of the specifications got the latest CPU or using dynamic from arm you've got the latest GPU from quark on themselves and on top of that you've got the DSP and the ISP and the acoustic chip audio processor and then you've got the security processor you've got access to eight gigabytes of lpddr4 Ram it looks really really impressive cause we won't know how impressive it truly is until we see phones launched next year but talking of phones being launched Qualcomm did make it very clear that this chip is optimized for Android and for Windows running on arm so with this year we've just seen the launch of the laptops running Windows on the snapdragon 835 and next year absolutely we're gonna see laptops running windows on the snapdragon 845

hey it's Josh Vergara what's going on everybody and we're here talking about the Galaxy S nine and I'm sure you've seen a lot of our coverage already on Samsung's newest flagship but we wanted to get some of our friends together and ask them their thoughts on it and let's say 20 seconds or less so why don't we go ahead and get started hi Amy so gadget match I've always liked the idea of an emojis and I feel like a are emojis are also a great idea I feel like this the direction that all phones should go I love that they have a very very detailed makeup and beauty mode and also the fact that there's a lavender phone I feel like Samsung is going into the whole market where hey it's David Emmel I am not particularly happy with the Samsung Galaxy S 9 because it just feels like it's a rehash of the Galaxy S a with new software features and new software features could always be added via update so I'm you know I kind of wish that they went for a new body design but I understand that they want to wait for the 10th iteration to make that huge huge huge design change but you're gonna ask the question hyuh metal rivera was pocket now I love the conservative design I feel that that as I needed to stick a little longer I loved dual cameras I wish they did wide-angle but the mechanical aperture is great software seems good I feel that it's promising I like that Samsung is not copying another company to get its way that's me I think we can reduce yourself hey guys it's John Bosco here with bone area formerly of pain for me it's more of an SMS device and nothing else an emojis kind of novel messing me up I did both man female and male I messed up my hair both times so it is what it is to me it's just an incremental upgrade but I pass on it probably so alright perfect alright on to the next one nobody understands what variable aperture even is photographers when they want to have different apertures because they're really good at photography they're not gonna go 1.5 to 2.4 they're gonna go like 1 point 5 to 8 ring if you really care about photography that's too small of a gap I don't even understand what the point of that variable aperture even is hi I'm Michael Josh from gadget matcom it's iterative but that's okay it's still one of the best looking phones out there the camera technology many people might not appreciate but it's actually been improved and emojis or AR emojis not so good not so nice I like the new color and I only my only problem is that it's so expensive I'm Daniel beta I'm managing editor of Android central more of the same it's still gonna be one of the best and most popular phones of the year Samsung knows what it's doing and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that camera needs to be the best if it's not not gonna fly for the majority of people who want that feature and for me that's my my biggest and most important compromise hey I'm Chris Velasco from Engadget and Josh I guess you want to ask me a question or something that's a relatively innovative like the dual camera idea in theory at least in terms of the aperture I'm not super sold on it frankly I'd rather have 10 Nokia ones boom done I don't even need the rest of the time 10 no Kia woods man think about it that's a combined total of 15 megapixels 50 megapixels 10 Nokia ones actually that's less than what you pay for a galaxy s 9 God fine hey guys david from the unlocker i think it's a nice little upgrade over the essence and the SI plus it feels a little more solid there's something bout the design it feels a little heavier and more dense which I like the intelligent unlock actually works really well which I'm surprised by the camera has a nice bump in spec it does really well low-light shots so long as things aren't moving there's by hello I'm sure Lynn reviews editor at ain't gadget we're talking in the press room right now so we've got very quiet okay it looks exactly the same and the selfie camera has not changed all that much I don't really like that I need better selfies of all ways and all the time the makeup thing is not the best I've tried other apps and they're a lot better I do love me some they are emojis because it looks more like me then people of other ethnic types have tried the air in you dude all right now the Samsung booth is behind me and I'm walking away from it right now but I'm gonna go ahead and do my twenty seconds right and now the best part about the Galaxy S nine is definitely all in the camera especially the mechanical aperture now this is a factual hardware physical feature that DSLRs have that now is on a smartphone and I think that's incredible and the only reason why I love that is because more smart phones of the future are going to be able to implement that and it's something that we can see improve over time and that's 20 seconds already you got to get the gist of it anyway in any case keep it tuned to Android or e for all of the best from MWC 2018 including all of our coverage on the samsung galaxy s 9 from there you can just stay tuned because we are of course your source for all things Android at MWC 2018 oh yeah I'm Nicole Scott for mobile geeks I don't want to

[Music] how's it going everyone I'm Adam Alina so it seems like just yesterday that Google announced two new Google home speakers the mini and the Mac's but that was actually way back in September of 2017 we were completely different people back then now that the Mac's is finally available we can actually answer the question that everyone's been asking since the announcement bucks why would I spend that on a smart speaker why can't I just get the $49 whole mini and call it a day is the whole Mac's really that much better well that's what I'm here to answer so this is the Google home X I know pretty right it's clear that Google put a little more thought into the aesthetics of the speaker the overall design is super minimalist with no buttons to speak of only a mute switch on the back and a touch sensitive control panel up top designated by a thin line whether I have the speaker in the kitchen or on top of a bookshelf in my living room and blend it in perfectly it just became the thing that I can forget about and tell to play music or ask questions and this was the white version if you get the all black color you'll get an even more discreet speaker so at eleven point seven pounds the speaker isn't light so if you were hoping to throw this in your backpack on the way to your friend's house think again pick a spot you like and leave it there the dimensions are roughly 13 by 7 point 4 by 6 inches and it's made of the same kind of hard plastic that you'll find on the OG Google home and smaller home Mini the biggest difference in build materials between them is the fabric that you'll find on the front of the home max which is unique to the home acts not only does it feel good to scratch but it's what Google calls acoustically transparent which basically means it won't interfere with how the sound waves are coming out of the speaker along the back below the mute switch you'll get a power input a USB type-c input and a 3.5 millimeter input so yes if you want to plug in your own gear and make some sick beats with the speaker you can now the home max comes with a little bass pad which sticks to the bottom of the speaker and because the speaker can be oriented horizontally or vertically you will have to pay attention to which way you place it it has to be placed so that the touch controls I either on top or on the right side otherwise you might get this warning that it's upside down by the way the Google home is upside down it'll work best if you turn it over that touch-sensitive strip is basically used for playback controls if you don't feel like using your voice you can swipe to adjust volume and tap to pause or play but unfortunately you'll still have to ask Google to skip to the next song or return to a previous one so I'd note while I'm on the subject I don't know if I have it setup wrong or something but every time I tell the Google home max to put a song and repeat it straight up lies to me it says that the song is on repeat but then when the song finishes it'll just go on playing the next song so along with chromecast built-in and Wi-Fi the Google home max has bluetooth 4.2 built into it so if a friend comes over and you don't feel like sharing your Wi-Fi password for whatever reason they can still connect to the speaker and play music now if you've ever owned the Google home product before the main way you're supposed to interact with it is with your voice and in that respect there's not much new here you can also ask it questions or control compatible smart home devices if you haven't one issue that I didn't really like was that when I was asking to cast Joe Hindi's latest upcoming games video it was a bit slow to show up on my TV but I really didn't like how someone in the comments of that video so that no one likes Harry Potter thumbs up if you know what this means digging further into the Google home set up you'll be able to customize your preferences like your preferred music streaming service including Spotify Pandora and of course Google Play Music or even what kind of news stories you want to hear at the beginning of the day now again these are all technically features that are available on any of the Google home speakers so why by the max well one feature that's unique to the max is the ability to sync up two of them for a stereo pair so if you want to drop a cool $800 on smart speakers you'll have a pretty badass listening station if you're looking for more of a multi-room audio solution you can of course group a few of these together which I have to admit is pretty cool with the home max at the center of the two minis that I have but one issue that I did find consistently was that after a certain volume the microphones in the Google home max just couldn't pick up my voice every time I said the hot work at a hundred percent volume I found myself literally screaming at it to try and get it to stop so it made me think of a super unscientific test basically I recorded myself saying the hot word hey Google at a normal speaking voice and played that clip from a Bluetooth speaker at distances of 5 10 15 and 20 feet all while the speaker was playing the song Havana by Camila Cabello at varying volumes you can see the results for yourself after I passed 50% volume it was really hit or miss and compared to my real life usage I actually thought these results were pretty good to be honest there were times where the music was definitely not louder than 50% and it still couldn't hear what I was saying even if I was standing only a few feet away I don't know what's going on with these mics but it definitely gets a little annoying but the best part of the speaker the reason that you'll probably want to buy it the reason that it's so much better than the whole mini and the reason that I think it's amazing is the sound quality the Google home max sounds really good the base notes are definitely emphasized enough to give them that mainstream bump that so many people will appreciate but it stays well away from beats territory thankfully Google emphasized those low frequencies a little too much for my personal taste but most people will easily enjoy it because of how well-defined it is in a song Moon River by Frank ocean the low e-string is a little too strong for my taste but it does give the song some grittiness and never gets in the way of his vocals in the mid-range which is what counts the bass pad also keeps the rumbling of the speaker from disturbing anything around it and the whole max has 6 internal microphones to detect in real-time how much of its sound waves are being reflected off nearby surfaces and then it corrects for that with an EQ that's built in so you won't need to go into any eq settings on your own because the Google algorithm does it for you now whether that lack of control is a good or a bad thing is up to you since you can't really tweak it but I found it to at least be consistent wherever the speaker was placed the low end didn't drastically change those low end frequencies don't overpower the mids at all and when paired with how loud this thing can get it's perfect for powering your parties that said it sounded good even when playing music at low volumes and I ended up using it to play music in the background throughout my day vocals in the song generator 2nd floor by freelance whales we're still plainly audible even with all of the other instruments joining in during the course at around 2 minutes 17 seconds which included plenty of thumping drums and bells ringing throughout speaking of the bells one of my only issues regarding sound quality it had to do with the high end frequencies it sounds like Google played it safe here and didn't give them the same kind of emphasis as they did with the lows which is understandable because when is the last time you heard someone say drop the bells and max volume nothing really distorts which is good but there also isn't a ton of reverb to high hats and cymbals which can really help with the sound stage of the music and I've owned the Google home basically since it was released and thanks to Black Friday sales I have two of the Google home minis but besides setting timers while cooking asking it basic math questions when I'm feeling lazy or setting alarms I never found any of them particularly useful I definitely don't use them when listening to music because the sound quality is mad at best but I found myself using the Google home max constantly whether it was just to play background music while I worked or to stream YouTube videos to my TV or just listening to podcasts the home X weaved its way into my life in a way that none of the other home speakers have so even though it's a terrible listener I have no problem saying that anyone looking for a smart speaker who values sound quality will probably really love the Google home max and a way that I don't think anyone loved to the other two Google home products but I guess only time will tell and that's it for our review guys thanks for watching make sure to check out the full review over at android authority comm now you know the spiel I'm about to give hit the subscribe button

the huawei mate ten series is all about promises the promise of AI in your smartphone the promise of a rising star in the industry and the promise of a better long-term future for your device well where's being hot on the heels of Samsung for many years now slowly increasing its global market and its Western mind share in fact it's no stretch to say that while way rather than Samsung is now the premier innovator in the smartphone space and the huawei mate ten series a very promising example of where Huawei is headed while way is essentially marketing these phones around four main selling points the display the camera battery and AI base performance the display is the first point of difference between the two phones both comprised metal frame sandwiched between sheets of Gorilla Glass with Huawei's new signature stripe highlighting the dual wiper engineered cameras there are departure from wild ways typical metal phones but they fall in line with the current 2017 flagship trend will be it without the addition of wireless charging on the upside you now have a place to store your fingerprint collection the mate zone pro is the more expensive version with an eighteen to nine aspect ratio OLED display and up to six gig of ram in 128 gig of storage the mate 10 sticks with an IPS LCD at 16 to 9 resolution with 4 gig of ram and 64 gig of storage while the mate tens dual SIM slot can be used for microSD expansion the pro version only supports dual SIM both models have HDR 10 displays and while there's still not too much mobile HDR content around right now there will be over the lifetime of these phones both panels hit 713 it's in brightness but the make 10 pros OLED panel producers punchy of colors and white of whites for some reason why we chose to put a full HD plus resolution panel on the pro version while the regular may 10 gets a quad HD panel meaning the regular May 10 has higher pixel density but unless quad HD is really important to you you won't be disappointed by the Pro versions panel plus the combination of the brand new 10 nanometer chipset Aoi battery management and OLED display with a black theme and lower resolution means if you're all about battery life you can squeeze even more battery out of the pro version on my best day I managed to hit around 6 hours of screen on time while I was inside and had the brightness set to around 40% obviously your mileage may vary depending on how you use your phone and how bright you have your screen but that number generally hovers around 4 to 5 hours speaking of the battery both units come with a four thousand milliamp hour cell with Huawei supercharged with the phone turned off you can charge a third of the battery in 15 minutes a little over half in half an hour and around 85 to 90 percent in a full 60 minutes Huawei is taking Samsung's misfortunes to heart and has stepped up its battery safety as well having its fast charging solution certified by TUV Rheinland the battery is also the first place we see a eye on the may 10 hey i power battery management promises the world much like while weighs born fast a fast mantra but like that performance over time promise you're going to have to wait until the huawei mate n learns all of your habits only then can it better allocate resources to eke out more battery life for your particular style of usage of course this will only happen or not long after you've dropped your cash on it but history has shown that while waste combination of a large battery great fast charging and solid battery management means that May 10 and May 10 Pro will likely be among the best battery performers of the year now as you may have guessed AI plays a pretty big part in the performance of the may 10 to the Kiran 917 chipset has a dedicated neural processing unit that handles complex processing tasks on device rather than in the cloud but it must be noted that AI has a prominent but limited place on the May 10 I wouldn't go so far as to say it's pure marketing but the benefits of AI and the NP you will only really be felt over time as there are precious few features using their full capabilities right now whywe assures me that more will be delivered over time not held off until the next device in the series Google Translate will soon join Microsoft's Translate app which uses the mp4 near-instant photo based translation and the 13 objects in scenes the camera can currently recognize to automatically adjust settings will increase as the NPU image database expands Google's AR core will arrive via an update later this year and the neural network ap eyes are coming next year the curé 970 is also being positioned as an open AI platform for developers meaning further applications to tap its full potential are sure to arrive in time but for now the NP you and AI kind of sit in the background speeding up some parts of the experience totally learning your habits suggesting smart tips based on context awareness and generally just promising more benefits in future I primarily use the May 10 Pro during this review and found the experience to be reliably fast if not light-years ahead as the a I promise might have you believe they experience the usual stutters and glitches coming into any phone and had a few issues with Google Apps playing nice with emui the main tends run android 8.0 oreo out of the box with emu i ate on top several oreo features are on board like notification dots launch app shortcuts smart text selection and picture-in-picture mode but while we can't exactly be relied upon for the most faithful implementation of google features and several others don't make it at all including adaptive icons and notification channels fortunately oreo brings with us the promise of project treble meaning that updates in the future shouldn't be a sluggish as they have been in Huawei's past while way is even said as much with two years of guaranteed updates and at least one major Android version bump as always huawei like the Samsung of old makes up for it by loading on more software features than you can poke a stick at perhaps the biggest ticket feature on the may 10 and a big middle finger to Samsung is a Doppler desktop mode you just need a USB type-c to HDMI cable with DisplayPort support and you can plug your phone directly into a monitor lore'l lets you attach various peripherals like a bluetooth mouse and keyboard where you can use the phone as a kind of trackpad to get you through a presentation it's a little sluggish but it works any calls or messages that come in while in desktop mode will still be handled by the phone and not show up on screen to maintain your privacy it's a little weird to get used to but a handy option to have and it'll be interesting to see where this kind of functionality goes in the future other software features include smart split screen so if you're watching a video or playing a game and a message comes in the main tone will let you jump into split screen mode so you can do two things at once now if snooping is an issue for you you can register a fingerprint which accesses a whole other version of your phone that way you can keep your dirty secret secret by unlocking your phone with your clean finger or pattern a floating navigation dope lets you open up all that screen real estate by using a floating bubble that works much like fingerprint scanner gestures to control navigation without the usual on-screen buttons now can go on endlessly about the specifics of huawei software features but if you want to read the full review head on down to the video description because now I want to move on to the camera which I firmly believe is the most impressive part of the May 10 series 2f 1.6 summer Lux HD lenses sit on the back of both mate a 20 megapixel monochrome sensor and a 12 megapixel RGB sensor four-way what I focus is very reliable and oh is on the RGB lens helps with image stabilization especially in low-light conditions I found the photos out of the may tend to be generally very good well you get some impressive shots out of the mate nine if you were using full manual controls the may tenant offers the same level of quality but in auto mode bringing Huawei's photography potential mainstream low-light photography especially was impressive with very little noise or visible brain it has to be noted though that the May 10th ends to crush blacks in its attempt to stamp out noise altogether making most nighttime photos look good but visibly darker than the actual scene depending on how you feel about noise versus overall lightness you'll either love or hate flyaways approach here other phones like the pixel to try really hard to lighten the scenes that tend to add much more noise than you'll find on the may 10 some of this no doubt has to do with the AI scene recognition which you can thankfully override but only by using the manual controls or choosing another preset like HDR which is not my ideal solution if you don't like the a I assisted results a simple toggle in the camera app for disabling AI scene recognition would be a much better idea but IIM the camera is not all bad though io motion detection means capturing moving subjects without blur is quite easy with the maintain able to capture action shots without any visible movement even in pretty poor lighting the scene recognition works very reliably to automatically adjusting settings to best capture the subject or scene it'll just depend on whether you agree with the AI or not on what constitutes the best settings the only real problem I had with the may 10 camera was over sharpening the sharpening in some shots tends to make the result look too fake take this dog photo where everything is a little too sharp and to look lifelike then there's this one where everything pans out perfectly this kind of variability is emblematic of the may 10 camera performance for me multiple shots taken one after the other can often produce very different results in HDR mode to the HDR version would occasionally lighten the shadows as you'd expect it to but in others that would produce darker shadows than the original shot you'll always get at least one photo that is fantastic but I definitely recommend always firing off a couple just to be sure in good lighting the may 10 shoots great shots like any other high-end smartphone the monochrome sensor doesn't always seem to provide that much extra detail though making me wonder how much more fun the may 10 camera could if it had a wide-angle lens like the LGP 30 or a 2x zoom lens like the note 8 hey I also helped provide a 2x hybrid zoom which produces results a lot more like those you'd find on the pixel with more noise but a lighter palette and more detail in the shadows it definitely produces better detail than a crop 10 standard shot what remote is very reliable if not perfect and wide aperture mode has improved since the Mait 9 to both understandably look a little fake but are perfectly good for a new profile pic or social share if while waist cameras put you off in the past for being too complicated the may 10 rectify that situation bringing very impressive results to a point-and-shoot audience there's a little bit of character to the may 10 camera that you'll have to learn to love but if that doesn't put you off then it's a very capable shooter there's a whole laundry list of other firsts and improvements on the mate 10m 810 Pro from dual 4G voice over LTE and cat 18 LTE to AI voice recognition and noise cancellation and calls both devices have stereo speakers courtesy of bottom firing grill and the earpiece speaker but at max volume which hits around 80 decibels the sound gets too tinny for my liking especially from the earpiece and the headphone experience is much better support for lossless 32 bit audio at 384 kilohertz is a nice touch of overkill but the presence of high-end codecs in norio will not be enough to satisfy potential mate 10 pro buyers who prefer wired headphones fortunately you can always use the included types of earbuds all live the dongle life and enjoy Huawei's audio tuning on your favorite set of cans water resistance qHD panels headphone ports and microSD expansion of the stalwarts of smartphone shopping but by mixing and matching features so randomly there's no obvious winner here at 699 euros the May 10 has all the regular bases covered but at 799 euros the mate 10 pro is in some ways superior well in other ways not as feature-rich it'll be the only version to make it to the US though with global pricing and availability coming soon despite a few questionable choices the maintainer May 10 Pro are really nice phones and while they may not yet be meeting Samsung head-to-head they're a positive step in that direction if while we manages to come through on any or even all of the promises that's made with the may 10 series then they're guaranteed to get better over time as

so this is the Sony Xperia XE one compact it's the smaller version of the regular XZ one but it doesn't skimp out on the spec sheet and for the most part offers the same experience as the XZ one with very few compromises the phone features the same hardware the same specs the same camera and the same software there are however some key differences between the XE one compact and the standard XE one the most obvious one being the phone size and its design the XZ 1 compact has a flatter more boxy and rectangular design and has a closer resemblance to older Sony phones whereas the standard XZ 1 while still a rectangular slab overall featured more aggressive tapers and curves the other difference is in the phone's build materials while the standard XE one has an all-metal body the XE one compact switches that out for mostly plastic but it does have some metal on the top and bottom portions of the phone despite the plastic build the phone doesn't feel cheap in the hand and it has a satin like finish so it's not slippery at all and doesn't attract any fingerprints it's not the prettiest or most forward-looking design but if you like Sony smartphone designs you're probably not going to have any complaints about it the main attraction to the XE one compact or any of the previous smartphones from the compact line is the smaller size and compared to every other smartphone released in 2017 this thing feels extremely tiny even with the chunky bezels after using so many large smartphones it's always kind of refreshing to go back to the phone that fits so easily in the palm of your hand and it's nice to be able to reach every corner of the screen without having to awkwardly shuffle the phone around or use two hands a smaller phone obviously means the screen is going to be a lot smaller and that's one of the downsides of using the XE one compact at least when it comes to media consumption purposes watching YouTube videos and playing games can feel a little bit cramped since you don't have a whole lot of screen real estate to work with it's a four point six inch LCD which is a little over a half an inch smaller than B standard xz1 and the screen resolution has been dropped down from 1080p to 720p after using a lot of quad HD displays I can definitely see a difference but 720p resolution works perfectly fine on the smaller screen it's sharp enough that reading text or browsing the web is still a comfortable experience and the overall quality of the screen is pretty good it has good viewing angles vibrant colors and Sony software lets you tweak the saturation contrast and white balance to how you want the screen to look everything else on the XZ 1 compact is pretty much identical to the regular XE wan for starters there's a three and a half millimeter headphone jacks so no adapters required here and like many other Sony phones their support for Sony's proprietary audio technology that will upscale compress music codecs to give you a closer to high-res sound and you have support for other high res audio codecs like flak and L DAC the phone also comes with front-facing stereo speakers so while the top and bottom chin are pretty big they at least have a purpose they sound pretty clean without any distortion I just wish they were a tad louder because they sound pretty quiet for front-facing speakers but it's still nice to have a stereo pair especially on such a small phone there's 32 gigabytes of storage onboard and a micro SD card slot for extra storage and like most phones in 2017 its IP 68 certified against water and dust there's a fingerprint sensor embedded in the side mounted power key but just like every other Sony phone released in the last few years this function isn't available on US models so your only means of security is either through a pattern or pin the guts of the xz1 compact is your typical 2017 flagship specs with the snapdragon 835 processor and 4 gigabytes of RAM and as expected the phone performs very well in daily use it's fluid and responsive it's fast to load apps and play games and the 720p display probably helps out quite a bit with the phone's performance as well since there's less strain on the processor even though the XE one compact is smaller than the XZ one it still has the same size 2700 milliamp hour battery but battery life is significantly better and this is again because of that 720p display the XE one compact easily last me two days regardless of how light or how heavy I use the phone and screen on time was always a pretty consistent 5 to 6 hours which is pretty impressive for a phone this small and a battery of this size even though the phone has a plastic body there's no wireless charging but you do have these standard quick charge 3.0 for fast top offs or Phillips with the exception of the front-facing camera the camera experience on the XZ 1 Compaq is pretty much identical to the xz1 it has the same 19 megapixel Exmor sensor on the back with five axis image stabilization 4k video recording and slow-motion video at 960 frames per second the front-facing camera is lower resolution at 8 megapixels instead of the 13 that's on the XZ 1 but it's still perfectly fine for taking selfies and it's a wide angle so it's easy to fit more into the frame but there is some slight barrel distortion along the edges sony dubs the rear camera motion eye because it can predictably capture unexpected motion and the way it works is pretty simple when the camera detects any motion such as a person running or a moving car while you're taking a photo the camera will automatically take a few photos on top of the one that you take yourself and from that point you can pick which one looks best it's really helpful when you're trying to quickly capture that perfect moment and having several photos to pick from certainly increases your odds of doing that the other standout feature with this camera is the new 3d scanning capabilities and if you saw the EXCI one review you already know how well this works you can scan people's faces food or anything you want really and currently these scans can be used as wallpapers turn into gifs and share to social media and the scans are very very accurate and detailed as long as you do them in well-lit areas the scans can also be printed off through a 3d printer or you can order a print of your scan through the 3d creator app from shapeways or sculpt Theo which are a couple of companies that Sony has partnered with the same camera and same image processing also means the same image quality it's a decent camera and you can get some pretty nice looking shots out of it in good lighting with pleasant looking colors and good detail but dynamic range is really lacking especially in the shadows not having optical image stabilization really hurts the image quality and low-light photos don't look quite as sharp as they could be and they look overly processed that noise and artifacting is extremely noticeable on the software side of things the XZ one compact runs Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box and most if not all the features of Oreo remain intact like notification dots native picture and picture improved visual tweaks better auto fill API etc and it has Sony's usual skin on top of Android but the experience is pretty close to stock so nice skin does feel slightly outdated in some aspects like the app drawer for example is still open with a button in the dock instead of a swipe up but you do get some nice features from Sony like customizable themes and PlayStation integration and the phone is pretty free of bloatware aside from the typical suite of Sony apps the Xperia XE one compact starts at $600 unlocked and is available through retailers like Best Buy or Amazon and you're probably thinking $600 sounds pretty steep and comparatively it is when you can get phones for equal or lesser price that offer more for the money what it really boils down to is how much you value one-handed usability and there's not a lot of phones out there that offer the power of the XE one compact in the small form factor after all there are people out there who still want a powerful Android phone that isn't massive in size so if the XE one compact fulfills your wants and needs in an Android phone the $600 could be worth your investment so that wraps up our review of the sony

hello again ladies and gentlemen i'm joe hindi the android authority app guy and it's about that time of the month to round up the best new android apps that were released in September of 2017 and it was actually a pretty decent month being my eyes is a volunteer app it helps blind people with problems that are easily solved by people with normal vision here's how it works both blind and sighted people sign up for the service whenever a blind person needs help with something they call the service and a sighted person answers to assist it currently boasts around 50,000 blind people and 500,000 volunteers however the blind are encouraged to use the service as often as needed so no amount of volunteers is too many the app and the service are both entirely free direct chat is a chat companion app it doesn't send or receive messages on its own however it does allow the chat heads feature on almost any messaging service there are a variety of customization options and they help prevent issues like overcrowding what a bunch of chat apps are present it does seem to work fairly well although there are a few bugs here and there the free version does have advertising while the paid version is ad free along with some additional features Google assistant is a weird new app it doesn't house Google assistant or anything special like that's however it does offer one tap access that inexplicably wasn't available before the application works by opening Google assistant as soon as you tap on the icon as opposed to opening the google app and then finding it there and that's about all that the app does it makes it easier to find and gives assistant a proper spot on your home screen or your dock otherwise it doesn't do anything else yet Google family link is a new application for parents the application shows parents what their kids are doing on their smartphones additionally it gives parents a little more power over those smartphones and parents can do things like check usage lock the phone and monitor other vital stats it's a real pain in the rear end to set it up however it does seem to work okay once it is we recommend you keep this one on your radar at the very least launch air launcher is a new free open-source launcher it looks and feels a whole lot like Google's pixel launcher that includes similar home screens afters and Google now access the launcher also adds icon pack supports various customization options adaptive icons for Android 7.0 and up as well as a lot more the application is in beta right now and that means there are bugs however it still works rather well it should also remain free in perpetuity facebook Messenger light isn't technically new however it is finally out in first world countries like the UK US Canada and Ireland this is great news because facebook Messenger Lite is a lighter easier and more data friendly alternative to the normal Facebook Messenger app it rips out a lot of the useless features and bloat and what's left is a basic experience with material design chat functionality and call support it's also entirely free and highly recommended over the regular app Microsoft edge is the mobile version of Microsoft's desktop browser it features all of the usual stuff like an incognito mode browsing history favorites and other stuff it can also sync to the PC version and also save things to read later it is in beta right now and that means that there are some features that aren't available and there are also some bugs this one should be a pretty good browser once is officially out Microsoft launcher is Microsoft's new launcher obviously it's a rebranding of arrow launcher but it's not just a flat rebranding there are some new tricks here the launcher removes Wunderlist support in favour of Microsoft to-do list app there is also a new newsfeed functionality along with some other smaller features it's in beta right now and there are a few bugs and some jumpiness to the launcher but we expect it to improve a lot in the coming months movies anywhere maybe one of the most important applications released in 2017 it lets you watch movies from Amazon iTunes Google Play Movies and Vudu you simply log in with all your various accounts and all of your movies are readily available in one spot the application also comes with a decent UI chromecast support and more it's an essential application for movie fans especially those who buy movies across multiple services there are some bugs but it is new so that's to be expected this is going to be a very big deal streak complete is a new crowdsource app for OpenStreetMap the idea is actually pretty simple the application asks you a bunch of questions about your immediate vicinity you answer those questions and those answers help open Reeth map and prove some of the questions include things like speed limits for various streets building addresses park purposes and a bunch of other stuff the application is easy enough to use however you do need an Open Street Map account linked before it lets you answer any questions and that about does it for this one folks if you want to check out any of these apps for yourself you can

the owner 6x was released just over a year ago and was very well received for its 250 dollar price point it had impressive specs and became the phone to beat for budget-conscious buyers now honor is back with the 7x bringing an updated 2017 design better camera and faster processor but can it still compete with the other budget devices out today the honor 7x has a very premium look and feel much like the honor 8 Pro it uses an all-metal chassis with nicely rounded corners and it's near 6-inch display is still quite manageable thanks to minimal bezels while the screen isn't 2k that's fair enough for a budget device rather this is a full HD Plus LCD panel but it's got nice vivid colors and sufficiently high pixel density for most folks in keeping with 2017 trends the 5.9 3-inch screen uses an 18 to 9 aspect ratio with an 83% screen to body ratio that's up there with the flagship crowd while we've grown accustomed to this look on more expensive phones it's always nice to see on such an affordable device the current 659 octa-core chipset is paired with the mali t 830 GPU for some power sipping pixel pushing globally will see a 64 gig version with 4 gig of ram while the US will get 32 and 3 both versions have microSD expandable storage up to 256 gigabytes but neither is water-resistant and there's no wireless charging here nor NFC for Android pay like the 6x the honor 7x sports a dual lens camera the main shooter is 16 megapixels while the secondary 2 megapixel camera is there to provide portrait mode bokeh unfortunately this doesn't work quite as well as the more expensive competition and we were slightly disappointed with the depth effect however improvements can always be made later with a software update the 16 megapixel camera with phase detection autofocus lacks some color accuracy but otherwise holds up pretty well and is still capable of getting some nice-looking shots with good sharpness there's also a beefy 8 megapixel front facing camera with portrait mode for the selfie inclined as a fingerprint sensor around the back a single bottom firing speaker and that most elusive and sought-after of 2017 features the headphone jack battery capacity remains the same as the 6 X at 3340 milliamp hours charged via microUSB rather than USB type-c full cost-cutting purposes we'll bring you more amana seven x's battery and camera in the full review so stay tuned for that the honor 7x runs Android new get it launched with the usual promises of an update to Android Oreo as soon as possible it'll be available in black blue or gold and while we don't have official pricing yet the interweb rumor mill has it pegged in the low 200s but we'll give the honor 7x a full run for its money over the coming days it does make quite a good first impression from its contemporary design and full screen display to its metal build and dual cameras as cheap phones get increasingly good the feature gap between flagships and mid ranges continues to shrink even as price differences only seem to get bigger yana 7x is one of an increasing number of devices aiming to buck that trend and we're happy to see it thanks so much for joining us hit that like and subscribe button ring the bell for upload notifications download the android authority up so what's up on social and keep it locked to android authority comm because we are your source for all things Android 
hey it's Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and we have a bit of a different one for you here we thought about taking a look at the galaxy s 9 and putting up against while one of its main competitors and has been a while since we featured an iPhone on Android authority of course but we thought this would be a good time to take a look at the iPhone 10 and maybe expound on what Samsung might be doing in the future after all the next one is going to be the S 10 but there are a couple of different takes on a number of different aspects of a smartphone when you take a look at these two side-by-side we're using the samsung galaxy s 9 plus in this case because it has the most features compared to the iPhone 10 which is a little bit smaller but still packs as much as possible in terms of design the iPhone 10 did have to go a little bit more radical for its anniversary device and we expect that Samsung will probably do the same thing but you could let us know what you think about that in the comments down below the iPhone 10 is a radical difference from the arrests of the iPhone line especially since the iPhone 6 with its metal design this one is glass on glass and it does have a different look not only for the lack of a home button up front but also for the dual camera on the back now speaking of the lack of a home button you don't really have any buttons at all on the iPhone 10 everything is done via swipes from either below the screen or from above the screen to get to the control center and then of course if we're gonna talk about the top of the screen then of course there is the notch let us know what you think about the notch and the comments down below obviously everyone has differing opinions on it but the one thing we will mention here is that even if Samsung is using a large screen the infinity display with soft keys on there at least there's nothing impeding the full screen experience on the iPhone 10 even what games like Tekken like I'm playing right here on either phone the knotch actually cuts into the content a little bit which might be a bit annoying to some people but on the other end of the spectrum the Samsung Galaxy S 9 probably had to be at least familiar to any users who have been using their phones in the last couple of years that way they would be able to rekindle or rather recapture the user base that they have had ever since the Samsung Galaxy s6 era you of course have iOS which requires very different specifications when compared to Android it's the Android device that will seem much more powerful because of its high levels of RAM its snapdragon 845 especially in the case of the samsung galaxy s 9 and from there you have high amounts of storage and expandable memory for example things that the iPhone 10 generally does not have and there are people that have said historically that space tends to be an issue when it comes to their iOS devices you have the camera and on the back of the iPhone 10 there is a dual end setup with one of them being a telephoto lens this is obviously a trend that was followed by Android a little bit later on and the galaxy s 9 plus follows suit it also has a telephoto lens but we have to say that the s 9 is trying to move forward in the camera game by bringing some hardware physical features to the smartphone lens no matter which s 9 you get the main camera not the telephoto lens that is only found on the s 9 plus has a dual aperture that allows for more light to flood in when using at F 1.5 and then you are able to get a much wider field of focus when you use the F 2.4 aperture and you can set that in the camera app the galaxy s 9 does boast the 4k 60 frame per second capture that also translates to 960 frames per second capture for super slo-mo on the other hand the iPhone 10 tends to have less Pro controls but you can always download an app for that but inside of the camera application the built-in one you are able to get some pretty good shots from there with all of the settings pretty much put on Auto there are a number of different modes that you can select like slo-mo panorama even a square mode if you're an instagramer and from there you'll be able to get some pretty nice photos using either the back or the front camera but the front camera of the iPhone 10 does allow for a specific portrait mode that gives you different lighting options it also tracks your face using a different camera array which is used for things like face ID face ID is a little bit different when compared to the intelligent scan of the samsung galaxy s 9 which uses a combination of the iris scanner and also face unlock in order to provide a seamless experience no matter what you're doing as long as you're looking at your phone when waking it up but now we can get into one of the main differences between the two and it just has to do with how much fun you can have with it different kinds of emojis the iPhone 10 brings an emojis and you can say that it was the first one to think up of this idea because you have these little characters that you access by going to some sort of messaging application it's not built into the camera and you just move your head around and the same technology that gives you face ID allows you to have basically one-to-one movement with the character including your mouth your eyes and your voice because you can record a message as one of these little characters take for what you will you might have your own opinion when it comes to an emoji but Samsung has gone ahead and made their version of one called a our emojis a are emojis basically lets you take a picture of your face and it will use recognition to create an avatar of sorts for you it's more of a caricature than a completely accurate depiction of you but you can also do the same thing there but you can customize it to your liking put some different clothing on there even change the color of various elements and you can turn on your AR emoji when using the front-facing camera so you can record your own videos with it with one-to-one recognition it might seem a little bit buggy at first we're sure that this is going to get improved in the future but it's another fun way of showing off a digital version of yourself it even saves eighteen predetermined gifts that use your avatar to convey a number of different emotions and finally the Battle of assistance you have Bigsby on the samsung galaxy s nine which has been getting a lot of updates which allows it to do more than just be a voice assistant which in a way is what Siri is Siri is just available on the iPhone 10 and it allows you to use your voice and to talk to the phone in order to get a number of tasks done however Bixby tries to take that a step further with Bigsby vision and a number of other functions Bixby vision in particular does tried to find items in a sort of reversed image search fashion in order to tell you where you can maybe shop for stuff or it might be able to tell you what kind of food is right in front of you there are a number of enhancements in Bixby and no matter what your opinion is on there it is trying to be an all-around assistance so throughout this video you've heard me say that you should sound off in the comments down below about where these two phones kind of sit in the mobile tech space we definitely want to hear from you about how you feel about these two devices whether or not the Galaxy S nine is being more reactive to the things that the iPhone 10 introduced or maybe they are just two separate devices that are trying to do very similar things but it remains that you probably have your opinion about either of these devices and you know which one you're going to get if you happen to be on the fence though you can have that dialogue with us in the comments and we'll see what we might be able to provide in a future comparison where we put these two phones head-to-head especially when it comes to their cameras so that was just a quick look at these two devices we will do a more full Harrison later on you can find that either here on the channel or on Android or e-comm you can argue that these are the two hottest devices out there right now and of course we're going to see what the future updates will show us from these two companies the iPhone 10 was obviously a radical change and the s10 from Samsung is probably gonna have some sort of radical change as well after all that's apparently what Tennant years does to a company in any case you can keep it into Android 34 more about these two phones and more about the Galaxy S 9 in particular and you can head over to Android 30.com for all of that great coverage don't forget to subscribe to this channel if you haven't already so you can

[Music] [Music] I'm here with lawn and Tyler's taking a video pretty good coffee Cheers should I just be like what do you guys think about apex concepts my overall I'm trying to think how I wanna start I don't want to start with like so take 101 ok we'll cut there this is the apex concept smartphone let's take a look and see what it can do [Music] well this is the flashiest that they've ever done something like this any press conference at this show so far which is funny because my eyes are low sensitive right now they're gonna shine lights right at us give it to Sue's oh yeah this event is kind of crazy so far so we're pretty excited to see what this phone actually looks like check this out oh my god [Music] you 
so Sony is a pretty interesting company when it comes to mobile products they're not really conforming to what's going on in the industry with the bezel the screens the dual cameras and whatever else they're just sort of doing their own thing and making phones the way that they see fit and whether that's gonna work for them or work against them only time will really tell and the sony xperia x z1 is their latest flagship and it's really just more of the same from sony but this phone does have some interesting things going for it let's talk about the not so interesting stuff first if you used a sony phone within the last five or six years the design of the xz1 will look very very familiar it still has that overall boxy rectangular look but Sony has done a few things to sort of freshen up the design a little bit it has the loop design so these sides are rounded off which makes it feel a little bit more comfortable in the hand but it's still not quite as comfortable as something like a Galaxy s8 or an LG V 30 and this loop design has now been extended to the top and bottom of the phone so if you look closely the top and bottom are ever so slightly bowed out so the phone actually no longer stands vertically on its own anymore and in the hand it does feel quite nice it's completely made out of metal so it does have a very sturdy construction but the overall look of the phone just feels very dated compared to everything else we're seeing in 2017 and because sony has been using this overall design for so long it's starting to get a little bit stale at this point taking a look at the front of the xz1 the display it's not going to be the most eye-catching part about this phone the display doesn't go edge to edge it doesn't have curved glass it's just a pretty standard looking display it's 5.2 inches it's an IPS LCD with a resolution of 1080p but it is a very good-looking screen it has really nice colors really good viewing angles and it also gets plenty bright that's seeing outdoors even in direct sunlight is not an issue and the software does allow you to tweak the colors of the display you have a perfect that will give you a more natural and flatter looking image and then you have the standard mode which is the default that cranks up the vividness just a little bit and that you have a super vivid mode which really cranks up the saturation and the contrast but this was my least favorite of the three modes because it looks really unnatural so I just sort of stuck with the standard mode which is a perfect balance between the professional and the super vivid mode now the bezels surrounding the display are quite large especially along the top and bottom but Sony does make good use of these thicker bezels by giving you front-facing speakers which I do appreciate but historically Sony's front-facing speakers have been pretty weak but on the EXCI one there's a new smart amp now that's supposed to give you 50% more sound pressure and it's supposed to make the speaker's a lot louder and they definitely do sound a little bit louder but it's still not quite as loud as other phones that I've heard and they passed with front-facing speakers so while I do appreciate the stereo sound that you get with these front-facing speakers I still wish there was a little bit more volume to these speakers just in case you're wondering the xz1 does come with a headphone jack and sony has always put a pretty big emphasis on audio with their smart phone so you have a lot of support for a lot of high res audio codecs and you also have Sony's proprietary technology that can upscale any of your music to give you a closer to high-res sound on the inside the xz1 has your typical set of 2017 flagship specs so snapdragon 835 and 4 gigabytes of ram and there's not really a whole lot to say about the performance of the x8 one it performs just about as well as any other flagship with these same specs it's very fast its responsive it opens apps quickly multitasking is not a problem here either with bored gigabytes of RAM and it also plays all the graphically demanding games perfectly fine without dropping any frames so there's really no issues here at all with the performance of the XE one in terms of features it's got all the typical stuff that you might expect from a Sony flagship its IP 68 so it's protected against submersion and water or using it in the rain it has 64 gigabytes of internal storage and it also has a micro SD card slot if you need more but one thing that it does not have is a fingerprint sensor at least not if you live in the u.s. which is something sony has been doing for a while now so it's just something you have to live with now as far as battery life goes it doesn't have the biggest battery that we've ever seen in a smartphone it's 2,700 milliamp hours which sounds pretty small in 2017 but that hasn't necessarily tanked the battery life in my experience I can still get through a full day with casual use the key word here being casual and that consists of checking emails web browsing social media texting and maybe the occasional YouTube video but if you're doing more intense things like gaming a lot or you're using Sony's 3d Creator app which we will get into the phone does tend to get quite warm and in that case the battery life does go down rather quickly but for most people I think the battery life is going to be perfectly fine and of course it does have the standard quick charge 3.0 so it doesn't take a whole lot of time to top off or fill up so there's a couple of things that makes this phone interesting the camera and the software let's start with the camera first so the camera is a 19 megapixel sensor that Sony is dubbing motion I and essentially what this means is it can capture unexpected motion or emotions such as a baby smiling and basically the way this works is it will actually take three photos before the one that you take yourself if it detects there's any unexpected motion or emotion in the frame and it actually works surprisingly well and because of Sony's predictive hybrid autofocus it can capture these photos with very little to no motion blur every smartphone camera right now has its own gimmick and the xz1 is no exception and the gimmick here on the EXCI one is that you can use the camera to create 3d scans through Sony's new 3d creator app and you can scan pretty much anything that you want whether it's people's faces food or any other random object and it works surprisingly well I was surprised at how well it captures details on people's faces and how eerily similar it looked and with these 3d scans you can print them off if you have a 3d printer but even if you don't have a 3d printers Sony has partnered with some online 3d printing companies like Shapeways and sculpt do if you want to print them off yourself and they've made it really simple and easy to do through the 3d creator app and eventually you'll be able to use these 3d scans as a gaming avatar or insert yourself into a game once Sony finalizes the partnerships with those companies the most important aspect of any camera of course is the picture quality and picture quality on the EXCI one is just okay in good lighting situations you can get some pretty nice-looking shots the photos are vibrant without looking overly saturated but the camera lacks a lot of dynamic range and it really crushes the shadows that you lose a lot of detail in those areas and in low-light the photos look overly processed that it makes noise really easy to see and you get a lot of weird artifacting in places that you would not expect to see them and highlights are also very overblown you get a lot of lens flares a lot of streaking and a lot of blooming and lack of OAS really hurts the performance of this camera the software experience on the XZ one might actually surprise you a little bit because it's the very first Android phone to run 8.0 Oreo out of the box and that's gonna be a big selling point for the XE one at least until people start getting their hands on Google's brand new pixel - and of course with 8.0 Oreo you get all the Oreo features they would expect like notification dots native picture and picture support a revamp settings menu etc the list goes on and on the only thing I really don't like about these software experience on the XZ one is Sony skin on top of Android while it is very light and very close to stock it hasn't really been updated to fit the aesthetics of Oreo so hopefully Sony updates that soon because right now it does feel a little bit outdated so if you're looking to buy the Sony Xperia XE one it's available now directly through Sony or other online retailers like Best Buy and Amazon for a price of $700 and $700 isn't necessarily cheap but considering we're in the era of the thousand dollar smartphones $700 doesn't sound all too bad at this point but should you buy the sony xperia x z 1 overall it's a really solid smartphone and it does all lot of things well and it has some pretty interesting things going for as well like the 3d creator app and the fact that it's running android 8.0 oreo but that selling point is going to be relatively short-lived and i think only the most die-hard of Sony fans will really appreciate this phone so if you really enjoy sony's design you really enjoy sony's mobile products then you'll really like this phone but if you're looking for just a solid Android smartphone with some really nice features there's a ton of better options out there as always thank you guys

hey just Joshin for Gaara what's going on everybody and we want to talk about smartwatches for a second now smartwatches are still kind of a tough category to describe because there's so many of them out there and thanks to Android where we have so many of them that range from the incredibly expensive and gaudy to the easily accessible and affordable and unfortunately we can't really think of anyone Android wear watch that any of us here at Android authority really truly love there's kind of a reason for that aside from the look of the watch that you might be buying the experience of Android wear is largely the same across the board you have a lot of functions available in Android wear even some watches that are able to take calls and also respond to messages be Notification centers and there are sporty ones that rock GPS heart rate monitors and finally NFC is available for things like Android pay and that's where the tick watch came in powered by a custom version of Android mahboy hoped to separate themselves from the rest of the Android wear devices by providing a different experience that included one impressive quirk a touch-sensitive panel over on the side that you could tickle in order to scroll through all of the elements inside of the SmartWatch me personally I'm always a proponent of more input methods especially on smartwatches so you don't have to rely on just the screen to do everything well with this tick watch was able to carve out its own little space in the world of smartwatches that has become incredibly saturated but with the latest edition of the tick watch family the affordability of the device became the priority and with that mob boy put Android wear into their tick watch the result is this the take watch s and the tick watch e now before we even get to any other portion of the design we have to say that the tickle portion the touch-sensitive panel is not available on these versions of the tick watch which is a bit of a bummer because for a device called tick watch there are a couple of expectations and that is actually one of them the change to Android wears a whole different story that we'll get to later but for now just note that the tick watch S and the tick watch e are pretty much all screen all the time with the exception of the button over on the left our review units came in very particular colors the tick watch s came in this very loud a yellow green mixture of sorts and unfortunately the tick watch s already started to show signs of wear and tear even after just a few days of usage while out in Hawaii the ComTech summit now there's some obvious pitfalls to having a device that looks like this after all it doesn't really blend in very well with the outfit I have on right now it usually works more for casual and even sporty looks like this there that's more like it so obviously the tick watch s works better with the Wardrobe like this and if you're wearing a tie and maybe like a suit jacket this watch is just gonna stick out like a sore thumb but then again that's the reason why you have something like the tick watch e which looks like this there you go this is the matte black version of it and there are a couple of other ones available in the tick watch family of the e devices but this matte black one actually blends in with pretty much any wardrobe and at the same time it does still come with GPS and a heart rate monitor so you can still do some of the fitness stuff so that means that this watch will blend in better with casual clothing and with other wardrobes like the one I had earlier you might notice that we're not really showing the tick watch E as much in this video and that's because this happened to it just a couple of days into our recent trip the watch too started spazzing out as far as I know there wasn't any wear and tear or any major bumps that happened with the watch the screen just started to flicker and it had a permanent version of an Android wear card at the bottom so unfortunately the tick watch he was not the watch that we would be able to use continuously for our review so you might want to take that into consideration when it comes to the price point of the tick watch e in particular it is the cheaper one of the two devices and based upon the price point you might want to remember that your mileage may vary in terms of the QA on these devices both the tick watch S and the tick watch E have the same specifications for the most part across the board the tick watch a simply has its GPS inside of the units while the tick watch s puts the antenna inside of the proprietary bands and both also Rock the same display so despite the tick watch these problems the tick watch s shows us that the 1.4 inch OLED display works quite well for Android wear and since it's an LED panel it's able to do always-on display capabilities without taking up extra battery the rest of the specifications are also the same including mediatek processors that work well even after weeks of usage and four gigabytes of on-board storage if you want to put music files in there and listen to them without needing your phone around mob voice-o-matic any cellular cabe in order to extend battery life and they say that it would get up to two days we got about 1.5 days but we felt like we had to charge it nightly just to be sure that we didn't run out of battery in any middle of the day so what makes the s different from the e is mainly just its looks and where the GPS antenna is located because both still have heart rate monitors and you can also get pretty much the same experience when it comes to health applications in either device the health application is very Apple watch esque with its circular designs but it does do a good job of counting calories steps it is also good for doing sleep tracking but I use sleep as Android the app in Android wear in order to do that overall it does a fine job of general fitness tracking and it's nice to have these tools available on a SmartWatch whenever you do kind of want to check your vitals or at least track what you're doing but with Android wear you get an experience that is very similar to a lot of other Android wear devices they take watch s and they take watch e are very affordable but they're not that much cheaper than other devices in its same category but the tick watch S and I take watch she do come with the latest version of Android wear which come with in all of the different features like different applications also gestures and overall just to a slightly more refined design to the Android wear that we think needs a complete overhaul but it begs the question as to who really wants a SmartWatch like this after all they kind of reflect their price points the all-plastic designs of the two that we got kind of make us think that these are more like toy watches rather than true timepieces but again the price point is meant to reflect that and at 1:59 for the tick watch e and $1.99 for the tick watch s it's basically coming down to whether or not you have ever used a SmartWatch before if you never have and you don't want to use up too much of your money on any one SmartWatch this might be the one for you you can get into Android wear pretty easily thanks to mob boy and their take watch family even if what we loved about previous tick watches no longer is the case here so will this be your first SmartWatch with the original tick watches that recommendation was a bit easier to make because the tick watches were actually a bit unique compared to the rest now you just have an easy way of getting into Android wear and if you just want to get your feet wet in a new form of tech well this might be one of the easiest places to do it as always thank you guys very much for watching and we hope you enjoyed this video on the tick watch as in the tick watch if by the end of 2017 you're still looking for a SmartWatch that you don't have to really spend a whole lot on and it has a very low point of entry well this just might be it so keep it tuned to Andrew authority for more on this and all wearables and you can keep it tuned here for also all of our coverage of CES as it is going to be happening in just under three weeks keep you tuned here and head over to Andrew 30.com for even more because we are your source for

when it comes to getting help from Google assistant all you have to do is give these phones a little squeeze but there's so much more that these new Google phones offer it's Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and this is our first look at the Google pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL brought to you by audible now there are two sizes of the Google pixel - there's a pixel - and the pixel 2 XL which is the one that I have in my hand right now the pixel 2 XL is actually pretty easy to handle still and especially with these squeezing capability it's still easy to do that and get right into Google assistants without any problems at all one of the workflows that were probably gonna end up seeing a lot is when you take the phone out of your pocket you just take it out and even with the screen off you could just squeeze the device and it will turn right back on and give you a Google assistant the smaller pixel 2 comes with 5 inches in its screen and it's a Full HD OLED screen the Google pixel to excel will have a 6 inch quad HD OLED display that also rocks a 18 by 9 aspect ratio now the pixel 2 has the smaller screen and thus is a little bit easier to handle which is expected but the pixel 2 XL does a little bit of a better job this time around with that 18 by 9 aspect ratio the screen is a little bit taller than it is wide like a lot of 18 by 9 aspect ratio phones that we're seeing this year and thus it is a little bit easier to handle than its counterpart from last year now there's one thing that I was really surprised by it was the dual front facing speaker now what we have our stereo speakers on the front to make it so that you're able to blast music or whatever you're watching at yourself and I will admit it's a little bit too loud in this area for me to actually test the speakers but I will say this when I played a youtube video I was actually able to hear it even in this environment now that's not the best test but we're going to do that testing even more later on with our 40 speaking of audio probably one of the big points of contention for people is going to be the lack of a headphone jack unfortunately there is no headphone jack on these devices which means are going to be using either a USB C adapted pair of headphones or you're going to be using the pixel buds or any other wireless bluetooth headphones in order to enjoy music and audio out of these new pixel phones underneath the hood you get the snapdragon 835 with the audrina 540 and 4 gigabytes of ram and in both phones you can get 64 or 128 gigabytes of on-board storage with no microSD card slot the batteries are also relative to which device you get as the pixel has a 2700 milliamp hour battery and the pixel to excel gets 835 20 milliamp hour unit and both phones have ip67 water and dust resistance there are a number of colors of the pixel - including a blue version that you're seeing in this video and of the pixel to XO we have two colors and I'm holding the black one in this segment right now but the one that I really want to get my hands on is that panda color with that coral power button on the side that gives it a really lovely accent but now we can talk about the cameras and the rear cameras on both of these devices have a 12 megapixel sensor with 1.4 micron pixel sizes at F 1.8 aperture but behind all of that is a data algorithm by Google that uses its machine learning in order to give you all of the best data to get the best possible shot out of these cameras Google is also going for the more data-driven photography experience using machine learning as much as it possibly can in order to cater the shot to the best possible quality but this portrait mode is also available for the front-facing camera which is an 8 megapixel shooter and as you can see I'm in the stranger things little demo area where they're showing off the AR capability is putting stranger things monsters and characters right beside me here on this couch it's actually a pretty great feature of the camera pretty low latency and I'm able to interact with those creatures and characters live on the camera application it's just one capability on these cameras that actually got one of the highest if not the highest DXL mark ratings that we've seen on any smartphone so far and yet another capability of the camera is google lense which is now a part of google assistant that you can access by hitting the icon when you open up the assistant it allows you to scan pretty much anything in your environment and you will be able to use Google's own search engines in order to figure out exactly what you're looking at and of course with the software we have the stock Android experience with Android 8.0 Oreo at the helm now what you get is the latest version of Android so if you are an Android purist of course you're going to be looking at the pixel as the best experience for Google's operating system if you're a veteran of stock Android then you know what to expect here the interface looks incredibly familiar but the search bar has been moved to the bottom so that you are able to use it no matter what screen you're on and then of course you're able to get to Google assistant in a number of different ways including now squeezing the phone and there's one thing that's incredibly clear about these pixel phones and about Google's product line for this year it's that Google assistant is definitely at the helm and is the focus of all of their products will be giving you our full review once you get our hands on a unit and I'm really hoping I get the pixel to excel in that panda color because that's the one that I definitely want to rock so as always thank you guys very much for watching and thank you to audible for teaming up with us to bring you all a free audio book and a 30-day free trial via the link in our description audible.com slash Android authority audiobooks from audible are a great way to transform your commute like one I just made recently across China and the Philippines to make it to this event they have an unbeatable selection of bestsellers mysteries thrillers and motivational books for me it's a great way to learn and improve myself like I did with my current picking you're seeing it here headstrong by Dave Asprey optimization isn't just an Android thing it's a way of life why not do for yourself what Android does every month and every year headstrong teaches readers about biohacking in order to bring out the best version of ourselves I highly recommend it as a personal development and bio hacking book and you can get it right now for free at audible.com/asap all com / Android Authority thank you to the sponsor of our video audible ride or fly like I did with audible so stay tuned to andrew authority for more about the Google pixel to the pixel to excel and for all of googles products that were announced today at their event in San Francisco keep it tuned to Android 30 for that and even more because of course we are your source for all things Android 
hey everyone this is David ml with Android authority and today we're taking a look at the nokia 8c Roco now this is the flagship of the new series of phones from Nokia and the company makes that pretty obvious with its high-end specs and it's striking form factor the body reminds us a lot of the Xiaomi me Note 2 with its curved glass which bleeds over the edges now this happens on both sides of the phone and it does leave the size of the device filling a bit sharp the buttons are also a little bit difficult to press since there's not that much a gripping area but I think Nokia was thinking more about style in this case well this looks really striking and it gives the impression that this is a very premium device we do have some worries that it wouldn't be very practical in everyday use everything about this phone is premium though from it's nearly completely glass body to its flagship level specs list I don't think there's a person on the planet that wouldn't see this device as a luxury it might not be the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 but with a snapdragon 835 six gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage the Sirocco really shouldn't have any problems burning through apps and games this is all powering a 2k P OLED panel and it just looks fantastic colours are striking and vibrant and I would honestly take this display over my pixel 2xl any day of the week it's a 16 by 9 aspect ratio so it's not as bezel assess other flagships but it's also a bit shorter than a lot of the other flagships on the market right now I like it though because it makes the phone feel a little bit more manageable to hold the glass body also allows for things like wireless charging and ip67 water resistance and it really feels like nokia left out very few things in this phone save the poor headphone jack that we're all missing dearly this has somehow become a trend for high-end devices though so it's not exactly an unusual move there is a fingerprint reader inlaid into the back right below the dual 12 and 13 megapixel telephoto lens combo which is made by Zeiss optics now I haven't had the phone long enough to give you a detailed rundown of the cameras quality we'll be able to do that in the full review to come always welcome a telephoto zoom option / a software crop though so this is great to see there is an option to take a both E which is kind of like a simultaneous front and back camera shutter now I can't see myself using this that option but it does make sense if you want to show yourself reacting to a scene in front of you hardware is really only part of this story though and software can often be a huge part of the experience this phones running Android 1 and that means that it's running one of the cleanest versions of Android out there almost every one of the apps on this phone is made by Google and it feels just as if not more clean than a pixel there's only 18 apps installed on this phone by default which leaves a clean slate for however you really want to personalize your Android device the Nokia Scirocco might not be running Qualcomm's latest chipset but it is a solid option for people who just want to use a nice piece of art everyday assuming they are willing to pay that 749 euro price point make sure you stay tuned to Android authority to keep up with our coverage of MWC and beyond and follow our social to stay up to date with what we're up to because of course we are your source for all things Android 
age structure for guard Oh what's going on everybody and this is a look at a brand new version of the LGV 30 now if you were looking for something that was truly revolutionary from LG you may not be finding it here this is basically the LG v 30 basically all of the same specifications with a couple of changes now the six gigabytes of RAM is a nice welcome addition and the one that we are using in this video is the new Moroccan blue we won for the blue one over the Platinum gray one which looks just like a darker version of the silver that we had in our review already on top of they bump up in RAM you also get a huge bump up in storage 128 gigabytes or 256 gigabytes of on-board storage are available in this version as well everything is the same here right down to the materials the feel and also the cameras you still get the wide-angle lens on the rear and you get the front facing camera that admittedly is not the best one of the bunch but what LG is trying to introduce at least in the LGV 30s thinkyou edition yes that is the full name of this phone the LG v 30s as we'll call it here is the one that is supposed to bring more artificial intelligence features and it mainly has to do with a couple of camera modes going to the camera and there are a couple of buttons there that allow you to do a few different functions one of them in particular is an AI lens which uses some machine learning in order to figure out what kind of subject is in the frame in a lot of cases is going to be pretty obvious you're probably pointing it at a person and it will change the settings to a better suit the kind of photo you would want of a portrait for example or if you have a piece of fruit in front of it then it'll say that it's food we did do a somewhat unscientific test where we had a person and the camera did denote that it is a person in front of the camera hold up a piece of fruit to cover their face and see if it was going to change it up well we think that because it kept seeing the hands that it kept seeing a person which is kind of fair once we put this orange down on a table and pointed the camera at it it was like okay this is definitely food I did use it for a couple of other situations as well it did find that this was a flower even though it is a fake set of points EDIUS and then from there we were able to go to the cue lens the cue lens is the other option here that is supposed to marry not only user input but also some artificial intelligence features you might see on other phones it's going to search or do a reverse image search on in this case Amazon Pinterest or you might just want to scan a QR code all three of those options are available on the bottom and if you get your subject into frame and then select which network you want to search it will figure out what that item is now obviously systems like this even ones we've seen on bixby and on google lens aren't always perfect we did scan a book and it did find it on Amazon but the other items are just vague enough that it wasn't really looking for the specific bottle of wine in this case instead it just found bottles of wine LG has also changed up the camera a little bit to provide what is called a bright mode where they take four groups of the megapixels the 16 megapixels in the camera groups them together to flood more light into the sensor but you get a 4 megapixel picture now inside of the camera it will just automatically figure out that you need the bright mode on and there's an icon to turn it on and off so if you are looking for a huge in ocean from LG here at MWC 2018 you might be a bit disappointed just like we were now we're always going to enjoy some different design choices but other than the color and the 6000 bytes of ram there's really not much differentiating this phone from the LGV 30s that already exist out there in the world LG was pretty quick to say that they do have some huge announcements coming a little bit later this year but right now they are sticking to this new idea that they're going to do incremental improvements onto the phones that already exist that they know already successful now though we are going to do a full review on this phone mainly over the AI features we can say right now that if you already have an LG V 30 then maybe this upgrade is not something you would want to consider but if you've been holding out until now you might already be missing out on a great video camera on the LG v 30 and now it comes with a new color in any case keep it tuned to android authority for all of the best including more on this the LG v 30s think you and you can stay tuned for all of the great announcements that we're seeing here at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Spain remember to head over to Andrew authority calm for even more of all of that coverage and then subscribe to this channel if you haven't already because we are your source for all things Android 
[Music] so here we are with a brand new pixel and the pixel 2 follows up on the original by kind of adding to the formula on a phone that was supposed to be the official home for Android and it was Google's first foray into the hardware game and there's something that I really want to emphasize when it comes to my review of this the pixel 2 XL and the pixel 2 it's the fact that it's not really about how many features you're getting and the sheer number of things that you can do with the phone it's more about the experience and if you will the texture I've drawn the design is the first thing you're going to notice about this device it is immensely better than last year's pixel which had a very slippery metal and that large glass panel on the top that people weren't really all that sure about this year the glass panel is minimized it only takes up maybe a fifth of the top of the device and then below it is a metal body that actually has been treated to have a texture to it it's not just smooth metal and it grips very well in the hands making it a lot less slippery than last year's pixel which really helps in the handling Department it's one of those tiny changes that Google put into this phone that make all the difference so we think these phones look pretty damn good and if you want to protect your investment and keep the phone from scuffing from general wear and tear then you might want to invest in these minimal cases they are incredibly thin add no bulk to the device and if you look at this particular case it's a way to bring back the really blue color that we don't have in this year's generation of phones things kind of do change up when you get to the front of the device the pixel 2 looks a lot like a smaller Nexus 6p in that it is perfectly symmetrical and has quite a bit of room at the forehead and the chin above and below the screen for both of these devices the forehead and the chin how's the front facing speakers which is a great addition that proves to be really useful especially when gaming but unfortunately with all of this goodness so far there had to be a sacrifice and the main sacrifice that a lot of you out there will probably be calling this phone out on is the lack of a headphone jack losing the headphone jack means that using one's favorite headphones might be a little bit of a chore this time around we do suggest that you just keep the adapter connected to your favorite pair so it's always available but those few times when our Bluetooth wireless headphones may have run out of battery did proved to be a little bit troublesome especially when we didn't have our favorite wired earphones on hand one final thing to mention about the design here the sides are pressure sensitive that's kind of a fancy way for me saying that you can squeeze the device the squeeze feature is not entirely new and on the pixels they only activate Google assistance it might have been nice to have a different function for here that is user programmable but at least Google assistant is incredibly useful and if you are in Google assistance pretty constantly this is the best way to trigger it the smaller pixel 2 is obviously the easier to handle device but it does have a lower resolution at Full HD which might be a bit of a problem for those of you who are really into virtual reality on the other hand you do have the 18 by 9 aspect ratio display of the pixel to XL which comes in a quad HD resolution the main addition to these displays other than the 18 by 9 aspect ratio for the XL is the addition of an always-on display but there are a couple of issues when it comes to mainly the saturation and also a bit of the color reproduction on the pixel to XL even though these are OLED displays for whatever reason the saturation on the pixel to XL is a little bit dialed down you're not going to be seeing the kind of color reproduction that you might be used to on samsung devices where it's incredibly vivid instead you're gonna get a much more accurate display which is what Google is trying to remind everybody they were trying to do with this device but there is another problem here with the viewing angles it's been a long time since we've talked about viewing angles as a problem on a device but even when you move the device at a somewhat acute angle it doesn't even have to go that far you notice a cooling effect on all of the colors here almost like a blue tint now this is something that might really bother some users out there but giving them the benefit of the doubt we don't think that really too many people are going to be that bothered by this issue playing games watching videos and looking at the screen dead on when looking at media or anything that is colorful we really didn't notice that much of a difference when it came to the saturation the experience was still enjoyable so keep that in mind there might be some issues with the display but it's not really going to change your daily usage and this might not come as much of a surprise but performance has not been an issue with the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL you have everything that you would need inside of these devices including the snapdragon 835 4 gigabytes of RAM which is utilized beautifully by the optimized version of Android Oreo in here and you have different storage options depending on how much you pay for the device there's no SD card slot in here but it does help that google photos is included on here and it allows you to upload original resolution files whether they're photo or video so you can save up space pretty easily multitasking in particular gets high marks not only because of the multi window that we've enjoyed on this before but with picture-in-picture which is now a feature of android 8.0 not only are you able to use maps in the corner of your screen while you're doing other things you can also do that with YouTube which is what I've been doing the most the smaller pixel too obviously has the smaller battery but it does still get through a full day's work without any problems it just might have less screen on time than the pixel to excel in my case I've been getting pretty consistently five hours of screen on time on here with mildly heavy usage like I said before I have YouTube videos playing all the time and of course you can use the included charger for power delivery charging or you can use qc3 in order to top-up the battery when you need it the rest of the hardware is pretty much what you would expect - the headphone jack you have everything that you might need here including NFC and even IP certifications so that this phone can take a tumble or a dip without even breaking a sweat so as the story goes texture continues to be the name of the game for these pixels you're not getting a huge amount of features in these phones but all the stuff that you do get is not only optimized they also work incredibly well the performance is where it should be even though you only get four gigabytes of RAM and really the optimized version of Android makes all the difference in utilizing everything the pixels can offer which brings us to the cameras which is another really optimized part of the pixels now you're not going to get dual cameras on the back of this device you're only getting one lens however Google is really trying to optimize it as much as possible so that you can get the best quality photos right now you're watching footage full HD resolution footage from the front facing camera which is itself a wonderful performer right now I'm actually using it just on my vlogging rig and you can see that the quality is actually pretty great one thing I should mention though is that the audio you're hearing right now is coming from an external recorder and that's because the audio from the phone sounds like this it's not the best audio that we've heard might be one of the main source pots when it comes to recording video on these devices because there are a couple other things that have been added on like OAS and also a portrait mode on the front-facing camera audio is really just a small blemish on what is overall a pretty good package but using this camera as a vlogging rake has been pretty nice because the front-facing camera allows for pretty high quality video but of course you want to see what the rear camera looks like and there you go 4k video recording on the rear camera of the pixel - it does a good job of providing good quality video with a little bit of blotchiness and grain especially in low-light situations by the main source pod like I said already is the audio but if you want to talk about detail you definitely want to talk about the still images the camera application works pretty much the same way as it did in last year's pixel only there is a replacement lens blur is now portrait mode and yes this is a portrait mode that only uses one lens and it does not need to have a secondary zoom lens and it works on both cameras in either case it will take two pictures one with the artificial bouquet effect and one without it that way you can take your pick but the portrait mode does a really good job of actually cutting out the foreground subjects there were only a few times that we saw the cut be incorrect overall the portrait mode is going to be one of those crowd-pleasing features that selfie experts or rather selfie enthusiasts are going to really enjoy pictures in general have turned out really great with wonderful detail and good saturation that have been added in due to the always-on HDR plus mode there aren't really any manual controls to speak of here but this might be the best auto shooter that we have ever used essentially what the HDR plus mode does is it takes a bunch of photos at the same time then uses all of that data in order to create the best possible final product this is really useful even in low-light situations where the shutter doesn't even stay open for very long the shutter to file speed is still pretty high in low-light situations and it's just basically telling you just trust me I'll get you the photo you want so if you're a shutterbug and you're looking at the pixel - as your potential next device the rear camera got the enhancements that it should get after last year's pixel but it's really the front facing camera that puts the icing on the cake with that portrait mode that you can use for all of your selfies and finally let's talk about the software which but there really isn't a whole lot else that we can say other than this is the way Android was meant to be all of the different features that you get in Android 8 are over all practical and are things that we would use everyday like picture-in-picture there are a couple of other features that have been added in like the always-on display having a now playing feature that pulls from a database of songs so that when it can recognize that there is music playing it will be able to tell you what that song is so if now playing is displaying a song down here and you get into the phone it'll either give you a card that provides you with the name of the song if it's in the database or it would just send you to a Google search so you can find out for yourself and speaking of Google searches well we have google lens but it's not really all the way here yet google lens still has yet to make it to Google assistant but this is the way it works in Google Photos any photos that you already have in Google photos can be scanned maybe a bit of OCR text recognition and maybe a backwards image search and it will try to tell you what it is you're looking at it works maybe half of the time and some of the results were pretty impressive like when it read the text on my shirt and then it gave me a Google search leading me straight to the restaurant that I was reppin and as I've been alluding to this entire review it's really about the user experience of Android and the daily usage of this operating system that ultimately is its best when it's on a pixel the pixel to launcher for example is even cleaner than before and putting the search bar on the bottom of it makes it easy to access for all of those people who do Google searches all the time and then of course we have the squeeze feature which is the best way of getting to Google assistant from pretty much any part of the phone even when the screen is off so if you're looking at it from just a pure speck and feature standpoint then pixel to and the pixel to excel are going to fall just below all of the other flagships this year but that's not necessarily a bad thing because empirically it does lack a little bit compared to a note 8 or a V 30 if you're coming from a previous pixel then the story is nice and short here the pixel twos look better perform better shoot better and simply do better than the previous generation but especially if you're an Android purist and you prefer optimization over sheer numbers of features well then the pixel 2 is the best way of enjoying Android and it is definitely the way that Android was meant to be as always thank you guys very much for watching and I hope you enjoyed this review of the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL I kind of just wanted to gush you a little bit about how much I enjoy these devices because honestly they are a lot of fun and whether or not they are actually better than other flagships kind of depends on what your EADS are but if you're just looking for a smartphone that simply works and gives you the best version of Android well you don't really have to look any further than these two phones keep it tuned to Android authority and don't forget to check the description down below to find links to our Android 8 review to the minimal cases that I

hello there my name's Gary Sims from Android authority now we're waiting for the new Galaxy phones to be announced the s9 very very soon and of course in previous years the phones have had two types of processes in them some of them had Qualcomm Snapdragon processors in and some had processes from Samsung the excellence range and true to form Samsung have just announced a new processor the Exynos 9 8 10 I keep wanting to say it's not 8 9 10 but it's t9 810 and so in today's video we're gonna look at what is the Exynos 9 8 10 so if you want to know please let me explain so the first thing to note is the new X not 9 8 10 is in direct competition with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 now it is a octa-core processor it's a 64-bit octa-core processor and the 4 power efficiency cores are the based on the cortex a 55 design and that's exactly the same as the Snapdragon 805 but when it comes to the for high-performance cause we have here some significant differences Qualcomm have gone with the cryo which is based on the cortex a 75 where a Samsung are now at their third generation or custom CPU design so the previous external chips had the m1 and then the m2 and now we're at the m3 now this key thing about the m3 first of all is its clocked 2.9 gigahertz as its maximum clock frequency but more astoundingly samsung are claiming it has double the single thread performance than the m2 now that's quite an amazing statement by Samsung and we really are looking forward to seeing this chip in some devices so we can check that out but if it's true it means that the Exynos 9 8 10 has got performance parameters similar to close - not yet beating but very similar to very close to the Apple a11 Bionic now according to my calculations if what Samsung is saying is true we should be seeing Geekbench scores for single threaded operations of around three thousand nine Android and multi-core scores are up over 9000 as I say those are a huge leap compared to what we had in the last generation and moving on from the CPU we go to the GPU and this has got the latest are Mali Jeep unit that's the G 72 now the previous external chip had a 20 core GP unit this one has now got an 18 chord G unit but yet it actually has a 20% greater performance than the previous generation and that's because the G 72 is a greater performing processor than the G 71 a graphics processor and they've gone from 24 down to 18 but still managed to bump up that GPU performance so again that will be really interesting to see when we have this in real chips other things to notice are that it's built using a 10 nanometer fabrication process and it also uses low-power ddr4 Ram now when it comes to multimedia the new excel chip can do 4k and 120 frames per second both recording and playback and also it supports h.265 h.264 and the vp9 codecs now when it's using h.265 it can also record using 10-bit color which of course is very important for HDR setups couple of other things to mention it can support dual cameras on the back up to 16 megapixels or a 24 megapixel single camera on the back it also supports things like blue 2 5 it's got advanced image stabilization built into the chip itself and of course it's got the latest and greatest LTE modem which is a 1.2 gigabits per second LTE modem if of course your carrier support such a thing so how does it compared to the snapdragon 845 well for example it's got greater features like it's got the 120 frames per second recording in 4k now the Qualcomm does not have that now last year Samsung disabled that feature in the Exynos variant of their phones so there was parity across all of its devices now that will might probably happen again this year because the Qualcomm doesn't support 120 frames in 4k but the bigger problem for Samsung is this performance if the performance is as great as they are claiming then there's going to be quite a performance difference between the cold conversion of the handset and the excellence versions of the handsets now Samsung I've got two ways to play this one is just to say well that's it that's the variant you get in your region because of modems because of you know the regulations because of marketing that's the variation you get and that's the speed you have to deal with or they could peg down the performance of the Exynos version so that it's not so much greater than the Snapdragon 805 version we'll have to wait and see what Samsung do so I'm really looking forward to seeing this chip in devices and comparing it to devices that got this Snapdragon 845 it's certainly going to be an exciting year in terms of process of performance and processor capabilities during this year and the handsets that we're going to see I'm going to sim from Andhra thority and I really hope you enjoyed this video if you did please do give it a thumbs up also don't forget to subscribe to handle Authority's YouTube channel hit that Bell icon so you get a notification every time we drop them your video and last but not least please go over to handle 30.com because we are your source for all things Android 
samsung's latest announced phone goes up the most recent release before it the differences between the two phones might be obvious after all one has a stylus built in but there is more to the picture than meets the iris pun intended what might be most exciting about this comparison is how the Galaxy S line can influence the future Galaxy Note it's Joshua for Gaara what's going on everybody and this is the Galaxy S 9 versus the Galaxy Note 8 design is actually a bit different between this two and not just because of the size the Galaxy Note 8 brings the 18 by 9 aspect ratio in a 6.3 inch screen that is a little bit too tall for some people if you're looking for good one-handed usage that is why the Galaxy S line is often welcome to because the smaller of the two makes handily more accessible however the galaxy s 9 plus still has a 6.2 inch screen if you want to have more screen real estate it's also no understatement to say that the s 9 plus is very similar to the note 8 and that's because of more than just the screen after all the galaxy s 9 now brings the same two lens setup that was first introduced in the note 8 it now has a telephoto lens on top of the main lens which has a number of improvements but one of the best parts about looking at this camera module is that the fingerprint reader is no longer next to it it is now below it making it a lot easier to reach even if you're using the bigger model definitely a lot easier than trying to reach the fingerprint reader on the no-date so the cameras are a big upgrade in the galaxy s 9 and the s 9 plus but we're not just talking about this secondary lens yes the telephoto lens on either phone comes at f/2 point 4 aperture but the main lens is the exciting prospects built into the mechanics as an actual opening and shutting iris if you want to have more light and better depth of field effects then opening it all the way to the F 1.5 aperture brings in the bouquet while the F 2.4 closed aperture is better for wider frames or wider scenes now these aperture changes occur automatically in the auto mode of course however if you want to change it yourself you can always go into the pro mode and any people out there who have used DSLRs and our big faux togs might really be excited by seeing a mechanical iris on a smartphone for the first time the note II kind of strikes the middle ground here with a single F 1.7 aperture that is in the mainland's on top of the telephoto lens that we've talked about already Samsung is also adding multi-frame processing to their cameras in the galaxy s 9 line the DRM on the actual camera module itself will take dozens of photo and use all of them in order to create the best final shot and that doesn't even take into consideration new modes that we have talked about in a camera future-focused video you can also see on this channel super slow-motion is really fun 960 frames per second at 720p resolution is always going to be a fun prospect but trying to get that perfect shot might be a bit tough that's why the auto mode figures out when the motion happens so then it captures the motion in that super slow-mo AR emoji is for all of those out there who might have an emoji envy or you might just want to take bitmoji x' to the next level you can create an avatar with a lot of different customization options and then use the front-facing camera to actually move it around and make it make faces based upon what you are actually doing so those camera modes and those enhancements are basically exclusive to the galaxy s 9 family at least for now the no 8 will then step a little bit behind the pack but it is incredibly important to remember that the node 8 is more of a Productivity phone as well that's because of the s-pen so many capabilities are baked into the stylus and its software and the note 8 is an incredibly capable machine use the s-pen as a sort of Mouse for precision or easier item selection for writing notes via various different methods or even use it to just draw all over the place and then of course there's a big speed the Bigsby button is over on the side and still provides the same level of assistance but it has been somewhat enhanced in the galaxy s 9 it is able to recognize foods and it is also able to do better live translation when you're using the augmented reality portion of the camera now these are features that we expect to come to the other Galaxy phones that have Bigsby so it's only a matter of time before software update kind of bridges the gap here so we've talked about camera and then also the productivity of the note 8 in particular but we can come back to the media consumption experience the screens are incredible but you also have the ability to have great audio now on the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus powered by Dolby Atmos there are two speakers now one on the bottom and one on the front that is integrated into the call speaker and together they provide much louder sound than any other Samsung device before the rest of the phone is what you would probably expect the performance gets an upgrade to the snapdragon 845 and the s9 plus closes the ram gap by bringing six gigabytes of RAM much like the note 8 one interesting tidbit here is that the Galaxy Note 8 is the middle child in terms of battery five sporting 330 million powers compared to 3,000 and 3,500 for the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus respectively it should come as no surprise that the Galaxy Note 8 is still a very viable choice what is exciting is that the Galaxy S 9 is bringing a couple of new features here like dual speakers and the mechanical iris that could very well make it to the next note device the galaxy s 9 is available for pre-order starting March 2nd and users around the world can trade in their phones to get a deep discount on the new phone especially if you have a note 8 and you decide to trade it in you'll get that deep discount and the S 9 hour or the s 9 plus will be more affordable for you now keep it tuned to and row 30 for more about the galaxy s 9 and about Mobile World Congress here in Barcelona and remember to Like comment subscribe to all of that good stuff and

just when you thought the tablet market was really on its downward spiral Huawei comes up with these two good performers it's Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody and this is the huawei media Pad m5 in a couple of different sizes ever since Netflix allowed downloadable content while we noticed that their tablet sales were kind of on the up-and-up so they have a new version here that comes in two different versions the 8.4 inch and the pro version at ten point eight inches both of them sports 2.5 D glass and come in at quad HD resolution that's an IPS panel in both at 2560 by 1600 resolution the pro series does come with a keyboard which allows for a little bit more functionality along with the Huawei pen that allows for stylists like experiences what is nice is that the media consumption experience is really being considered well you have our dual speakers on the 8.4 inch or four speakers on the 10.8 inch tablets all powered by Harman Kardon and they sound pretty great so if you are watching Netflix quite a lot or even just YouTube or any other media on these tablets you'll have a great audio experience [Applause] and all of that is powered by the cure in 960 and is rocking emui 8.0 as far as battery life goes if you are doing those binge watching sessions then the 8.4 inch tablet will get up to 11 hours of 1080p video playback while the 10.8 inch tablet will get about 10 hours but it takes less than 3 hours to get a full charge on these large batteries for both of these tablets as far as design goes there's really not a whole lot to say about these two tablets other than the fact that they have that form factor there is a nice screen on the front of both of these devices but there's plenty of bezel around it which could or could not be a bad thing depending on what your handling is like and both of them do come with cameras and maybe you are going to be the kind of person that doesn't use the camera very often but at least it is there if you want to take a quick snap of whatever's in front of you while you're enjoying your media while we also took into consideration some gaming in here as the Kirin 960 takes the processing power and diverts it to the gaming that's being done and actually blocked social apps so that you're not disturbed while you're in the middle of a big sesh but of course whether or not you're going to want the media pad m5 comes down to whether or not you use tablets at all and that's actually a question you wanted to pose to you do you use tablets in your daily and let us know if you do what'd you use them for and is the huawei media pad m5 a consideration that you would make overall it's nice to see that tablet still have a bit of a space inside of the Android ecosystem but overall we think that the media pad m5 is a worthy addition to anyone who wants a big screen experience especially for media consumption keep it tuned to Andrew authority for even more about Huawei's announcements during MWC and even more from over world congress here in barcelona keep it tuned to yo for even more and head on over to Andrew 30.com for all of the great coverage and don't forget to subscribe to our channel if you haven't already because we are your source for all things Android 
have you ever heard of the uncanny valley well it's a term used in video games to describe characters and avatars that don't quite make it all the way to being truly realistic there's just a few things about them that you can't unsee and thus it kind of breaks the illusion well for a phone that's supposed to be made for gamers I thought that this was a poignant term to use to describe it it's Josh of Agora what's going on everybody and this is our full review of the razor phone comparisons to the next bit Robin are going to be pretty obvious here after all the company was acquired by Razer and what you have now is a phone made for gamers now that's different from being a gaming phone but that also means that razor's influences are clearly seen here nonetheless you have a phone that is actually a bit unique in design compared to other competitors and it's also a bit reminiscent of the original next bit Robin you have the angular corners and also flat sides all around making for a blocky device which is a design aspect we don't really see a whole lot these days but one thing I want to tip my hat off to is the symmetry of this phone the speaker grilles on top and below the 5.7 inch screen take up the exact amount of space in those particular areas the power button on the right has a fingerprint reader embedded into it much like the original next bit Robin and it was actually pretty easy to use even when using my middle finger on my left hand in order to quickly unlock the device after pressing the button the USB type-c port on the bottom is centered as it should be but there is no headphone jack here instead you get an adapter that you plug into here or a headphone jack but it does come with a 24 bit DAC installed and we'll talk about the audio experience in a little bit and finally on the back there is the camera optic package dual lens is over in the corner on top of the razer logo that is prominently displayed on this black slate design it's actually a very handsome device but the main problem we have with it is just the handling with a 16 by 9 aspect ratio screen it's a little bit wider than it probably should be and mix left to right or right to left handling in one hand a bit difficult this is certainly going to be a two-hander especially when you're trying to type but that screen is one of the main draws of this phone and it is a quad HD IPS display that includes ultra motion technology now that means that this display can get up to a 120 Hertz refresh rate but it is also synced up with the GPU in order to give the best possible experience no matter what kind content you are using I've played a lot of games on this device and there are quite a few triple-a titles I take advantage of everything the razor phone provides there are some games that don't quite take advantage of the full spec list but they still look great because of that ultra motion technology so if you're playing a game that runs at 30 60 or 90 frames per second it's going to look great on this display still because the refresh rate adjusts accordingly but the great motion in this display which is derived from razor's own laptop displays is really apparent even in simple tasks like scrolling through Google now or through websites like Andrew Authority comm or going through apps like Reddit it's really easy to see how high quality this display is and razor might just have unlocked a new trend and smartphones moving forward the only problem that I really had with the display was its brightness this is an IPS display but it's somehow doesn't get as bright as other IPS screens in the market this is mostly noticeable in broad daylight situations where we pump to the brightness to full but still kind of had to squint or move the phone around in order to see certain elements but it is a small price to pay for a phone that is overall of beast and the specification list shows that the Snapdragon 835 is backed up by eight gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of on-board storage that does include a micro SD card slot you have the very best specifications here that is only really matched by the one plus 5t currently thus work in place speed along swimmingly so that gamers aren't the only ones who are going to enjoy using this phone on the daily you also have a lot of power for multitasking as we use multi-window for YouTube and other applications but of course when Android Oriol finally makes it to the razor phone you'll also be able to enjoy picture-in-picture we've already mentioned that gaming is great on here no matter what game you're playing but the Triple A titles that are supposed to come out that take advantage of the razor phone specifications are still a little bit limited for example Final Fantasy 15 is still not out on this phone and it was one of those games that they really hyped for when it came to using this phone to its fullest potential but that's not to say that the razor phone isn't finding itself in the best possible position when it comes to mobile gaming because it truly is publishers like Sega and Nintendo are getting into the mobile space putting not only games from their previous library but also putting in new games like Nintendo's newest offering in Animal Crossing it's a great time to be a gamer and it's great to see Razer getting into the mobile space at this time of course those games are not just a visual aspect there's also an audio aspect involved and razor put a lot of thought into it in a partnership with Dolby and their Atmos app you have dual front-facing speakers that provide a great amount of sound seriously this is some of the best sound that we've had from a smart phone ever it's enough to actually replace cheap Bluetooth speakers so you don't have to have it in your arsenal all the time it certainly past the shower test but it still has to be outside of the shower doors because there is no IP certification but there is a little bit of a compromise in the audio experience when you talk about the headphone jack now this is a contentious point for pretty much anybody but what I do adore about razors approach to it is that they finally did something I've been saying everyone should do the USB type-c port on the bottom also powers a 24-bit DAC that is built into the adapter which provides a great sound especially if you're using high quality headphones this is another instance where Razer might be setting an example that we might see more of from other manufacturers moving forward call quality for the most part was good on the razor phone at least in my experience and I was using it on the t-mobile network but I do have to mention something about the microphone when it's right next to my mouth for more conventional calling everything sounded fine but when the phone is farther away from me for video calls and also for speaker phone calls the people on the other line said that I was noticeably quieter that tells me that the microphone needs a little bit more sensitivity but you know mileage might vary on this we've heard differing reports from multiple sources about what the call quality is like on the razor phone so things might be a little bit different with different units so maybe your experience is gonna be different and finally we have a large 4000 milliamp hour battery which razer claims was possible because of the exclusion of the headphone jack i was never really able to get more than 5 hours of screen on time at least on average which is not great but I was doing a lot of gaming on this device if you turn down the settings in the game booster you might get a little bit more out of it or if you're just using it as a Productivity device then you might get more screen on time but of course your experience might be different speaking of which that game booster app is one of the only additions that Razer put into the software suite here the game booster allows for tweaking of everything from the display refresh rate to the clock speed of the sesor and you can also change it for full performance or for full power saving modes and you can go into each game in the application in order to change the different settings this allows for a little bit more control and it also shows that razer was really trying to put its best foot forward in providing performance and customization and personalization into the razer phone experience and that continues with the software suite that has been out sourced to a great third party in the Nova Launcher now the best part about the Nova Launcher here is that you get all of the great benefits of it including a pro license that gives you access to all of the different features that Nova provides if you pay a little bit of extra money which you don't have to because it's included with this phone you have all of the customization options like animations on the home screen icon packs even gestures that you can do on the home screen itself and you have a lot of different options to really tweak this operating system to make it look like your own so overall we've had some really good things to say about the Razer phone and it looks like the company has done a great job in the wake of next bits acquisition in order to bring a great first attempt into the smartphone space but then we have to talk about that uncanny valley and we're gonna talk about the camera now you have dual 12 megapixel cameras on here that have F 1.8 aperture in the regular lens and F 2.6 aperture in the telephoto lens and unfortunately we already had some qualms with the camera in our hands on when we noticed that there weren't that many modes and there wasn't even an indicator to show you which lens you were using and how far you were zoomed in for how much time the razor phone has had up until market release it's a little bit of a bummer to see that razor hasn't really added a whole lot to the experience and even then the camera app is one of the slowest that we've used especially if you use HDR and it does not have an auto setting you're going to have to hold the phone very steady especially in lower than ideal lighting situations and if you move even just a little bit you're going to get some blur in the photo now in broad daylight situations you could get a pretty good photo but those are the only times that you can really do so and that's kind of the mark of a subpar camera the fact that it can only work in the brightest of conditions unfortunately for the razor phone it's just not a phone that we can mention in a list of good cameras in the Android space especially considering in the last year or so we've been having a continual rise in photographic quality and so there you have it the razor phone this is a powerhouse powerhouse is a great term to describe this device because it does so many things right but it just falters in one very key aspect after all the razor phone looks and feels like a flagship device it even looks like a beloved phone from days past an expert Robin there are certain things that you can easily look past even the lack of a headphone jack considering that great adapter they have in there and the size of the device is something that you could for the most part get used to but the biggest issue with the phone might be described best by the uncanny valley it's just the one thing that you can't unsee and unfortunately it's one of the most important parts of a smart phone and it's the camera experience so that makes the camera this phone's uncanny valley as always thank you guys very much for watching I hope you enjoyed this review of the razor phone razor claims that they're going to put a lot of updates out for the camera and hopefully they're going to change the experience at least a little bit but as smartphone history has shown us updates don't really change too much about the camera experience even further down the line but from there without the camera you have one of the best phones that we've used this year and that display technology is something we hope to see in a lot more smart phones moving forward keep it tuned to Android authority for even more about the razor phone and maybe a couple of comparisons after all one of its main competitors in the spec sheet is the 1 + 5 T so you can look forward to that and even more from Android Authority com head on over to the

the HTC u 11 life Android one is ostensibly a mid-range u 11 but it's also a lot like a mid-range pixel to which HTC also made under the auspices of the Android 1 program the u 11 life runs near stock Android Oreo offering a very similar software experience to the pixel 2 but with mid-range specs and a 350 dollar price tag the u 11 lifes lineage is visible in the familiar liquid surface design but it makes the switch to an acrylic and polycarbonate chassis instead of glass and aluminum it maintains those big old bezels but unfortunately does away with stereo boom sound speakers but it does come with a fully fledged version of HTC edge sense something even the pixel 2 doesn't have edge sense lets you use long and short squeezes of the frame to launch the camera and take photos or switch between cameras you can also use it to launch Google assistant and map various actions within individual apps some might think it's gimmicky but I find it to be quite intuitive and actually use it a lot of course if you're not into it it can easily be disabled another nice HTC add on to the stock Oreo experiences HTC use sonic audio tuning vo 11 life comes with a pair of active noise-cancelling used sonic earbuds connected via USB type-c they're very comfortable to wear and offer rich bass and excellent audio quality but they're real secret is in their ability to map the contours of your ear canal to create an audio profile that's unique to you because the u11 life Android one runs Oreo it also supports various high-end audio codecs like optics HD and L doc so if you're into wireless headphones you can enjoy a higher quality streaming it also supports Bluetooth 5 for higher throughput and longer range connections with compatible devices the downside of all this Audio goodness is that there's no 3.5 ml headphone jack and there's no included adapter either even if you already have a 3.5 ml two USB type-c adapter lying around it likely won't work with the u 11 life that's because HTC uses a special digital protocol the dumb adapters don't support so if you want your wired headphones to play nice with you eleven life you'll have to pick up an HTC made digital adapter with a built-in DAC another thing worth noting is that the impressive viewsonic earbuds won't work with other smartphones that don't support that protocol I mentioned while they worked fine with the huawei mate 10 Pro they didn't with the LG v 30 the Galaxy Note 8 or the pixel 2 it's likely not a deal-breaker but something to be aware of the you 11 life has two big surprises in store and the 5.2 inch full HD super LCD panel is one of them it's really quite good with rich colors good dynamic range in viewing angles and decent if not exceptional outdoor visibility with over 500 nits of brightness the second surprise was the camera which was much better than I was expecting HTC has been making some good cameras for a while now and the 16 megapixel F 2.0 cameras on the front and back of the U 11 life are really very good the main camera has phase detection autofocus but unfortunately no optical image stabilization but steady hands though you can get very good low-light shots with little noise and good color reproduction just take a look at this side-by-side with a pixel two to see how well the you eleven life performs at this price point the cameras performance is a very big bonus sure it has its weaknesses most notably a slow camera app and shutter lag but with a little patience you can get really good shots out of it it shoots video in 4k at 30 frames per second with high res audio recording and 720p slow-motion at 120 frames per second as HDR boost on both cameras and you've got a very capable pro mode with support for raw I found the U 11 life tended to slightly under expose shots but that's easily fixed with the exposure compensation slider in the camera app or by using the manual controls colors were accurate without over saturation and the 11 life captures a good amount of detail in daylight well both things do degrade in really dark environments and sooner or later noise is unavoidable but I was generally really impressed by the you 11 lifes camera and think it along with the software experience and display are the real standouts of this phone you 11 life also has an ip67 water resistance rating NFC if you're into Android pay comes in versions with 3gb of RAM and 32gb of storage or four gig of ram and 64 gig of storage both of which have microSD expansion they're considering the minimal price difference between the two I absolutely recommend the version with more RAM and storage it also packs all the benefits of Android Orio alongside guaranteed updates for two years and security patches but but there's always a downside and some of the you 11 life's floors are going to be make or break for some besides the contentious headphone jack situation the you 11 life is powered by the Snapdragon 630 a thoroughly mid-range chipset that while it handles the Android borio experience admirably isn't going to be good enough for some folks especially if you consider yourself a power user or mobile gamer I found the 630 to be quite sufficient for everyday tasks but it's something to keep in mind especially considering the same amount of money can get you a better spec sheet elsewhere the 2600 milliamp hour battery is also not going to be big enough for everyone I have raised between four and a half to five and a half hours of screen on time of day which is fine for most but we'll leave demanding users wanting more the 5 volt 2 am charging brick will top the 11 life off in a little over an hour and a half with a half charge in 30 to 40 minutes you're living life also feels very plasticky and scratches much more easily than a glass packed phone it's more resistant to impact and less likely to crack the glass but I'd still recommend using a case just to protect that surface from scratches it'll attract as readily as it does fingerprints likewise the single bottom firing speaker is there if you really need it but there's no HTC boomsound to be found here and as nice as a 16 megapixel selfie camera is I personally would have preferred a more sedate front facing sensor in exchange for OAS on the main camera as with all mid-range phones it's a game of give and take if you want to know if you should spend 350 euro on the u11 life with Android one I can't definitively say that you should there's just too much solar competition in the same price range that you'd need to check out first some of which has dual cameras bigger batteries and more audio options for example but one thing I can say is that if you do buy the you 11 life Android one you're very unlikely to be disappointed yes it's a little slower and less powerful than some other phones out there and maybe it's battery could be bigger and it's price tag a little bit lower but the software experience is excellent and has some great additional features like edge sense and new sonic audio and it packs a great screen really good camera and has guaranteed updates for years unfortunately for our US viewers it's not making it to the US market though but you will get a version with HTC Sense the HTC u 11 life Android 1 is not the perfect phone for everyone No but if the issues you've seen here haven't put you off the HCC you eleven life with Android one is going to be a really great phone for many as always thank you so much for watching be sure to subscribe like the video hit us up on social media and visit Android Authority comm for more on HTC

hey it's Josh Arikara what's going on everybody and we're taking a look at the Scogin falster now Scogin already has a great library of analog watches and a growing library of hybrid smart watches however this is their first touchscreen device now this particular one runs Android wear which means that it is compatible with Android and iOS devices making it a pretty accessible device just like their other hybrid smartwatches however you'll get access to Google assistance all of the different smartphone notifications via cards that you might be used to an Android wear already and of course customizable watch faces which we'll get into in a second but the first thing that you'll notice about the falster is its minimalist modern design Scogin really did nail the design of the foster we think and we believe that this is one of the most beautiful Android wear smartwatches we've seen thus far one of the reasons why is because of the design while being minimalistic is also at a good size it's not too small for most people who might have larger wrists however for those like women who might be looking for smaller bodies and there's more watches this actually fits the bill quite well there's even a dial over on the side that has a nice meaty and satisfying click to its meaning that this is a sturdy yet sleek device all around it does have interchangeable watch straps which include this leather option that we saw and also these mesh straps that we saw as well underneath the surface there is the Snapdragon wear 2100 processor that powers what is kind of the smoothest Android wear iteration we've seen thus far as well there's just something about this clean interface but also just how smooth the animations look that make its feel just a bit more premium than other Android wear smartwatches that we've used there are four watch faces already installed and all of them showed just enough information without cluttering up the screen overall the falster offers an edited take on useful functionality and simpler cleaner interfaces Scoggin might have created a SmartWatch that is actually incredibly accessible for way more audiences then you might expect for usual Android wear smartwatches the falster will come in at $275 and 295 dollars depending on your configuration and will launch sometime in January 2018 so keep it tuned to Andrew authority for more about the Scoggin falster and more Scoggin smartwatches including the hybrid SmartWatch like the yarn that we did review a little while and then keep it into Android 34 even more from CES 2018 because we are of course your source for all things Android
