Happy podcast day  universe! Today’s episode is a ginormous lesson in staying calm in the eye of the storm. I walk you through my own internal processing while finding myself in social media drama and return to this very simple  but oh-so-important learning: what people reflect back my way is not the truth of who I am. Having 1 000 people tell you you’re amazing doesn’t make it so  and neither does having 1 000 people tell you that you’re awful. Being at peace with who we are is a constant practice and sometimes the universe throws a little drama our way to make you prove it! Thank goodness for opportunities to continue learning  learning  learning❤️ I talk about what being of service truly means for me and how it’s evolved throughout my life  the meaning of #PurposefulAds and #GoodKarmaMarketing and also give more insight into the children’s mission we are launching this year. Tune in now to listen! Link to podcast in bio (or search Yoga Girl wherever you normally get your podcasts). LOVING YOU! Thank you for enlightening me and for helping me stay anchored in my purpose. You’re all forking awesome. x

Here’s a question... What have you done to make a change in the world lately? How much time  energy and money do you dedicate to being of service? No judgement - just leaving that up there. For you. To think about. 

.
I’m off - running three non-profit foundations while managing 40 employees is a lot of work and I have to get my beauty sleep😴😘 #ChangeTheWorld #BeOfService #BigMoneyBigImpact #NonProfit #SocialMission #ForkTheHaters #InfluencersForChange #YOGA. AD!

Yoga brings calm to my soul – but a sweaty practice also brings odor to my yoga clothes. I used to use vinegar to get the stench out – but re-engineered Tide has shown me a better way to do Half Lotus  without the lingering workout smell💪🏼❤️ I can now focus on taking deep breaths and staying present. Give it a try for yourself and see how #TideBeatsHacks ! #Yoga #Ad. When you go to work but you’re worried about your baby all the time and wondering what she is doing and if she’s happy and if she misses you... And then @jessicarydh sends you this😭❤️😂❤️😍 (Luna’s Låda means Luna’s Box) 🌙📦 🎨 MY HEART!!!!!!!!!! I CAN’T!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍

As International Women’s Day is approaching Natural Cycles is raising topics related to contraception and female health. So important! Starting my day off right involves more than rolling out my yoga mat. Knowing my body and my cycle is a big part of my self-care routine and every single morning  before I get out of bed  I take my temperature to keep track of my cycle with the Natural Cycles app. We are not ready for another baby yet  and tracking my cycle and logging my temperature first thing in the morning gives me peace of mind and sets the tone for my day ahead. After that I get out of bed  get the baby and together we roll out my yoga mat for practice and play💕☺️

Want to start tracking your cycle and get to know your body better? See if Natural Cycles is for you! Go to http://bit.ly/yogagirlnaturalcycles for more information. #yourcyclematters #ad. Afternoon stroll and came across these guys! @philip_merryweather one day we’re going to pay an entrance fee I promise! (actually we just came by to borrow a cup of sugar)😜 We’ve been here with Luna before but this was the first time she fully connected with all the animals. Watching her eyes light up and reach out to pet them just melted my heart into mush (and it’s already pretty mushy these days)😭 She copies the sounds all the animals make - monkeys  cows  goats  horses  birds... Ok most of them sound alike (its either “heh heh” or “moh moh” or “ih ih”) but still😂 According to her astrological chart she has a huge connection to animals and plants and might just be a little artist in the making... I believe it❤️😌 

Recording a podcast today but I don’t know what about. Camels? Water/Fire? This weeks epiphanies? Shoot me some topic suggestions! Whatever I end up talking about I’ll find a way to cry into the mic  that I’m sure of...🤷🏼‍♀️🙈😬😇💕 Loving you. x #life. Cactus fruit! @dennisfromsalad all-time favorite thing. He loves picking tiny pink fruits off of cacti. Actually  he loves everything tiny. Miniature everything (so he can make the Zoolander joke “is this a thing for ANTS?”). And he loves everything pink. When we go out to eat they always hand me the pink umbrella drink and give him the pint of beer (but it goes the other way around). So when I got to eat this little fruit today... That’s how I know it’s true love😌💕 #tinypinkthings #cactusfruit #marriage #truelove #desert #alsodessert #family #walk #love. Rock & Roll Gypsy🌸⚡️

Feeling fierce AF today and ready to make some serious dreams happen💪🏼 In other news... Lea Luna has weaned and I am no longer breastfeeding. Fought it for a long time (who am I kidding - I’ve been trying to force it on her since she took her first steps and completely lost interest). In the spirit of making space for calm and going with the flow I have now surrendered to it and am hereby letting go. Her first birthday is coming up on Tuesday and she is done. Super healthy  super happy and doesn’t want to nurse. That’s just where we are! So I’m letting it go. And in letting go... Guess what I realized? I GET MY BOOBS BACK! Say whutttttt! Celebrating these ta-ta’s today🍒 and you should do the same! Yours  not mine😜 Whether you’ve breastfed or not  if they’re large or small  perky or less perky (hehe) - they’re yours! Love them hard and when possible  set them free😘😌 #selflove #freedom #rocknroll #gypsy #boho #free #beyourself #loveyourself #life #enjoy #freespirit #be. Raspberry lemonade and these sparkling gems✨ (I take all my rings off to write). I can’t get my wedding ring back on after pregnancy!! Anyone else with the same issue? I took it off in my last trimester because my fingers swelled a little bit but now I can’t get it back on. Should I force it and see what happens? Forcing anything doesn’t usually go well for me judging from my past😝 but the ring is my grandmothers from the 70s and when we added stones to it before our wedding the jeweler said we can’t do more to it because the original ring is so thin and fragile (if you want to see it  scroll to my engagement post from June 2013 lol)😂 so. Force it on? I’m thinking my knuckles are just big(ger? Does that happen?) but what if I put it on and it’s way too tight and then I can’t get it off? Mehhhhhh.

.
Ok  enough procrastinating. I always procrastinate writing my book by writing about other things... Or by adding tiny specks of light to photos like this one above😬😂 #okbyeeee #writingnow #iswear. Sunrise practice. My back still aches but it’s better. Gentle movements  deep breaths and slow mornings with my loves help❤️ It’s funny that now that it makes sense  I can trace this back pain back to so much. Journaling on it now. Made a vision board over the weekend to help me manifest the soft  calm life I yearn for so much. It’s hard when everything around me and within me pulls in another direction. I have book deadlines and an overflowing inbox and employees that need support and to-do lists that are endless. So instead of rushing out the door  I make an effort to sit down for breakfast just a little bit longer. I take my time feeding the baby. I enjoy my morning cup of coffee. After breakfast  we play. Without rush. When I hug my husband  I linger. And then I’m out the door and I work. And work. And work. I’m super fast. Super efficient - I do it all at mega speed because that’s how I work best. And when I come home... I take a breath  kick my shoes off and try to be slow again. I make an effort to light candles at the end of the day. To put my phone away. To make our home sacred. I have to make an effort because calm doesn’t come easy to me. But I do my best to make space for it - to return. To slow down so much in the moments that matter that when I speed up in the in-between  I don’t lose touch with why I’m here  doing all of this. 

So many lessons in finding this balance. It’s a practice; like yoga. Never finished. 

What are you practicing today?

I’m starting to realize that it’s not so much about finding peace as it is about finding all the ways in which I separate from it. Meditation isn’t a new state of mind  a different realm  a transcendence. It’s just a returning. Its simple  really. Its coming back to what’s already at the core of our being. 

It’s returning to who we already are.

#tica #lealuna #baby #adorable #love. Stood in front of my bookshelf this morning with closed eyes  took a deep breath and let a book pick me. When I blinked my eyes open A Return To Love was in my hands. I haven’t read this book in so  so long. I’m a few chapters in but feel like I’m reading it for the first time. “Be not afraid  but let your world be lit by miracles”. The title page made me cry with relief  with remembrance.

.
 I first came across A Course In Miracles in 2008  a whole decade ago. I had just left Sweden and was living on my own in Costa Rica and everywhere I went I felt like I belonged. I had no money  no plan  no big life goal. I was just happy floating from place to place  happy to be alive  happy to be me. The trust I felt within my heart at 19 was so profound... I don’t know how I ever lost it. I don’t know how I ever got caught up in so much fear. I lived in a shack on the beach and every morning a little group from an intentional community I spent a lot of time in would gather on the beach and read excerpts from A Course In Miracles copied on sheets of A4. I remember feeling almost silly hearing the words read out loud - I already knew this. I didn’t just know it  I knew it knew it. But everyone was so serious  dissecting every paragraph  looking for meaning. I had the meaning. I still have the meaning. We all do. I’ve just gotten separated from it. No - I have separated from it. It’s not just circumstance  it’s me. I’ve been busy doing instead of being. For so many years. And then almost exactly one year ago a little light bearer came into my life to remind me of everything I’ve always known. That it’s safe to love. Safe to let go. Safe to let be. To swim forth in clean water and leave the mud behind. That it’s time to return to love.

.
It’s not strange that I found myself with this book in my hands this morning... It is time.

Time to come back home.

#trust #trust #trust. I’ve had this pain right at the back of my heart for as long as I can remember. Something just snaps and I become paralyzed and can’t move. It’s been going on for years. Nothing helps and I’ve tried it all; yoga  physical therapy  acupuncture  acupressure  reiki  massage  chiro  osteopathy  traditional doctors  naprapaths  kinesiology  you name it I’ve done it. The worst part has been not being able to anticipate it or knowing what triggers the pain.
.
It happened today. I’ve been feeling so great but this morning I open my eyes and it’s happened IN MY SLEEP. In my sleep! My back is out. Can’t move. So I spend all day on the couch which drives me nuts. I snapped at Dennis for leaving his loose change on the table and we fight and it’s not until just now that I realize the reason I snapped is because I’m terrified Luna is going to choke on them - every day I pick up goddamn coins around the house. Fuck these fucking coins and everything else that she could put in her mouth that could get lodged in the back of her throat; dog food  rocks from the garden... I snapped because I’m fearful. It’s not the damn coins  it’s the fear they represent and the fact that I have no control. I police everything and it’s exhausting. AND THEN IT HITS ME. I did so much work with @debrasilverman_astrology about my fear of death and then @the.small.folk lost their little Alby and I’ve been consumed by it. He choked on a rubber ball and died in his mother’s arms. 3 years old. I can’t stop thinking about him. And then I wake up and my heart has literally frozen - my back is out. I think I finally get it. It’s fear. This pain. That’s what it is. It’s not my chaturanga that needs fixing. It’s not the pillow I sleep on at night. IT’S FEAR. It’s the common denominator. I’ve finally found it. Fear of death  fear is loss  fear of abandonment. I feel fearful but it’s too big for me to process so it gets stuck in my body. The fear of losing Lea Luna is so overwhelming that my body seizes up in my sleep. 
.
Everything is making total sense. I’m still in pain  but it makes sense now. It’s a relief and it’s terrifying. So I guess the question is...

now what? 
#beinghumanisfuckingexhausting. Thank you 8 Limbs Yoga Centers for this great response on the recent developments in the yoga world.

http://8limbsyoga.com/response-to-northwest-yoga-conference/. The post-swim lesson snuggles!❤️ We are learning Infant Swim Rescue with @isramymann and its SO fascinating. Basically babies 6 months to 6 years learn how to turn from face down in water to lying face up floating completely by themselves on their backs (and if they are able to walk they can learn how to swim!) - learning how to rescue themselves if they’re ever to accidentally fall in a body of water. With our new pool here at the house this is giving me waaaay more peace of mind - not to mention it’s so cool watching Luni learn this stuff😳 She’ll never ever be outside by the pool by herself (infant swim rescue is obviously not a replacement for common sense but since this is social media I just have to say it) but this is a pretty cool added safety measure. Who knew tiny babies can learn all of this!? We do 10 minute lessons every day 5 days a week for 5 weeks. She’s done 7 lessons so far (missed a week because of ear infection) and she already knows how to float on her own! Go Pisces baby go! I’ll post some videos too later on. Any parents out there that have tried this? Ow did your babies do? Share!!👶🏊‍♀️💦🏊‍♂️ #infantswimrescue #isr #infantswim #babyswim #babyswimming #pool #safety #water #ocean #lealuna #love. It’s March! For this month  this is what’s on my to-do list:

• Continue being soft. I don’t know if you’ve noticed  but I’m all gooey and vulnerable and overflowing with emotion these days. That’s a good thing.
.

• Float in water. Every day. Switch off phone - take off clothes - float. Simple recipe for instant peace of mind and body.
.

• Trust that baby is safe  because she is. When contrasting thoughts show up  redirect awareness to here and now. All. Is. Well.
.

• Family time. Before everything else. The three of us  being. It’s everything that matters.
.

• Do the yoga. Drink the wine. Wind down at the end of each day.
.

• Vision board evening! Learn to manifest out of peace  not panic .
.

• Write another 100 pages on book (deadline is April 3!)
.

• All the regular work-stuff. So much is here and the busy-bee side of me wants to write out 100+ bullet points to highlight all the doing  working  busy-ing. I won’t. I have a super team supporting me. Everything is under control.
.

• Continue cleansing  beautifying  releasing  purging  organizing. Our home is our temple. Be a temple keeper.
.

• Sit in silence (don’t overthink it).

.
.
.

Whats on your agenda for the month? I am in the middle of the most busy and exciting time of my career… And I managed to put work at the bottom of the list. Feeling so very good about this. Learning how to manifest and be efficient through the art of grounding. Floating. Trusting. 

It’s March people! We’ve got work to do! Most of it is internal and of the heart. Let’s get started.

If you listen to my podcasts and watch my instagram stories you are already aware of this  but I have some truly badass stuff to share! Here goes: You will be seeing some very obvious ads and marketing on this platform over the coming months... WHAAAAAT!? The number 1 anti ad person is going to start posting ads on Instagram?! Hehe. DAMN STRAIGHT! I’m calling it #GoodKarmaMarketing and I am truly hoping this is something that catches on. I am launching a huge new foundation this year dedicated to children in need and our first initiative will be helping abused children in Aruba. A big issue here is that the orphanage is always full and they often send kids back to their homes even though their parents have been deemed unfit. My dream is to open a second facility  an orphanage or a foster home  but it’s too early to decide how this exact project will look. Right now we are busy manifesting a shit ton of money so we can help communities EVERYWHERE - Aruba is just the beginning. I want to redefine how business is done  how we view entrepreneurship and how social media is being used as a whole (stay tuned for something epic launching later this year)💪🏼 One of the first changes I am making myself is beginning to use this platform for some very selective marketing so we can use the funds generated to be of service. It just felt ridiculous to continue turning down money every month when we are struggling to raise what’s needed for the launch. More details will follow but what I need from you all is this: if you ever see an ad on here (it will be rare) - ENGAGE WITH IT! Like it  comment on it and support the brand that’s connecting with us and thereby doing marketing with PURPOSE. I’ll be able to share at the end of each month exactly how much money we were able to generate for non-profit projects through this new online marketing initiative (but I won’t always be able to say so within every post - it depends on the brand guidelines of the company I’m promoting). For now... Trust that I’m only sharing epic shit. And stay tuned for MEGA MAGIC🌱🌎❤️🤗

Doesn’t matter how. Practice yoga  to for a run  walk your dogs  dance in your living room  play with your kids. Just move energy around in your body or you will become stagnant. The more we move  the easier it is to move because our vibration runs high. The less we move the harder it is to get started. So as you’re reading this... Decide: how an I moving my body today? Share it with me below❤️ I had a 60-minute yoga practice at @island.yoga and then recorded this little flow (if you copy it don’t forget to do the other side - this is just half!). Feeling all sorts of yummy right now. And a wheel happened! That’s been a long  long time coming. So delicious. x

My greatest teacher (along with the guy who’s always behind the lens). Together they’re teaching me everything about water. How to be slow and fluid and gentle and soft. To let the waves carry me and have faith that we all actually already know how to swim - even when the seas get rough (I this little girl has been swimming for lifetimes...). And to trust. Just trust. My greatest lesson.

I love you @dennisfromsalad ❤️💧 Thank you for bringing all of this unshakable love and stability into my life. It’s everything I could have ever imagined and 
so
much 
more . #life. Wondering what I’ve been up to these past 24 hours? I’ve been to the stars and back! 🌙⭐️💫 Did a 4 Elements Intensive with Debra Silverman Astrology and it completely blew my mind and heart open😭❤️ So beyond grateful for these past 24 hours. I still can’t put into words everything I’ve processed. To sum up: Because it the many events that transpired in my childhood I have been living under the false belief that the world is a very scary place  and that intense love must be accompanied by intense fear. I’m walking with baggage that’s dragging me down and that has since long served it’s purpose. It brought me here. It’s over - it’s done. In this moment  right here right now  I am safe. I am held. I am protected. I am here with a very big purpose. I don’t need to be anyone’s savior. I can lean into spirit. IT IS SAFE FOR ME TO LOVE! 

It sounds so simple  I know... But to the core of my being this is brand new information😂

.

I have learned so much about myself this weekend. I was a total skeptic when it comes to astrology before but watching even @dennisfromsalad (the most skeptical and practical person I know) find truths and resonate with his chart was so beautiful. Follow @debrasilverman_astrology to learn more about our connection to universal truth immediately!!! We recorded a podcast that answers all of your questions that will be out Friday - don’t miss it!

Happy podcast day everyone❤️ Ij today’s episode I talk about death. Death  fear of death  overcoming adversity  trauma  pain... All the truly hard stuff. I share what was the hardest year of my life with the passing of my best friend  my grandmother and my dog all within the course of five months  and how when it comes to trauma  healing is not a linear thing. It’s normal - necessary even - to shut down and shut off in the midst of loss; it’s how we survive. And somehow we love on and we get through it and inevitably  we’ll be presented with opportunities to return to the wound. I’m in it now. It’s been four years... But I couldn’t do it then. Doing it now is super hard because I’m in the midst of so much life and joy - but maybe that’s the only way. To have something truly beautiful to balance out the pain.

Working through a lot these days. Giving myself permission to move all the time. To make plans and abandon them right away. To work hard. To mother hard. To be with my husband. To drink the wine. To cut to the chase. To pick something up and then lose interest and try again. I’m all over the place. Allowing it. Me. Recording the podcast yesterday I realized; I’m writing a book about death. Is that why I’m so obsessed with the idea of it lately? Not so strange after all.

Turning my phone off now (which is hard  because the baby monitor app is on my phone and I like to look at Little Moon as she sleeps). Tuning out and tuning in. Quality time with Ram Dass and my yoga mat. Reading Be Here Now for the 100th time. So good. Loving you. x

I was so scared of motherhood before it actually came my way. I was scared to fuck up. To not be enough. To pass on my unsolved pain to her. Scared of so many things. Most of all... Scared to lose her. I still am. Every day. I asked a friend who has grown children the other day; of the overwhelming fear of losing her will ever fully settle. She was surprised; “oh  I never had that. I always felt a lot of trust. But you know  whatever you have to deal with  your children will bring to surface for you.” 

.
So I’ve been thinking. Maybe it’s not just motherhood - that this is what it is. Maybe I feel it more intensely because it’s what’s already within me  it’s unsolved  not yet healed. My fear of loss. Maybe when your stepdad and your grandparents and your best friend and your dog all die and your mom spends the bigger part of your childhood not wanting to live it sets you up for this. Every time Luna takes a nap I wonder to myself if this is the nap she’ll never wake up from. But she always wakes up. I shake the thought and carry on and she always wakes up. 

.
I had my future read once by a woman who told me I would have a baby girl that would die  and then two boys. This was the year before everybody died. I think about that reading and I wonder - does that woman know what she did to my peace of mind? A part of me thinks  if she knew so much  why couldn’t she have told me that my best friend was going to crash her car and die two months later. Or that my grandmother would pass three months after that. Or my dog  my baby  three weeks after that. And that my mom would try to commit suicide again four months later. Why couldn’t she have predicted any of that? Instead she just planted this idea in my brain that in its turn became a fear so intense some days I don’t know how to live with it. 
.
I don’t know. I’ve never told anyone about that reading because I was so scared it would become true. But I call bullshit. I think Luna is here to help me heal all this shit  by just being who she is. By being here. By my side. And safe. Every day. #motherhood  @ Island Yoga.

#yogagirl #covershoot #beach #happiness #love #smile #bathinsuit #ocean #sea #sand #joy #aruba #islandvibes #island #caribbean #yoga #yogaeverydamnday #life. Facebook gave me a memory from 5 years ago today (swipe left to see it⬅️). It’s me in our old house on the little yoga deck @dennisfromsalad built me in the garden underneath our mango tree. I’m in an advanced yoga pose and I make it look so easy. Looking at the memory I scoff - “those were the days! Look at what my body could do!”. I was practicing hours of yoga every day and taught 23 classes a week at the time. My entire life was yoga. I had just started this Instagram account and every day after my practice I’d lean my phone up agains a rock  put it on self timer and take photos of myself in poses. I would post something new every day and from my little yoga deck in my backyard  I watched this community grow. 

.
Today  writing this  my life looks vastly different. I’m older. I spent the bigger part of three straight years traveling the world teaching yoga. Eventually  my body couldn’t take it. I grew tired of living on the road. Decided to set roots. Got pregnant. Opened a yoga studio. Birthed a baby. My yoga practice is... Not what it was. Today  it was four poses on my mat in the living room while wriggling an 11-month old who thinks it’s hilarious to run at me as fast as she can with complete disregard for any obstacles in her way (ie dogs and furniture)😝 My yoga deck has grown but I have never  not once had a real practice on it (11-month olds and pools don’t quite go hand in hand). I still practice every day but I don’t practice the poses I once used to - there are no funky pincha mayurasanas in sight. I do yoga to stay sane and free from pain. It’s as simple as that. And I take very few photos of my practice because I don’t have the time anymore  and I find that the most inspirational things I can share have more to do with heart and soul than poses and body. So today when I told Dennis to take a photo of me attempting this pose... I meant it as a joke! Like “look what this crap looks like now”. BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW PEOPLE! This momma’s still got it! It wasn’t even hard. Makes me wonder if I just naturally am able to do stuff like this or if some poses show up one day and are there to stay. Maybe... Some things just do stay the same🤔 #yoga. Sometimes the only choice we are left with is to let go. To surrender and release control. Let go. Let go. Let go. Stop resisting and allow the dust and the murkiness of your past to be stirred to the surface before it can settle. Sadness will come and that's ok. Pain will come and that's ok. Despair will come and that's ok. It's all ok because in the empty space that follows... Trust will start to grow. Love will set it's roots within you. Joy will blossom. Feel it all. Let. It. Be. This is the process of healing. It's the only way - to let it out and let it in. You might not know it but the seeds of the most miraculous parts of your life are being planted right here  right now. In this. One day they are going to sprout. And everything is going to be okay again.

When you’re making home made vegan meatball subs and it requires using your Vitamix but your baby is sleeping so you prepare it in your bedroom and it’s sort of like camping but also not at all🙂

THIS SHIT IS SO GOOD THOUGH! Putting the recipe in my IG story. Basically you make veggie meatballs and cook them in marinara sauce and put them in a sub with some lettuce and veggie parmesan and life is made. 🌱🥖🥫🤗x #plantbased #vegan #veggie #cooking #foodprep #bedroomcooking #healthy #weird #parenthood. We’re ok. Thank you everyone❤️ Our first ever hospital visit and I hope I never again have to race to the ER in my pajamas with a baby in my arms that could barely hold up her own head😣 Her ear infection is back (or never really went away - and we’ve been swimming! Ugh) and last night she had insane fever spikes that just wouldn’t go down (we took a cold bath  paracetamol  everything). I’m glad we went in but in the end  they didn’t do much. We slept in the waiting room and played with a stethoscope and eventually got to go home. Very sweet doctors though calming a very panicked first time mom though. And now she’s acting like she’s never felt better in her life! I think it’s the post-fever high😂 We will use earplugs when swimming after she’s all healed and well again and I’ll have to be super careful with her ears in the water from now on. Little angel. She’s very happy today. Still feverish but happy. And I keep thinking about all the parents out there that are dealing with actual illness🤕 There are babies with all sorts of serious illnesses out there that I can’t even think about. Sending love to every mom and dad worrying about the wellbeing of their child right now. You are fierce as FUCK. Parenthood is no joke. This love is no joke. The fear... I can’t even go there. Loving you all and thanks for the well wishes❤️ #lealuna #11months #motherhood. Hospital nights💔 104.5F Fever (40.4C) and it just kept going up. It’s 2am. Been here three hours. Drove here with my heart in my throat - she was completely lethargic and didn’t even cry or say a thing. Now she’s better. But this shit is so scary. We just want to go home😔 #emergencyroom #parenthood #lealuna #angel. Happy Friday and happy Podcast Day!!! It todays episode I talk about social media marketing  big yoga corporations  influencers and staying authentic in the online world. I share my social media triggers and things that drive me up the wall (companies pretending to do good  influencers faking vulnerability  people portraying yoga as exclusively for the thin  flexible person.... The list is LONG)😅 I get into my own reasoning behind choosing not to use my Instagram account as a marketing platform  dreams of being able to create new forms of transparent marketing to do good (#GoodKarmaMarketing anyone???)  wanting to inspire other influencers to use their influence for good and more.

A part of me wants to go live in the jungle somewhere and walk barefoot in the dirt and completely retire and never send an email or hold a smartphone ever again and be naked always naked and do nothing for the rest of my life other than eat mangoes and swim in the ocean and raise this little moon baby like the earth fairy she is🌸 BUT then I remember: I’m here to change the world. And to do that you have to kick ass and work your butt off and send the emails and use the smartphones and take the meetings and make the money and continue creating. So I’ll stay here - writing  working  working. With moon baby naked in the garden but fully clothed in public (mostly). Our mangos are from the grocery store and the WiFi connection is strong but the ocean is right here. Balance. It’s what it’s all about😌 #moonbaby #earth #naked #pachamama #hippieatheart #entrepreneurinlife #YogaGirl #love. AND THAT’S A WRAP!!!! 14 days of shooting. 23 000+ photos. 50+ outfit changes. And too many smiles to count from this little gal!❤️ We are happy. We are tired. Big reveal coming soon...😏😍😇

He loves her so much. She loves him so much. Their friendship is the best. They spend a lot of time in his bed  chewing their collective toys (there is no differentiation between dog toys and baby toys in this house anymore). She is really gentle with him but even when she isn’t he is always gentle back. She feeds him from the table and he licks all the food off her cheeks🙈 I love them both so much😭

Step away for a moment and look at the big picture. Notice all the things that are going well  that are running smoothly? Focus on them. Put more energy into order than you do chaos. Shine your light on what you want more of in life instead of getting swallowed up by the small stuff. All is well. Everything is fine. 

You have so much to be grateful for already.

In today’s episode I’m joined by the hubs @dennisfromsalad (who’s now a steady guest once a month due to popular demand!)! We start off talking about germs and OCD - I’ve found myself increasingly nervous by germs since becoming a mom while Dennis is the same old slob and truly couldn’t care less🙄😬 

We then talk about a recent fight (errr fights) we had and how we process in two completely different ways - he shuts down and does his processing in silence and I want to talk and vent and share. I don’t know why people asked us questions about this because we are CLEARLY not experts here😂  We transition into the topic of makeup  the meaning of life  being happy as a hippo and then get into the #MeToo movement. Aaaaaand then  somehow  Dennis tells the world the story of or first night together😳😩😂🙈 I cant believe we didn’t edit anything out buuut I guess this is just how we roll now!!! (does anyone remember the days of Dennis refusing to speak on Snapchat? Those days are long gone!)🙈 

 I laugh out loud into the mic so many times in this episode and Dennis sarcasm reach brand new levels so hopefully we don’t offend anyone too bad. Hehe. ENJOY!

Beelieve in your own ability to create magic✨💫⭐️💡 . . . 

Tonight I’m feeling inspired by @dennisfromsalad ❤️ He decided to pick up a camera one day and is now fully immersing himself in learning something brand new. The other night he asked me to sit in the middle of the bed holding a jar of string lights... and I thought he was nuts😂 But then this dreamy little shot happened! With Ringo giving the stink eye! So cute. My point is - if it’s tugging on your heart  give it a try! Learn as you go. Experiment along the way. Don’t be afraid to fail. Believe in your ability to capture light and make actual magic happen🌙 .

Spent the day at Aruba’s only fresh water spring... Dreaming about one day opening an eco retreat center here. It’s so beautiful. In the middle of the national park. Miles from everything. No cell service. Right on the ocean but in the middle of nowhere. There is an ancient house on the property with beautiful hand-painted tiles in every room. And the spring! The spring! It’s magical. Grape vines all around and little fishies that nibble on your feet. And turtles! And goats roaming! I love it here. If anyone out there is casually sitting on a couple million dollars that you want to give away...

Wore flowy dress and hippie pants and high heels and walked barefoot and smiled and was serious and took all of the photos. Came home. Walked the dogs.

Plopped down on the couch after an entire day of shooting with a husband who now also takes photos and always has a camera in his hand sooo this is what a very very tired woman wearing a lot of makeup looks like👻

Good night  universe! Tomorrow morning we start again (can I just float into bed like a vampire and use this face again tomorrow??)😴🧖🏼‍♀️💄 #secretshoot #tietie #gnight #hairandmakeupbegone. Note from the universe:

You are so wonderfully  magically  undeniably perfect - just the way you are.

SOMEONE GOT HER FIRST BUMP ON THE HEAD😩😩😩 We were walking around on a little road along the beach and she was wearing little moccasins and ran so fast that when she stumbled and fell she somersaulted and whacked her little head into the pavement🤕😭😩 She was so fast I couldn’t keep up! I think her brain hasn’t caught up with her body yet (or the other way around?). Look at this little bump. But. We lived through it! Angel baby.

PS this is it right?? One bump on the head per child? Ok cool👍🏼🤓 #lealuna #10months #family #cuteness #bump #love  @ Island Yoga. NA-NA!🍌

📷: @wildernessstories #banana #nana #lealuna #eat #enjoy #delicious #baby #10months #life #family #love. Happy Friday and happy podcast day!!!! This podcast is already making its way out into the ether - it’s a hot topic! In today’s episode I dive into the very sensitive subject of competition  jealousy and cattiness in the world of yoga and business. I share my own stories of being on both sides of the spectrum - both having felt nervous about other teachers competing with me and having had other teachers create drama over competition. I share specific stories from different times in my life as a yoga teacher and entrepreneur and candidly talk about both the challenge and the learning of each situation. Operating out of lack will always make us feel like we don’t have enough and this is where most sense of competition and jealousy stems from - the fear of not being able to provide for ourselves. But what if we operate out of abundance and out of knowing that we are cared for? This sets us up for success in a completely different way!  I talk about yoga industry and how guru culture always creates a challenging situation (I truly believe everyone in a pedestal is pretending!)  supporting other teachers  being humble and much more. Tune in to learn some big life lessons on how to grow your business and stay anchored in passion and love for the work you do in the world❤️

Had a great day and then a very hard day. Feeling completely drained. Done. Finished. Tomorrow I’ll feel differently. I know that. But right now I’m so low. So low. Out of balance. Working too hard but not enough. Focusing my energy on too many things at once. When in reality  all I want to do is lie in bed and cuddle this little munchkin. Who for the past three days has been walking like nobody’s business! Steady as a rock. Fearless  going from room to room  stopping to pick things up off the floor and then stand back up again. Easy as pie. She’s so joyful! And walking. Tiny miracles. My little moon. 

Life is good. And hard. Mostly good. x

Trying to get used to the concept that I don’t have to deserve to rest - I can just rest because I want to. I’m really bad at resting. Bad at the not-doing. I’m always in motion. Never still. And when I do rest or take a break or treat myself it’s always after a very intense project or many consecutive weeks of hard work. I always felt like I had to “deserve” it - “ok now I’ve completely exhausted myself to the point of a meltdown and worked harder than any human being should - NOW it’s ok for me to take a break”🤨 

Someone recently opened my eyes to how nuts this is; this idea of deserving a break. What if resting doesn’t have to be a reward? What if I could (should?) rest just because... I want to? Mind boggling!😳 Replenishing ourselves is so important but I always feel like I’m wasting time. So... I’m working on it. Took a nap the other day - for no reason other than that I was tired (I normally never nap). Read a chapter of a new book yesterday instead of opening my computer to “finish my days work” (which actually never ends). And today  after teaching yoga and putting the baby down for a nap and cleaning the kitchen I opened my computer to dive into my inbox and in the corner of my eye  I saw the glittering water of the pool right outside... The sun is shining. The baby is asleep. WHAT THE HELP AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE???🙈😝😅 So for the past hour I’ve just been out here. Doing absolutely nothing. Slightly uncomfortable  I admit. It’s a very weird feeling because my to-do list is long. But I don’t have to deserve this! I can just enjoy it because I want to. Take that  over-achieving  mega-intense type A personality! I’m mellowing you out one dip at a time☺️😇🤓

Did full moon yoga on the beach tonight. Didn’t want to close my eyes in Savasana. Saw a shooting star! Set new intentions. Journaled. Moved. Opened. Stretched. Feeling tired  but rested.

the moment I realized 
I'm actually

beautiful . 
.

Telling yourself you are not is separating from source. It diminishes everything. Only when you see the beauty of your own soul and how it shines can you live in resonance with your purpose. Loving yourself is fucking EVERYTHING. And it's not easy  I'll tell you that. So make it your mission to wake up every morning and love the hell out of every inch of your body. Your heart. Your being. Every time you tell yourself you're anything but gorgeous it rips a tiny piece of your heart! Recognize your patterns and how you judge yourself so you can stop it. You need to love yourself. We need to love ourselves. Self love... It changes everything. 
Go outside  put your hands on the earth and feel it move. You are here. This is it. Don't waste another second thinking you don't belong.

She is pointing at the string lights hanging above us saying “ampa” - her first real word!! (after Mamma obvi)☺️ Lampa means lamp in Swedish💡 She walks all over the place now. Points at everything. Waves and gives us kisses. And today I caught her taking magnets off the fridge AND PUTTING THEM BACK😳 She’s legitimately a little person now!!! How did this happen!? So nuts. We hang out at the studio every day and her favorite thing is walking up to peoples tables and showing them all her teeth🙈😂 ah this baby. I get nothing done because everything else is boring! Just wanna hang out with her all day. 
.
I did record a podcast today. On competition and jealousy in the yoga world - it’s a good one. And I taught a yoga class. And had an interview. Then a meeting. Cleared out my inbox. Wrote a few pages on my book... Ok  I do get things done. Efficient is my middle name!🙃😜

I asked the hair dresser what she could do with my hair under the assumption that I would never  ever  ever come back😂 I hate getting my hair done! Absolutely hate it. But I needed something. The darker shade I had from last year has faded in the sun and I was back to a weird brassy mess and we are doing a 2-week shoot for something huge (HUGE!) so I want to look decent. But. I will not set foot at a hair salon again! Maybe once a year  tops. To me there is nothing more boring than getting your hair done (people who do it on a regular basis - how do you do it???) and I think it’s such a waste of time. Can’t sit still! So she got me this - a shade of blonde close enough to my natural hair color that I won’t have to go back for at least a year. And a hair cut. Done and done ✅ 
(ps this still took 4 hours and all I could think of was what I could actually be doing with my time)🙈 #teamcantsitstill #hair #hairdid #done #motherhood. Happy Friday and happy podcast day everyone! In today’s episode I’m joined by my friend (and one of my favorite musicians!) @nahkobear 🐻❤️ I share the story of how I first connected with Nahko’s music and how it helped me move trough the grief of my best friend’s passing. Nahko shares what it’s like to write music that deeply impacts people all over the world and we reminisce about the moment we first met - @ahlaluna and I were lying in a giant dream catcher-looking hammock way up in the trees talking about how amazing the performance we saw the night before was. I had my head in her lap and we were humming the lyrics to “Black as Night” - I believe in the good things coming  coming  coming... Suddenly she spots him and goes “hey  there’s your music man!!” and in the spirit of being her  touched his head and said hi as he walked by❤️ Two weeks later she died. And I played that song on repeat every single day for a year. Actually  I still play it. Of course. 
.

We talk about moving through this grief  music as an instrument of healing  the importance of spiritual discipline and trusting that life brings you where you’re supposed to go (especially when things get really  really hard) and Nahko shares some of the hardships he is working through himself at the moment🙏🏽 We also talk about the blessings and challenges of being a leader in the community  the importance of activism and standing up for what you believe in and how at the end of the day  the way we care for Mother Earth is a true reflection of how we care for ourselves. And... He sings! Magic! Thank you papa bear for sharing a cup of tea and your time🌙

There are moments when I get caught up in mind-stuff; worry  problems  thoughts about things that aren’t working and how I’m not good enough or how things aren’t going my way... And then I look at this face. And I remember: if she would be the single one thing I ever did in this lifetime - I would have done enough. Birthing her was enough. Being her mother is enough. 

What greater thing could I possibly ever pursue
than her?

 This baby loves hers😍 Today’s green smoothie is packed with spinach  banana  mango  spirulina  maca root and cashew milk. Yum! I make a big batch that we share every day. Luna drinks hers from her own bottle or eats it like ice cream with a spoon if it’s thick. So easy!

In today’s episode I’m joined by @chrisburkard - photographer  explorer  creative director  author and speaker. Chris has gained worldwide recognition for his photography and art over the past few years and is especially known for his travels to remote places and extreme weather surf photography (if you don’t already follow him make sure you do!). How do you turn your passion into your career? How do you stand out in such a competitive field? What’s it like balancing creative talent with running a large-scale business? 
.

Chris shares how he got started (and how when it comes to pursuing a dream  we all have to start at the bottom!)  what inspires him as a photographer and shares stories from his life on the road. We talk about nature conservation  the importance of bringing deep purpose into our work (whatever field we’re in!)  parenthood and using past mistakes as a way to grow. Chris also gives his best tips for staying grounded on the road. And yes - this incredible photo above is his all-time favorite photograph he’s ever taken... Listen in to hear the incredible story behind it🏔🏄‍♂️

(they’re open-mouthed and extremely slobbery but it’s the best thing ever)☺️ (also she has seven teeth suddenly not sure how that happened) (also the sunset last night was too amazing for words)
.
.
We deviated from our bedtime routine and stayed out for sunset last night - I’m basically mom gone wild! Hehe. I’m such a control freak when it comes to shark baby... But it was so worth it and she went to bed an hour later and still slept fine! Maybe I’m the one who needs he routine  not her?🤔🙈

I’m prepping for our 2.5-month trip to Europe coming up in April - we are going to Italy  Spain  France  Sweden  Holland and Switzerland. And maybe UK. I have to learn how to be all chill and relaxed and go with the flow w baby! Any traveling moms out there who can teach me? I’m an awesome traveler but not since I became a mom. The last trip across the Atlantic sort of traumatized me a little (if you haven’t listened to The Flight From Hell podcast episode yet I suggest you do. Warning: you might pee your pants laughing)😝

Slobbery kisses and travel plans. That’s what today is all about❤️

#sunset #sky #ocean #family #sea #beach #motherhood #gratitude #color #beauty #life #love #thankyou. It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. 
I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.

It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love  for your dream  for the adventure of being alive.

It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow  if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain.

I want to know if you can sit with pain  mine or your own  without moving to hide it  or fade it  or fix it.

I want to know if you can be with joy  mine or your own; if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful  be realistic  remember the limitations of being human.

It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself. If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul. If you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.

I want to know if you can see Beauty even when it is not pretty every day. And if you can source your own life from its presence.
I want to know if you can live with failure  yours and mine  and still stand at the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon  'Yes.'

It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair  weary and bruised to the bone and do what needs to be done to feed the children.
It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back.

It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.

I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.

Oriah Mountain Dreamer. Still is  will always be  my favorite poem. Almost tattooed these words across my ribs when I was 19. Happy I didn’t - I’ve come to learn that not everything needs to be etched into my skin for me to truly feel them.. The path you are on is the right one. Wherever it leads. Keep going. Keep searching. Keep moving. Even when it’s dark and you don’t know if you’re on the right track and you can’t see the road ahead anymore... Just put one foot in front of the other.
.
You don’t have to see the destination - you just have to trust that it’s there and keep moving forward. One step at a time. 

.
Life takes you where you’re meant to be. Don’t give up.

@loving.lealuna (magic photos by @dennisfromsalad)🧡  #10months #lealuna #baby #happiness #joy #sharkbaby #laughter #smile #sunset #photography #life #family #sky. We are feeling so much better! Still sick but at least we got some sleep last night🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 And today is podcast day! In this weeks episode of the podcast I cry - a lot. Had I ever recorded a podcast while sleep deprived and not cried? Nope. I’m used to bawling in front of half a million people weekly now🙈😂 Anywho. In today’s episode I talk about anger! And how  if left unchecked  it can easily turn into resentment... Which separates us from our ability to bring loving kindness into the situation and in the end  causes us more harm than anything else. Have you heard that saying; holding onto resentment is like holding onto a piece of hot coal and expecting the other person to burn? Well it’s true! One of my intentions for this year is to work through resentment and get better at dealing with anger (I can hold a grudge foreverrrrrr). And I got the perfect chance to practice it this week! Tune in for some candid storytelling and pretty good advice if I may say so myself🤗❤️ Link below or search From The Heart or Yoga Girl on iTunes (or wherever you get your podcasts!). Enjoy!

#yogagirlpodcast #fromtheheart #yogagirl #yoga #practice #love #kindness #personaldevelopment #treepose #baby #islandyoga #happiness. We’re sick but we’re CRUISING!!!!😍❤️🤗 #lealuna #cruising #walking #babysteps #9months #family #home #love. A papaya a day keeps the doctor away! (jk it gives you double ear infections an eye infection and a fever of 103)🙄 
.
.
All jokes aside... Baby is doing a little bit better. Still shit. But it’s not shittier. Silver lining! And we do eat papaya every day. With a squeeze of lime  my favorite. Did you know you can plant the seeds just as they are and grow tiny little papaya trees? Or you can roast the seeds and eat them  they’re spicy. And good for you! 

Today @dennisfromsalad took this photo of me having mine by the pool looking Instagram AF🙃🌺☀️ (when in reality I held a crying baby for ten hours and “went to bed” at 8am feeling like absolute crap). Having a pool makes everything look glamorous as hell! Luckily I can’t not speak the truth in the caption.Right now? I’m lying on the floor with my head propped up against the crib. Intensely uncomfortable. Feverish baby sleeping on my chest. These days any sleep at all is gold. I’m not moving an inch. Day 3 of fever - should be better tonight no? Let’s hope. x #teamnosleep #motherhood #papaya. Taking down the tree today... It’s a PJ all day kind of day❤️ Eye infection blossomed into full on mega cold and shark baby spent eight hours straight crying last night before passing out in my arms at 4 in the morning. I slept for 45 minutes total. Her fever peaked at 39.5 (103 F)  her nose is running and she is coughing too. She hasn’t had as much as a rash since she was born so this is pretty rough for us all😔 Seeing her in pain and not being able to anything about it is so awful. Eye is much better today and even though she barely slept she’s in super good spirits - picking today of all days to walk 10+ steps on her own! My little moon baby. I’m exhausted. From worry  mostly. Fittingly enough I wrote a blog last night about my obsessive fear that something awful is going to happen to her. Typing out my fears was helpful but everything I feel for her is just so intense. It’s painful  the love. I worry all the time. When she finally fell asleep last night I couldn’t sleep - I just laid there watching her chest rise and fall with every breath. Ah  motherhood. The hardest and most beautiful thing I’ve ever done.

hey guys I'm Rachel Griffin here are a couple of poses you can do to wind down after a long day and to get you ready for bed beginning in child's pose create a little bit of space between your knees you have space for the heart and the chest to melt to the ground your foreheads of the math and in your fingertips further forward towards the top of the mat to find some length for the side body soften the back of your neck and start to move your hands a little bit further away towards the right side of the mat finding a side stretch for the left side of the body grounding down through the palm of the left hand forehead comes to the ground and then look up walk your hands through Center and all the way over towards the left side forehead comes to the mat press the palm of the right hand down stretching the right side body here and then lift your gaze come back to Center neutral place forehead to the earth inhale float your body up come to tabletop position take a breath lining up your shoulders above the wrists hips above the knees you inhale to lift your chest exhale rounding through the spine relax the back of the neck following the breath inhale widen across the heart look slightly forward exhale press the earth away rounding the upper back body aim Hale lifting through the heart and exhale rounding through the spine come back to Center ilet's I think the sit bones down to the ground swing your legs out in front of you maybe remove some flesh from the sides of the sit bones flex your feet and as you exhale start to walk your hands out over the legs you choose how deeply you want to fold into the space try to create some length for the spine as you exhale perhaps folding a little bit deeper each time allow your body to melt into this position when you feel ready to walk your hands back up coming into a cross-legged seated position so sukhasana long spine inhale and then fold forward exhale walk your hands out and melt the chest to their make your way back to centre extend your legs in front of you balance your knees lose and then cross the opposite side so you have the opposite foot facing the front walk your hands out ahead of you and one more time folding forward along the forehead to soften to the mat slowly make your way back to your Center and from here we're going to come all the way down into a lying down position so all the way lying down bringing your knees into your chest let's take a twist drop your knees over towards the right reach - right the left arm over towards the left and allow the weight of the body through gravity to help you find ease in this twist so we're not pushing or pulling towards any place just softening with a bra and you come back to Center opposite side knees go to the left right arm goes to the right just allow that slow fluid inhales and exhales to guide you into this twist lift your gaze first bring your knees back and then from here we make our way all the way into legs up the wall pose so scooting your sit bones as close in towards the wall as you possibly can if you have tight hamstrings go ahead and bend your knees a little better place a folded up blanket beneath your tailbone or your sit bones you can flex your feet and I'll focus on relaxing the spine the neck especially the lower back to deeply into the sensation of your heart the sensation of the breath and allow yourself to stay here as you are in this place of silence you 
hi you guys today I want to talk to you about something really important something that everybody goes to and everybody feels from time to time fear fear is a big deal it can leave us completely frozen and unable to act it can leave us with our knees shaking and our heart beating or Kenosha's or like worst-case scenario moments are coming our way from left and right it's easy to become swallowed up by fear sometimes it's legitimate not very often and most of the times the fear that we feel on a regular basis is not 100% valid there's different different types of fear right there's fear of falling off a building or a fear of getting injured or you know legitimate fear they can actually keep you safe that's why we feel fear at times to keep us safe and then there's other types of fear that kind of creeps up on us and most of it comes from our minds we create ourselves ourselves for maybe past experiences when we were younger and my biggest fear of my entire life has always been public speaking terrified terrified and this is kind of interesting because I teach yoga for a living so basically it's public speaking is what I do for a living I have no problem teaching yoga to a thousand people I'll get a little you know butterflies just because I'm excited that I don't get nervous but the idea of public speaking of preparing a speech or a talk and standing up the front of a crowd and delivering that talk oh just talking about it makes my heart beat in a very uncomfortable way it's not something that I enjoy even the slightest and if you've read me book you're a girl I have a chapter in there called love over fear something that life has taught me is continuously the universe will throw you curveballs where you get the opportunity or the chance to move through fear and come out on the other side and it's up to us how we choose to react right whenever something comes your way if it absolutely terrifies you you can choose to run away the other way to escape and to decide I'm not going to do this which usually means that you're going to stay put where you are right you're not going to evolve you're not going to expand your horizons you're going to stay within that comfort zone which is fine you know until it's not and other times you're faced with a fear you're faced with this feeling in your gut Wow I know if I can do this this is terrifying and you take that stuff you choose to move forward there's no other word to describe it than liberation freedom really I'll tell you a little story the reason I want to talk about this right now is that I just did a TED talk which for me is probably the biggest accomplishment of this entire year and not because it's a huge deal or no I mean Ted and this was a TEDx event Ted is a very recognized institution and I'm really honored that I was invited but mean there was 500 people in the audience I've spoken in front of way more people than that before from a yoga mat but this was a big accomplishment for me because it scares the living hell out of me how this all started it was last year and I just finished writing my book and Swedish I was busy translating the book to English for the American market and I could call right before my Swedish book tour I got a call from one of my agents saying that they found this amazing speaking event this very inspirational speaking about the really inspiring people from all over the country called for good and they would love for me to be a speaker talking about my book or about my path how the book came to be a 30 minute talk and three main cities in Sweden and I immediately just froze up coconut no I mean I would even consider it right away I said no no thank you just don't come with these types of suggestions to me because I'm never going to do that ever that terrifies me it's horrible and then they said are you sure you can just give a feeling you would do so well and it would be so good for the book of the publicity and I just say I didn't even think about it I just flat-out denied no way and then I hung up the phone I turned back to my computer where I'm busy rewriting or translating the book for the American market and the chapter that's on my computer is love over theater the sentence I was writing was if it doesn't at least scare you a little it's not worth doing and here I was you know telling the world to face their fears and to overcome and I'm scared shitless to do this one thing that they just asked me to do and I have a feeling you know once in a while you get that feeling in your gut where okay this is a direction I need to move in it doesn't know it's not a comfortable place but it's very need to go so I call the back and I said you know what the hell I'll do it I had a few months to prepare said okay I'll just try think of something and I'll figure I'll figure it out and then as they drew closer and closer I get more and more terrified and not in a pleasant way not in a way that I was excited to deliver the talk I was just absolutely frozen with fear I had nightmares I would wake up sweating just from nightmares over this over this talk and in the end I had to tell them I can't I can't do it baby I think I've nauseous every day just thinking about this thing that's coming in the future and they did with a suggestion that I could have a moderator on stage with me so I could go out with a person instead of me being alone doing this speech I would have a person there asking me questions like a dialogue this is kind of the easy way out like I'm realizing now but it was an important first step because I think if I didn't have that opportunity for that first time I was on stage I I might have chickened out I might have canceled because that's how terrified I was so I knew the first event it was I know 400 or something 500 people maybe they're in Los AIDS and I'm there with the publicist from the publishing house where I published a book at speedin and she's asking me these questions and I know already kind of what I want to talk about so she ended up asking me five or six questions just to keep the dialogue going but it was basically me on my own and it was okay I didn't feel great when I left I felt like if you know I can't believe I had to do that and I had to bring someone on stage with me I felt like a child but I think I did it you know I took a step into this immensely uncomfortable place and I did it you know I didn't die right the second location we had she came with me on stage and I felt a little more comfortable was that already knew a little bit more when I would say and I've done it once I said you know what just ask me one or two questions so that's what she did she ask me one maybe two questions and I just kept that more like a monologue flowing on my own and then the third event came up but it was in Stockholm it was the biggest one of those three events and I realized okay it's time for me to do this on my own I took these baby steps up this ladder it's time for me to do this on my own so I told her I didn't eat on stage and I spent I think the week before in absolute agony complete agony just nauseous wanting to throw up I had stomach pains sweating nightmares it was awful but I knew I'd committed I was going to do this no matter what I went onstage he's in my speech and it was a Swedish which is also funnily love enough I'm Swedish but English is easier for me these days it was hard for me to convey what I wanted to convey in Swedish and I felt afterwards I did not feel good I didn't know I was there on my own everybody told me it was so great and only god you're so brave and I loved your talk and so real and we didn't not feel good afterwards and I told my husband that I'm never doing this again because the amount of anxiety I felt leading up to these events was so much greater than the gratification of actually having delivered my speech right if I would have left that stage feeling on top of the world feeling like you know God is like I did it I overcame a warrior and that feeling would have been greater than the feeling of anxiety beforehand I might have started to do this some of this could have been something that I actually did more of but that was not the case it just felt horrible right so I just decided no okay I took these steps that I've just been such just not for me right it's just not for me and this forward a year and I got invited to do a TED talk in Luxembourg and a TED talk is something that I dreamed of doing the idea I know I have a lot of ideas worth spreading you know I know I have things to say and I know there's a blog that I want to listen but it's been this future dream in my mind of yeah maybe in ten years I'll do a TED talk when I'm this mature older person with more wisdom and when I've practiced this more and you know I have overcome this fear I kept putting the idea of overcoming this fear in the future over and over again like now is all the time I'll overcome it later but if not now when that's the question how long was I supposed to wait and live with this fear of public speaking and in my line of work and all the opportunities that are presenting themselves to me right now if I can't speak in front of people and missing out on a lot of piece of things and I had turned many events down just because they wanted to speak her instead of a teacher so I've been hiding them in my yoga mat know for years and the time was up so when the ask me he's had Luxembourg I initially said yes this is something that I could do and in the moment I said I would do it I just had these heart competition since I felt like I couldn't breathe I was awful and then I said you know what it's really far away flexiboard it's really far away and you know Ted they never cover your your flights or anything really expensive for me and my husband to fly all the way from Aruba to Luxembourg just for this one talk so this was another easy way out but I told myself it's just logistically not possible like it's too expensive I can't do it so I turn them down and then I told I told that is it done is well we I think you're just scared this is this your fear talking I said no this is my reason nobody can afford it and I told them these words if there's ever closer Ted events somewhere closer to where we are then I'll do it just the next time I get approached if it's closer by I'll do it and he said okay whatever the next morning they call me from TEDx or move up Ted aruba inviting me to do a talk in my home country right where I live on this island I was out of excuses I couldn't legitimately keep excusing myself anymore to do this so I said yes what was different about this time around is Ted forces you forces you to plan and prepare like crazy and I'm not a planner I never planned my yoga classes I never prepped for things like that or whatever I'm presenting it I never think of it beforehand I just I sit with whoever's there and I use that energy to create something out of that moment and I think that's also a reason why I don't get nervous because I don't have to think of delivering something perfectly I just have to be myself and hold space for other people but now Ted they make you plan and prepare every single things you have to write your entire talk you have to hand it in forever you you get coaching sessions these amazing experts that all they do is public speaking I I have this whole entire process of planning for and preparing this talk over the past few weeks and in the practice at home practicing practicing practicing and every time I delivered it it was differently but I realized that the more I would seek these words out loud the clearer the message I wanted to convey became the more I practice that I realized this is not that intimidating it's not it's not a matter of life or death because I'm telling my own story I'm telling something that I know is true something I'm passionate about it's basically just me being myself holding space for other people to listen and form their own opinions so it is kind of like teaching yoga just with a lot of preparation the day starts coming closer and I just really do my best for the past two weeks just be present in my daily life but I've had this back of my head feeling every moment of every day that this is coming Ted is coming like that is Monster is coming for me and I just been trying to breathe my way through it and every single day I have been practicing and that's it and it's just like our yoga practice you know it's hard in the beginning the more you do it the more comfortable you get with the idea what it is that you're doing if it's a log or a handstand or something different and with this it really was the more I spoke but more comfortable I became speaking that's simple so the big of the rehearsal arrived they have an entire rehearsal but they go through the whole program a day before I woke up feeling so terrified I couldn't breathe I almost couldn't even do yoga because I was just frozen with this fear and I worked through it I stretched my body the way I normally did and breakfast and then went to there with her soul and they was so nervous for the rehearsals that Dennis told me afterwards that it was really really clear how nervous you were and I was rushing my way through this talk when I finished I had two and a half minutes left and you had to thing with it's allowed and I had two and a half minutes left so I thought wow okay I need to really get on stage I'm relaxed and slow down and breathe and just really keep it a normal pain so if I can do that I can do those because I don't know my talk I know what I want to say and how I want to deliver it it's a bed woke up the date out of 10 felt really emotional and then my practice and I cried in shavasana just from the anticipation of this big thing and it wasn't so much the people in the audience staring at me you know the fear wasn't really that I was going to mess up or fall off the stage or blank out or anything like that it was more of the idea that I'm doing something I'm so uncomfortable with it's the idea of climbing this mountain that I've avoided for my entire life really thanks for doing that I had been in thirds we had a lot of press and I got to sit in the audience for the first half of the event and watch six amazing speakers and for every speaker that came onstage I felt more and more calm and they were also very different and they delivered their talks completely different but I just felt so calm for the first half and then I got to go backstage I had minor panic attacks then a final run-through of my talk and then I'm standing backstage my thup just completely terrified I couldn't look anybody and I couldn't talk to anybody I couldn't focus on anything else but just kind of putting one foot in front of the other and staying with my breath that was it and they introduced me and I walked out onstage I took a breath before I started talking a deep breath and then I delivered my first line and after that was like flying it went so well I felt so comfortable and I'm just telling the story that I know that I've lived people were listening attentively everybody was present everybody was there and I just felt so 100% in the moment all that fear went away because this happening you know you cannot stay present and feel fear at the same time because fear lives in the mind and as I start telling my third story I have three stories in this talk it's are telling my third story normally when I look at the time around this time I have eight or nine minutes left but I look at the time I had four minutes to go so I had become so relaxed stage that I was taking up too much time and the cutoff line was 15 minutes and they're really really strict because there was a televised event and I realize I'm not going to make it through my entire talk I'm going to have to wing it completely so I had to completely cut an entire piece of my talk out and I think thanks to the fact that I was so in the moment and so present I actually saved it it was nothing like what I had practiced it was nothing that we had planned it I had to just be in the moment and changed a story and give it a completely different ending but soul conveying the same message that I wanted to convey from the beginning and it worked ever I could have freaked out or Blythe out I did it and I got offstage and guess what I felt like a million bucks I did and now I have a scaling I can't believe I'm saying this but I want to do this again I want to do this again I want to talk I can I can do it I can I can deliver talks I can I can do speech I can do public speaking it's okay I can do it and for me to be able to say that is just out of this world this is a monumental step for me and I know I've taken this burden off of my shoulders I overcame fear and I feel lighter as a human being so what I want to tell all of you is whatever it is that you're avoiding in life because our fears they're going to keep coming at us right that's how the universe works the universe wants you to overcome your fears to choose love over fear every day and if we avoid it isn't it keep coming our way over and over again until you have the courage to say yes I guess what so try you might fail like I did I had three talks when I felt horrible and I just nothing worked and with time we learned the lesson we're supposed to learn and then we fly I hope this inspires you to go for something new get out of your comfort zone and get out there face your fears you'll be so happy that you did thank you so much for listening to this long story I love you guys so much don't forget to subscribe I'm going to put out new videos talking about different subjects every single week

hi everyone I'm Rachel Brayton and here are three simple yoga poses you can do to calm your mind after a busy game coming to your knees you can separate your knees a little bit wider than your hips and then walk your hands way out in front of you melting the chest down towards the mat then bringing your forehead to the earth and allow your body to sink onto the floor here maybe sway a little bit side to side softening the hips taking deep full breaths through the nose and then from this pose from Child's Pose walk your hands in towards the knees again we'll cross the ankles and roll back on our sit bones so we can extend the legs straight out in front of us sitting up nice and tall flex your feet inhale and lift your chest lengthening your spine and then exhale gently walk your hands out in front of you and stop where it feels good to use maybe that's folding all the way down maybe pausing somewhere halfway let your hands rest on the mat on your legs on your feet whatever feels good to you and then with every inhale you lengthen the spine lift your heart a little higher and with every exhale you fold slightly deeper and you stay here as long as it feels good to you and when you're ready you gently walk your hands back up the legs coming into a neutral place for your spine and then come all the way into a lying down position bring your knees into your chest we'll take a twist here dropping the knees gently to the right side and reaching the left arm out straight over towards the left and gently lifting your gaze untwist bring your knees in drop your knees to the left side and reach the right arm to the right gazing over towards the right thumb lift your gaze untwist knees come back to Center and then walk your way up into a seated position well those are three poses you can do to that the end of a long day or just taking a moment to quiet the mind and Center your thought on estate

hi guys it's Rachel briefing we're gonna do a Q&amp;A today so I get a lot of questions on Facebook and Instagram and via email on a daily basis and it's really hard for me to keep up answering all these questions via social media so I thought we could do this do a few YouTube series where you take your questions and I'll answer you straight into the camera so enjoy many more questions just put them in the comment box below I am born and raised in Sweden in both Uppsala and Stockholm but I left Sweden when I was 18 to move to Costa Rica I speak four languages they speak Swedish English Spanish and Papiamento which is the local language here and everywhere that almost nobody in the whole world speaks I'd say the first thing you have to learn to really be able to stick your hands tense really well is to learn how to fall out so if you're always relying on the wall and you're really scared of falling it's going to be hard for you to start practicing handstands enough to get really good at them quickly so step one would be to try to let go of the wall and learn how to fall in the middle of the room you'll want to twist your body a little bit so you can cartwheel out landing on your feet so you don't hurt yourself I'll be back in Sweden in January for a couple of events and some workshops and also we're getting married there in June so there'll be a lot of Sweden trips next year my favorite book is this book it's called the power of now by Eckhart Tolle and whenever someone asked about my favorite book and always recommend this one so I don't want to say it changed my life because it sounds a little bit corny but it did change the way I view the world it's really helpful if you're that person that worries a lot or if you feel regret about the past or if you're anxious about the future because it really helps you get some good tools of how to live in the present moment and it's a really good addition to your good practices on your spiritual practice as well what was in the box oh my god should I show them the box okay I'll go wait I'll show you the box so I didn't want to tell you guys what was in the box on Instagram because I didn't want to have another fight about sweatshops and child labor and if they get an email from the girl from Nike who sent me this box and it looks like they're doing their best to improve their image but I don't want to promote a bunch of companies so what they gave me was these types of I think their yoga shoes like yoga or ballet shoes that you can use if you don't want to put your bare feet on like a gym floor or yoga mat or whatever if you don't have a yoga mat I guess and also these little ribbons you can tie up your calves and then these types of shoes I think you want to wear them outside and use them yet so I don't know and also got a really cool purse that I put somewhere else but that what's in the box I started practicing yoga when I was about 17 or 18 I took my first class ever in my life I was I think 16 years old I was on vacation in Thailand with my parents and I took a class at a hotel by this really sweet little tiny instructor which was really beautiful but it didn't really change my life and then I was I think 18 I left Sweden for Costa Rica and I found yoga so to speak while living in Costa Rica so yeah six or seven years ago I think that's a really great question and I get that question a lot I think Instagram is a really good tool for inspiration for your physical practice so it's great to be able to look at these very advanced Yogi's and teachers and petitioners for inspiration and motivation and you know where to take your practice and new things you want to learn however I don't think Instagram is a good tool for teaching anybody yoga the physical aspect of you remember the asanas so if you can convey the spiritual aspect of yoga in a good way and focus on the feeling of it not just them what it looks like or you know fitting your body into a shape or a mold I think Instagram could be great but I do get a lot of emails from people that injure themselves trying crazy stuff off of Instagram so I don't like to promote the challenge part of Instagram or the pure physical aspect of it so if you can just find as much body awareness as you can and feel in your own body what's good for you you can use Instagram for inspiration without a problem okay so the beauty of product question I get asked a lot I don't use a lot of beauty products at all I use whenever we go to the States I stock up on organic shampoo and conditioner and stuff like that I'll buy whatever you can get at Whole Foods I like Alba organics I think it's called Avalon and Jason organics everything good but some things I do use are these so something I use on a daily basis is argan oil which I really really like I put it in my hair at the ends of my hair get really dry I'm in the ocean a lot so it's really nice for that um it doesn't make your hair heavy or greasy it just it just gives it a really good shine and then I like to use the vihuela oils or how do you pronounce that I don't even know this is a Hawthorne oil I put on my body with my skin gets right I use rose water just a regular rose water you can get anywhere I sprayed on my face in the morning when I wake up and then I like to use shea butter for my hands if I'm traveling this is a lavender shea butter which is just really simple super natural nothing crazy and if it's yeah one thing I absolutely do love I don't use perfume I try to stay away from chemical products as much as I can but this little essential oil blend it's Pacifica and it's called Malibu lemon blossom and I've used it for I don't know 10 years or something and it's all I use for fragrance and it smells delicious but that's all the stuff that I that I use really do you want to answer this one he's he's shaking his head of course we argue we are a normal couple normal people with normal disagreements and we love each other very very very much but of course we argue just like anybody else we have a good balance because then this is very patient and I have a tendency to wanting to do everything at the same time and I think we have really great balance in our relationship but of course we argue from time to time I think it's normal and I think it's healthy too so my favorite yoga poses are I love legs up the wall pose buddy to cut out knees one of my favorite things to do such a healing pose and a super great for your low back I also love double pigeon pose as my favorite hip opener it was so delicious and of course hence dance I you didn't know it is I love the handstands the heart is yoga pose for me is anything that has anything to do with a backbend so I grew up with scoliosis and I've had a car accident and whitewater rafting accident and a lot of stuff that just left my back and a really big mess so any type of backbend big or small is always always very challenging for me what's my real job well my real job is is doing yoga I get that question all the time people wonder you know how do you travel the world and how do you just stretch on the beach for a living which is yes a stretch from clipping but it is a real job but it does take a lot of effort a lot of time but it's a dream job and I'm really happy to be at travelling yoga instructor voice I don't plan like classes at all I've never planned a class in my entire life even when I was in teacher training I had a really hard time planning anything else so for me I never know what to teach until I see the class right in front of me because you know you never know who's going to show up or the energy level of the group or I like to teach from what my students reflect to me so every class is always very different but everybody's different as a teacher for me it's I can't find anything and other people you know can be they benefit from planning out their sequences this is why I only talk about rhino oh yes oh so I do talk more about Ringo because Ringo is the newest dog we've only had him for five months he's a little puppy we love our all of our dogs equally I mean I've had Kela for for almost four five years and I've been with Leica for four years and we've had pepper for three years Ringo's just the novelty of the group and he has a super funny personality and he's also the only one who's small enough that he can travel with us so that means he's a little bit more interactive with our lives when we travel but we love our puppies the same for a new practitioner this is a really good question so my biggest advice that I can give is try to be really patient with yourself don't don't worry about reaching to a special point and don't worry about perfecting all these poses just focus on feeling good and what you do I like to say that in my classes a lot don't focus on what the pose looks like the focus of what the pose feels like so we all begin from where we are everybody has a different background everybody feels different in every single pose also don't be nervous to take classes everybody's way too busy worrying about themselves to care about what other people do in class so take it easy be patient and start as soon as you can it gets easier and easier my favorite scent right now is verbena verbena verbena and Otto pronounce that lemony scent I love that we have candles we're bringing my candles all over them so when I first left Sweden I was 18 I was really young I was just fresh out of high school and my intention was never to to really leave and be gone forever my intention was to travel for a while but I always had the feeling that I didn't really belong in Sweden it's super cold and dark and I always felt like I belong at a beach or somewhere warm I need the sunshine in the ocean in my life and I wasn't scared you know I really believe that if you want something you just make it happen and focus on what you can create instead of what you're scared of so if you all all you see are obstacles or the fear so what could go wrong and of course you're going to attract some of that stuff and I was never fearful about not being okay so if you really trust that that you'll be fine in whatever you do you can do anything yes there are days where I don't love my body I think just within the other person I try to not obsess so much about my body I know that's a it's a really common thing these days people spend a lot of time focusing on on what the numbers on the scale say this morning or how your while your jeans fit you and and just kind of scrutinizing yourself and obsessing with the way you look and I don't think that's healthy anyway I think if you focus too much on what your body looks like you miss what's going on around you and all those beautiful things but of course you know as any other person I have my bad days and my good days and if it's the time of the month or you're feeling bloated or you know I can have a really crappy day too and something I like to do is is go back to what the body can do for me as opposed to what my body looks like to me and there because most of it is always in your head right so one day you think you look great the next day you think you don't but your body doesn't change overnight your head does so yeah it's just focusing on what your body can do for you more than what your body looks like today in the mirror so go for a run over walk stretch practice yoga do something active and get out of your head for a moment I guess ah me and that is Matt it's a long story but I was living in Costa Rica at the time and I went to Aruba just for vacation actually with my family and I was here for a little while I met Dennis on the second day I walked into his surf shop and yeah long story short ten days later I moved to everybody never left it was pointers so we don't use any agency like that to help with the events or the social media or anything like that but I do have an agent that helps out with the bigger decisions and contracts or endorsements and stuff like that but we do almost everything on our own you can find all of my upcoming events and workshops and retreats on Rachael Bryson comm everything is there the website is new hopefully we have all the little kinks fixed and it shouldn't be crashing in the future at all but all the info you need about everything is right on there you can always send us an email too my own necklace Oh people ask me that question every day I bought it when I was 17 in south of Spain in Marbella on a market when I was there so as before I was actually really into yoga I just really really liked the symbol and I felt drawn to it but I've never found us a similar one after that so I I don't know where you can get one yes I speak Swedish yamato-san Scalia is fans so happy for this awesome a lot of people so my thoughts on yoga and partying I think I think it's a process and I think depending on where you're at in your life you know I don't think you necessarily have to renounce all the pleasures of a regular life to be a yogi no maybe I will in 10 years or 20 years or you know when it's time for that and and I go through phases in my life where I sometimes really like to go out and I like to have fun and I like to have a few beers and I'm 25 years old and other you know moments or parts of my life I don't want to do any of that at all so it depends of where I'm at and also what's going on in the rest of my life but I do think you make yoga what it needs to be for you so don't judge yourself and of course don't you know if you can stay away from binge drinking or having destructive patterns when it comes to partying and alcohol you know use your yoga for for positive things and to help you make positive choices for your body and for your health but there's nothing like a good yoga class to hear a hangover that's completely - coconut water you know rehydrate drink a lot of water tea go for a walk if you need to lie in bed and watching How I Met Your Mother eating some chocolate I think that's good too my top three y'all got breakthroughs in the past three years um there's been a ton of yoga breakthroughs the DC I feel like I had a little breakthrough every week of some sort right now my newest breakthrough has been my press my handstand press which I never really strived for a lot and it's just suddenly kind of coming together so that's nice um getting past my fear of back bending with back bends is a huge one my teacher brought Cahill helped me with that I didn't really have a back bending practice up until in a year and a half or two years ago at all because I was so scared of back bending I had so much pain in my back so the idea of bending it that way was just completely absurd to me you know I I would teach balance but I really would I was so scared of them so I was really scared of back fence and now I am NOT setting that's a huge breakthrough for me actually my iPAQ improved a lot the second I started really putting back beds into my practice it's just a very slow practice I'm not going to be putting my feet on my head any time I'm close to the near future but and another big breakthrough I guess I can heal my handstands - the big breakthrough two or three years ago I was not doing a single hands done at all so yeah all the big things I do for sure happened in the last three years so I know this question is for the sweetest girl out there Meg and I'd like to answer because I know what it feels like to be in a long-distance relationship and and that has had a few months apart when we first met I didn't get a visa to live on the island so I had to live in Colombia for three months and you know we go through that a lot especially when we travel and stuff like that and I think that feeling of missing someone so much that you feel like it can't function there's a lot of a lot of love in there I mean there's a love for the other person and love for the connection that you have and I think you can use all that energy for something good so rather than sitting at home or longing for the person you're you wanting to be with or you know which is waiting for tomorrow or the next month or whatever it is you guys can can be together I would focus on using that energy energy for something good but right now so focus on your projects and your work on the things that you have going on in your life that are not just your relationship you know there's more to who you are than just this relationship try to stay present read the power of now practice yoga focus on those little things that make every day a beautiful one and then before you know it you'll be with the person you love again and and you can use all those things for good together yes we want kids I really want kids I have a ton of sisters and brothers and I'm the oldest I've always wanted kids I love kids I want four that is once one and it guess it's up to debate but we're going to wait a few years I mean I'm 25 he's 27 so I don't want to rush anything in I think right now with all the traveling we're doing it would really change reflects a lot so something but not not today I will teach prenatal yoga when I've been pregnant it's kind of a thing I think it's a really good basic principle of teaching yoga they'll teach what you don't know it doesn't mean you know you have to be the most advanced you'll be in the world or you know you can teach yoga without having this insane incredible practice that's just very few people in the world to have but teaching what you know means you know what this pose means the do's and the don'ts what it feels like in the body to go that direction and I have no clue what it feels like to be pregnant so I will teach that into line today I ate I had a huge cup of green tea and then I ain't Greek yogurt with honey and some gluten-free granola then I got the other day and a ton of pineapple and then I have another cup of tea and then don't judge me I hate this weird chocolate that Dutch people eat at Christmas because it's so delicious and that's all I did eh so it's really difficult to stay healthy when you travel I know this because we travel a lot I always bring my yoga mat wherever I go really wherever I go there's a great mat that I have I think it's from Manduca it's one of their newest ones and it's so thin it actually folds into a little square like this you're gonna have to roll it just fold it you can put in your purse and I roll my mat up wherever I go another thing you can do to be a healthy traveler is to try to drink as much water as you possibly can so I know it can be quiet you know annoying if you have to go to the bathroom the whole time when you want a plane but drink as much water as you can you're going to feel much better when you arrive and throughout the whole entire flight I also love to use essential oils I have an essential oil and like a tribal blend that I use which is a Miss it helps to balance your hormones a little bit and helps you to these tress and also just bring your own food I cook before I travel and I pack my own little boxes of food so I always have something really healthy and nourishing that fills me up because I you can rely on airplane food ever so those would be my biggest tips I'm 5/8 or 175 for 174 in centimeters so I'm a lot taller than a lot of people think and I know people ask about that is to then Dennis is 6 4 so we're tall people so my advice for someone that's a new teacher first of all don't freak out talk about panic don't be nervous I mean or actually be nervous and just try to accept that everybody's going to be nervous in the beginning I mean when I started teaching it took me a year to be really comfortable in all my classes you know it's a new thing you're going to be a little bit scared to do it in the beginning the more you teach the easier it gets so it's a practice as well and I like to always say you know don't think that you're going to come out of your teacher training a finished teacher you know teacher training is the first steps that you do to become certified and to learn the things you need to know but your real training as a teacher starts when you start teaching so I say you need at least six months of solid solid teaching to start to feel comfortable and like you know you're what you're doing I'm also trying to find your own voice or to be yourself I think when the person you are off the mat or outside of being a teacher when the person that is you can really blend in with the person you are as a teacher that's when you'll meet really in harmony in the classroom and I think so when I started teaching for instance I was trying to put on this role of being a very silent wholly stoic type teacher because those were the teachers I have had in my life before they were all ash donkeys and the types of classes they used to take we're very very strict where there's silence you know and you follow a strict series of poses and I try to be this person of being a very strict quiet teacher and it didn't really fit with who I am as a person so once I started embracing who I really was and finding my own voice what makes me unique my classes changed completely and it means in my class people are going to be laughing and falling over and maybe I'll even curse in class and I play funky music and it's not a very serious space because I am like that as a person you know so once I've made my class into that space I started getting a really big following and people really appreciate having you being their teacher not just a teacher as a separate person and then use something else so try to find what makes you you and brace being nervous if you have to it will go away and find

here are a couple of tips to fit in the meditation practices into a hectic lifestyle the first thing I like to recommend is to stop thinking about meditation is something that's very complicated are very difficult to attain and decide to carve out maybe just five minutes of your day if it's in the morning if that fits you better then go for that it was in the evening before you go to bed just go for that so finding at moment throughout the day that it fits you perfectly is it's the best way taking a moment to turn your phone off find a quiet place is always always a good idea at any moment throughout your day so definitely shutting your phone off finding a comfortable place to sit and picking a time just to feel what it feels like to be in the body at that moment one of the easiest techniques I think personally to find that piece in the moment especially if you're new to meditation and you're just beginning is to simply close your eyes and focus on the flow of your breath so without thinking too much about it without judging no big expectations sitting down in silence closing your eyes feeling your body from within focusing on the flow of your inhales and exhale I've shared some more tips that a little bit more about my own journey when it comes to meditation and the yoga practice in my new book yoga girl so put through that give it a read and let me know what you think

hi everybody and welcome to yoga girl adventures we are here at beautiful summer jhana villas in Koh Samui Thailand and I've changed out of my bikini for the first time this trip into my cooking where so I can show you guys my absolute favorite Asian dish we're gonna be cooking fresh vegetarian spring rolls rolled in rice paper and to make this dish we have some really amazing fresh vegetables so depending on where you are at you could actually use any type of veggies that you prefer I love avocado if you have bell peppers tomato sprouts anything you prefer just for you but for this particular one we're gonna be using some fresh carrots we have cucumber a really nice assortment of lettuce spring onion and a little bit of chili pepper so to help me today I have a very special guest we have not 75 she has been a chef for over 10 years and she's been cooking us all of these amazing healthy vegetarian meals every day here at some Adana so we actually already prepared some vegetables right we've been chopping up some cucumbers tore up some lettuce the carrots we kept a little bit finer grated a little bit of chilli and spring onions so I already have our chopped vegetables we're gonna begin right away with a rice paper so nuke is prepared for me just a really big bowl here with some water and when it comes to rice paper you want to wet it all the way through and this is a mistake that I have made in the past so not wetting it enough if it's still a little bit stiff it makes it really hard to roll or it will stick to the cutting board so maybe 30 seconds keep it in the water no kiss taught me you can flip it around a little bit until it's soft enough that it's rollable this is why I have a professional because I mess up in the kitchen a lot but then you learn and you grow you think it's ready or a little bit more it's okay okay the pro has said it's okay so you lift your rice paper up put it on your cutting board just like this and then make sure there are no air bubbles in it so you can smooth out the little bubbles that form on the surface and we're gonna begin with our lettuce right so tearing up just a little bit of lettuce we have some assortment of different kinds choose one that you find tasty like I particularly don't love for instance iceberg lettuce so we're gonna skip that is that enough okay isn't it and then just a little bit of spring onion we kept the stem for this one just chop the ends off put that right on top add a little bit of carrot I'm actually slightly allergic to carrots so I'm not going to use too much and then for the chili fence on how spicy you want it so Tylan is a very spicy country everywhere I go they asked me how spicy I want things I say a little it's a lot so we're not gonna use a whole lot of this chili just like this is this very spicy not so spicy she's from Thailand so a little bit subjective when it comes through that and then let's not forget our cucumbers as well let me add them on top and to make sure that the roll looks nice when you've actually rolled it we're gonna add a little bit of lettuce just on top like this correct okay this is the hardest part of the spring roll beginning to roll so we're gonna lift the ends up so they're not stuck just a little bit of lift for them like that and then this one and then you take all your veggies kind of push them towards the edge and try to roll it tightly tightly and then just wonderful and then pull the sides in towards the center it's kind of essentially like making a burrito have you had a burrito maybe and then keep going keep folding it to center you can add a little bit of extra water just for it to stick properly good look I made one okay good look how pretty this one is and we just place that aside and we'll make a couple more so when it comes down to cutting the spring rolls it's really important that you actually wet the knife a little bit so if the knife is dry they might stick to the rice paper and they'll break so let's leave her pretty one for last and we do my fat roll now so we cut the ends off just a little bit I just learned this by the way make sure your knife is wet enough because the end and then cut in a diagonal so you can actually make your spring rolls stand up nice and pretty look at that okay see see it's standing on its own and then like this it's family soup and then like this look at that I'm so prep and then an important part of serving your spring rolls is of course what kind of sauce you like so I'm a little unconventional when it comes to this stuff I really like soy sauce with everything but milk has prepared for us here sweet chili sauce a little bit spicy and also the sweet plum sauce so you can find them as well any oriental grocery store or a Whole Foods or just any place where you can get Chinese food pretty much so I'm excited to try this which one is the better sauce let's see which one is the better one I think my fat one turned out really nice okay I'm gonna go over the not so spicy because because I'm I was mmm do you want to try one look right here have one I'm gonna stop she's like oh god I might die no one knows is it the best one ever ever we have the pro approval thank you so much thank you captain cough thank you so that was our spring rolls let me know how yours turned out if you liked them and I hope you have a really beautiful lovely day kakuka thank you so much see you next week can we can we tell can we tell the world that this is not sweat but water from my hair 
hi everybody and welcome to yoga girl adventures and the yoga girl kitchen so this year a girl kitchen episode is a little bit more adventurous than usual as we are at beautiful sama jhana villas in Koh Samui Thailand and I'm going to show you my favorite hi our sibling we're gonna be making a green papaya salad which is really healthy number one super healthy very good for you all clean very wholesome ingredients but also very handy a little bit spicy it's just an interesting salad and compliments bigger dishes really well so for the recipe we're gonna start the base of course as you can tell by the name is green papaya now depending on where you live in the world you might not have a green papaya lying around your kitchen what you want to make sure is that you don't use an over ripe papaya or actually our wife papaya at all so it's not supposed to be orange like we're used to in the West but actually green and it's a little bit firmer and it just complements the salad a little bit better together with that so that will be our base we're gonna use just a big chunk of carrot we have some string beans and then for the dressing so this is almost the most important part a ton of ingredients that will make this just super delicious tomato you can choose any kind cocktail tomatoes plum tomatoes which is the mix of what you have at home some chili you decide how spicy you like it or in Thailand we're gonna keep it pretty spicy for this episode some peanuts soy sauce or if you prefer fish sauce you can be used as well I'm a vegetarian so I'm gonna stick with a soy sauce garlic fresh lime and a sweetener now here in Thailand we have this really amazing coconut sugar which is very flavorful and great for the salad just to bring the sweetness out of the papaya a little bit at home if you have a hard time finding coconut sugar any sweetener would do so you can do maple syrup agave syrup regular sugar cane sugar whatever you have around the house we're just gonna use a little bit of that for the dressing the first step of making our spicy green papaya salad is we're gonna make our dressing to make it you're gonna need a mortar am i pronouncing that right a mortar I have this gorgeous huge clay pot mortar thing that I got to borrow from the kitchen here but you can use just a regular small one that you have at the house so starting off right here we're going to use a 1 clove of garlic if you like things very garlicky you can use maybe one and a half maybe two I'm gonna stick with one just pop that right in there and then from there moving on to our chili now the chili is gonna differ depending on where you are in the world I'm gonna start off with just a little bit so half of these little spicy guys and then using my mortar I'm gonna just squish that together really well so you want to really get all the garlic out make sure you mix everything in there with the seeds of the chili just kind of dig in there properly all the way oh I can feel the the spicy is emanating so good okay and then when I have that done I'm gonna move on to my peanut so I'm gonna use about two three spoons of peanut depends on how much you like I mean I kind of like it a lot so let's go for three and then start mixing all of that in it smells really good already and you can really get in there this is almost like a workout this is post yoga mashing of peanuts and garlic and chili okay it good and then from there let's move on towards our tomatoes so if you have cocktail Tomatoes like I have right here it's enough to just chop them in half if you're working with bigger Tomatoes you might want to kind of slice them together a little bit more so we're gonna make this into a big paste and then use the lime of the soy sauce to create the entire dressing how many is enough okay watch come back good and then coming from here we're gonna use our soy sauce let's see a spoon of soy sauce is gonna be enough and you know you're gonna test a dressing before you add it to your vegetables if you like more of anything in particular you can do that a spoon of the sweetener of choice so we have our coconut sugar here which is going to be really delicious and then to finish off for the dressing the juice of one entire lime so it is quite a tangi dressing which I love and then let's mix all of this together so once you have the juice of the lime the juice of the tomatoes together with the peanuts just mixing together it just smells absolutely incredible and careful with your eyes you don't want this to smash up and hit you in the eye that's gonna be painful good okay and then to make sure that this is actually the type of dressing that you really love give it a little taste if you want it spicier you add a little bit more chili if you want a more garlic you add some garlic mmm it's so delicious actually I'm gonna use just a little bit more a little bit more soy sauce so you choose just how much of this you want it's really basic and then give that another little twirl and then the dressing is ready to go you want to see can I show you how beautiful this dressing is just now so this beautiful clay pot I I almost want to take it home it's so gorgeous so it almost looks like peanut butter or like a peanut butter dressing right now everything is mixed really well with the garlic and with the tomato good and then moving on from here we're gonna chop our vegetables so when it comes to the vegetables for the salad if the only tool you have in your kitchen is a knife you can definitely chop them just very very finely on the same size we're gonna grate them we have this really clever tool right here that allows us to grate both the papaya and the carrot at the same time so just getting rid of the peel a little bit right here and then put that a sign good and then you start grading so if you have more of a traditional grade about your house that's great go ahead does it matter which end I use no and then same for the papaya just peel it really quickly and start creating so you're gonna want to use a whole lot depends of course of how many people you are cooking for and whenever I'm in the kitchen I don't use measurements very well so go by feel and as you're tasting the dressing as you go you can totally decide how much you want to eat just so you can make a whole lot and keep it in the fridge for a week if you want or just a little bit so it's enough for your lunch or for your dinner good okay so now that we have our carrot and our green papaya magically graded we're gonna mix this together and as I said if you don't have green papaya at home use a big cucumber use a very green mango or you can use a little bit of each so this could be a green mango green papaya cucumber carrot salad if you want just go ahead and mix that up now that you have your care in here papaya nice and blended we're gonna come back to our mortar and come to our string beans so for these long guys right here you can actually just use your hands and you can just kind of pop them into the dressing so to make these soak up the dressing we're just going to mush them around here a little bit and you decide how much you love I actually love these kinds of beans so let's use a whole lot good and just mush that a little bit not too much you just want to break them up a little bit so that they can soak up the yumminess of this delicious dressing that we have good and then it's time to take our papaya mix add about a handful of the green papaya with the carrots put that aside and then with your spoon just kind of mush down around a little bit so you really want the dressing to soak up the entire yumminess of the papaya of the carrot cucumber mango whatever you're using so really make it soak everything up in there you don't want to go light on the dressing for the salad less is not more for this one but add a little bit extra if you like as well okay once you've mixed everything together you can take a little taste I'm gonna use my fingers mmm oh my god I'm such a great cook with a little bit of help from Thailand mmm this is amazing oh my god it's ready to be served we have this beautiful plate with our little carrot rows so thoughtfully prepared by the help we have here at sandwich on up and then you take your salad pop it on the plate just like that looking a little bit of extra beans hiding on the bottom and there we go lunch is served so thank you everybody for watching hope you learned something I definitely did today hope it's delicious leave me a comment below let me know how it tasted for you and

we are in Latvia a beautiful but still rather undiscovered country located on the crossroads of eastern and northern Europe Latvia is a small country with just about 2 million inhabitants with a rich history of culture and tradition located on the east coast of the Baltic Sea it offers the longest sandy seashore beaches in Europe as well as thus forests with unspoiled nature Latvia has a serene rhythm of life in the countryside modern cities and unassertive but hospitable people the capital city we got is full of history every cobblestone of the old town tells a story of the many foreign conquerors that have ruled a country and left their cultural imprint on infrastructure architecture and the country's character despite this wonderful richness there is a darker side of Latia a country that still struggles with unemployment poverty this has affected the family way of life in all of the country alcoholism crime and abuse is far too common causing parents to abandon their children or leave them unattended social welfare is often the only source of funds or assistance to turn to but too often tainted by corruption hindering progress and development today 20% of Latvia's children live under the poverty line and 7% are at high risk of losing their parental care children are the most vulnerable group of society and if deprived of a loving environment or basic needs at an early stage of life they risk never being able to bring positive change to their life situation however if cared for and invested in children have a powerful potential of breaking this cycle to bring well-being to themselves and their surroundings there are many foster homes in Latvia working hard to take care of children that have become orphaned or abandoned they make sure children have roof over their heads and enough food on their feet but equally important is that children grow up in a loving environment with stable relationships that they get an education and that they are encouraged to dream due to lack of funding this is too often put aside forcing children to move around from orphanage to orphanage leaving a feeling of despair and no manifestation of a better future making sure children grow up in a loving environment away from abuse violence or crime is an investment for the future development of the entire country it avoids history to be repeated and gives the prerequisites for a prosperous future we cannot break this cycle without giving the next generation the necessary tools to develop into loving individuals I am yoga girl and together with 109 we are inviting you to be part of this change join our retreat in May of 2016 in Latvia get a deep understanding of the issues we are tackling experience the impact we are making together and most of all meet the children in their home environment and spread love all while practicing yoga in the beautiful country of Latin all profits from the retreat goes straight to the children and their future let us join forces and give the children of Latvia hope for better days to come we believe in the power of social media to create positive change if you do not have the possibility of joining a retreat there are several ways to engage visit our website 109 WorldCom to learn more you

you're crazy girl yeah how long have you been holding it this is timing it well don't come down I was only 42 seconds 
hey guys it's Rachel I hope you're having a really good evening or morning or you know wherever you're at in the world I am here in beautiful Costa Rica I'm going to beat that a little hotel room I'm here for a yoga Festival and I'm super excited for the weekend I've been getting a lot of questions lately where I'm always getting a lot of questions about everything I get emails and comments and tweets and Facebook messages and you know there's no end to how many messages I get in a day and there's questions about everything from you know little stuff like clothing or alignment in yoga or natural beauty products and stuff about my dogs my family just all kinds of questions but also some very very serious ones very serious questions that I get some people write me their whole life story and when I express gratitude for resonating with something that I've written or asking for help and see I get on a daily basis 5 to 600 emails and it's surprising and getting bigger and it's a beautiful thing and I feel so blessed that so many want to reach out and and they're actually connecting on a really serious level however I'm doing my best to answer as much as I can but I just don't have time so if you've written to me in the past weeks and I haven't you haven't heard back it's not because I don't care I read everything every comment every email I read it I just won't have time anymore and I've been trying to figure out a way where I can communicate a little bit easier with you instead of sitting down maybe writing a big blog which takes a lot of time out of my day it's much easier for me to talk and speak than it is to sit down and write which is why I left because it comes into that space I wanted to try this maybe I can just sit down in front of my computer we have a topic I talked about it I have a lot of things the same ideas that many of you resonate with and maybe see if it works see if anybody listens so what I wanted to talk about today is I got an email earlier from a girl she was 16 years old suffering from an eating disorder and she wrote me a really long email basically you know asking how how did you get this perfect life and in this perfect body and and how did you make everything fall into place and then and she really was very unhappy with her own body and her final question was how can you love yourself when you're really ugly and had a question just brings me to tears because I have a really hard time grasping the 16 year old can have these thoughts and ideas about about her body I think this is such a heavy subject that it's so important and not enough not enough people talking about this in a real way and I know there's a lot of pressure out there right now to look a certain way and to be super skinny or super thin and also in social media there's a ton of accounts out there just promoting weight laws and you know people are going to the gym running in a treadmill staring at themselves in the mirror with their jaw clenched and I don't think at that end makes anybody happy I mean being happy which is what everybody wants right that's ultimate thing but everything we do in our lives if it's changing our bodies or finding a dream job or traveling or getting married whatever it is that you want it's because you have a desire to be happy icky and pointless everything we do and having a perfect body well being really skinny or looking like a supermodel or whatever it is that you're looking for does not make you happy you might think I'm lying now like you know your mind probably tells you if you were twenty pounds skinnier your life would be perfect this change your life would be perfect if you had longer hair or you're fit into your jeans better or you could travel more whatever it is your mind has this this thing it puts an idea in you that life would be better if you changed something changed it's always in the future your mind like to think the happiness can not be here it has to be somewhere else and that's the thing if you always put that happiness in the future whatever you're doing and you get there and happiness is not there because you're not present so you might lose those many pounds and your mind is going to find something else to be unhappy about something else that has to be changed and even if you think you know you might be a skinny person and that's going to make your life easier because people will think you look prettier in pictures honestly people don't care that much about other people like I just want to put that out there people are really preoccupied with themselves and what's going on in their own space and they're looking at themselves in the mirror not so much at what you look like and real happiness that foundation of being really really happy not calm from the reflection in your mirror or from the number on a scale it doesn't I promise you that I promise you that you might for a brief second thing that you're happy but that happiness is very fleeting and it's superficial and it's not in your heart real happiness real happiness finding your passion or living your dreams or being creative and being with your family and finding love and and embracing yourself as who you are does not come from the number on a scale it does not come from anything outside of you and also it's not in the future you think keep thinking happiness is going to come it's going to come it's going to come can't find a way to be happy now that deep happiness is not going to come and starting off with your body I I would like to tell this this girl wrote me and how can you be happy and love yourself if you're ugly being ugly who has ever told you that I doubt that if you really look into it how many times a day do you tell yourself that you are this or that how many times a day do you judge yourself or label yourself as good or bad compare that with how many times anybody else is leaving you label you the same way we have these repetitive thoughts and they go round and round and round and probably your mind is telling you every day that you are not good enough when that's not true what goes on inside of your head is not your truth and what goes on in your mind is not the space or real happiness comes from real happiness comes from the heart it comes from them here your heart couldn't care less what you look like in the mirror trust me your heart couldn't care less if you fit into those size four jeans and whatever it is your heart doesn't care about any of that stuff again a little emotional this is a really really important thing so I want to say how about we start the other way around how about instead of thinking if you lose this many pounds you'll be happy later how about finding the love for yourself first find a way to accept who you are an embrace where you are in love who you are first and see what happens seriously let go after your dreams find that passion figure out what makes you really happy what do you do and you're really in the moment and everything just comes together and this is what's your thing find that and spread that love and share it connect to other people and you know get off the internet and find that love for yourself first and if you do that it's not that hard to change things physically physical changes are really really easy and they're not a big deal compared to everything else if you love who you are you're gonna eat good food if you love yourself you're gonna move in ways that make you really happy you're gonna move practice yoga and dance and run and do all those things because you like and you enjoy them and they make you feel but not because you have a wanting to change what you look like so if you're trying to change something go the other way around and find your happiness first and that physical part it's gonna come don't worry about it also on that if you're really living in the moment and you really have that joy of just being alive being adventurous and finding everything that makes you you the physical stuff it doesn't really matter that much and trust me this is coming from a person who does not have the perfect body like I haven't been on this epistatic on that scale I would not weigh myself I don't look in the mirror that way thinking what I see is gonna define who I am or how happy I got because it's not true whatever ideas you have of me it's also not true so please please just go deeper into your own heart and meditate or you know do what you have to do to stay president and find the joy that's real and let's move from there I think the world would be a much brighter place we all just loved ourselves for who we are I love you guys 
hi everyone and welcome to yoga girl adventures in an episode of the other girl kitchen here in beautiful Costa Rica right now we are close to Vita and the south end of the country and one of my favorite places in the world Salva an ammonia where we hosts yoga retreats every single year and for this episode I'm going to show you two of my absolute favorite Costa Rica and local dishes we're gonna be cooking gallo pinto which is basically rice and beans together with one of my favorite salads heart of palm salad for the gallo pinto you're going to need three cups of cooked white rice you can use whole grain rice but for this dish white rice is to be preferred and then you're gonna want to use 2 cups of cooked black beans I always love to use dried fresh beans just like these soak them overnight or 6 to 8 hours or so and then cook them until they're soft and tender better to use fresh dried beans than to use canned beans always and then with that we're gonna need about 1/2 medium size yellow onion 2 cloves of garlic a full red or green I like them red bell pepper tortillas for the actual enjoyment of the meal and for cooking we're gonna use some regular vegetable oil salt and pepper and something super specific to Costa Rica which is South sadly some more lisanna sauce it's kind of similar to work just sure sure so how do you think we're Chester's we're it's just words just liars I even practice the word Chester of sauce it's similar but not totally the same if you don't have salsa Lozano at home you can use that or even a little bit of that a little bash of tamari or Bragg's Liquid aminos will work just fine as well so let's begin by cooking our rice and our beans we have prepared beans soaked overnight so they should be almost ready to go so we have our beans ready we're waiting for the rice to cook and while we do that let's get chopping our vegetables so beginning with the onions as I said you need about half a medium-sized yellow onion for this meal just peel the ends off and let's chop the onion pretty fine me good chopping your onion nice and well and then let's just place that aside for now moving over to the bell peppers you want a core the bell pepper completely I like to start at the very top and then you can just kind of pull the seeds out and then chopping that pretty finely as well is this good luck I do more a little more chopping chopping chopping okay so just like that so you'll keep the belt up there just a little bit chunkier than the onion it's still pretty chopped up and then place that aside is there rice yet ready yet moving on to the garlic so I love love love garlic in my life two to three cloves is good enough if you can open it okay here we go two to three I'm gonna go for two and a half cuz I love garlic and then you can use the edge of the blade to kind of crush the garlic a little bit and you can peel them off easier and then I always like to cut off the little end so you don't get that in your food and this you can chop up the really really well mince even Superman garlic okay good okay so we have our garlic bell pepper our onion but pretty much ready to go this rice is taking forever forever so while you wait for rice to boil you can just enhance fans in the kitchen or not go on rice rice rice rice rice in my kitchen rice rice rice is it ready no all right so now that our rice is cooked so we have 2 cups of cooked beans rice is finally finished 3 cups of cooked rice and this will yield about enough for 4 to 6 people depending on how hungry you are we're really hungry beginning with your onion we're going to saute the onion together with a bell pepper in a pan and we'll leave the garlic for later a little bit of vegetable oil so we saute the yellow onion with a red bell pepper until it's soft and just the onion is a little bit golden rich we'll take oh oh we have to cut this together just something good right and now that we've sauteed our yellow onions our red bell pepper will just add garlic and then it's time for the rice and beans good and then let's begin with the rice one cup two cups three cups get in there and the beans the beans the beans oh look how pretty that is look how pretty it is come to our salt and pepper and then we have all of our ingredients in here final touch is alpha panel or worth choice for fire or saw siddhasana I would use a little bit of tamari in here because I love that with Pinto but this will be good enough just a - big - okay so we're pretty much ready look how yummy this looks and shit we forgot our herbs can I go to the garden I'll be right back so here we are in the greenhouse at South Armenia there's all kinds of magic in here all kinds of lettuce and really delicious herbs we're gonna go for the cilantro and a little bit of time that we need for our guy up insulin for our salad today so beginning right over here we have the coolants of Kyoto which is a different type of cilantro that's really special for Costa Rica I smell that and it's really powerful it's almost overpowering in a way and we're not gonna need too much cilantro for this flavor for this dish so we're gonna skip that for now but it's good to know and then we'll come over to the actual cilantro from over here do you like that smell I know and then right here we'll get just a little bit regular cilantro we'll see four kind of texture a little bit of flavor not too much we're not gonna need a whole lot and then sometime where's the time Wingo here's the time want to smell that mmm I know it smells amazing ready so when's at the garden house got some fresh thyme I have so much time on my hands and some cilantro believe this the launcher for last the time you can just chop up it's really optional a little bit of this if you want I love thyme any fresh herb you have in the garden is good for anything we're gonna use a little bit of this for our salad as well fresh herbs always good to keep around and if you're using fresh herbs you can add them last at the very end if you're using dried herbs you can add them with the oil and the onion at the beginning good and it looks like we are done look at this amazingness so this is gyul pinto with all costa rican ingredients in Costa Rica I wish you guys could smell how amazing this smells we have our black beans we have a rice bell peppers onion garlic we have our thyme and then right before we serve we'll chop up some cilantro and put in there as well yes now that our guy pinto is ready let's move over to the heart of palm salad so if you've never had a fresh heart of palm before this is what that looks like usually in the rest of the world you get these in cans the fresh one is completely different thing it's super delicious they're very crunchy and texture there's actually the core of certain types of palm trees a vegetable and it's high in potassium is high in b6 there's lots of yumminess and heart of palm so we're gonna have this be the base of our salad but let's begin with the lettuce so use a big bowl and then for this lettuce make sure you rinse it properly we're just gonna chop it up pretty roughly you can even tear this up if you want it does not have to be chopped very finely good just like that let's pop that in our bowl and then moving on from the lettuce we come to our Tomatoes so this salad is so easy to make it's delicious and really what makes it what it is is the heart of palm itself so here in Costa Rica we're lucky we get heart of palm almost everywhere you can buy them at the side of the road even I like to eat them as a snack just kind of as they are but it will complement our Gayo Pinto really well goodness come give me a kiss kiss the chef hey are you hungry yeah starving so we've used one head of lettuce two fairly big tomatoes and that'll be enough pop that in there and then let's go for just a little bit of red onion the red onion can be really overpowering for the salad so let's go for about a third of a red onion not more than that we go and then coming over to the avocado my favorite well it's actually have a fruit of a cloud as a fruit but this is my favorite thing in the world and in Christa Rica we get these amazing avocados they're always perfect and you can just kind of slice them into half and I use your fingers and just pop them into the salad the slice and they use your fingers and drop them in there yay finally let me have all our vegetables let's move over to the heart of palm the star of this show and we're just gonna slice the heart of palm and leave it in little rounds that's gonna be too thin you actually want the chunkiness of the heart of palm to be the core of the salad look I'm gonna use around and as they are so look at the yumminess of this salad right now we're gonna mix it all together and then we're gonna add a little bit of homemade dressing for the dressing for this salad we're gonna keep it so simple we're gonna use a little bit of fresh lime some olive oil salt and pepper and some herbs from the garden so about half the juice of half of a lime make sure there are no seeds left in there a dash of olive oil just a little bit some salt and some pepper good let's mix that bad boy up again good almost ready to eat so right before you start you can chop up a little bit of cilantro now so lunch is usually kind of a love-hate type of herb you either love it or you absolutely can't stand it I love it so you don't need to use too much just a little bit for when you serve let's take a big chunk of pinto and if you have any extra avocado lying around serve it you can never overdo avvocato and our heart of palm salad look at that ah if you have the acidity of the salad little bit of lime juice the texture of the palm meat-filled the heart of palm delicious and the heat of the gaya pinto now very a printer traditionally should be served with hot sauce we have hot sauce so everything is ready take your cilantro and kind of sprinkle it on top adds a little bit of green to your guy open so not too much so this is a delicious meal a very typical tikka a very typical Costa Rica and we have our kaya Pinto delicious warm very nurturing and filling together with this really fresh salad with a little bit of acidity from the lime and the beautiful texture of the heart of palm that I love mmm it's so good I'm going to take this and enjoy with my Costa Rican view but I hope you had a fun time cooking with me subscribe for more episodes right here and I'll see you next week right

hey guys I am Rachel briefing and today I'm going to show you the foundations of a handstand so there are a couple of key points of alignment I want to go through with you guys today step one is going to be to try and get away from the wall as much as we can so instead of leaning against something we can use alignment and technique to little by little get our feet off the mat so what you want to make sure is that you have as much alignment as you possibly can find before you even lift your feet off the ground so step one is going to be to place the hands on the mat make your way into a downward facing dog you take one step forward and you lift the top leg up you want to give this a try with both legs lifted try one at a time until you figure out which side is your easier side now make sure you have your shoulders aligned directly above your wrists it means you're not way back here with your sit bones towards the back of the map the shoulders are above the wrists they drop back and try to have the right tricep really wrap around the bone gaze is forward the entire time so don't drop your head so you're looking towards the back of your mat but look forward to have your eyes on the road and that way you know where you're going press the thumb and index finger down to the floor and this top leg stays straight and strong the stronger the top leg the easier for it to pull the rest of the body up off the ground you keep the gaze forward bend the bottom knee kick up heel in and come back down try that a couple of times kick up heel in and come back down the reason you want to bring your heel in that way if it makes your body a lot smaller making it easier for you to balance with your hips above your shoulders so do that try to not find any and don't kick too hard you want to make sure that you don't fall over there's no falling into a backbend no flipping over at all just kick as high as you're comfortable to for now then the knee kick up heel in and come down with time you'll kick up heel in and find a little bit more time to balance with your shoulders right above your wrists here once you have that try to keep your shoulders off of your neck do all the lower ribs in scoop the tailbone under and then extend the bottom leg up to the sky connect your two big toes and send energy all the way out into the tips of the feet once you've had a couple of wraps you come back down and take a break thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this little mini tutorial if you have any requests for poses or transitions like me to break down in the future just leave a little in the comment box how about beautiful day you
