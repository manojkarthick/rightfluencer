Happy Friday! I‚Äôm super looking forward to the weekend because we‚Äôve got our engagement shoot for our Save the Dates and we‚Äôre meeting with vendors for the first time to discuss the cake üç∞  hors d‚Äôoevres üç°  dinner menus ü•ó  and special surprises üôÉ for our wedding guests!!! Planning is getting REAL. I‚Äôm having such a blast you guys! I‚Äôve got this 32 page inspo document that details exactly how I (and of course Sam ü§µüèº) want the wedding to feel. Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs going to be enchanted...‚ú®What‚Äôs your dream wedding theme? And for those who‚Äôve already gotten married  what was your wedding like?. Wow! Maybe one day I can be this organized!. Strong women lift each other up. They don‚Äôt tear each other down. üëä Happy International Women‚Äôs Day! Tag a strong woman you‚Äôd trust to do this plank stack with! üëÆüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë©üèø‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥üë©üèº‚Äçüåæüßïüèæüïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Anyone find it harder to make best friends as adults?. Awwww üòÇ. The perfect breakfast: avocado toast with heirloom tomato and arugula seasoned with olive oil and a pinch of salt. And of course my almond milk matcha latte! I am complete. üçµ What‚Äôs your fave breakfast combo?. After all these years of POPster brides asking me for some type of a wedding workout...I never felt right about creating a workout for brides if I wasn‚Äôt a bride myself! But finally you guys  this is the year!!! I just created some of my BEST WORKOUTS (not kidding) for...our Blogilates Bridal Bootcamp! It‚Äôs happening!!! 

I‚Äôm gonna get you soooo ready for the big day! And that doesn‚Äôt just mean physically - I‚Äôm talking confidence-wise  posture-wise  and the elegant way in which you‚Äôll hold yourself. This is gonna be a fun journey. Who‚Äôs ready!??? And how many brides do I have out there? Bridesmaids? Wedding guests? Comment below!!. Pulled out some partner moves in the park! üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Try these 3 exercises for a MAJOR fat blast sesh plus a legit leg sculpt and booty lift! üçë 1 minute each. Then dance it out like me and my lil sis! Tag someone who you don‚Äôt feel judged by when you‚Äôre being yourself!. Today we‚Äôre going to draw 4 different shapes with our butts: triangle  circle  U  and I. All these different motions will force our entire backside to be challenged. Now do this with me...can you make it through without stopping?. Life is about finding the harmony between the physical  the emotional  the mental and the spiritual...so whatever weight you‚Äôre at when you‚Äôre the happiest...then that‚Äôs your perfect weight.. Wow! This looks fun!. It's March!!! Not sure how you should plan your workouts this month? Then here is a workout calendar you can follow for free! Give it a shot!. Did you know that the 5 people closest to you are a reflection of who you are? Yup! So if you wanna be smart  successful  happy and confident - hang around people who exude those qualities! üëç

I‚Äôm so honored to be around these amazing girl bosses who I get to call my friends. üë≠üë≠ (with Lindsey Stirling  Rosanna Pansino  and Lilly Singh). Splits on a rock? On a cliff? Love that I can go to the beach in the winter! What's the weather like in your city today?. "NaN". Fave type of bread? GO! ü•êüçûü•ñü•® HMM mine‚Äôs a tie between croissants  Hawaiian rolls this one soft bread from 85 degrees bakery and Brazilian cheese bread. üëÖ. When was the last time you actually called someone!? üòù. I always üíó a good arm workout...especially if I can get that burn WEIGHTLESSLY! You can do these literally anywhere - in your living room  bedroom  hotel room - and I promise your arms will feel the burn. üí™ Try these 7 moves for 1 min each nonstop - go! Tag a friend to challenge! Full length video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tiJg-MK37E. Flexibility. Whether in your body or in your life  you must learn how to BEND so that you will not BREAK. Think about that. Life is changing every second. The people you think you know will change too. In fact  the cells in your body are being replaced all the time - you‚Äôre never really ever the same person as you were 1 second ago. So how can you expect life to be a predictable  perfect plan? You can‚Äôt. Everything‚Äôs evolving. Everything - including Instagram and this new algorithm! So what are you gonna do? Either you create the change you want or you accept your new reality with an open heart. But what you cannot do is sit there  try to live life as it once was  and complain. That will do nothing. That is when you will break. You must learn to be flexible to thrive.. Ever wanna get a solid arm workout in but you don't have any weights or dumbbells? Yea me too - so that's why I LOVE these weightless arm workouts that require zero equipment...so you can easily do them at home  in your apartment  in your living room  in your hotel room  or in your bedroom! Try it with me!. Today I stepped away from center stage. I choose not to lead  but rather to follow. As a fitness instructor and a CEO  2 roles that require you to constantly guide and inspire others  you MUST remember to step back. Take the time to listen  to observe  and to LEARN from others if you want to be a true leader. üëä I‚Äôm so happy I got to attend a POP PILATES class today as a STUDENT...of my own format! It was such a fun and eye opening experience! I‚Äôm full of new ideas now.

POP PILATES started with only 1 class and only 1 instructor - me  a college student just trying to figure out life. That was 10 years ago. üôä But today the POP ARMY took over 24 Hour Fitness NATIONALLY and we taught hundreds of classes all over the US! And each month we‚Äôre teaching over 3 000 classes worldwide! WHAT!? I‚Äôm so proud of each and every single one of my POP Instructors who brought our POP THROWBACK party theme to life today. I mean ya‚Äôll looked amazing in your leotards! You guys make me so proud. üíï I just can‚Äôt believe it. There‚Äôs so much more I want to GIVE to you guys. Just you wait!

Big shoutout to POP Instructors Melanie and Kandice for KILLING IT at today‚Äôs class at the Cerritos 24 Hr Fitness. I was blown away. Wow. How lucky am I to have instructors like you guys!? The passion  the energy  and the happiness in the air was just...magic. ‚ú®. Do you ever get sneaky though and give someone a smaller piece than they traded you for!? üòÇ. Happy Pisces Season! ‚ôìÔ∏è who has a birthday coming up?

üí¶YOUR SWEAT HOROSCOPE!

You are so selfless and always willing to help others others  so this workout is designed to give you much needed ‚Äúyou time‚Äù. You‚Äôre easygoing so don‚Äôt usually love a super strenuous activity because it sometimes leaves you feeling strained instead of refreshed ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt like a solid workout. Because you‚Äôre a fluid water sign who loves to shape-shift  your best exercise will be part dancey and part flexy. Your best workout will be Hip Hop Yoga! ü§∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Put on your fave song and move to the music with this invigorating yoga flow!

Tag a #Pisces friend! You can get the entire break down: https://www.blogilates.com/piscesworkout/. Funny story. Last night I was at a local dessert shop ordering a matcha shaved snow with mochi and strawberries üçìüçµ (yup living that balanced life yo!) and the owner of the shop freaked out at Sir George the Magnificent and was like ‚ÄúOMG OMG OMG.‚Äù üê∂

She ended up sitting down next to us  giving Sir George a legit puppy massage for 10 minutes  and giving us all her tips on potty training! I felt like I was at a friend‚Äôs house  not a restaurant. üòä

Then before she got up to take a customer‚Äôs order  I reached out my hand to ask for her name and introduce myself. I said ‚ÄúNice to meet you! My name‚Äôs Cassey.‚Äù Then her eyes widened and she was like - ‚ÄúWAIT. YOU‚ÄôRE FAMOUS.‚Äù üòÇ

Then she immediately pulled out her phone  opened up IG  and stared at her phone for 10 seconds. I could legit see the dots connecting on her face. She looked at my profile  she clicked on a pic of me and Sir George and came to a full realization. She then whispered to herself...‚ÄúIt is Cassey...and there is George.‚Äù üò∂ LOL. I can‚Äôt even.

If you guys are ever in LA check out Spoon by H - it‚Äôs run by a sweet family that really cares about their food and their customers. Plus...it‚Äôs really good!!!üëåüç∞. "NaN". Freedom. Do you crave it? Freedom to do what you want without anyone telling you what‚Äôs good for you. Freedom to eat what you want without calories restricting you. Freedom to wear what you want without size labels making you feel bad. Freedom to say what you want without others constantly shutting you down. Yea. I think we all crave freedom. The thing is...freedom (for most of us reading this caption) is already here. It‚Äôs our mindset that imprisons our feelings and then our actions. All it takes is for you to wake up and realize that you can pretty much do whatever you want. At the end of the day  no one is holding you back but yourself. So go. Live. You only have this one life. BE BOLD! Be unafraid. Be freeeeeeee my little birdies!. Where are my Pisces? Try this personalized workout since you‚Äôre easygoing and don‚Äôt usually love a super strenuous activity because it sometimes leaves you strained instead of refreshed ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt like a solid workout. Because you‚Äôre a fluid water sign who loves to shape-shift  your best exercise will be part dancey and part flexy. Your best workout will be Hip Hop Yoga! Put on your fave song and move to the music with this invigorating yoga flow!. People (usually men) always say that Pilates ‚Äúlooks easy.‚Äù I laugh inside and invite them to a POP Pilates class. If the guy actually decides to attend  you can probably guess what happens next. üòâ Shaking body. Groaning. Sweating. Complaining. Heavy breathing. Taking breaks. Falling out of poses. ü§î Never underestimate any exercise format until you‚Äôve tried it! Just because things look a certain way doesn‚Äôt mean that they are. 

Props to all the POP Pilates peeps out there for making Pilates look so graceful! I guess if we started grunting and yelling as we did our double leg lifts we‚Äôd attract a whole ‚Äònother type of audience!? üòÇ Can you imagine!? Full length video for these moves here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbQW9ZVpQHA. Learn this routine now and come work out with us on Sat Feb 24th at your local 24 Hour Fitness...for free! No membership required. POP Pilates is throwing a nationwide POP Throwback party to our fave 80s and 90s songs. There will be free giveaways like scrunchies and chokers for those who come early! Invite all your friends and share this video with them!. Sam loves taking pics of me when I randomly fall asleep in odd places. (Furniture stores  people‚Äôs houses  you know  the usual...) Anyway  I was so tired this past weekend that as I was trying to blog  my eyes got so heavy I fell over sideways and knocked out. üò¥ I guess Sir George came to join me in my midday nap. üòç 

When I look at this photo I just feel pure love. There may be some barriers between us when we‚Äôre awake  but none in our sleep. We‚Äôre the same. One. Connected. I can‚Äôt wait to experience life with Sir George. My heart overflows with affection for him every single day. ‚ô•Ô∏è I don‚Äôt want to think of the day this might end.. Trust me. Coming from a nonstop high achiever  goal getter type of personality  I only get temporary happiness from reaching a certain level of success or from winning awards. Why? Because I‚Äôm quick to find my next destination and how to get there. I admit that I rarely take the time to stop and appreciate what I have. And because of that  I run in and out of emotions like emptiness  sadness  anger  self-loathing etc. So I urge all of you to please stop and realize how fortunate you are to be alive  to have a phone to read this message  to be able to even read! Seriously guys. Be happy for what you have. Because desire and expectation can really spoil the sweetness of your life. You do not know when it will end. So please be grateful.. You know  I'm thankful for annoying things. Because without them  we wouldn't innovate. You guys after dealing with all sorts of yoga mats (cheap thin ones to expensive thick ones) I decided to create something that gives you the best of both worlds. I am so excited to share with you our latest creation - the softest  cushiest  and most grippy mat ever - our luxury suede yoga mat! https://www.popflexactive.com/collections/pop-pilates/products/pop-pilates-suede-yoga-mat. Seriously. It‚Äôs too hard to please everyone  so don‚Äôt! When I was younger I tried to be such a people pleaser that I always was the first to sacrifice my own happiness for others. The draining thing was  many people did not do that for me. As I became more emotionally exhausted  I realized that I couldn‚Äôt keep going on empty. So I put the energy that I once used to try to please others into taking care of myself. It feels so much better and I feel so much more whole. Of course I still give - it‚Äôs my personality - but I‚Äôm more careful. How about you guys? How do you deal with people?. New blog post recapping the first 7 weeks of 2018! It's been INTENSE!!! BTW do you like personal posts from me or more informational?. POP Pilates = a dance on the mat. It's a group exercise class that fuses pop music with innovative Pilates inspired moves. The best part is - anyone of any level of fitness can do it and be challenged by it. Wanna get certified  start teaching  and start earning $ for inspiring others?

If I taught fitness in the 80s I‚Äôd be living that leotard life! üòÇ

Guys exactly 1 week from today on Feb 24th  there will be FREE @poppilatesofficial classes all over the US! üá∫üá∏ üò± All you have to do is find your local 24 Hour Fitness gym and see if they‚Äôre having a POP THROWBACK PARTY that Saturday!

If you have any questions please ask in the comments! I would loooooove to see you at one of the classes! üíï Don‚Äôt be scared. This is gonna be fun!!!. Happy Lunar New Year! üéäüí•üéâ 2018 is the Year of the Dog! üê∂ It‚Äôs so crazy because I never ever would have thought Sir George would come into my life aligned with the year. But I suppose the universe works in unusual and magical ways. ‚ú® 

Let‚Äôs celebrate all the doggies in our lives for they are LOYAL and beautiful creatures. I can‚Äôt get over how much I love my fur baby!!! üò≠ Do you know what your Chinese Zodiac is? I‚Äôm a üêÖ if you go by the Lunar calendar but a üêá if you go by the American calendar! Only cuz I‚Äôm a January baby though! Chuc mung nam moi! Gung hay fat choy!. Ummm I don‚Äôt even know where to start. YOU GUYS I AM OFFICIALLY A PUPPY MAMA!!!! üê∂ Ahhhh! I can‚Äôt believe it! üò≠Meet my new baby - my new purpose in life: Sir George the Magnificent!

I can‚Äôt even describe to you how having a doggy of my own feels. I‚Äôve wanted this for SOOOO long. I used to think I could get through life by asking strangers if I could pet their dog. üêï But it only filled the hole in my heart temporarily.

When I looked into Sir George‚Äôs deep black boba eyes  held his mochi pad paws  and combed my fingers through his apricot fur  I knew right then and there that he was THE ONE I‚ÄôVE BEEN WAITING MY ENTIRE LIFE FOR.

I can‚Äôt help but love him more and more. I never saw myself as the type to pick up üí© or wipe smelly üçë (I hate all things related to the toilet) but with Sir George  it‚Äôs like some maternal instinct just turned on inside of me! ü§∞üèªI don‚Äôt care! I just wanna love him forever and ever no matter what he does!

I cannot wait for you guys to get to know him!!! I AM SO HAPPY. SO SO HAPPY. My heart is flying. I feel like I‚Äôm living in a dream world. Ahh you guys! I am no longer Cassey the Dog Stalker - I have my own pup!!! Sam and I are officially puppy parents!. Fitness used to be so robotic to me. I used to think things had to be done a certain way and that if you didn't follow the rules  you were "wrong". Well  the moment I decided to break tradition and follow my soul is the moment I began to get how fitness is truly supposed to FEEL.

I made this music video because I needed you to understand what POP Pilates really means to me. It's changed the way I see fitness forever. Music + Pilates created "The Perfect Storm".

Become a certified POP Pilates Instructor: http://bit.ly/POPworkshops. On yesterday‚Äôs tragic school shooting in Florida - whatever side you‚Äôre on when it comes to gun laws - can we please be adults and WORK TOGETHER towards a solution??? There have been 18 school shootings since the beginning of the year. Its only been 7 weeks.

Please let‚Äôs use the comments area as a way to have a civil discussion about what can be DONE. Let‚Äôs make our community different than the rest of the crazy internet and let‚Äôs really THINK about what we can DO instead of complaining  whining  and doing nothing about it. I‚Äôd really love to hear your solutions. Thank you. ‚ô•Ô∏è. Fake. I‚Äôm beginning to feel so fake. Wearing red lipstick  holding these roses  and pretending like the thorns on these stems don‚Äôt hurt my hands. Why? Because I know that holiday photos like Valentine‚Äôs Day pics will get a lot of likes on Instagram.

Ughhhh. Listen to me. I‚Äôm playing a game  I know it  I don‚Äôt like it and yet I‚Äôm STILL doing it!

You guys wanna hear the truth??? The truth is...I bought these flowers for myself from Whole Foods for $19.99 (got a coupon for $5 off)  forced Sam to drive all over our neighborhood to find a random spot to take this pic  and then we got in a fight along the way because he said that all I ever do is worry about taking pics for IG.

I was mad. Mad because he was right. Mad because I felt like...I still had to do it. Sigh.

Tonight the real me doesn‚Äôt want to go to a fancy dinner. The real me doesn‚Äôt need roses to validate our love. Sam and I are staying in. We‚Äôre wearing funny sweats (swipe to see). We Postmated some Memphis BBQ with collard greens and creamed spinach. There‚Äôs now BBQ sauce under our fingernails and smothered around our lips. It may be not be ‚Äúinstagrammable‚Äù but it sure is REAL. And that - feels nice.. Anyone else? üòù. Today is typically a day couples get to celebrate  but it‚Äôs time to change that - because before you can give your ‚ô•Ô∏è to anyone else  you must love yourself completely first. Know yourself  trust yourself  and accept your beauty and your quirks because they make you EXACTLY who you‚Äôre supposed to be. So whether you‚Äôre single  flirting  coupled up  broken up  married  divorced  separated - whatever - choose to have a Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day! Now go love yo-self and treat yo-self!. I mean...follow for follow or else I‚Äôm unfollowing. üòÇ. Ok so a bunch of you guys shared the Cupid Shuffle Plank Challenge with me so I decided to give it a shot! Wanna try it with me!? Then upload your own video!. Who is #mygreatestinfluence? It's not a historical figure or a celebrity. Rather  the answer is much closer to all of us. The answer is YOU.

I am grateful every single day of my life for the opportunities I get (like being on the The Vitamin Shoppe's Wellness Council!) because I know that these things would not even be possible without your love. So thank you for being a good friend and thank you for trusting me with your fitness all these years. I'll never stop as long as you're by my side! What do you guys wanna see me do next!?? http://bit.ly/2CU48tF

Yayyyyy!!!!!. Haha  love this!!! Tag your dad!! :). Must remind myself this  for comparison is truly the thief of joy.. The Cassey clones have arrived. üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What will they do? Well you gotta watch my new music video ‚ÄúThe Perfect Storm‚Äù - a project I‚Äôve been waiting 2 years to create.

When you watch this video I want you to FEEL what POP Pilates means to me - the beauty  the strength  and the colorful passion that it empowers me with. ‚ö°Ô∏èBut it didn‚Äôt always start that way. I had to fight against the norm  break boundaries and be okay with being different as naysayers doubted me.

It started with 1 class. 1 instructor. Me. And now...there‚Äôs a POP ARMY that teaches over 3000 classes EVERY SINGLE MONTH. üëä I cannot believe it. My heart is so full with gratitude for every person who has made POP Pilates what it is today. And we still have so much more to grow.

Big thank you to all the incredible people involved in making my vision for this video possible!

Watch the full video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjZ6LwjgYU. It's here!!! 

It was 2 years ago when I had the idea for this music video. I asked myself: How could I express to you how POP Pilates makes me feel - the strength  the beauty  and the grace that it empowers me with everyday? How could I show you the journey that sculpted POP Pilates into the force that it is today? From one girl filming a YouTube video in her living room to now a POP ARMY of instructors all over the world.... Sneak peek at the Perfect Storm music video that‚Äôs dropping later today. So many bruises from this routine. But so so worth it. Because bruises heal and you get stronger. üí™ I can‚Äôt wait for you to see what this is all about! ü§ó Vlog on the making of the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wPq5u6H-ZI. You guys! I just released a vlog today with a sneak peek to a super creative video I‚Äôve been wanting to film for the past 2 years. Tomorrow you will understand how POP Pilates really makes me feel and how much magic ‚ú®  love üíó  and color üåà it‚Äôs brought into my life. Ahhhh are you excited to see it!?!? Watch the BTS video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wPq5u6H-ZI. Come behind the scenes with me on the 2-day shoot of our POP Pilates music video for "Perfect Storm"! I haven't done a vlog in a while and thought it'd be fun to take you guys along for this project I've been waiting 2 years to make!. It‚Äôs like I have to keep proving that I can get through anything ya know?. Wedged in a rock crevice with none other than Jackelyn. Both livin that one piece life and LOVING it! TBH when I wear bikinis I feel like I‚Äôm always fighting the the slip of the nip or the battle of the butt crack. üò≥ One pieces = the rompers of swimwear.. Haha  how's your workout motivation today?. Here's the segment from the Today Show this morning!!! Do the moves with us!!. You guys! I‚Äôm in NYC and tomorrow I‚Äôll be on the Today Show with Kathy Lee and Hoda torturing some unlucky audience members with my PIIT28 moves! MUAHAHA! üòà Will you watch!? I‚Äôll be on around 10:45am EST/7:45am PST on NBC. Take pics of the TV screen so I can see afterwards! Eek! Gotta get a good night‚Äôs rest so I can make you guys proud!. You guys know what the CHA CHA SLIDE is right!? The DJ plays it at every party. Well  I thought it‚Äôd be fun to do a fitness version where every lyric becomes an exercise move!

‚ñ™Ô∏èClap your hands = Plie Squat Clapping Combo
‚ñ™Ô∏èSlide to the left = Side Lunge L
‚ñ™Ô∏èSlide to the right = Side Lunge R
‚ñ™Ô∏èTake it back now y‚Äôall = Plie Squat 3 Walks
‚ñ™Ô∏èBack One hop this time = Jumping Jack
‚ñ™Ô∏èRight foot lets stomp = Forward Stepping
‚ñ™Ô∏èLunge R Left foot lets stomp = Forward 
Stepping Lunge L
‚ñ™Ô∏èCha cha real smooth = Cha Cha Cha
‚ñ™Ô∏èHands on your knees = Squat Reach
‚ñ™Ô∏èReverse = Disco Roll fwd and back

Tag a friend and make them do this with you! If you wanna do the entire song  the full length video is on YouTube.com/blogilates!. How I battle the dreadmill. üëüüëü. The Cha Cha Slide is the most played party song because anyone can dance to it! But have you ever tried it - fitness style? It‚Äôs seriously such a great and low impact cardio  fat burning workout with lunges  squats  jumping jacks and even a little cha cha!. I am LOVING this one piece life. How about you guys? Are you more of a bikini or one piece kind of gal? üëô PS...don‚Äôt worry about what‚Äôs in style...wear what makes you feel sexy  confident and powerful! Trends come and go. You don‚Äôt have to follow them. Just let them inspire you.. Happy Birthday to the one who keeps me so calm  so happy and always so in love...Sam üéà I cannot believe we are going to get married this year!!! WHAT!?!?!?!?!? I‚Äôm not sure I could even think that far into the future when we first met 10 years ago at Whittier College. We were just students then...worried about grades  freaking out over tests and constantly procrastinating our homework. Ha  so trivial! Now  our worries are far far FAR FAR FAR more  but to be conquering these crazy challenges together is truly a blessing that I will never take for granted. ‚ô•Ô∏è Happy üêù day!!! Now...time for me to get off my phone and interact with you in real life. Are you a cat person or dog person? Love this cute video!. Flying to somewhere tropical right now because it‚Äôs Sam's bday tomorrow and we need a mental break from the big events going on in our lives. Fianc√© life is amazing but to be honest  the overbearing expectations from my family for the wedding have me super STRESSED OUT. I really wish everyone could just chill out and have fun. Weddings are supposed to be about love  happiness  and new relationships. Not ‚Äúwe have to do it this way because that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs done.‚Äù At the end of the day...it‚Äôs just a party. Maybe a big fancy party if that‚Äôs what you want. But honestly  there‚Äôs no right or wrong way to do anything. So why do people have to be so dramatic about everything? Ugh.. Seriously. SO MANY LEGGINGS. Anyone else!??. A workout...for your zodiac sign!? YES!!! Here‚Äôs the Sweat Horoscope for my #Aquarius üåä popsters!

You go hard  or not at all! So when it comes to working out  you need to know what the goals are and you will CRUSH IT. So this total body strength training/cardio circuit is your best bet! You will be a happy  sweaty  and goal-driven Aquarius! You tend to thrive in group settings  so to make this even more exciting  invite some friends to do it with you!

How it works: There are 6 moves. You‚Äôll do each one for 1 min AMRAP (as many reps as possible) except the running one - that you‚Äôll pick a distance and you‚Äôll do it for time! 30 sec rest in between the moves. 4 rounds total. GO! You can see the entire workout here: https://www.blogilates.com/the-best-workout-for-aquarius/

What‚Äôs your sign?. Oldie but a goodie!!! Looking for a new program to start? Try this!. Puppies make me happy. No statement could be truer! üê∂üíï What kinda üêï do you have? Here‚Äôs Blogidoggy celebrating the big 4 Million with me and my tumeric drink!. Sometimes I move too fast. I don‚Äôt take a moment to realize all the cool things that are happening and I end up speeding on to the next - never getting a chance to celebrate how incredible life really is. This weekend I chose to chill out  to not think too hard  and to just bathe in the simplicity of happiness. Because it really is that simple. One day  we‚Äôre not going to be here anymore. And I don‚Äôt want to waste any time not being grateful to be alive. This life is such a gift and I want to live it to the fullest. It would be a shame to not take advantage of all of the opportunities that come your way.. Scales used to have so much power over me and to be completely honest  sometimes they still do. It's so crazy! I mean  scales are supposed to be objective measuring tools  but somehow we let them control our feelings. It's going to take time  but it is 100% possible to relearn your relationship with your weight. Know that it does not control you. It is simply a number  and you are more than a number!

Everyday that you can step away from letting your weight control your life  is a small but mighty victory. I hope today's tip helped you. Let me know where your relationship is with the scale. I'm excited to share more tips like this as a part of the The Vitamin Shoppe's Wellness Council. Remember  every victory no matter how small or how big...is yours! bit.ly/2CU48tF #victoryisyours #vitaminshoppe #sponsored. WORKOUT COMMAND! Stop everything and do 1 minute each side to sculpt your thighs and booty! üë†üçë Full length video at üìπ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKr_hm8_1IU. Watch this video to find out what my DNA says about my weight. You'll find the information shocking. It pretty much explains why there is no such thing as a diet or a workout that works for everyone. We are all so different.. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve done this. I‚Äôm pretty special. üòÇ Anyone else!?. Me as an active  healthy kid. Didn‚Äôt know there was anything ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me until another kid pointed a finger at me and asked me ‚ÄúWhy are you so fat?‚Äù I was mid chew at the dinner table.

My entire body froze. I couldn‚Äôt taste. I couldn‚Äôt hold my fork. I looked at my food and hated it. My eyes started to well up with tears. Before anyone else could see me cry  I ran to the bathroom  locked the door  spit out my food  and began to despise my body. Right then and there. I was 8 years old.

I‚Äôve always wondered why attaining a six pack and losing weight has been so difficult for me with the way I eat and the way I workout. And why other girls can eat whatever they want  not drop a sweat and still be so thin.

So I ended up doing a genetic test from 23 and Me and found some pretty interesting results that may explain why I look the way I look. And to be honest  I don‚Äôt know if I should feel relieved or feel upset at the results. If you wanna see what my DNA says  watch my new vlog: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ_Zj8N0cSc. So excited that 2018 POP Pilates trainings are around the corner!

Last year  I told myself  one of these days we‚Äôre gonna take Popflex Active to a trade show and be a big  real legitimate clothing brand - proudly showing our activewear to buyers of department stores and gyms! So to solidify my dream  I flipped open my Focus Journal  turned to the January 2018 calendar and wrote myself a future note: ‚ÄúBe at Active Collective this year.‚Äù üìù As life got crazy busy towards the end of 2017  I forgot about that dream. Until...we got a call from Active Collective asking if I‚Äôd like to come teach a special POP Pilates class at their show AND if I‚Äôd like to debut some of my newest designs. MY MOUTH DROPPED. üôä I opened my journal to January 2018 and there was that foreshadowing note I left myself several months before...‚ÄùBe at Active Collective this year.‚Äù üòØ WOW.

hey guys Cassey here and i am with my friend rose bean we are at her house and we're getting ready for the holidays yeah so I thought it'd be cool if we could do a video on tips on how to live a life that is happier especially since we're coming into a time when we're gonna be around family and aunts and uncles and get really stressful but really it should be a really happy time I thought what better way when you talk to Rose Anna who is the definition of happiness I mean look at this look at this you're smiling all the time you bake cookies and candies and cupcakes and you just so happy and so we're gonna give you guys five tips on how to live a happier life ready let's go number one be grateful for what you have because I think sometimes people always want more and more and more and you start feeling empty when you don't realize that everything that you have around you is kind of all that you need if you appreciate it one moment for me as I traveled abroad and I lived in a third world very rural area oh wow and they didn't have running water I did not have a soft bed to sleep on I live that way for a year and when I came back to the states I cried for the first time because I really just appreciated and understood how many things that I took for granted and I think that you can forget how maybe the rest of the world is living yeah when you're in your daily grind so what I like to do and I think this is a really good tip but write down either in the morning or the evening five things that you're grateful for when you start to train your brain to remind yourself things that are going well and things that you have yeah you really appreciate them I agree so much I think sometimes when we're living in Our Lives you get so stuck on what's good and what's bad and what should be our way in what we deserve when really instead of complaining like take a look around and be thankful hmm it just takes a couple seconds to just remind yourself I like that tip number two so around yourself with positive people like each other yes yes I also love a group of girlfriends me too Lili Justine Lynsey uh what I really like is that there's no jealousy mm-hmm we all like to lift each other up we don't drag each other down because there's no point I think the look that's so important is that you find people in your life who love you and are supportive your environment can really affect your mood imagine you're in a negative environment all day every day that takes a toll on you and it took me a while to work at it to really build my environment and now I'm in a place where I don't have any drama with any of my friends or any of my family it is save the drama for your llama I love that one of the first things I always tell people that is if you're feeling unhappy look at your environment especially the people because that negative energy can become so infectious that you can start becoming negative without even knowing why but when you're around happy people like honestly we're always smiling then you can't help but smile and feel happy because there is no reason to be sad because you're grateful for everything that you have tip number three do something nice for yourself yes I feel like a lot of times we can be hard on ourselves sometimes you get burnt out and you just have to think let's actually make time to relax to wind down for me that means getting a massage I love massages oh god wait do you like them hard or like soft medium oh okay what do you like to do for yourself it's nice exercise and eating well because you know when you exercise not only does it create a lot of endorphins but it just helps everything else in the body work well and I actually think better and okay do you work out in the morning I do okay that is so smart because a lot of successful people work out in the morning because it's really their mind clear yes mama you're successful only one holy woman but it helps clear your mind helps get you in the mode for like killing it throughout the day because you just killed it in your one hour workout and then you kind of just move through the rest of the day a lot faster tip number four random act of kindness you never know what small thing that you do for someone may have a butterfly effect and may keep spreading I think that's a real important it doesn't have to be a big grand gesture you don't have to pair with a charity and you know give a monetary donation like you literally don't have to do that you can give someone a compliment like that is a random act of kindness my parents raised my sister and I we always volunteered we did community service all the time but that's just something that my parents instilled in us to always participate in giving back whether it's to the community or to fellow human yeah I'd be kind I think that's so important because when you continuously give without expecting to receive magical things just start happening I can't really explain it but it's like putting that positivity out to the world in a universe just kind of works with you whenever I give to people it just feeds my soul I mean really really happy and that is why we were making this video makes you happy so if you are right now I'm sure how to give literally just text your mom or text your friend and give them a compliment that's how you can start number five don't hold grudges okay so I don't hold grudges it makes you feel bad the person holding the grudge not the person you're holding the grudge against so that becomes toxicity for your bodies a lot of energy to be mad at someone so that's just exhausting on the body and it also doesn't make you very happy you know so for your own sake if you would like to become happier let go of grudges you forgive for yourself anything that's something that want to people don't really understand you feel like you're forgiving that person so you feel like you've lost you've surrendered it's totally not that forgiving is for you so that you can clear your mind and move on and I like to remember all the good times we have yeah so I like to think about all the fun memories we had and all the reasons why I love that person and just kind of keep that in my head and then let it go good people bad people all sorts of people they come into your life they sculpt you to be who you are to do me so without them maybe you wouldn't have that fights that you have inside of you now maybe you wouldn't be as smarter sharp as you are now because you know you've been through that so I believe everyone is put in our path for a reason um so you just gotta deal with it can move on and don't hold a grudge hey Rosie Anna do you have a bonus to having a sense of humor which everything is a really good tip to happiness laughing yes like a healing agent for the Soul mm-hmm you need to laugh and not take yourself too serious yeah I think that it's easier to be happy if you have a sense of humor about things cuz bad things happen all the time in life I think some people who take themselves too serious could be harder to be happy I agree and if you guys aren't hanging around some automatically funny people you can find a lot of funny YouTube videos laughing um so guys thank you so much for watching this video and if you want to get more of Rosanna and know it over to her channel I'm gonna put the link down below and watch her stuff she has um some vegan cooking videos healthy stuff and she has some sweet so sweet summon indulge east uh for your Yolo days yeah but seriously Rosanna you make me smell so much and that's why I wanted to do this happiness video with you and I'm just so thankful for you I love you I'm gonna give you a compliment before we end rosianna I really love how much of a powerhouse you are and how and how cute you are I just kill in life I love it I love how confident you are oh no positive you are thank you cassie is so positive you guys every time we get together it's never negative we never spend hours like there's no poop talking festive although every time we get together we talk about creative future yeah an inspiration and it's just so refreshing I agree so much we don't bond over talking badly about people because I don't think that's a real bond because after you don't have anyone back to talk about what is your friendship really based on hmm our friendship is based on being happy for each other wanting to see you succeed and I just I just love you as a person um no lemon [Laughter] eating right so yeah just honestly I love that about you and I hope you guys out there

[Music] hey guys Cassey here is the today I'm going to take you through five moves to strengthen your legs while telling you about five things you can do to break out of your Lavery habit I know we all have our lazy days it's totally okay but when you're in that red and you really need to get out of it well these tips are going to help you well you do this video okay so your five moves are plie and lift the side leg raise curtsy lunges one heel lift plie and the four and flex I love that last move all right so I'm going to start the timer and we're just going to get going okay plie and lift and here we go I want you guys to bring your legs wider than hip-width apart okay and you're going to bring it down plie keeping the pelvis forward tailbone tucks chest open shoulders down and you're going to lift extend the leg whoo yay and what okay we're going for two minutes so my first tip for breaking out of your lazy habit is basically take a big task that's really intimidating you and break it down into small little baby tax so the same thing you have a goal don't just go and charge forward without knowing what you're gonna do and create a plan bring it down to little little steps because that way it feels more doable and look everything is possible in life you just got to break it down and figure out how to make that work okay a lot of times we get scared because we don't understand that's really it I mean when you're in a haunted house which I don't even go in because they're so scary I'm scared because I don't know what is behind that wall or that gravestone and so similar in life if you know there's something time that while you can prepare for it and it's not as scary um so in relation back to the laziness factor break everything down into small little tasks and I really recommend either writing it down on your phone in a document writing it down in your planner writing down really clears of my mind I like drawing diagrams drawing pictures and something visual because the more you understand the less scared you become okay I'm like already out of breath this is like a car go move without even without being a car you move okay keep going you've got about 20 seconds left I want you to come down open up your chest lift up that leg hi nice whoa and lift really moving your arm with the legs last one plie and up oh okay that was good wait number two we got a slide leg raise up this one's really good with outer thighs as well as the obliques Oh hands on at the hip on the waist you're going to flex your foot so check it out and bring your heel over the body and open up and bring it down so it's a lot of balance here if you need to hold on to a chair or to a wall that's fine but what really helps me is when I look in one place and I don't change my gaze I'm looking at you right now and look we need to look away yes we focus on each other and you won't fall okay we're ready to dip in the tube tip number two is do what you like the very first thing you do in the day it doesn't make any sense do what you like first thing in the day so if you have a big to-do list and you don't want to do anything well make the easy thing the friction that you do so even if that means cooking breakfast eating breakfast then make up the person that you do it'll set the tone for the rest of the day okay go ahead and quit blocking that foot lift and lower I think a lot of times when I get lazy it's because I'm trying to jump into something that I really don't like to do and to be completely honest with you guys sometimes there are times when I don't want to work out and what I end up doing is I just fall asleep on my and I just avoid everything and I'm like oh I'm just really tired and so if I had changed my perspective instead of be like okay you have to go gym and you have to look way they had to do this in that and if I don't feel like it then maybe I should just go outside and go for a walk it doesn't have to be that crazy do what you like and you're less likely to be lazy but yeah like I said in the beginning if you got a big to do task list to do what you like person today it's as simple as that even if it means texting your friend and telling them hello anything do what you like first oh really yep Ruben okay how we feel on the leg good you're almost done lift and down server okay number three we thought your crispy luncheon you want to place the hands on hips shoulders rolling back chest open gonna come down and lift come down and lift think like a princess no in fact you're clean think like a queen you're here honor your people in your cord and you're going to come into that room that ballroom with your shoulders back but it's just open all graceful and grand and royal just the way you are back how I want you to do the crazy lunch now come back with number three tip number three is to go hard but also schedule in your lazy time so I think what intimidates a lot of people is that they feel like ah this project is going to pick this amount of time and I just gotta go hard the entire time no I actually think that creates procrastination what you got to do is take it a little bit at a time just like that first hint so say I'm going to really focus for 20 minutes cRIO focus sports and then schedule in three minutes away to time you can go on Instagram do whatever you want and get back on it's almost like skin for you it's like tips for your focus so I don't want you to feel bad about meeting in mental breaks because I think that's very necessary I think it's very healthy so if you schedule it in at least you'll stay on task instead of being like not scheduling anything isn't going for five minutes in 60 minutes in office it has been 14 minutes and you've been scrolling nonsensically on Instagram you have not learned and you can get so special in that amount of time if you want to just be free I think there will be a lot better sustain on test all right you guys 20 seconds left we are down and up making sure your chest is open your belly is in shoulders are back so I throw the cream yes you are because you are come on right down and up low and lift perfect one more okay now we've got a page with heal up not either intense for the inner thighs so big white snake lift up the heel hands in front come on I want you to do is simply pulse pulse up in one type they put that one minute okay my fourth tip for breaking out of your laziness is to declutter yes I mean literally clean up your room clean up their desk even uh something I have to work on my desk is so cluttered right now so I feel as my desk is also a reflection of what goes on my mind which is also my desk top on my computer it's also a reflection of what's going on my mind and pretty much everywhere it's kind of wild and crazy I should clean up anyway if you want to break out of your lazy habits have a cool place okay when you're clean you can clearly it can be more creative and you don't feel like you're just skirting around your stuff all the time I think feeling like you're all caved in and makes me feel late to which oh oh gosh I'm new like that feels good make sure that heel is lifted that Spy is really engaged in my pelvis before I'm not leaning forward my chest is still up my shoulders are back beautiful you good okay and it has been proven that people who have cleared houses tend to be more lightweight than those who have really how this whole hoarded thing you know what I mean and so there is a correlation between being overweight and having too much junk in your house junk food junk and house extra weight on the body they think clear everything out can you feel so much better good good yeah yeah whoo perfect going slow brett-brett stayin hi how you guys doing you feel good don't stop you got must 3 2 1 and okay your last two minutes there's my new loop my favorite move in this entire thing is called the floor and flex and keep your hands on the hips check it out and draw four then you're going to kick it out and flex up low pelvic floor and like okay here we go go home pour and flex activating the entire leg working on your balance beautiful guys okay my fifth and final tip for getting you guys out of your lazy rest it's a surround yourself with inspirational people people who are like hey guys let's go for a run or let's get outside or let's work on this project together and let's go painting be around people who want to do that because if you're a lazy people all the time chances are you're going to be well more lazy so if you can find a group of active people whether they are currently physically in your life or maybe you found them in the pop star community on Instagram or on Facebook other side then whatever works for you that motivation that inspiration should really translate if you can see other people doing that for themselves you want to do it for you too okay now show me this move in a drag the toes up the knee pass me lengthen and flex down you really want to take your time with this beautiful work good stuff now if you feel like you cannot find inspirational people in your day to day life I suggest reading a book by someone who inspires you maybe listening to a podcast that inspires you may be following some people in social media that inspire you people that you want to be like and so the more you can get your thought into that mentality of feeling happy of being successful that super clear and where you can hear those stories and where you can use those stories in your everyday life emulate kind of the same thing but you can find your own success to create your own happiness and one more okay that was a really good guys so thank you so much for joining me in this workout make sure give me a thumbs up if you made it this far house and let me know in the comments below what you do when you're lazy and like I said when I'm lazy I just I just go to sleep but that's the same thing to happen when I'm sad if I drink too much which I don't drink but I do fall asleep pretty much sleep is the cure for everything for me which is very interesting but it also is very healthy for you to work out eat right and sleep well those three things are real important to living that balanced and harmonious life okay I love you guys so much ah we'll see you next time bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
you guys I just found out some crazy information for my genetic testing for 23 me and I have to share it with you because I feel like I finally understand my body type better why I look the way that I look and aa big THANK YOU to 23andme for your genetic testing for your science and also for this partnership because I am so excited to share with you this information that honestly shocked me but also oddly relieved me at the same time but before I even get to that back story okay you guys so I'm heading over to my sister's apartment because we have to look at the genetic results that my sister got I got together because it is one of the most interesting things that I have ever found out about myself and about my weight which is kind of the point of this entire video so let's get into the weight part I grew up as a chubby kid in class I was the fat one at family parties I had a double chin in like all of my elementary school pictures I actually didn't start to thin out until seventh grade due to puberty I tried everything to try to lose weight I've been vegan I've been vegetarian I've been paleo I've been pescetarian I've even been on 1,000 calorie diets I still remember that when I was like eight years old I was in a family party and this little girl just walks up to me at the dinner table and she goes and even today it is still happening guys like on social media people don't let me forget they say why don't you have flat abs if you're a fitness instructor don't you think you're too fat to be one it never goes away and so losing weight for me has been so difficult like I try to eat so clean I try to work out so hard and some girls can eat burgers and pizza and all sorts of things all day long and if they want a six-pack they can literally have it by tomorrow if they just like you know take out bread or something like that but this is not that easy for me and I've just been like am i doing something wrong and i cheating and i don't know it or am i meant to be this way is this my balance am i supposed to be sort of soft on the outside but strong on the insides and people can't even tell you know physically that I work out like is this my destiny well that's where 23andme comes into play 23andme is basically a personal genetic testing service so what happens is you spit into a tube the scent of your saliva to scientists to examine your DNA and six to eight weeks later you get back the results and these results are pretty awesome because you learn things about yourself that you probably didn't know before like how your DNA affects your facial features the way your hair looks your taste preferences and even how much you weigh like just about my 23andme results back to get yours the shock factor Oh yesterday for 45 minutes we thought we were it sister we literally it thought we were so growing up our parents always told us that we were so many factors met Chinese and 25% Vietnamese when I got the results back it's that I was 77 percent Chinese and 23 percent Southeast Asian which is pretty much what our mom and dad told us but then when Jacqueline got the results back then there was 46% Chinese and 54% Southeast Asian so literally when we got those numbers Jeff and I were freaking out legit so this is why it broke down that way though when you have parents that are both here so let's say our mama's pyramid and using our dad was pure Chinese then we both would be 50/50 babies and like all send it but there's a lot of mixing on one carrying and the mixing on the other in terms of their ethnicity but it mixes together to create a baby it can really be plenty of combinations and because both their parents are make Sofia in Chinese we ended up getting different mixes no in real life rokay were actually still sisters and even if we were it's too late okay what's next I really want to talk to you about the bonus report putting through me gives you this report which basically tells you if you're predisposed to way more than average if you're predisposed to way less than average or you're predisposed to just be average weight and it is so interesting because I'm really not sure how it supposed to feel about beef it's all I got and it says waiting for Wi-Fi everyone Cassie your genes predispose you to wait about 5% more than average anyways you're safe it says Jaclyn your genes predisposed to eat away about 5% less than average so just to give you a little bit of context to what these numbers mean and Sam actually shut the test as well and his wellness all told him that he is predisposed to wait 3% then the average person his age in height it's a mom who has issues with her weight her results said that she was pretty disposed to wait 3% more and so when mine says that I'm predisposed to waive 5% more than average that's pretty like really doesn't matter you kind of just aren't given what you are given and and you just have to rock it you just have to own it and it doesn't matter if I'm 5% less it more like whatever it doesn't matter it just could it be happy with it I just feel like sometimes I work so hard and I just am not getting the results I want what is the non acceptance come from is it time because like you see a lot of other really six-pack fit people do is it because people have said something to you where does it stand from I mean like if you look at most other fitness instructors of trainers everyone has like major abs and tiny waist and like a big booty if they like they look a certain way that there's a look right and I don't look that way and I'm reminded that I don't look that way thanks to social media I'm not everyone just they get you so I think it comes from there and I think it comes from always trying to reach something that I haven't ever had so I think we need to take a step back and think about it as to what this would mean back in the day maybe that means that because I can't carry enough heat I don't make it through winters it doesn't matter how we look physically but what does this mean in survival mode you know like maybe it's not lifting outlets absolutely it totally is about how you choose to use the information right you know I could choose to be sad or if you choose to be happy about it and it's all about trends like right now one look is in style in the next couple of years of different levels on style and you just kind of do you because if your focus these numbers and all this stuff and you're just gonna stress yourself from an end of time right now I'm making decision to be grateful for the body that I have because it's healthy I can move I can work out a grim business I can play with you like I love my buddy yeah and these little things like they don't matter because your life is about so much more than having a six-pack imagine if life was really about having abs and I just feel like an app with legs when walking around so interesting and this is why I love science because yourself I really really would recommend getting 23 weeks my friend and we all have the best dinner conversation so we talked about our genetics you'll get a bunch of reports like the Wellness Report which basically tells you how to DNA affects your weight whether you're lactose intolerant I'm so much more so guys I hope you choose to give 23andme a shot if you want to just head to this link right here you get

[Music] hey guys Cassey here and welcome to the final video in your body coding bootcamp we made it through six weeks and I'm going to reward you with something absolutely amazing today we are doing a total body stretch in front of the ocean and I want you to really just listen to the sounds of the beach and imagine that you're here with me relaxing and giving your body what it truly deserved so I would be opening up your sack your chest your legs and maybe getting you ready for some splits so it's gonna be fun and remember we're stretching it's going to take time so if you feel like some of the moves are a little bit too much no worries to decrease your range of motion so let's start out in a Down Dog something we're really familiar with both hands underneath the shoulders palms wide bring through the balls of your feet into the mat and I'll lift up those hips press the heels into the mat try to flatten them down and bring your eyes towards your toes looking right to your legs Oh breathe in through your nose out through your mouth now let's go ahead and walk that dog pressing one heel into the mat at a time listening to the wave beautiful tippy toes and heels press planned that back beautiful now bring yourself into an up dog right here hole rolling with those shoulders steps allowing the test to open lift up we're going to go into a dancing dog now switching between your dog and your down dog taking your time smiling through the entire flow feeling good feeling so fortunate that we get to stretch together today and right here flip open shoulders rolling back and go ahead and drop the knees drop the toes and press yourself back into Child's Pose inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth now we're going to open up your chest okay so we're to get down onto the mat I want you to lay yourself down now bring your arms until goalpost position just like this and lay your cheek on the floor so you're going to lift up one leg and press it back you should feel your shoulders opening up to feel your chest and just hold breathe in through your nose out through your mouth opening up that knee and go ahead and bring it back switch opening it up keeping those arms in about 90 degrees goalpost position hold we're just going to get us ready for the next illusion good three two two one go ahead and press it down four hat now ready to get into a position that will be quite challenging but just go to your limits all right so what I want you to do keep those knees hip-width apart we're going to lean back so of course this depends a lot of your back strength and flexibility just go as far as you can instead of just you know throwing yourself back imagine you're lifting your heart towards the sky and let that extend you okay it's hard for me to talk when I'm all the way back so what I want you do when you're back there make sure you're pushing your pelvis forward okay here we go lift lift let's bring those arms back onto the heels press your hips forward inhales the nose exhale through the mouth oh let the test more more MORE in theory yes and bring yourself back up okay let's get that back feeling normal again so press the upper back into the sky hold it and then press the booty up into the sky slowly couple more times and one more [Applause] [Music] okay now since we're here we're gonna get those legs you guys worked a lot of legs throughout his entire body planning booty so I am going to ask you to roll your mat up a couple times for any question as we're going to stretch your your inner thighs as well as your philosophy so lunge for now the thing here is I don't want you to completely just let go and do this keep this nice and square fact I'm feeling a lot of my quads and my butt right now with just pressing my pelvis it's such a tiny thing I wish I could be in your room right now like adjusting you but try not to put all your weight forward resist and you will feel all the stretch right here okay hold that keep it square hips square I don't want it I want to see any of it in space square looking forward beautiful and then now you lean everything now give me everything you got flatten the toes hold really feel in that groin stretch yeah that feels good okay now the next one's a little bit hard we're going to get your quads because after we do both sides we're going to get into some splits and this isn't just on hamstrings with a pair of legs I need you get your quads so place your hand down right here grab with the opposite hand on yourself and look so cool here for a second first and see how we are okay you might feel a little bit of pulling in your quads in your groin in fact you may not even be able to touch enough okay you can do this for me just do the best that you can 10 now we're not just going to hold we're going to tap heel to butt woo feel in my quad heel too but giving you some rest in between okay so it's really hard to just hold something that's super painful just take it a little bit at a time just like that okay now we're going to hold you ready all right and hold whoo breathe five four three two really Wow okay since we're here extend that leg flex the foot links in the tip of your head towards your toe this is for handlers and make sure your leg is directly in front of your hip not to the side and that hamstring in there good and try to plot your back and lift it up okay guys we're repeating on the other side and then we're going to get into split so leg forward lunge with resistance feeling your quads and your glutes right here without just throwing everything away okay you're standing tall lunging tall actually like you're about to propose to somebody this like this hold squeezing hips are square remember we're not opening out this stays at 90 and then we let it go full things right they're dropping the toes to the floor [Applause] nice line right here holding holding feels really good now let's get those quads screen the hand down opposite hand opposite foot and you may find that one size more flexible in the other which is totally normal you'll discover what side that's gonna be alright guys ready pushing in crap really can't really be there painful tap release they're really not my favorite thing to do but I know I'm use them so we forget to do it with you couple more cap release one born then we hold okay you ready besides harder for me I can already tell and three two hold relax breathe in through your nose exhale your mouth give me five four ah man that's crazy okay and then we press back heel into the mask they assured straight out from your hips and extend okay today the left hamstring is right we're reaching her head towards the big toe flexing that foot holding I feel so good and terrible at the same time I love it the great thing with stretching is the more you do it go to bed it's like work towards it's like anything else you're totally farther in three okay very very good so just remove it speeds up and we're going to go into a green legged dog open that HIPAA does it feel so good okay so hand's underneath the shoulders lifting up into the three-legged dog extending that leg open your hip a little bit to keep your shoulders nice and square and then bend the knee for me and press the toes away from your body Oh fill in those calves fill in that back eyes on the big toe and now we're get down onto your elbow we feel a little bit weird right okay good just one elbow hold it three two one lift yourself back up it's ten and bring it down okay we're going to switch on to the other side three legged dog open up bend the knees pressing the toes away from your body keeping the hips aligned keeping the shoulders square and then bring one elbow down and continue to live [Applause] three two one bring it up and bring it down onto the knees and into Child's Pose inhale through your nose exhale through your mouth and slowly bring yourself up okay guys this is the exciting part we're going to come into your splits now if you feel like you're not ready for this no worries to go down as low as you can in fact if you have to go the blocks here be awesome for yet to hold on to that if you don't do your best go as low as you can okay so placing my hands outside my legs what I'm going to do it's crawl to myself up just like so I'm going to slowly slide forward now if you're just right here that's fun you need to hold on to something that's cool or if you want to do a half split like this that's good too until you get a little bit more flexible so pressing the ball of my foot with the back leg I'm going to reach my front foot forward and then I'm going to relax my toes down to the floor now for me I'm still trying to work on keeping my hips super square I feel like there's still a little bit open but I'm working towards it basically what you don't want to do is come into a split where you're like kind of like that really ugly we want to keep everything facing this way and even if that means you can't get that low it's okay if you're doing it right so settle yourself down and don't tickle your foot in the back and hold in helping no one suppose exhale to the mouth if you can reach it forward you can go into a half split here which we did earlier if you would like holes and I actually like to roll around like this make sure I'm really getting flexible in all areas of my legs bring it on to the hand and lift it back up oh okay you got very pretty other side now I did my good leg first so let's see how I do on the left leg come on not impossible but my semi injured hamstring leg okay so hands on the side we are going to correct the ball the foot back and let this print like slide little by little as you can see this leg is a lot thicker than the other one and let's see how far again let's see how far I get and it's going to take time I've been running a lot so my hamstrings I've been getting SuperDuper tied I'm still stretching them every day to make sure I don't lose my flexibility okay just slowly put myself down extend my toes and allow myself to submit okay not not terrible but I can tell I'm not as square as my other side that's okay and worked towards it good roll side to side like the ariana grande song but we all know what that was about unfortunately okay really high and lengthening a little bit more can week and then reaching board into a single like a tie clip hike holding between your head towards your toes always and rolling this a little bit moment we can't do it so tight three two one okay hold it up and bring it back oh good okay guys in the spirit of the beach and the ocean and dolphins and filled with sandpipers and everything that I got to see on this beautiful journey of the six week body filming we're gonna end with the mermaid okay so I want you to come into my own position like so and what you simply reach over and then using your obliques and we'll put up your arms press up and stretch do more I'll

[Music] hey guys Cassey here it has been such a long time since we did a sequence video so just start it off I'm doing something a little bit different today I'm going to take you how to meal prep I do it myself because it helps save me time and money and keeps me on track for the rest of the week and I know a lot of Fitness people that like doing this too but it can get a little bit overwhelming so I'm going to show you five different recipes and they are all 28-day reset friendly for you to do and choose from for the entire week make sure you have some Tupperware laying around you're going to want to fill them up and prepare them to put into the fridge but you can just grab and go when you're headed to work or school or if you have no time and for those of you who haven't tried the 2080 reset if the 20 day program for you to figure out what your food intolerances are it's not a diet it's not a weight loss plan it's extremely healthy we're taking out dairy gluten added sugar processed foods and alcohol don't have any of that for 28 days and you'll see your face start to clear up I know mine did because I took out the dairy and a lot of people actually lost anywhere between 5 to 25 pounds in 20 days which is crazy to me okay are you guys ready let's go ahead and get started so guys all today's recipes are based around ground turkey so make sure you have some of that laying around and to prepare it you just need to add your ground turkey to some coconut oil along with garlic salt and pepper garlic seasoning and saute it up until it's ready and then you can keep it in a nice little Bowl for all of these recipes okay our bread recipe is parking in green beans so just take your green beans and lay them out nicely on the sill pack or your baking tray sesame oil drizzle all pull the coated and then you're going to add some salt and pepper and then just massage it with your hands I love massages I need them every day but I don't get them every day in asking for X write them all out so you all get even treatment from the oven make sure the other set on broil and then we're just going to stick these babies in the green beans look so good we are going to do a little bit of a mix around here and a throw it on top of some spinach and you're ready to go and remember if you make this for the entire week this times everything by 5 some sesame oil in the pan garlic and we shall reintroduce the meat because we want it to really take up the flavors of what about to add in some coconut aminos and some rice vinegar and if you're feeling a little bit spicy add a little bit of hot sauce just make sure that your hot tub doesn't have any added sugars and you really only do this for like 1 or 2 minutes looks like we are done so I'm going to turn that off I have my cute little pink pepper we're here we're going to first put a bed of spinach on the bottom it's like Sunday and you need us to eat on Friday you probably want to saute this it doesn't feel and taste all weird you couldn't be done but I'm going to add one more thing some green onions [Music] hmm I would eat this entire thing right now but we have four more recipes to go [Music] now we're on to recipe number two this is Asian lettuce wrap so good so it could not be any easier just grab your ground turkey place it in a bowl some drippy piece oh my gosh okay we're going to keep going so rice vinegar coconut aminos okay and we got some scallion and carrots and some red bell pepper some pepper and a little bit of studio and now you're going to grab your Tupperware and just place on here as you could go now this is going to be a part of a taco so I'm using butter lettuce as my shell and you're going to keep that in a ziplock bag of some sort to make sure that it doesn't get soggy ready to go and lasts all week long top it all off we had some crispy [Music] mmm-maybe my most favorite thing that I've ever made on SHINee's so good for lunch or dinner or whatever okay now odds recipe number three so now I'm going to show you a really easy breakfast recipe to this cult Turkey and egg and you just want to take some cooking oil spray your pan we're just going to do a sunny-side up egg oh my gosh I'm telling you I have slippies fingers today okay let's try that again [Music] I'm going to add my ground turkey in tomato's aware make sure the marinara buy doesn't have lots of crazy preservatives check the ingredients if I really need this right now I probably microwave it or give it a little stir on the frying pan but if you were doing this as a new slab cold is totally fine or they meet sorts egg on top beautiful [Music] absolutely good cold imagine that hot pie feels like a shot sugar some sort all right guys onto recipe number four now we're going to make noodles spaghetti so basically all you need is a zucchini and if you've never made doodles before super easy make sure you have a spire light there's an even keel if you're going to stick this guy into this torture device to do things scoot him into this bowl all you do is you crank away so you end up with a bowl just like this full of zoodles this one isn't microwave or sauteed but remember you can totally do that if you would like to I am just going to add some marinara sauce and it's like a turkey on top that could be done here but make it a little bit more interesting and add a little bit of nutritional yeast so you can get this at your local health store like a Whole Foods or something like that or online adds a nice easy flavor but there's absolutely no dairy and we're done I mean look at some point it's very savory and you don't even feel like you're missing any text pasta because if you really give you that carve you feel all right guys on to the last recipe want to know a really cool way to seamlessly potatoes super quick all you have to do is stab your sweet potato with a fork and then wrap it in its little mummified casing of a wet paper towel then put in the microwave for about five minutes nice and soft now guys if you're eating one potato at a time microwave is totally good but if you're doing a bunch for the entire week then bake it it's going to save you a lot of time I'm going to do a nice little incision down the center will open heart surgery right here and I'm also going to mash up accenture a little bit just so it'll be more like a bowl so now I want to take your turkey and add the salsa into the Turk now that everybody's all coated in place them inside as much as you would like if you have any to go guacamole on like that go ahead and bring that along but if you're prepping ahead you don't want it to turn all brown and disgusting so just add that later we have some green onions I'm talking about pepper and some cilantro so I did this DNA test and I found out that the reason why I don't like arugula or chocolate or coffee is because I actually do have high sensitivity to bitter foods the reason why is plant reminded me of this because there's some people to take cilantro and all a piece of soap I don't have that I love cilantro but now I know so if you ever have a chance take a DNA test really interesting shows you a lot of whole interesting facts about yourself so good it tastes like I am at ICS the right now and guys can totally microwave the whole entire thing and you're good to go [Music] so those are your five 28-day reset meal prep recipes as you can see they are so easy to make they're super affordable and easy to make at one time so you're good for the rest of the week I really like no prep on Sunday so that on Monday and starting fresh and you don't even have to prep for all seven days prep for just three or five or something like that and see how it makes you feel you don't even have to do every single meal so but we get your lunches in check also guys I'm so excited to tell you that I am in Lindsey Stirling's new music video it's like the first music video I've ever been in and so excited to

hey guys Cassey here today I have a very special guest on we're going to have some real talk with one of my favorite youtubers and really good friends bethany mota I'm so excited that you're here thanks for having me this place is so pretty I love it oh my gosh thank you I decorated just for you I mean everything is from Urban Outfitters home goods and John in Maine I'm obsessed with this dro oh yes I'm destitute I kind of we plug these on you tomorrow it's worth it it's worth it definitely is all about positivity she's such a role model to so many young girls out there and you know I wanted to get together today and help everyone watching deal with their confidence everybody has issues is confidence but even me now I don't rely so much on opinions of other people or people making me feel good you have the control over how you feel and I think that's the most empowering thing that all this can learn so today we're going to share with you 10 tips on how you can boost your self-confidence some of them are real easy things you can implement right away and something's going to take work we'll start with some of the easier ones look you guys do it our first tip is to fit taller there you go that's what we did I'm like half a second fit it it is proven that when you sit taller and you're not slouching not only do you feel more confident side but others perceive you as more confident so people treat you differently the comeback years ago I noticed I was always loved so yeah this is a very defeated oh it is you know like if you're feeling just you're not up and you're not open if you're in a social setting someone may not want to come up to you because this is kind of closed off right right you're open and you're like showing people that you're confident and right talk like you're more open socializing is people feeling comfortable to come up and speak with you exactly it's more inviting right exercise I recently started exercising a lot more and it genuinely feels so good although I think because now I exercise for a different reason I feel yeah past I used to exercise because oh my gosh I need to lose weight I need to look like this because society tells me that I need look like that whereas now I work out because I want to take care of my body I just feel like you speak from exercise enlightenment because so many people get stuck on the vanity of it right and I'm guilty of that I'm sure a lot of people like I want six-pack abs or I want this type of booty and like that fine but it's not going to last you for the long run because it's all about how you feel number three listen to your favorite song I love this one anytime that I need a new food aha so I put on my favorite music and I dance in front of my mirror and then it just changes my total like mental state I don't think you need to be a good dancer or not only of that just like feel the music and just have a good time well you were amazing on Dancing with the Stars let me tell you that was really cool that's like my dream too to be able to dance with Derek Hough like whoa those really cool I was really cool and I wear all those sequined dresses like that a Centurion was fun I did some research and I found out that when you listen to music that has more bass in it it actually makes you feel more powerful uh-huh you know like looking to hardcore wrath and that do you ever do that yeah I need you to kind of feel like oh yeah number four compliment yourself one of my ways that I like to do this is I kind of like to focus on the things that I may not see as perfect or like the imperfection yeah I have those are the things that I really like to admire about myself and learn to genuinely love and appreciate so can I dig a little bit deeper what's like that things that you're not confident about you're so beautiful and you appear so confident but I know we all have some insecurities when I was a lot younger I used to hate my dimples really absolutely his while they were different like they hurt they didn't look like most people that I knew then over time I realized this is unique and I should love this and be grateful that I have you know the feature I know sometimes it's getting hard to look at yourself in the mirror and see all these flaws but the truth is the flaws make you who you are I think we shouldn't be so critical of ourselves to the point where it hurts my self-esteem I think we really create our own unhappiness because we have our control over that feeling on that same line I want you to compliment other people because if you are a confident person you're willing to give and tell people how beautiful they are how amazing are instead of feeling like jealous and little I think also if you find yourself having those soft stores other people that may be negative you have to even though it's hard kind of look within yourself and say why am I thinking this negative thought about that person why am I feeling jealousy and miss it you're feeling that because more than likely it's something that you feel insecure about which is totally normal and totally okay but there's no reason to take it out on someone else when you genuinely appreciate something about someone and you let them know seeing how happy that makes them and how excited they are to hear that also then make you happy and excited for me I actually find more joy in giving people gifts and receiving them and I feel like helping in our form as a verbal gift and so I say we all give at least one gift today to somebody even if you don't eat if you don't know them surround yourself with positive people this one is so important yes it is because if you have negative people around you they're going to suck the energy out of you and then make you feel like you're not worth that much I mean I've had friends of or friends before who would give me backhanded compliment or people who literally would want to see me fail for whatever reason I do believe the Cubs are placed in security but you don't need to be around that because you can choose your friends and choose people who support you and what you're doing that's so so much better I just love surrounding myself with people who are passionate about life and passionate about whatever it is what they're doing because that encourages me like I want to work harder yeah it'd be more passion sometimes you may not realize that someone so close to you can be toxic do you know that the five people closer to you are reflection of who you are here that before that yes and it's so true so if you want to be more positive if you want to do better in business if you want to be more of a leader just surround yourself with people who are like what you want to be and then you're going to get there visualize what you want whenever I there's something that I want to achieve what I do I just write it down over and over again I don't want to get vision board off I'll have a notebook and I literally write down like the same goal over and over again I think it's just a repetition of a constant running through my mind because whatever you focus on is where your step for all of your attention goes yeah if you're going to work for I like the writing down thing because it is the first step in going towards your goal because it's making it very real it's not just some thought that's floating around in your head in your heart to turn a dream into a goal you got to start planning it out I love having journals I love writing everything down that I need to do for the day because that feeling of checking it off oh it is everything it's because I I want a deal with your failures this one is something I've learned so much about in the past few years yeah I genuinely cassell yer as an opportunity to grow and yes yes I used to see failure as oh my gosh I think I was like I did it wrong but anytime I've ever failed or experienced pain in some way in the challenging experience it's always had for some reason a beautiful result like I was cyber bullied and then I got into you too if you can see the zillions and take yourself up from that fall that's the entire learning experience it's this incredible feeling because you're like I'm not standing still anymore yeah I'm okay with failing again yeah and I understand that it's going to happen and it happens to everybody and I'm willing to take it practice so if you feel like you kind of stuck up something there's two ways to deal with it first you could sit there and feel really bad and like not ever want to do it again or you can admit to yourself that hey I'm actually not that great but I'm going to practice on making it better public speaking with something you could terrified me in a lot like in elementary school do you remember like holding like little no cards and like going up in front of the class I don't know if you did that and like doing a speech baseball cards okay so I did that and every time I went up to the room my hands was literally shake like this you could see it and so I remembered heading into middle school I was liking what I need to get over the fear of public speaking so I'm going to join a speech club and every day they would force you to go up and respond to talk about something random like even like shaving your legs or something right and then eventually after years being at speech class I won the oratory category at my entire school I love that story so what I love about that is just that it's very clear that you were determined yeah and you didn't say I'm I'm capable of doing that like I'm just not meant to do that if there's something that you're thinking about and it scares you it's probably scaring you make you nervous because you care about it yeah and that's the only way that you're going to grow in life is doing things that actually means something because if you're just over here doing things that are safe you're not going to learn as much about yourself you're not going to grow as much exactly and we have this one life to live I say take all the risk I mean like to be safe a little bit like tell yourself but but like be adventurous this is your movie this is your store you can make it play out however you want my Miley does makes me feel so good if I draw all the time you know I don't even smile when I cry it's so weird why I know I find that whenever also if I'm in not so great in the mood and I would like start smiling or talk to somebody and have a positive conversation it just shifts my mood it shifts my mindset it's same with the posture thing and kind of like tricking your body is when you're like this all the time and you're always moving a megahertz you get comfortable doing that so you just go straight to it without thinking if you're having trouble feeling like what's going to make me smile everything sucks well think about how grateful you are to be alive think about the amazing things that you've done even if it's like something really small like oh I opened the door for an old lady today when I went out of grocery store like that's a really awesome screen I'm act of kindness like think about the little things and let them penetrate inside you and let yourself be half for that I think the more you're grateful for things the more you can generally be happy with let's kill so I have a body I have legs that I can walk on in eyes that I can see with and an experience things through how can I be so hard on myself about these little things and how dare I be so insecure about the yeah I mean little thing when I have so much to be grateful for its when you think of it that way it's like what was I doing I know seriously yeah seriously and if you're watching this video right now you probably have a phone or you have a computer so that's awesome okay those are 10 tips for boosting your self-confidence I hope you guys felt at least one of these could apply to your life and I want you all to go smile right now even if you want to comment a happy face emoji like that's step one right also bethany you're coming out with a new book right I got to tell us a little bit about it I'm so excited I worked on my book to make

hey guys Cassey here and welcome to my bedroom I'm so excited because today I'm going to show you my favorite bedtime stretching sequence now the night is always the best time to stretch because you are the most flexible because you've been mobile all day you've been sitting in a chair you got up you watch you drove a car whatever your muscles were moving so you're more likely to be bendy at night which makes it a lot easier and a little bit more fun when you're trying to stretch out your muscles now if you guys feel like stretching is boring and it takes too much time a trick watch your favorite TV show or your favorite YouTube videos while you're stretching in time just wise you don't even know what's going on so guys I want you to play this video do the stretching sequence with me and get ready to calm yourself and relax yourself for bed ready let's go okay so hopefully you are on your bed and I'm going to start out by stretching out your arms so go ahead and bring one arm over across your body inhale through your nose exhale through well I want to light a candle or something make this your time your time to really spend time with yourself yeah good and drop a shoulder really gonna stretch right here through the upper arm and go ahead and switch and press that shoulder down good stuff just relaxing in bed I'm gonna take on above bring it behind go ahead and sway side to side good step and reach over and hold bending and bring that out switch arms stretching out that tricep swing side to side good stuff and we reach over to one side feeling the lats now very good point three and okay now go ahead and bring one leg forward and cross your knee over the underneath and then we just go to pretzel twist it just like so allow you back to truly release low back very good inhale and feet whore nice let's get the other side okay switching legs and twist hold if you really push hard enough you feel your seats as well to do it right now looking over your shoulder hey now let's get into some leg step I want you to bring your legs forward just like so and reach for your toes of course all of us are at different flexibility levels and don't feel bad if you're right here if you've got to bend your knees a little bit what I want you to do is try to keep your legs straight press the bathroom knees into the bed and then flatten your back if that means you can only go right here that's okay but you're going to get better okay hold it hold on to your ankles hold on to your feet your toes point inhale exhale okay wiggle your butt around because the more you do that give some space underneath you can actually bend a little this is hamstrings hello if you can sing a lot at work or at school this is you killed it okay now we're gonna get to four guys inhale exhale bring it and you just want to hold right there and hold as low as you can breathe you'll get through this I promise and three two one whoo okay let's make it a little bit more intense I'm via flex your feet this time grab onto the backs of your the balls of your feet if you can if you can't hold on right here what I want you to do is try to lift the heels off the bed and flatten the back who calf stretc mania now continue holding and drop the elbows onto the shin oh my gosh right it's so good because a great timing basically did mobile stretching all day long extend the arms benda extend the arms then two more times extend and Bend x10 whoo very good okay now I want you to straddle for me as wide as you can okay and you're going to flex the feet point the toes flex the feet point the toes by the way I'm working on my toe point I put my feet in this like ballet stretching thing almost every night it's so much but trying to really improve my toe point just because I think it's pretty I want to do it okay now point and hold now I want you to reach forward once again trying to keep that back flat okay inhale exhales come a little lower inhale exhale come a little lower I'm holding on to the edge of my bed now to help me pull myself forward or press the knees into the bed point the toes really feel your inner thigh back out okay here's a trick to if you want to get lower take your hand and pull your thigh like up a little bit pull the thigh up on each side kind of like right outside your butt and then then allow you to get even lower hold good inhale good and slowly lift yourself up so good okay keep it there keep it there I want you to take this hand place it underneath your thigh okay now reach over and grab on to your toes if you can if you cannot stay right here okay the more you do this video the better you're going to get now my shoulder is right here on my inner thigh just a few inches above my knee I'm going to really dig it down there so that when I open my and my obliques are getting the full stretch your eyes want to reach the ceiling hold good I try to bring that elbow up three two one release oh this feels so good okay other side bring the hand underneath flex the feet little by little you grab the toes ground ball your feet the foot and look up hold we're really getting an amazing amazing hansung stretch inhale exhale play something lower whoa okay guys now let's go ahead and get our hip flexors okay so I want you to go it just hurt myself crap crazy okay so I want you to bring your opposite ankle over your opposite knee you see that and then I want you to align the heel with the knee on the bottom alright this is really going to open up those hip flexors press this knee down oh my gosh okay and the more these two are aligned the harder it's going to be so don't just sit regular Indian style really bring this bottom foot out so that it is aligning with me now easy way to push me down this to just put your head and toe super red like that push it down push it down good hold and you can close your eyes and don't let your muscles resist because a lot of times we don't allow ourselves to be flexible we hold back and lift up very good sir size right here opposite ankle over opposite knee pulling this leg out and making sure that they are parallel or as close to parallel as possible and as you can see this side for me is not as flexible as my other side and I already know that because my left hamstring is looked injured and our bodies aren't the same so it's okay all right now I'm just going to put some pressure on it we should dip and light little pushes are totally okay just a little bit of time and if you're ready for it can even have bend for like this hold for three two one so so good okay finally we're gonna stretch out those legs of yours and what I want you to do is to lay down just like so on your bed which is what you would normally do they want you to bring your right leg into your chest okay grabbing behind that leg your lift up try to keep this leg straight wait feel the hamstring stretch point your toes inhale on the exhale pull that leg in just a little bit at a time so you just lay in bed yeah good fun and inhale exhale pull it nice and look it may hurt and you make me shaking so good to be stretched out inhale exhale pull it in yep keeping those hips we're in three two one nice okay other side grab behind the ankle near cap lift up the toes keeping everything nice and straight to the ceiling inhale exhale Oh already feeling it and because my hamstring is a little bit injured I like to do this to loosen up the muscles loosen up the tendons inside the ligaments inhale exhale bring it in good you just got to be patient with your body stretching is live those things that you cannot rush in fact if you rush you will get injured so take your time listen to your body yeah great inhale he knows Mexico oh really so good finally we're going to end with our happy baby so bring your life up like so with your middle finger pin around your big toe just like that and much really like it in Little Rock side to side if you are

[Music] hey guys Cassey here and welcome to the final video in your body coding bootcamp we made it through six weeks and I'm going to reward you with something absolutely amazing today we are doing a total body stretch in front of the ocean and I want you to really just listen to the sounds of the beach and imagine that you're here with me relaxing and giving your body what it truly deserved so I would be opening up your sack your chest your legs and maybe getting you ready for some splits so it's gonna be fun and remember we're stretching it's going to take time so if you feel like some of the moves are a little bit too much no worries to decrease your range of motion so let's start out in a Down Dog something we're really familiar with both hands underneath the shoulders palms wide bring through the balls of your feet into the mat and I'll lift up those hips press the heels into the mat try to flatten them down and bring your eyes towards your toes looking right to your legs Oh breathe in through your nose out through your mouth now let's go ahead and walk that dog pressing one heel into the mat at a time listening to the wave beautiful tippy toes and heels press planned that back beautiful now bring yourself into an up dog right here hole rolling with those shoulders steps allowing the test to open lift up we're going to go into a dancing dog now switching between your dog and your down dog taking your time smiling through the entire flow feeling good feeling so fortunate that we get to stretch together today and right here flip open shoulders rolling back and go ahead and drop the knees drop the toes and press yourself back into Child's Pose inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth now we're going to open up your chest okay so we're to get down onto the mat I want you to lay yourself down now bring your arms until goalpost position just like this and lay your cheek on the floor so you're going to lift up one leg and press it back you should feel your shoulders opening up to feel your chest and just hold breathe in through your nose out through your mouth opening up that knee and go ahead and bring it back switch opening it up keeping those arms in about 90 degrees goalpost position hold we're just going to get us ready for the next illusion good three two two one go ahead and press it down four hat now ready to get into a position that will be quite challenging but just go to your limits all right so what I want you to do keep those knees hip-width apart we're going to lean back so of course this depends a lot of your back strength and flexibility just go as far as you can instead of just you know throwing yourself back imagine you're lifting your heart towards the sky and let that extend you okay it's hard for me to talk when I'm all the way back so what I want you do when you're back there make sure you're pushing your pelvis forward okay here we go lift lift let's bring those arms back onto the heels press your hips forward inhales the nose exhale through the mouth oh let the test more more MORE in theory yes and bring yourself back up okay let's get that back feeling normal again so press the upper back into the sky hold it and then press the booty up into the sky slowly couple more times and one more [Applause] [Music] okay now since we're here we're gonna get those legs you guys worked a lot of legs throughout his entire body planning booty so I am going to ask you to roll your mat up a couple times for any question as we're going to stretch your your inner thighs as well as your philosophy so lunge for now the thing here is I don't want you to completely just let go and do this keep this nice and square fact I'm feeling a lot of my quads and my butt right now with just pressing my pelvis it's such a tiny thing I wish I could be in your room right now like adjusting you but try not to put all your weight forward resist and you will feel all the stretch right here okay hold that keep it square hips square I don't want it I want to see any of it in space square looking forward beautiful and then now you lean everything now give me everything you got flatten the toes hold really feel in that groin stretch yeah that feels good okay now the next one's a little bit hard we're going to get your quads because after we do both sides we're going to get into some splits and this isn't just on hamstrings with a pair of legs I need you get your quads so place your hand down right here grab with the opposite hand on yourself and look so cool here for a second first and see how we are okay you might feel a little bit of pulling in your quads in your groin in fact you may not even be able to touch enough okay you can do this for me just do the best that you can 10 now we're not just going to hold we're going to tap heel to butt woo feel in my quad heel too but giving you some rest in between okay so it's really hard to just hold something that's super painful just take it a little bit at a time just like that okay now we're going to hold you ready all right and hold whoo breathe five four three two really Wow okay since we're here extend that leg flex the foot links in the tip of your head towards your toe this is for handlers and make sure your leg is directly in front of your hip not to the side and that hamstring in there good and try to plot your back and lift it up okay guys we're repeating on the other side and then we're going to get into split so leg forward lunge with resistance feeling your quads and your glutes right here without just throwing everything away okay you're standing tall lunging tall actually like you're about to propose to somebody this like this hold squeezing hips are square remember we're not opening out this stays at 90 and then we let it go full things right they're dropping the toes to the floor [Applause] nice line right here holding holding feels really good now let's get those quads screen the hand down opposite hand opposite foot and you may find that one size more flexible in the other which is totally normal you'll discover what side that's gonna be alright guys ready pushing in crap really can't really be there painful tap release they're really not my favorite thing to do but I know I'm use them so we forget to do it with you couple more cap release one born then we hold okay you ready besides harder for me I can already tell and three two hold relax breathe in through your nose exhale your mouth give me five four ah man that's crazy okay and then we press back heel into the mask they assured straight out from your hips and extend okay today the left hamstring is right we're reaching her head towards the big toe flexing that foot holding I feel so good and terrible at the same time I love it the great thing with stretching is the more you do it go to bed it's like work towards it's like anything else you're totally farther in three okay very very good so just remove it speeds up and we're going to go into a green legged dog open that HIPAA does it feel so good okay so hand's underneath the shoulders lifting up into the three-legged dog extending that leg open your hip a little bit to keep your shoulders nice and square and then bend the knee for me and press the toes away from your body Oh fill in those calves fill in that back eyes on the big toe and now we're get down onto your elbow we feel a little bit weird right okay good just one elbow hold it three two one lift yourself back up it's ten and bring it down okay we're going to switch on to the other side three legged dog open up bend the knees pressing the toes away from your body keeping the hips aligned keeping the shoulders square and then bring one elbow down and continue to live [Applause] three two one bring it up and bring it down onto the knees and into Child's Pose inhale through your nose exhale through your mouth and slowly bring yourself up okay guys this is the exciting part we're going to come into your splits now if you feel like you're not ready for this no worries to go down as low as you can in fact if you have to go the blocks here be awesome for yet to hold on to that if you don't do your best go as low as you can okay so placing my hands outside my legs what I'm going to do it's crawl to myself up just like so I'm going to slowly slide forward now if you're just right here that's fun you need to hold on to something that's cool or if you want to do a half split like this that's good too until you get a little bit more flexible so pressing the ball of my foot with the back leg I'm going to reach my front foot forward and then I'm going to relax my toes down to the floor now for me I'm still trying to work on keeping my hips super square I feel like there's still a little bit open but I'm working towards it basically what you don't want to do is come into a split where you're like kind of like that really ugly we want to keep everything facing this way and even if that means you can't get that low it's okay if you're doing it right so settle yourself down and don't tickle your foot in the back and hold in helping no one suppose exhale to the mouth if you can reach it forward you can go into a half split here which we did earlier if you would like holes and I actually like to roll around like this make sure I'm really getting flexible in all areas of my legs bring it on to the hand and lift it back up oh okay you got very pretty other side now I did my good leg first so let's see how I do on the left leg come on not impossible but my semi injured hamstring leg okay so hands on the side we are going to correct the ball the foot back and let this print like slide little by little as you can see this leg is a lot thicker than the other one and let's see how far again let's see how far I get and it's going to take time I've been running a lot so my hamstrings I've been getting SuperDuper tied I'm still stretching them every day to make sure I don't lose my flexibility okay just slowly put myself down extend my toes and allow myself to submit okay not not terrible but I can tell I'm not as square as my other side that's okay and worked towards it good roll side to side like the ariana grande song but we all know what that was about unfortunately okay really high and lengthening a little bit more can week and then reaching board into a single like a tie clip hike holding between your head towards your toes always and rolling this a little bit moment we can't do it so tight three two one okay hold it up and bring it back oh good okay guys in the spirit of the beach and the ocean and dolphins and filled with sandpipers and everything that I got to see on this beautiful journey of the six week body filming we're gonna end with the mermaid okay so I want you to come into my own position like so and what you simply reach over and then using your obliques and we'll put up your arms press up and stretch do more I'll switch on to the other side lift this should really calm you she feels really good [Music] nothing both hands behind you like together mermaids quick it's not pretty okay three I'm coming down squeezing lifting stretching sighs [Music] and one more [Music] [Applause] bring your arms down and give yourself a cute round of applause guys we have completed be a six-week body toning bootcamp I'm so proud of you for joining me on this entire journey and if this is the first video you've seen of the boot camp go ahead and go back start from day one and make sure you do all six of my videos to complete the six food challenge as long as you have done each video in its entirety once which most of them say do it four times you get a 28 minute workout think you're good and we are ready for summer and I'm not talking about having a bikini body having a summer ready body having a peach body I'm talking about how do the contents rock whatever the heck you want and feeling strong about it okay so I love you so much and I will be in it [Music] you [Music] 
hey guys my sister Chaplin is finally here I mean I did make it she's officially a Los Angeles or residence my idea about a semi-official like you here yeah it's gonna happy that you're here guys we've been taking workout classes together yeah I mean cooking dinner together I've been cooking you've been eating the same thing yes he talked about weddings every single night but today we're here to do a lower back stretching workout so lots of you a little back pain and if it's major you should probably get it checked out chronic low back pain this is not for you but if you have like day to day if you sit too much stand to imagine it's just it's a little bit funky this is what you do yeah I think a lot of times we're stuck at our desk and even when we're not we're stuck looking at our phones and so you're just kind of hunched over all the time maybe the number one thing I hear complaints about is my lower back hurts I mean me included after go get massages all the time okay so the first thing that causes low back pain can be weak abdominals so if you have an imbalance between your lower back and your front of your body it's gonna start not feeling too good and that's what's happening the second one is tight glutes so we're going to tap into that today as well and then the last thing we're gonna do is just stretch out the lower back because yeah sometimes you're just gonna target the site but at the same time sometimes other muscles are causing that pain that's why you can't have to experiment and see what's going on I loved that I was so excited so guys if you have any back issues or really want to just de-stress for the holidays this is the perfect video for you all right let's get started okay so the first with his child's pose so you can come to the bathroom your Mac needs are either together or out why it's totally up to you and once you're ready reach those fingertips for to the top of your mat and the wonderful I had relaxed on the ground you know what I think of when I put my forehead on the mat waiting up about how dirty you could be and if I may get pimples you look relaxed when you try to actively press your hips back and reach your fingertips forward so you have a nice stretch coming to the low back take about two more really deep breaths right here it relax into it sometimes we hold back when things are hard but this is the time to let go okay thank you look good good we're gonna die early come all the way back up and again if you want to hold that longer if that is totally fine just press pause and then come back when you're ready our next pose here is called rabbit suppose I don't know why but it feels really good it for the upper back so wanna make sure we're targeting a lot of things to find out by the sight of the low back pain starts right so for rabbit goes all you gonna do is lower from your seated position and let your belly come onto your thigh and then you move to on the top of your head to cover the ground not your forehead so no forehead tuck that you put that right down to the ground grab onto the field and then gently lift all the way up until you feel a nice stretch through the upper back you really want to make sure while you're there you're not loading the neck and you're not going too much weight there the hands just a balancer and as you can see Casa looks super good here do you feel it right here yeah it's so good yeah that's good she looks great and then just breathe breathing is good I know low back pain is so annoying you know I like breathing because it makes me it in a form in a way it kind of meditative like I feel like you're focusing on backsies bet your body can really just relax yeah oh good good one more deep breath right here and then when you exhale lower back down in to your seated position good little ways out and then we're going to go ahead and flip on to the other side where you can get your back all right so right here we're just going to go ahead and stretch out the lower back a little bit more a little bit more you're gonna have the knees into your chest this is called rolling like a ball I know that one and you know other way to roll and gently rock yourself all the way back down with your corn and turn all the way back up today a gentle rock and then right back up so do a couple these whatever feels good if this hurts because you have a really like painful surface just the floatable mats right right right totally okay alright one more rock and then hold it up to your balance this is where the core where it comes in its gonna lift those legs out this is called our book put his arms can come out to the side good make sure those shoulders are squeezed back together and you pretend you have like I'm on a grapefruit right here Oh grapefruit okay good size I like pomelos pomelo they're so good smells are Greek roots right are they right and they're big truth yeah yeah okay yellow Bigfoot's yeah with yellow inside yeah yeah because if you don't you do like golf ball oh you can't be a tangerine cute no wait cuties are tangerine today so if you want a little bit more gonna have some more crap so maybe straighten one leg whoo ah good keep balancing keep breathing Steve meditated let's switch legs good see where he learned this lower back pain as we go now if you want the ultimate go ahead certain both legs at either Cathy's favorite move well told it her fourth three shoes I get it when I were dating and one good job oh man thanks nice work now in a row long turret back so another really did one is when you can add some twisting movements that also really relieves the pain it's just imaginary spy it's kind of just gently moving away from each other and it's opening space into those muscles all right let's do it this one's easy if you do it all the time okay I'm gonna roll back onto that and hug the right knee to the chest extend the left leg out and all you do is cross the right knee over his body and then right arm comes out and if you can't really push your right thigh down actively push and then possibly reach your right fingertips to the back of the room wherever you are I thought when you're actively helping yourself stretch deeper I feel it so much right here my glutes - it feels so good it's either all connected as muscles are all related so so good one more breath are your life I'm alive I am just finding bliss in this moment let's go ahead and bring it back to the center let me come in right lengthens up do a nice little hug first hug your own ink and then go ahead and twist to the other side again think about active stretching so it's kind of just plopping and laying there you want to push those fingers out and press that side down and now we're going to feel real good I just got a back crack oh that's so good keep breathing inhaling and hammering okay this stay right there guys if you have a friend at home and we want to help get this deeper stretch all you're going to do is just take one hand place it like in their booty area so make sure it's pretty good friend and they're gonna take the other hand place it on a shoulder just like gently add the twist don't go crazy cuz you're gonna hurt them oh that's good stuff legit okay sometimes the smallest assists from friends will make the biggest difference in your stretch be good yeah awesome come back towards the center hug your knee into your chest and then roll back up to a seated position okay like taller taller okay so now we're gonna dig into the gluteal the gluteal okay so we're gonna take our ankle and put it on top of our knee and then it's our knee on top of the ankle okay I think I have a like a triangle thing here going onto the legs make sure shins try to beat your parallel yeah yes I love this move really really good if you are super tight and you find space like let's say someone has space there feel free to put a block here or pillow even like a pillow put it there and just fill up that space well I like to just push down on it go hard go hard because that's how I roll go hard so this is good enough which I feel like you want more right like we always want more just going to curl more tips forward and stretch oh man oh yeah this is real good very very good they're gonna hold here and breathe good and Cass that's awesome but again remember if you have a friend at home who can assist you hold at the base of their low back and just kind of gently press them forward does that feel okay good nice and just keep breathing good I want to do it - it looks so juicy she offers you - okay we wanted to the next one okay okay okay we'll finish this one okay what - you were dressed we can do more bread okay juicy delicious once we're ready you pay I'll start off here then I'll come get you okay we're even I'm scared Cassie it's just hard no I actually am just too intense okay ready enjoy right we're crawling whoo the sides tired yeah I mean - no oh my gosh oh my god yeah you know it's crazy it's just health related all these muscles are like we're yes we're not stretching the low backs per se right now but this like opens up the gate it's crazy we go push you down tear down okay okay right here yeah in help you know exhale release stretching those fingers long nine and go for it another push okay ready you got five four three two really get feasel oh yeah oh good yeah and then the final line is if you're already in this pose we're not in just a quick little twist you want to do that yeah we're gonna pretend like you never got that okay because the twisting is also super super good to relieve that pain so one hand comes behind you one hand comes to the outer of the thigh and then just push push push yeah right back in and then switch other side push push push I want to get it crack but I think I max okay today I know I get sad when all the cracks are gone I know the business lay on bed I'm like ah crack I wouldn't really recommend that it's just a Christopher yeah yeah so those are the basic things you got to do if you want to stretch out that lower back and then you can maybe try to do one of these throughout the day maybe do one in the morning then try again at night if you don't have a lot of time it's all good yeah thank you so much for leading these stretches I really do feel more relaxed and I'm just really happy that you're here because I'm gonna do workout videos together and we can give this video a thumbs up if you made it through and I just want to say I love you so much and thank you for joining us [Music] 
hey guys Cassey here so we have finally made it to August I always get a ton of questions for you guys about how to stay fit and healthy in school to get good grades you actually do need to take care of your health I'm talking about your mental health your emotional health your physical health and so today I'm going to share with you a few ways to stay fit and healthy in school without too much extra work also also guys I'm going to share with you our very first 2017-2018 focus journal which is a sickness planner for students and teachers and professionals and I'm gonna be doing giveaway at the end there's going to be a ton of stuff so make sure you guys subscribe and leave a comment down below letting me know if you are a lefty or a right okay on to the video number one I think a lot of times I find myself not being able to concentrate because I'm thirsty or I'm hungry so the best way to settle that is to carry around with you a reusable water bottle I always have a water bottle with me on my desk on my nightstand I bring with me into the car at the workouts if you want to concentrate in school you want stay fit stay healthy it begins with staying hydrated a lot of times we feel like we're hungry but the truth is were actually really thirsty so keep this by your size sip it during your lectures have it with you at lunch everywhere and that will be the beginning of being super focused and concentrated number two make working out easy for you and that means if you don't want to spend money on a gym membership if you don't want to drive to the nearest gym boutique to take a class then let's bring the workouts to you my tips are sing fit at all times even when the gyms club is to have a yoga mat with you this is really all you need to get fit inside your room and if part is you can bond with your new roommate through workout so if you and your roommates bring your yoga mat belt and you go through a blog a legs workout and you're dying together I think that is the best form of bonding okay you guys gotta sleep you gotta sleep because I started getting such as it'll sleep at the beginning of high school until pretty much just a few years ago it really messes tabal ism in messed in type skin I had acne throughout school so there's even been studies saying that people who sleep more or students who complete more actually do get better grades and students who don't sleep enough and so if you guys really want to concentrate focus feel good and look good you need to get your sleep in there now let's talk about eating so if you're headed off to college you probably heard about the freshman 15 and let me tell you I did gain the freshman 15 because I was so excited when I got to the dining room hall have any soda that you want to be got to dessert and breads and cheeses and stir fry and so what I suggest to you is that before you start picking at all the food and being excited by all the options what I want you to do is make a walk around the dining hall and see what options are out there and then you pick the things that are whole and unprocessed if you feel like you have a set meal plan at school and it's really hard for you to only eat the lunch and the dinner because that is a meal plan that you have paid for well then you need to carry around this backpack snack so let me show you some muffy so for example Larabar is really good this is 28-day reset friendly boom shake a pop we need salty Cal corn so good cookies so crunchy and good and they're actually made from chickpea flour are as far as you can see all the ingredients on the front here about egg whites almonds cashews dates and no BS apparently here is an amazing workout hack if you feel like you don't know what to do and you need to be around people you need to be inspired and maybe you need to join a sports team that is a really good way to get your workout in that's what I did when I was in high school I was playing tennis throughout my four years and they made us run bleachers and play game four hours a day and I drink so much water was just so naturally a part of my life that I didn't even think about working out I was just playing games if you are in college a really good heck is to sign up for a kinesiology class where you actually have to work out for a grade so that way you get your credits you get your workout in and hopefully also learn a few things along the way okay and finally guys I'm so excited to present to you one thing that is going to make your health and fitness and academic life so much more organized citizen this is the 2017-2018 focus journal I am so excited about this not only because it's holographic and I love holographic things but this came to be because of you guys I met with a group of students at University of Pittsburgh and they were like Kathy we really love acid journal but I need something for my academic school years so can you mesh together a school planner in a sip planner and I was like okay yes I can and so we've been actually working on this for the past year and I'm so excited that now there is a focus journal that begins in August and end next year in July so let me show you some potatoes inside that I think are really going to help you guys stay organized there is a weekly spread where you can actually plan out your day from 6:00 a.m. all the way to 12 a.m. you know just in case you have some late night midnight study sessions or something like that and then it's a week at a glance which i think is so important for you to get a balance and understanding of what you have going on during the week and then I'm sure you're really interested to see what is going on on the daily page so check this out you've got your water on top which is similar to the SIP planner you've got hours of sleep so like I said you really do need to pay attention to that then you got room for breakfast lunch snacks and dinner and a slot for you to schedule in your workout because I always tell you guys you got to treat your workout like a date like an appointment and you don't want to miss it so there's a spot for that every single day and then you've got an extensive checklist here for all your homework your test your to do with your project whatever you need to do and so I would say that is probably the biggest difference between the fit planner and the focus journal it's how much space you have right here for the to-do list and there's also some pages for your dreams we can plan out what you want to do for the entire year and in a recap at the end of every single month to make sure you appreciate all the things that you accomplished we talk about things that you need to work on to celebrate the new academic year I'm going to be doing a huge giveaway right now are you ready

[Music] hey guys Cassey here so today we're gonna work on that muffin top we're to work on strengthening your obliques working on whittling down your waist and at the same time I'm gonna share with you my five tips for getting back on track when you have fallen off the wagon and trust me I think we've all been there I've been there and these are five things that I like to do to make sure I can get back on track okay but before we go into this let me tell you your five moves so your first move is gonna be the hip dip then you've got kneeling side squeeze next up is corkscrew then you've got wiggling ankle reaches and finally we end with the side plank leg lift front crunch oh that one's gonna be fun that's gonna be good finale move so guys two minutes every single move if it's a double-sided move it's one minute each side and we're just going to talk our way through it okay so hopefully I can stretch you alright we're gonna begin with those hip dips so I'm starting the timer what I want you to do is go ahead and come on to your elbow okay stack the feet hand on the hip making sure you are elevating that waist above the mat now we dip and we lift all righty let's get into those tips the first one is guys if you're falling off the wagon first thing you want to do to get back on track schedule your workout it's a really simple thing so I just use my phone I actually will pick the date and the time and what workout I'm gonna do and put it in my calendar and I'll give myself a one-hour reminder right before it starts and a 30-minute reminder before it starts so it preps me okay so I don't think that it's gonna come and creep up on me I know that it's coming and then of course the alarm rings when you're talking when it's time to workout so when you do that you make your workout a priority and I think that's really important because if you or say you're gonna do it all at 6 p.m. but you're like oh I'm just gonna finish this project or soon have a little snack you're not making a priority switch and you're gonna miss your workout and that's how you fall off the wagon when you don't make things important enough okay hand on the hip other side continuing those hip dips very good so make sure you're bringing the hip all the way down to the mat and then you lift up we're down exhale lift elbow right underneath the shoulders oh I'm feeling it down and up now like if you don't like using your phone calendar you can use a Google Calendar you can also use your calendar on the wall you can use the calendar on your desk and use a planner anything works in fact the under your workout can be as easy as telling your friend to meet you at the park at 6:00 p.m. after work and you both go for a rest okay so make sure you make it a priority to work out and do something that you like it'll make you want to do it more okay because when you don't like doing something like for example going to the dentist then you're not gonna have one you're there okay and down so pick something you like like dancing Pilates whatever all right number two we've got our kneeling side squeeze so back on to that first side you're gonna come on to the knee hand right underneath the shoulder arm up whoa almost out and then we squeeze and lower squeeze and lower making sure that you're really lifting the leg and extending the obliques as you squeeze keeping the toes pointed legs nice and long okay tip number two is to try something brand new so I feel like when you're in a rut when you fallen out the wagon it's probably because you didn't like what you were doing so I like to really change things up so for example if I've been doing a lot of running and all of a sudden I just don't like running and this is actually a true story I stopped doing a lot of Sprint's because I injured my hamstrings um start to lose my flexibility because the teacher in the class wasn't stretching us properly so that it's really stretched either side and so what I felt like I needed was something completely different I wanted to change up the case and so I actually tried hot yoga and now hot yoga is something that I well I think Cassie a few years ago wouldn't have enjoyed but my body was craving something new and so when I tried that it was actually really fun it was super refreshing so guys if you ever feel like you want to try something but you're not sure just go ahead and do it I think that kind of stuff really invigorates your body it invigorates your mind and it makes life a little bit more of an adventure and it's as easy as trying a new group fitness class okay lift and lower really squeeze and down yeah because I think when you get bored that's when you get into rep so you gotta keep life exciting try new things all the time even going like salsa dancing climb dancing whatever works for you just can't moving and keep it exciting one and down okay really good now our third move the corkscrew so what you guys want to do is go ahead and lean back on to the forearms okay and roll the shoulders back open up that chest belly button all the way in lift your legs up squeeze the heels together point the toes squeezing your quads I want you to lower the legs down lift up and stop then we reverse bring it down lift up and stop okay now you know the movement if you do want to make this move just a tiny bit easier go ahead and lay your back entirely down on the mat just like this and continue the same movement okay but I'm gonna go ahead and lift myself up for the corkscrew lift myself up okay here we go so our third tip is to try a new recipe so I feel like a lot of times when I got into rut it was because I was really bored of eating the same old healthy thing over and over again like chicken brass who let is and protein powder and egg whites I think it's really fun to go on Pinterest man I could spend days there and compiled recipes things that look super healthy I just type in like clean eating salads or like new like oatmeal breads that I could make or overnight oats or something like that and I start getting really excited about food oh my gosh I can get so excited by food I will scream and jump and I love going grocery shopping you just really invigorate to me so I think if you can pick a new recipe to try that's healthy it can really make your tastebuds come alive again make your soul come alive again because for me food is so much more than just feel it is life I really love eating and so I think if you can make healthy eating so much more fun so much more colorful you'll get out of your rut all right very good so here we go pressing those legs down lower and lift do it again down lower and lift okay very nice guys we are on to our wiggling angle reaches so go ahead and bring yourself down okay like tape width apart feet flat I want you to lift the head neck and shoulders you're gonna reach for the ankles actually almost for the toes and then reach on the other side okay here we go boom and boom just like that gonna exhale as we go now if you feel like the neck is feeling kind of heavy you can also place the hands behind the nape of the neck elbows wide otherwise really lift with your chest if you lift with your chest you're not gonna feel that straining the net too much okay so here's a thing that has really helped me when it's coming to just feeling like you're in a rut with your food in your diet and so I really like doing the 28-day reset I know a lot of you guys have tried that at the beginning of the year of 2016 when I first introduced they reset challenge to you guys and you guys can actually do this for free on blog lies calm you can figure out what foods to eat and not to eat on the reset and here's the thing the reset isn't a diet it is a 28 day challenge to cleanse your body but I don't mean cleanse of the sense of you can only drink juices you're actually eating food you're eating whole unprocessed foods and so every time I do the reset I feel like my skin gets clear well not like I feel like it actually does my skin gets clear I have a lot more energy and just as a side benefit you start seeing some extra fat come off your body so if you guys are interested go ahead and go to blog lice calm and click on the reset challenge and you can take it into the challenge absolutely free and it feels really good and for me the one thing that has really changed my skin you guys have commented about this recently is that I've taken out dairy from my diet and my pimples my acne it's gone and I think that's so exciting because I had acne growing up so I think that was a big triumph and doubt oh my gosh I was so hard okay we're on to our last move okay are you ready this is gonna be really hard guys this is a side plank leg lifts front crunch oMG so check it out you are on your forearm okay now I want you to lift yourself up into that side plank check it out you're gonna lift up the leg that's one then two you're gonna bring the leg forward oh my gosh now if you want a modification come on the knee lift and forward okay alright let's do this and we're up perfect and front now your fifth tip is to not beat yourself up when you fall off the wagon don't make it like this whole big ordeal like some big moral issue and you're a bad person because you fell off the wagon you eat something you quote unquote what it's supposed to have no it's not big deal you don't have to wait till next Monday to start over we can start over right now okay switch other side whoa okay here we go this is hard but this is the end of it guys you've got this elbow underneath lifting the legs up and here we go up keeping leg strong ah and front okay now what was I saying oh yeah you're not a bad person if you fell off the wagon it's okay I know I've been there before I've weighed myself and I saw that the scale wasn't saying what I wanted it to say so pretty much I don't weigh myself anymore I really don't touch a scale I don't like the emotional power that it has over me so I just I just don't deal with that I like seeing how my clothes fit I like seeing how energetic I am during a workout I like seeing how fast I can run how much weight I can live that's what I focus on and so I think when you guys feel like you're not really at your best just take it slow and get back into it one step at a time oh my god okay I think if I wasn't talking through that I probably would have died a lot sooner it'd help distract me and I hope you guys really enjoyed that give this video a thumbs up if you made it this far and also let me know in the comments below what you guys do when you fall off the wagon because I would love to hear your tips I'm not just talking at you this is a conversation it's a community and I just love you guys so much all right until next time keep working hard and I will you see you then bars [Music] [Applause] [Music]

hey guys Cassey here i am so thrilled we got to sit down today and just chat there's been some exciting stuff that has happened like I just got it caged I'm officially Beyonce so this video I want to talk about all the details on the proposal the wedding planning and also other stuff that's been going on one of the first things I need to tell you about is the fact that my sister has finally moved to LA I am so excited I'm so happy because the last time we lived in the same house together was when I was in high school and she was in middle school Jaclyn just moved to LA with her boyfriend and she's been here for a week now spend every night together we work out together we cook dinner together it's just been so much fun she's not only my little sister but also my best friend and we've also been talking wedding stuff like non-stop I just can't wait for all the cool things to get to do together so I probably shouldn't show this video a long time ago when I got engaged it's been two and a half months now Sam and I are officially fiance's I got engaged in August of this year on the Island of Hawaii upon a cliff overlooking the ocean it was crazy and I actually had zero idea that this was going to happen so apparently Sam and Jaclyn were designing this ring together and now that I look back I remember several months ago Jacqueline was like what kind of ring would you want if you were gonna be proposed to and I was like I don't like rings I don't like wearing them they bother me and she's like okay but if you had to choose what kind of ring would you want it to be like and I was like okay well if I had to choose maybe it could look unique maybe it could look like a rose on a vine just like I really don't want it to look traditional at all that's the end of that I thought she was just asking me for fun we go to kawaii in August and Sam and I prepared to go for an Instagram photo shoot I bought some new Free People dresses that I wanted to twirl around in and so I got my hair and makeup done he's like cool I'm gonna go shoot you at sunset on the cliff I found a really cool spot I was like awesome so I'm getting dressed getting all prettified and then we drive out to this clip we walk over he bends down to grab the camera from the camera bag and then he goes oops I forgot the camera and then he says I have something else for you instead and I'm like what he pulls out a black box and at that moment I'm like nah like he must be joking because him and I are not only life partners we are also business partners and we discuss everything together I was like this is not what I think it is is it and then he opens the box and there is a ring inside and I'm like is this actually happening I just can't handle it he asked me will you marry me and I'm like yes and I start crying he puts the ring on and then he turns my body and I look that way and there is my sister with her boyfriend hiding behind a bush getting all this footage and I just lost it I was completely taken by surprise I had no idea we've been together for nine years now we just feel so comfortable with each other we love each other we care for each other but the moment he asked me to marry him I felt like I felt like our love was reborn for those of you who have been engaged maybe you know what I'm talking about but like I could barely look at him I felt like I was super shy like we were just dating again like I didn't even know him it was super weird and yet super amazing because it just felt revived and reborn that's how the proposal happened and it was so funny because as soon as we got back to LA we found out that there were some articles written about us which is crazy there were headlines that just made us burst out laughing and crying Blogilates gets engaged to a guy know and even knew she was dating like it was so funny we almost died in terms of wedding planning man my sister was like on it as soon as I said yes she was like cool I'm gonna give you like a week to finish out this vacation but immediately right after she was like alright I got you an appointment at this bridal boutique and this bridal salon we're gonna try on all the dresses so much fun we're just putting on all these gowns and feeling like a princess and wearing the veil for the first time and being like wow like this is actually happening I cannot wait to bring you along for the ride plus guys my entire bridal wedding idea board is on Pinterest if you want to see everything and I'm talking about invitations cakes shoes hairstyles nails dresses obviously I put the link for Pinterest down below so go follow that board I love Pinterest so much next I want to talk to you about top flex and a new product that we have you guys it is time for the new 2018 50 oh my goodness I can't believe this is in my hands right now we've been working on this for so long throughout the year and I think you're gonna love it so much because it is rose gold themed this is a planner for your life for your thickness for your food for your goal setting everything all in one so you don't have to have a few different books everywhere and then you become all unorganized no just one beautiful compact a little place in the beginning of the book we have a place for you for short-term goals long-term goals Wireless dreams for me it's all about writing your plan down everything that is happening in this planner is coming directly from your comments from your suggestions we pretty much designed it together every month has its own beautiful artwork which i think is so important because i think i get more motivated when things are pretty there's just so much color throughout this book so this is the calendar spread where you get to visualize your entire month at a glance and over here we have your monthly mantra adventures notes for yourselves now the next page is your week at a glance so this is really important because it breaks it down into specific time slots also groceries area because I want you to be grocery shopping for yourself every week one of my favorite boxes in this entire book is this little box right here it's called the self compliment box because we're so critical of ourselves we see all the flaws but if you really take the time to complement yourself it can feel really so good and it can be truly motivating because a complement to yourself from yourself is an honest one so the daily page we have a water tracker right here on top and then underneath that agreed for breakfast lunch dinner and snacks hours slept then a place for two dews and finally a larger space for workouts which is what you guys asked for last year for me it is so important to write down what I'm doing what time I'm doing it and where I'm doing it so that I don't miss it a brand new feature that we have this year is called the habit tracker it's a place for you to track how you're doing with something you want to get better at okay for example sleep before 11:00 p.m. it has all the days of the month and you just check it off as you go and visually you'll be able to see how well you did with that task okay and another thing you guys asked for is to have a recap area at the end of every month and so we dedicated a full page to that this year I think it is so important to take the time to journal to take the time to really write out how you're honestly feeling now this journal is yours you don't have to share any of this with anyone else so these questions I want you to take time with them at the end of every month and just really review how your past 30 days went and how you can make the next 30 days even better also there's a little pocket at the end a little surprise I have for you that we didn't have last year but we have this year is you guys this is a little mini desk calendar and look guys they match like sisters it's so cute every week we have team meetings at work and we always like to talk about what new products what cool things can we make and the girls were saying why don't we have like a mini desk calendar and so we actually made this to match look at that isn't that so so cute every time you flip the page which has made out a really nice thick greeting card paper you get a quote and the cool thing is you can snip this off after the month is done and paste it on your walls that you're not really wasting this and you can keep the inspiration going as wall art the fit planner and the mini desk calendar are actually going on sale right now on pop bucks active comm so make sure you head over there and grab it like I said these guys sell out so fast the planner won't be on sale by Black Friday but it but I am gonna tell you right now all the active wear is gonna be on sale and it is gonna be crazy all right so guys let's talk about pop flex because the biggest question on all of our minds is when is the next collection coming out and to be completely honest I don't know but it will be soon and it's gonna be really really good I've been spending so much time doing research into women's bodies it's been tedious but all the research that we're gathering is gonna take us to the right place so that I can really guys deliver you the most beautiful product the most well-designed product the best quality at the best price I want to be transparent I want to talk about this because I feel like that's my issue with creating the type of quality that I want and selling it at the price point that we have we buy the fabrics from the same manufacturer as Lululemon and so the quality of the fabric is top-notch the challenge that I'm dealing with is that I want to charge half the price of what the big fancy yoga brands are selling things at there are certain brands that sell pants yoga pants at like 120 $130 which is crazy because I'm gonna spend that much on my jeans they're cost of making that one piece is actually less than what I'm paying to make my one piece because their volume is much higher so visually it's like this the cost of their production is right here for one garment and they can charge all the way over here for their yoga pant because they can and that's their brand so what I'm trying to do is charge you guys right here okay so that profit is gone but my cost for pretty much the same pan it here so as you can see my profit margin this much and that's okay I don't mind that it's just that it's been really difficult for me to make these things work I just want you to know that it's happening on the colors that we've chosen for the next collection are actually coming from you guys straight from what you chose on Instagram and let me just say stunning you guys have such great style you know what you want new pocalypse collection will be coming soon I'll give you a date when I know but just trust me when it comes out it's going to be so so good you just have to wait for all the good things so yeah guys that is my update on life I really miss sitting down and talking to you I hope you have an amazing and beautiful holiday season don't feel guilty about eating too much or you're not working out enough like just just try to live life and enjoy it but

hey guys Cassey here and welcome to chi clean eats now today we are working on everyone's favorite meal the day that breakfast but I also know it's probably one of the most skipped meals of the day we're rushing out of her house for work or for school we're just like I'll just eat lunch later but that leaves you in a state where you're just feeling really hungry when you're hungry you can't concentrate and you're just not at your best so I can help you save time today we're making three make-ahead breakfasts that can make the night before so you can literally just grab it in the morning and go you can eat it in the car on the bus and you will be nourished for the rest of your day the three recipes we're making today are frozen parfait cups omelet in a mug and pancake in a mug where do you learn how to do this let's get started frozen parfait cups are the easiest thing in the world to make you are going to grab some silicone baking cups okay because I like to be eco-friendly some yogurt today I'm using vegan coconut yogurt this comes in plain or vanilla depending on how you like things some chopped strawberries as well as some granola first all I'm gonna do I'm gonna put the granola on the bottom alright and then we're gonna put in our yogurt and then strawberries on top you put any type of fruit that you'd like so this is what it looks like right now that's what the granola on the bottom and now we're going to reverse that and put all of the yogurt in here the strawberries and the granola will go on top guys this couldn't be any simpler all right we're gonna go freeze them and I'll come back when they're done here they are frozen and looking perfect look how nicely that just pops right out just beauty beauty beauty beauty here's the second style with the granola on the bottom you can put this in a ziploc bag and take it with you let's go ahead and try them hmm that frozen coconut yogurt is so good and those little frozen bits in the UM the granola congee it's like oatmeal I really really love it you all right now it's time to make pancake in a mug everything in a mug is just so much cuter let's start out with some oat flour and then I'm going to pour in some almond milk some baking soda to fluff it up a little bit a pinch of salt 1 egg now going to add some ghee and if you never had that before it is basically clarified butter it's butter with all the lactose taking out maple syrup so you guys are going to mix it up that looks pretty good to me and our last step before we go to the microwave is to add in some blueberry it's thin nice and chunky and big check out this mug it's clear I'm so excited got it from world market before we put the batter in and the spray okay whoa oiling in the microwave it's actually going to grow so make sure you don't fill up your batter all the way to the top or it's gonna be a little bit of a disaster okay guys look at this ah this is an artwork look at those purples and those Maroons and those pings it's like a cosmic galaxy inside my mug topping with some blooms little bit of maple syrup Oh guys are you ready this looks like a blueberry pie is time to try this on can we hold on for a second that was the best breakfast thing I've ever had in my life that is so good it's not too sweet which I personally really appreciate because I don't like when the things are too sweet I can taste the blueberry that slight tartness and it really mixes so well with the maple syrup I mind is blown you need to make this you finally we're gonna make omelet in a mug so before you get started make sure you coat your mug with some spray I has some coconut oil right here we got two eggs then one egg white I have some mushrooms are chopped up already you guys can totally put whatever you want inside we got some red bell pepper onions are one of my favorite things to have in my omelet it just makes it a little sweeter some garlic powder to add a little bit of flavor and to make it go we going to vegan cheese and just a little bit of salt to bring the flavors out we need to mix this up colorful that is the fiesta I'm just gonna put the rest of the cheese in right now to make sure it's really gooey if you're doing this for the next day just leave it in the fridge cap it off and I'm just gonna put in the microwave now so we have a taste mmm that's good but before I eat just a little bit more that vegan cheese a little bit more bell pepper some onion and of course some avocado that makes everything better let's go ahead and dig in so much flavor from the cheese and the vegetables and that garlic powder it's like an omelette does a legit omelette in a mug I just gave you three reasons to eat breakfast in the morning they're all super time friendly you can make them the day before or the night before or even whip it up in the morning and you're good to go so promise me you'll at least try one of these recipes and keep your saw something good to eat in the morning it really will get you started off on the right foot and give you so much energy to stay motivated at work or at school let me know the comments below which one of these recipes you would want to try and what video I should make next time thank you so much for joining me and give this video a thumbs up if you'd like to at least one of the recipes and I'll see you next time bye you 
[Music] five [Music] I hope you guys really enjoyed that little Chumlee movie trailer yes starring Sam as Ken and right now we're gonna do a bunch of cardio obviously lots of kicking to increase the heart rate to burn the fat and also to work on chun-li sexy fat okay so because this is a pit 28 special you've got seven moves 45 seconds on 15 seconds off and you want to do this workout four times through for an entire 28 minute workout you'll be done for the day okay so your moves are the shuffle downs plie calf raise front kicks plie punches squat side kick right lunge kicks and finally squat side kick left there is a lot of kicking so you want to make sure to wear some shoes to protect your feet and really when you're kicking engage your core and be a street fighter okay so here we go hitting start we begin with the shuffle bounce right arms and guard and we're shuffling just like here just like so 23 seconds on one side 23 seconds on the other side so it's just a warm you up and to feel really a street fighter mm-hmm do you like how I match my hair and my colors I'm very proud of myself with that a little bit more great to switch sides guard the face nice work Santa's here it's tight it's not falling out okay so many people we're gonna be fine just fine shuffle shuffle this is gonna be the easiest move of all by the way so just appreciate come on thank you can't really guarantee it's just a warm-up okay now plie calf raise okay now we're gonna strengthen those legs those tunnel these thighs are like they're so strong we're gonna come out into Weiss okay why do I create we're gonna come down and lift up okay so root down and actually let's go down and up like that elbow and lift and lift and up now I don't know if you play street fighter I don't really but Sam plays it at home and I got intrigued by the costumes and I noticed that over the years chun-li thighs have gotten bigger and bigger which is really interesting well other probably it's also got bigger like boobs but it's very interesting but the thighs have gotten bigger because I feel like us girls are so obsessed with this inner thigh gap thing but honestly I don't know if anyone else cares I think strong thighs are awesome one more okay next move we got front kicks cuz obviously she is all about kicking guys so what you want to do by the base kick kick okay as high as powerful as you can okay okay the other really weird things I noticed about Jimmy is that her legs got darker and more saturated over the years I don't really understand I think they started out like the same color as the rest of her body and then I just saw the recent one and they're like they're not even like brown they're like red brick like like its desert on fire something like that I don't really understand so yeah I'm gonna have to figure out what I'm gonna do if I want to wear that costume outside if I should get like brown leggings or something or just wear nude likenesses I'm not really sure this is very Miss gay okay okay next one plie punches so we get down low okay inner thighs shining outwards knees nice and bent toes tracking out nice work guys lots of cardio and this one doesn't even bother

alright so first move you're on the couch hopefully you have a couch if not um then grab a chair but make sure the chair doesn't have those little wheels under ace you're totally gonna go for a joy ride that it's not gonna be very fun so triceps guys place the hands right outside your hips make sure your feet are hip-width apart and go ahead and take your bootie off the edge of this couch okay but not too far because we're gonna go ahead and do a tricep dip bending the elbows back and sliding your butt and your back against the edge of the couch so basically what I'm saying is is don't don't go like this see how far my butt is come close alright feet hip-width elbows coming back imagining that you have an envelope or a piece of paper in your armpit so you're not going like this so that envelope falling out keep everything nice and tight elbows going back towards the pillows back towards the back of your couch all right so guys we're just gonna talk we're gonna watch TV and

Victoria and Prince Albert anything it's like a PBS or BBC show it's really good okay bringing the leg up open the chest hands outside so we're simply gonna press back and in press back and in it's a historical reenactment scripted drama of the Queen in the 1800s it was where the costumes are I loved Anna showed a strong woman a strong young and actually a short woman who was in power and had to war to gain her respect I mean even these days women still have to work the game aside but you so it was incredible incredible show I was actually on the plane going back from Dubai I had nothing to do the 17-hour flight and I was watching Lee but I didn't want to watch any movies so I started watching Victoria and I ended up watching a whole of season one and each episode is one hour long so

by [Music] hey guys Cassey here and welcome to cheap clean eat so I saw in the comments that you guys wanted back to school back to work back to reality recipes that are easy to make in the morning so that you can have it for lunch that is really smart because I'm really guilty of just ordering food off of my phone like post mates uber eats eat 24 all that kind of stuff and a salad ends up being like 16 dollars it's kind of ridiculous I also need to start making my food and bringing it to work because it is so much more economical and plus I know everything that goes into it so today I have three really simple super delicious and super nutritious recipes for you to bring to work or school oh and one is vegan so I know you can ask for that too are you ready let's just go ahead and get started we're starting out with the chilled stage and avocado soup as you see there are lots of greens like a Persian cucumber some spinach a celery stalk and some basil leaves then to give it that creamy texture some raw cashews a quarter cup of avocado and some nutritional yeast for hpc flava some pepper some salt and a vegetable broth pretty much that's it put in a blender land it up you don't even need to cook it guys then grab your mason jar and score that delicious creamy mixture in and you're feeling super fancy guys go ahead and chop up some avocado chop it and from a tomato and top it okay oh my goodness that looks incredible I'm so excited I'm dancing and cannot wait next we have salad in a jar this is a Pinterest classic so the most fun thing is Gregory's a jar and put all of the salad dressing on at the bottom then you're going to add your harder vegetables basically the things that you don't think will wilt and get mushy by the time you take this out for lunch all right like carrots cucumbers are bonds of beans these were just things I had in my fridge it's super easy to make salad guys whatever you like I have my meat on top put some feta cheese olives and then you must put the lettuce on top or else it will turn into mush nests um and then if you're making this for somebody else put a little nice milk there it's salad in a jar and if you want to get all that dressing everywhere then you just shake it up finally my favorite the avocado egg salad PITA so go ahead and grab some boiled egg whites and making enough for two today so celery stock as well as some green onion we're going to add in a medium avocado oh yes and also one tablespoon of Dijon mustard a squeeze of lemon juice some salt and black pepper and basically mash everything up with your fork and fill in your pitas with the goodness that you've just made if you want to add in some more color tomatoes will definitely do the trick but literally guys these are so hearty just so delicious put in a ziploc bag and you're you guys and those are our three easy back to school lunches or back to work or wherever you're going on the go so let's start out with our PITA I am so dying to eat this right now it looks so scrumptious and good like a big ol hamburger so it's not it's avvocato eggs nice and chunky and the flavor really comes through because I taste it so while we're making this and just slips right inside your bag just like that take it wherever you are going and eat it right out of the bag - mmm oh my goodness it is so creamy guys that you don't need meat in this at all there is so much flavor and I know this will be so filling because of the healthy fats with of the protein from the egg and just something great vegetables in here that mustard really comes through - this one is absolutely delicious and will fill me up as move on to a chilled soup look at how beautiful that is beautiful and green and red and have you seen my spoon it says I love avocado I've been waiting to use this for a really long time bottom Etsy like several months ago and now I get to use it if you have a mason jar you can literally just cap it and put in your lunch bag and bring it with you wherever soup for lunch easy and you don't even need to heat it up mmm oh my goodness this reminds you of the summer it just feels so good and so fresh and I feel like my skin is just gonna glow now because I just had that one bite and then the easiest simplest thing in the world salad in a jar I'm sure you've seen this on Pinterest everywhere but I've never done it on a cheek meat so I felt like it needed to I need to do it shake it up and it is good to go the most important thing is that you guys have the salad dressing on the bottom and the more hard stuff so not the lettuce on the bottom it's like the garbanzo beans the bell peppers the carrots that sort of things that doesn't get you know all soggy by the time it's lunchtime mmm mmm perfect so easy to make you need to make this for back to school back to fall back on track wherever you are off from summer vacation these will fill you up they taste so good and they're so healthy for you and best of all they're really easy and quite cheap to make so I hope you really enjoyed this episode let me know the Khans below what other video ideas you have for food it's really fun to cook for you guys and thank you so much I will see you next time bye guys 
I can't believe you're breaking up with me I don't know I guess after seven years hello it's me was different for you what two words revenge by Oh I'm gonna show him what a huge mistake you just mean baby no you Cassie yeah and you're here for a revenge body right I'm warning you this is going to be intense are you ready for come on yeah Cassie you can do it whoa look at you go well you know what if you want results then you've gotta guess you can no just give me everything you've got I cannot give you everything you know how it shot good still want that revenge body yeah got this okay I do huh I seen you so I just what well you allow me to translate jerk for you he means you really do you've been working out or something so it's so crazy seeing you got me feeling some kind delay Hey look maybe we should catch up sometime grab a drink not even in Europe look and that how you want to break 
hey guys Cassey here today we are going to talk about being healthy yes it can be tough but health is everything that you have your health is your well and I'm not just talking about working down and eating clean because I know you've got that covered talking about implementing healthy habits into your lifestyle understanding your body better from the inside out and also seen your doctor once a year a lot of times we work so hard to get skinny and do whatever it takes to look really good on the outside but sometimes when you do whatever it takes it really takes a toll on your body and when you're young you're thinking about the weight loss and looking good and you feel like you're really invincible and nothing's gonna happen and it's fine but only for a little bit your body won't always be like that can't just work out to look good you have to work out to feel good so I think it is really important for all of us to stop take a moment to reevaluate what's going on on the inside of our bodies so that we can understand how to be healthier for real how to be happier for real so in preparation for this vlog I did a ton of research for you and for me so that I could share with you seven changes that you can make to your life so that you can live happier healthier leader and Locker number one get your sleep on according to a Gallup poll about 40% of Americans get less than seven hours of sleep at night and one of those Americans was probably me so get this if you don't sleep enough it can actually contribute to your weight gain because lack of sleep actually creates a chemical imbalance with your hormones and when you're sleep-deprived and you're feeling really hungry I'm going to guess that your food decisions aren't gonna be best stuff just avoid giving yourself in that situation and sleep especially if you want to see results with weight loss and anything that you're trying to achieve with your performance number two find a hobby that doubles as exercise I think we need to do our workouts more as a treat rather than a chore you don't have to just lift weights for run you can do yoga you can salsa dance you can go rock climbing you can go hiking I mean there are so many options for you the bonus with picking a workout that you actually like is that you're more likely to stick to it and when you can stick to something well I think your results are really going to show and it won't feel like you are dragging your feet through the months trying to lose one pound at a time it's going to be fun and I think the more fun you can put into your life the more enjoy the life's gonna be number three get an annual checkup look I know we are young we feel invincible we feel like no disease can touch us relive reverie whatever no no that's not the case we are humans the truth is you should see your doctor once a year because this will help prevent any medical issues that might come in the future so when you do go to your doctor make sure you ask for these for health numbers okay really important first get to know your blood pressure because this will help prevent heart disease and strokes and ask for your cholesterol your HDL will be your good cholesterol your LDL will be your bad cholesterol and knowing these numbers will help prevent blockages in your arteries ask your blood sugar which will help prevent diabetes and also get to understand your BMI I know BMI is a really confusing number and it totally depends on your weight your height your muscle mass your fat percentage and sometimes if we interpret it wrong it could give us a false understanding of our help so make sure you go to dr. you ask him or her about your BMI to truly understand where you stand number four be around people who make you feel good I'm sure you have people your life you're like oh my gosh I love them so much and well being around them and people in your life you're like that's much yeah there's two groups and I want you to spend more time with people who make you happy versus the people who don't make you happy because when you're in a good mood and you're giving off good vibes you're so much more likely to be successful in whatever you're trying to do and once you end those friendships you release the toxicity in your body in your heart and then spend the time with people who inspire you number five stop serving food family-style people tend to eat more and overeat when food is served directly on the table so what should you do cook your food on the stovetop serve yourself print to the table and have some nice conversation drink water slow down when you eat doing this will fight overeating and obesity and Lauren number six stop with the sugar okay there is sugar hiding in her food even when we don't think it's there I'm talking about healthy smoothies low-fat yogurt sugar also ends up elevating your sweet tooth and if I passes your oldest signals that you end up eating even when you're full not good so what do you do beyond the sweet tooth fruit fruit it is nature's candy eat that number seven relax here's the dealio more stress equals more cortisol equals more likely to eat junk food equals more belly fat not a good thing so y'all I need you to slow down and chew out because the more relaxed you are the happier you'll be the better quality of life you'll have and the bigger chance you have at living longer also I want to give a huge thank you to Cigna for sponsoring this video so I hope you guys enjoyed this video got a lot out of it you promise me that you can schedule your annual checkups that you're ready for 2017 it's usually covered by most health insurance but even so only half an out of people who should be seeing their doctor actually do so when you finally get around to scheduling that annual checkup make sure you get those four health numbers I talked about in the beginning and also if you feel like I want to get more in depth there are questions that can ask your doctor all on Cigna comm slash take control so go there and see how deep you could dive okay guys are we good are we good will you promise me that you'll do everything you can to live a healthier and happier life I wouldn't be doing squats and burpees would be what we're like 89 are guys so that's it and let me know in the comments below which one of these seven tips you're going to try to implement tomorrow okay I'll see you guys later and I love you so much [Music] and

my sister made me this this blanket I mean yeah hey guys Cassey here I cannot believe that in just a few days it's going to be a brand new year 2017 is upon us and let me tell you um I'm kind of excited for a whole new year look the first Monday of 2017 is going to be on January 2nd and I thought why don't we do a challenge together it's not going to be like any other challenge you've ever done with me ever so I think all of us need to be on board if you feel like you've been working out super hard and you put in all this time and effort but your body still isn't changing and you're getting really frustrated so let me tell you the culprit is probably the food that you're eating it's true and I was in denial for a really long time so if you feel like you're in the same boat this challenge is for you it's only 28 days long we start on Jan 2 and we end on Jan 29 so I need your commitment your full commitment that you will stick with me for 28 days okay so here's the challenge we are all going to go on the 28 day Lisa what does that mean basically you're going to stick to whole natural foods stay away from processed foods for 28 days the reason why I need your body to be in a clean state is because we need to figure out what foods are causing inflammation what foods are bloating you giving you pimples gas and all those sorts of things that sometimes we feel like is really normal but it's not by doing this 28 day reset we're going to reset your body back to its best state and the cool thing is when you do that and when you feed your body with these natural Whole Foods you're gonna feel so much more energetic and your skin's gonna clear up and that stubborn weight you've been trying to lose that stubborn fat it's going to naturally start falling off so here are the rules for the 2018 you set you're gonna miss five things the first thing is dairy so I'm talking about things like cheese butter milk gone for 28 days okay the second thing gluten so things like bread and pasta set that aside for 28 days number three added sugars so candy donuts pastries cakes all those sorts of things I don't have natural sugar number four processed foods so basically things that come in package where if you look at the ingredients you don't really understand what is in there five alcohol no alcohol for four weeks I know you can do this and you can be really fun and happy sober it's gonna be great I know kind of sounds like I just said you can't have this this and this but trust me you're now going to make a room for all of these other foods these fruits and vegetables and lean a protein that's really going to feel your body get you energetic and also clear up your skin and if you look so good now the second part of the challenge is I want you to commit to working out six times a week so whether that means you're going for a hike or a jog outside or you're following the Blogilates workout calendar which is totally free or you're doing hit 28 for 28 days which is the perfect companion to the 28 day reset whatever you choose to do just get moving I just need you to promise me that you will commit with me and with thousands of other pop stores all over the world for the 28 days okay I know you can do this do not give up on yourself and once you finish those four weeks you will feel how amazing it is to be at your best potential physically mentally spiritually you're gonna want to be gone so you guys are excited for you feeling kind of confused as to what you can eat no worries I took care of you if you download the PDF right here it's completely free I explained to you what meals you can have in a sample meal plan and why we're omitting the things that we're emitting and how you can safely add them back into your diet so that you can figure out what is giving you food intolerances for example for me I've been playing on and off the dairy and I know that every single time when I have it I immediately get pimples on my face I get super gassy and my stomach really hurts so once I started taking that out of my diet my skin is now so much clearer community and and I just go better right some feel a lot better plus a lot of Asians and Asians out there we usually lactose intolerance so this is probably a good thing to take out of your diet anyway and I love almond milk and cashew milk which is so many options and I'll tell you so good the other thing that I started to take out of my diet more I wouldn't say permanently but more seriously I noticed that when I have foods of gluten in it I start to get really gloating like not just kind of you know feeling a little bigger like looking like I'm pregnant you know I'm talking about where the lower belly just basically pops out and it's just like hard and full of air or whatever my stomach just cannot handle it so ever since I started taking out gluten from my diet I really have felt flattered in my stomach and just really a lot tighter so those are the two things that I have started to seriously take out of my diet of course you have it once in a while your body will bounce back you are resilient and it'll be fine but in the long haul if you want to always feel at your best you can we pay attention to the foods you're putting into your body and how you feel afterwards you are going to be your own best doctor and the 28-day reset will help you create a lab of your body to figure out what works for you and what does it'll find that some people can handle certain things that cannot on January 1st before we start I want you to keep your core picture for yourself and like a Sports Bra short nothing too scandalous guys keep it in your phone and then after the challenge is done on January 29th I want you to take an after picture a grind inside from the same distance so we can see how the changes are if you don't see too much NORs just keep going for a little bit longer sometimes it takes a different mount of time for each of our bodies to really kick in the changes my body is one of those types of bodies that takes forever so don't be discouraged I just want you to keep going because what's also going to keep it going is how you feel and how energized and lively you're gonna be also if you guys feel like you have a hard time sticking to a meal plan or just sticking to anything in general my advice to you is to write things down so I saw that a bunch of you guys already got the 2017 Blogilates fit we are almost out of these and I can't believe I did do a youtube video to show you guys um but now I am the reason why I really love this adjustment planner so much is because we have water hydration goals right here on top so you can color that in as you go throughout the day and you all stick to write down your breakfast your lunch your dinner your snacks as well as the workout you're going to do that day so for those who do it like tip just write down like pin 1.2 or whatever and stick to it you can put down the time you're going to do it because make it like an appointment make it a date and you will not miss it hours of sleep very important that is the third pillar to your physique success which is food workouts and sleep so don't forget try to sleep around seven to eight hours a day if possible and look there's even a to-do list this year which really makes this more than a fit planner it's like a life planner so everything all in one oh and I forgot to say I can't forgot to say this okay if you guys want the official coin a day reset ebook and the p20 program everything is on sale right now until January 2nd everything is 30% oh and the code is pick 2017 that's P at at T 201 7 so make sure to get it now so you can read up on basically how everything works guys you have all the

and slowly bring it down beautiful I really really love stretching and I highly recommend it and actually think it's necessary that you do stretch because after a workout your muscles really tense up you don't want to walk around the rest of the day being like you want to be open and free and so that is what stretching is for and I'll make your next workout even better whoa push up a little bit and come down bring those legs out flip over onto your belly and I want you to place the hands underneath the shoulders lift up slowly into that gorgeous cobra pose inhale through the nose exhale through the mouth inhale exhale sit back on to the heels and slowly lift up and there you go guys we just D bloated your belly Oh doesn't that feel amazing we just did something so good for our bodies and now we're gonna talk about the Google chromecast and the giveaway this is something that I use every night no joke it's so much easier for me to stretch when I'm distracted and so I love watching my favorite TV show on the TV screen now I make that very distinct point because it's extremely hard for me to watch a video from a little screen and stay distract because my head's always down and I don't feel like my body's in the right position and if you're like me I can never find where the remote control is it's always somewhere really weird but I always know where my phone is and so the Colding by the Google chromecast is you can use your phone as the remote control and all you have to do is tap one button and boom magically the video that's playing on your phone is now on the TV screen and the cool thing is I can still use my phone to text and do whatever check insta while I'm stretching so it's not like your phone is dead so if you guys want to grab one for your friend or for yourself just go to chromecast comm slash TV now it is time for the giveaway details super simple this giveaway is open to all pop stores everywhere all around the world and all you have to do is

and [Music] okay I'm happy here I am blown away by results so far on the 28-day reset challenge and for those of you who haven't joined yet join because it's free their really cool thing about the reset is that I feel at peace and I feel in balance and I really really appreciate that because I'm no longer thinking about counting calories and just worrying about all sorts of things I just know what these work for me and what we still and for those of you who are new to hearing about the 28 degrees that challenge basically you can get 5 things from your diet to figure out what kind of food intolerances you have so those things are alcohol gluten proper foods added sugar and dairy and for me personally I know that when I take out very my skin such the clean reps and when I take out gluten I no longer feel like I'm bloated and just so uncomfortable and then of course added sugar is too much that really gets me to break out too so I encourage you to do the 28 day reset to figure out what foods work for you and what we don't work for you so let me show you what a person imbalance looks like and what a person who is not in balance with my ok so here's a picture of me about four or five years ago when I was doing my bikini competition eating 1000 calories a day working out four hours a day and here is a picture of me that I just shot for the page 28 3.0 cover and if you look at the two photos you can really tell it's not really about how much you weigh guys because when I was at my fitness I wasn't at my happiest maybe that's something that we all need to truly understand it's when you have found your balance and get peace that you're in happiest so guys today I put together ten of my favorite 28-day reset approved snack they're all super quick and super easy so if you

[Music] 
hey guys Cassey here with Lindsay oh I see here this is the area of all our videos that's what I are most known for today we're going to get super real and secret deep and talk about our insecurities let's do it let's do it look good I think all girls have it we just don't talk about it what are some your insecurities oh man I wasn't really think I was just described but you know as far as alright all the hot seat get into it I think some people will be very surprised when they hear what my surgeries are my whole life has been very insecure about body image I think a lot of girls are and also I mean I'm a professional violinist I do for a living and he shows it across the world dance while you put no weight does that that's true yeah that's my secret weapon I'm not very insecure about my ability is highlighted am i is plain I know that's probably like not what you're so hunger also even my like public speaking abilities make all the I didn't work online really I don't remember what the first time they met Lindsay was at a Britain Co event in Sanford head so we didn't know each other but I have to do the team out that day and I spent like all night writing my speech preparing the PowerPoint and I completely failed really I did like afterward that you didn't see me but I walked outside I just I need to take some like sublets speech lesson it's one thing if you're like I need to work on that it's insecurity when you don't take lessons because you're just too afraid that you're going to fail you know what's crazy you're professional violinist you feel insecure about playing the violin I am professional fitness instructor and Pilates instructor and I feel insecure about my fitness sometimes as well I don't have a typical fitness instructors body I don't have six pack abs I don't have like a big booty that shaped like a peach emoji on your eyes some people call me out for it really I think you've got shame on them shame on them I mean how fascinating is that like I didn't know that about you and fascinating that that what we are good at is what we're the most insecure about like our gift is one of the most insecure about but I think that's what makes us both so good at we do because we do see things that we want to try to improve and I do not the difference between insecurity and insecurity with a future I guess I would like Gophers gold with foresight right because like if you see something you don't like about yourself but you're not going to do anything to change it I think that's where the problem is right balance might be for both of us has been something that we've been struggling to achieve for a long time you had anorexia I had orthorexia and I did a video on that I'm sorry guys they haven't posted another video about my eating disorder but I wanted to do this and talked to Lindsay about its therapeutic when you have a friend about it is that you can absolutely becoming super imbalanced in one area of life or you can only go so far before you start to realize I am missing out on every other aspect of my life because I put everything into this and I was obsessed with being skinny and working out and limiting food so much to the point where I you know I did lose a lot of my relationships and I was incredibly depressed as a result of you know lack of nutrients I know not being able to create the chemicals in my body but also depressed because all I cared about was this one very superficial aspect of my life and there's no way you can feel good about yourself when that's all we focus on oh my gosh I mean hear you say that reminds me of what I went through to being obsessed with vanity being obsessed with my abs and then being there or not and like I'm only hyper focusing on the physical it slowly took over my life in a way that I thought it was being healthy it becomes crazy what people think will click help in what health actually is because writing really internal and it looks different on every person and like with Instagram you can always move like Instagram models and interested and destructors who look so good in the picture and then everyone expects you to look like that everything appears certain way on Instagram and we've both done photo shoots enough and seeing the process where what's happened and why I actually look like when I walk into that photo shoot and so far from what I look like when the picture came out yes you know it's like it takes an army so whether you're at an award show whether it's a photo shoot after someone prepared you have someone for styling there's someone for makeup there's a person for lighting maybe I'll be angle there's a photography mom there is an army making sure that you look perfect in that one shot one photo if any of you guys out there feel like you're strolling through Instagram Facebook YouTube I think whatever is out there right now there's so much and you feel like you're comparing yourself to Instagram models or even our photos with something just know that that's not everyday life I've talked about this before you know that Instagram is your portfolio it's really easy to look at social media like she is I wish my face was as clear as her but I think even more than that comparing life to other people I remember it was a holiday and I was homeless in Arizona and my dad was struggling with all this helped up and I was sitting there as was Christmas Eve and we weren't playing games we were doing anything fun because we just were not in that state if they won't we're at the hospital and I respond your interest stories and seeing everybody having the trim of their lives as their family and I was like man comparison is such a cruel dlc of joy is I use have both marriages is disease of joy you suddenly lose sight of what you have yeah and it's all of the sides people are posting moments moments the best the best moment in comparison is if you enjoy whether its body comparison like comparison against area and and it's so weird because some people they know that they play the game so I noticed that there are some friends I have that will post on Facebook oh just like one system or whatever just oh just sign the contract you will the energy point and it is those things that actually make people feel bad yeah I think it's the way that they say it yeah rhaggy oh yeah there's ways of saying it where you're grateful yeah how do you ever feel like the people who say that are also the people who like me to say that for their own insecurities yeah I think you know yeah I don't think I need to go further into it but I do feel that a lot if you're actually really good at what you do - don't you say me and you just do right I think that's what makes you like so humble and our group of girlfriends so humble because we just do what we do and we genuinely have support one another we're proud of each other we respect another there's no need to brag or say whatever is jelly I need all that disgusting I'm sure you tell those conversations where you see someone who are you doing and they go off on a list oh my god like well actually I just want to hear like how's your do it you know I don't need we don't need a resume when we know you people we love know you know and and it really does come across a very insecure the only time I resume my soul is to myself what I'm feeling a lack of confidence I don't know if you're always trick on yourself but like when I was in high school there would be days for example where I would get that grade on a test or somebody says something mean to me or I lost the tennis game and I just be like stay out of this one so then I would take a moment to look back and be like Kathy what have you achieved up into this and in my head I'll lift up okay this is to this and it kind of built back up your Constance anyone else do that I got it oh yeah okay holy you know a theorist saw there's a viral YouTube video like five years ago where there's a little girl looking in the mirror and she's like I don't care like saying these things by myself and it was like her pep talk for the I visualize also the things that I'm good at sometimes to like you know I'm nervous for a performance I'll be like you've done this before and I'll visualize myself doing it at my best but I feel I can do I get some service to go to a social event like visualizing the kind of person that I know I can be and those whole events are really anxiety filled I have to hide yes you just don't want to be that person and even that moment where else been what conversations done your the networking room you're like who do I talk to next it could only be a minute where you're trying to figure it out but it's so anxiety provoking where you have the first you can create your seventh three years ago I wasn't okay well I was and I did not know anybody a kulluk high school yeah lunch table dress it up that is a relief what happened and I love like some like really really hot youtubers like a lot of people and I literally sent myself I don't belong there like so specific trait that social anxiety is for real not like it's something you leave behind in junior high you know I really like always it may have been worse then because I was the most awkward freshman I'm so awkward and I love your offer Nate well I thank you a lot of our insecurities really stemmed from picking ourselves with heart not seeking we're good enough but if you got to find what you are good I impose a more aside and you left in Italy and then do less of what you don't like and then you're going to find your own balance and one balance is so different I had to reevaluate and I was like what are these 10 or 15 pounds worth is it worth me not being able to read my business is it worth me not be able to eat out with my workmen and friends like no like okay I'll be a little bit heavier but who cares like have my life back exactly if you find your balance I actually wrote a book about talking logic to your eating disorder test I might even disorder actually I don't want to agree with you right now I think having those internal conversations have been a huge part of helping me to find balance in my life because your minds can't it can say like anything it wants to say you're fat you're ugly you're worthless but it cannot go against reason that's you know you will be able to talk your mind into whatever you want to believe and that was hugely empowering for me when I realized that I had some control actually of what I thought the mind is the strongest thing it is it can control your body so you can tell it exactly what you want it to do for any of you that is out there who are struggling with insecurities you look in the mirror you don't like what you see Oh Lucy what would you say would be the first step I'm going to say the first step is just acknowledging the things you're grateful for I think gratitude is one of the most healing characteristics that we have it's the opposite of jealousy and a comparison yes instead being a thief of joy it's like a Grand Tour of joy when you're grateful so I save focusing on the things like every single day you know possibly write down something a list of things you're grateful for every day and I would say also telling yourself what you're good at like your good qualities and looking for them the more you focus on those things like you are writing down every day what your night before or whether good at your mind actually becomes trained yes focus on that and that's that's true because I went through that and it changes though using journaling get me the journal make it special get a nice little booklet and later on it becomes your story we're all here to put something different on this world a different unique gift I'm using the gifts of music enjoy and dance and happiness over vibrant light hopefully I bring the gift of it is in helping you guys reach your potential student health and confidence and beauty and cute esteems it great thank you at my job and you guys need to figure out what is your gift what do you want to give to this world I mean I know this is within this channel and you want to know how to get six pack abs and super long legs and toned arms that's awesome but you remember that that is kind of a side effect of getting stronger of becoming a better person every single day without the most important thing and I also urge you guys to surround yourself with really good people I mean I am so lucky to have you in my life to have the other Disney Princesses Rosanna juicy and Lily in our lives because we really want you generally support each other and I just feel like life is so much more fulfilling that way I don't care how I look or any of like that when I'm around you guys I brag about like having fun and laughing with each other that's like the best feeling in the world and I think that's when you know who your true friends are yeah when you feel like you can really let your guard down and you will be yourself and you can be vulnerable in not only your appearance but just in like letting them see your true colors of not feeling if you get you're going to act and guys if you're insecure just own it own insecurities but choose to make it better which is what you said at the very beginning writing this blog if you don't like something change it in a healthy way because you are control of your life your mind in your body you can tell it what you want it to do just do it happiness in unless yeah yeah oh thank

[Music] hey guys Cassey here so today we're to work on your arms I'm talking your entire upper body so your back your shoulders your triceps your chest and in these five moves I'm also gonna share with you five tips for making new friends as an adult and I know can get really scary it's so much easier to make friends when you're a kid I feel like you have the playground and you have someone in your class you're like hey you want to hang out you want to be friends and you just do the thing but when you're an adult all of a sudden you're super reserved your guard is up you think everybody wants something from you someone's gonna take advantage of you so I'm gonna show you hopefully what what might help you make friends as an adult okay so we have five moves the five moves are up up down down half Cobra push-up goalpost punchers arm circles and inchworms we're gonna be doing each move for two minutes if it is two-sided then it's gonna be one minute each side and I'll be distracting you with our talk throughout the entire thing so hopefully you will not think about how much it's hurting and you'll think about how you can make new friends okay so I'm gonna start this timer and then we're just gonna go and get started with those up up down downs alright and begin so guys check it out you can do these on your knees or your toes you're gonna bring it on to the elbow on to the elbow please the hand right where the elbow was and right where the elbow was okay at that one-minute mark we are going to switch it up now if you want to go crazy come with me on the toes we're going down down and up you want to try to keep your body as still as possible all right let's get to that first tip how do we make new friends as an adult so I think sometimes it's easier if you actually just reconnect with old friends yeah so now because you have Facebook you can see what everyone's up to you see if they're doing something cool leave a comment naturally like it and see what people up to reach out text it's not weird I think if you were able to connect on something in your past you'll be able to connect on something in the future as well I think a lot of times as adults like I said earlier we get so reserved we feel like people may not like us go ahead and switch we feel like it's hard to make friends but honestly it's not because at the end of the day I think everybody wants positive relationships you want more people in your life who get you and so really stop being so shy everybody wants to have a friend so go ahead and reach out and really be vulnerable let them know how you're doing how you're feeling and then connect over some experiences they had in the past and let that be a beginning of your conversation okay keep those ABS nice and tight place the hands right where the elbows are back flat whoa this feels good down down I didn't know how two minutes if this is gonna feel but we're gonna get through we're gonna do this this up and up down and down plus you see my old friend see they're doing something that you're into now two up and do it together come on lift lift this was so good for the chest and the shoulders and abs okay perfect okay one move down now we've got your half Cobra push-up so go ahead and come on the flow police the hands in front of you slide the hands underneath your shoulders bring those elbows out bring those elbows in okay what you want to do is come back down try some tact here we go up and Laura okay my tip number two is to join a club um not like the club's where you're dancing you tell more in the morning not those but those are fine too I suppose but are people you can meet who have a common hobby as you if you really like okay no let me change that if you're really in like knitting why am i choosing all these brew types okay if you know but there's nothing wrong with knitting or square dancing that's fine too let's say you really like cooking okay that's very generic as people understand you really like cookies join a cooking club or something and then you'll meet other people there who already one have something in common phew so it's a lot easier to connect to people when you already have something that someone else likes it's easy to start a conversation it's easy to get excited and hopefully you'll find somebody in the club that you can really connect with and I also think it's important that when you are finding this thing and you can be going to like meet up.com you can meet with people on Facebook groups Instagram groups just really be open be yourself don't try to be anyone else and that's how you're really gonna find new friends who love you for who you and I also think as adults we do have a better sense of who we are so it's very possible to find even deeper relationships as an adult then when you were a child alright let's go ahead and lift and lower and up and down exhale up and down okay all right now we're gonna head into our goal post countries so you can be on your knees you can also stand up you can be on in you know cross like a style doesn't matter so your hands are up like so you need to come down I'm gonna punch out boom pin up goal post hunters here we go but ah Inlet so my third tip is to open up here's the thing people like to connect with other people who are willing to be vulnerable who are willing to share their real stories are willing to be embarrassed if you're gonna have so much slide and you know talk about yourself only you don't listen to other people no one's gonna want to be your friend you guys you want to make sure you're a good listener and you also want to let your guard down I think that's really important I even in a relationship if you're trying to protect your heart so much and you don't let your true self shine it's hard to really fall in love to really fall deeply in love and so if you're willing to have your heart broken I also think you can find the truest love there is out there when you really give everything give give that relationship everything so similar in a friendship I think you should be very open will let people know what you like if you like about them and don't hold anything back I think that is you know meaning of a truly beautiful friendship and relationship oh yeah and don't forget to compliment each other I think that helps a lot too okay let them know what you like about them who and out and up so good boom lift you got it how the shoulders feeling feeling good I know you probably forgot about the pain because I kept talking right and now I got to keep talking about that but I want you to punch boom pow just like that boom and you know the reason why I wanted to talk about friendships with these arm movements because I feel like with an arm you can hug you can reach out and give a handshake I feel like that makes a lot of sense alright next we have arm circles so out and out mini little circles okay two minutes here we go number four set at the time to hang out so here's the thing I feel like as adults we always get so busy everyone has work or they have these commitments all the time and kids and whatever but if you don't make the time to hang out then you're not really gonna be able to create those deeper relationships or to create new friends and so for me I never really ever wanted to be the type of person who would have to set up the time instead of dataset the activity but then I felt like if I didn't then none of our friends would ever get together and so my role now in our social circle I actually try to get people together and at the end of the day yes it's a little bit more work but good things take work right and so we'll set up a pit work out at the Blogilates HQ with some friends we'll go out for a kbq afterwards and it's fun I think we have another minute of this right yeah we're gonna keep going set up a food date I don't know go for run the beach go shopping get your nails done um anything have someone come over and play video games it doesn't matter I think getting together with friends but also being the person to initiate will help as well and hey when friends bring other friends that's also a really good way to make new connections because somebody likes something about your friend you like something but your friends so therefore through transitive property in geometry you will most likely like to be a friend of the friends all right now make sure go faster faster how the shoulders feeling I do burning I can't even feel them right now they're like they're like hardening up right now so you got this you can keep going belly in chest open shoulders down keep circling you got this ten seconds left come on faster faster faster okay because our last ones super fun and what okay whoa last one we've got the inchworms I love this one because it's for the chest shoulders abs and hamstring so look you're gonna go right left right left coming down to three into plank all right ready let's go for two minutes both now these two minutes go by so fast we're taking our time we're getting stronger and you're talking all right so my fifth and final tip for making new friends just honestly tell someone that you like them tell us what they have a girl crush on them um I know it can be scary and I know there is a chance for rejection but I also think that beautiful things come from telling people the truth about how you really feel and I also think it's cute wait but don't tell them what someone tells me that they like me other person they want to hang out more something like that and then you get some girl time to hang out and I remember meeting some new people and not knowing if they felt the same way about me I'm talking about like another one of my girlfriends and you could just tell both of us had this energy between us where we wanted to hang out more with each other and so eventually I was just like hey I really like you and she's like I like you too and then we just to hang out and we had a good time and then now we're really close friends and so I feel like if you just let somebody know how you feel you can really create a beautiful relationship so don't be afraid don't be afraid to open up so I really think it goes all the way back to that being open being vulnerable we're really trying to connect with somebody lastly I say like attract oh I trust like you attract your tribe with your vibe and you put out those positive energy vibes go find someone will like you back exactly who you are okay hold right there into that plank bring the feet in together come down slow drop the knees and back into Child's Pose inhale through the nose exhale through the mouth and go ahead and lift up rolling those shoulders back okay give yourself a big round of applause and I'm gonna I'm gonna air like you I'm gonna you're like you you guys thank you I hope you enjoyed those tips for making new friends I know it can be really scary but honestly just do it tell someone that you have a girl crash hold on and then maybe they'll feel the same way okay the worst thing that could happen is that they don't and then you move on all right I'll let me so much do this video a thumbs up and I'll see you next time bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]

you made it to this point and don't forget to subscribe I love you so much and I'll see you next time all right you 
[Music] hey guys Cassey here today we are gonna stretch it out I love stretching so much I wish I could do it more so wait instead of wishing for it I'm just gonna do it and I'm really excited because today we've got a ten-minute stretching video we're holding each movement for one minute each nice and long you're really gonna settle into it and at the same time we're going to talk about how to detox the negativity out of your life and create a positive mindset so really creating flexibility in your body in your mind in your emotions I think this video is gonna be very helpful alright that's good and get started I'm gonna start the timer right here we're beginning with the lizard so what I want you guys to do is go ahead and bring one leg forward just like so making sure that the knee is directly over the ankle now you can stay right here or you can bring the hands on to the inside really trying to push your pelvis forward now if you're feeling like you've got some extra flexibility in you what I want you to do is to come down onto the floor just like that and hold you're really going to open up the hips okay and I want you to open up your chest as well try not to hunched over like this if you got to do that then just stay on the hands okay I really want you to push that pelvis forth let's talk about number one I want you to say a positive affirmation now when I say that and when I tell people that they think of that silly video where you know some person is looking into the mirror telling themselves I love myself I'm beautiful and that sort of thing but like don't think about it as being silly think about it as it can actually help you and yeah I actually do do it to myself just not in front of a mirror so go ahead and switch what I do is when I am in a tough situation for example like if I'm trying to finish my last bicep curl and it is so hard and I feel like I just cannot I go come on you can do this you've got this you were so strong kasi you've got it I will actually say my name like under my breath like kind of like a crazy person I'm not but it really does work for me because I feel like I'm my own motivational coach and I know myself best and if I believe in myself and I know I can get through it I don't need anyone else to believe in me just me and so I say if you're feeling down if you're feeling negative sing a positive affirmation about yourself something that you want to be keep saying it because if you really want it that badly you will figure out a way to make it happen good guy is stretch a little bit longer breathe in your nose now go ahead and bring yourself up hands outside of the leg heel down into the mat lift yourself up into that healed pyramid so look everyone's level flexibility is going to be different if you feel like this is a little bit too much for you go ahead and place the legs down bring the hand here you can even lift up a little bit more it's up to you but if you can't get down the slow open up your chest lengthen your back and press your chest into your leg really feeling the hamstrings here and also the calf on the leg back there so let's talk about number two it's being grateful for the little things in life I think if you can truly appreciate when a stranger opens the door for you at the grocery store or when somebody you don't know smiles at you when somebody gives you a nice compliment like your hair looks nice today be grateful for that because those are the things that really make life so so sweet go ahead and bring your life back switch other leg comes in front heel into the mat press the other heel down as well flex the foot and press the chest into the mat being grateful is so important because nothing in life is given well nothing in life is really given to you nothing is owed to you you should not expect anything you should work hard for what you want and when nice things happen we really appreciate it and say thank you I think a lot of times people feel like so entitled that they don't want to tell others a quick little thank you people don't write handwritten thank-you notes anymore I really think it's important to even say thanks through a text anything let someone know that you care about them let them know that their little action did not go unnoticed I think that's a really important to live a life of positivity it's when you can share that positivity with others okay very good next now we have our figure for hope so you're gonna go ahead and come down bring one leg on to your thigh just like so pointing your toes and I want you to reach the arms board just like this we're gonna open up the hips you know work on the hamstrings oh well as well so look guys you can also be here like I said everyone's level flexibility is different but I want you to push yourself okay and number three is to learn how to turn your failures into lessons now this is all about changing your perspective okay because you can look at yourself as old poor me like I lost or whatever but really if you think about well okay I lost that race but you know what I learned that this is what I need to do to win this is how I get faster this is how it gets stronger it's a learning opportunity I think it's really about changing and shifting your perspective go ahead and switch on to the other side bring that leg out leg on top of the thigh reaching the chest forward and down okay yeah living that positive life it has to be about seeing solutions instead of seeing problems you know how sometimes there's those people that are just gonna say well you could lose a lot of money or you could totally fail you can not get into that school you want to get into did you try and guess what I'd rather try and fail then not try at all right so press that chest into the leg come a little bit farther reaching the crown of the head towards the toes hold hold hold yeah breathe in through your nose exhale through your mouth relax this feels so good opening up the hips lengthening that hamstring relaxing your chest into your leg okay slowly coming up wow I really found really really good okay we've got our leg twist so what I want you to do is go ahead and roll down with control grabbing on to either your leg you're outside calf right here or on to your foot if you're feeling super flexible okay I want you to bend the bottom leg and bring this leg cord whew I'm feeling that really open up your chest to the ceiling press the other hand into the floor so number four don't play the victim oh my gosh you know how sometimes there's people that are like oh it didn't work because so-and-so did this to me or did you do in the end you're in charge of your own life you're the CEO of your own life so whose responsibility is it for the way that you feel you ooh so I don't want you to play the victim I really want you to take charge go ahead and switch bring up the other leg flex the foot bend the knee and coming down whoa oh my gosh this is craziness yeah so what did I say take charge of your own life you have the power to control how you want to feel and you're not gonna give anyone else that power because it's your body your mind your soul your feeling is you got this one life to live on this earth we all average probably lives until I don't know is just safe 70 80 100 if you're lucky and you want to spend a majority of your life doing what you want not what other people are telling you to do that's gonna make you happy you want to live for you and so don't ever play the victim and if you do feel like a victim snap out of it and become the boss of your own life inhale through your nose and we really keep twisting bringing that leg even higher all righty now let's go ahead and come into a happy baby so what I want you to do is slowly road to helm again grab onto the outsides of your toes your big toes with two fingers hold it and bring the knees right into the armpits pretty much keep pressing down and then you're in a rock side to side this is a really good relaxing move it also really opens up the hips nice work good okay number five remember that no one is perfect and I say this because a lot of times our unhappiness comes from expecting a boyfriend a husband a friend a girlfriend to be a certain way and then we get really upset that they don't do what we want them to do keep staying here and then you have to just realize everyone has a back story no one's perfect but they can be as good as they can be in your life go ahead and come into this pose which I'm gonna call happy adult so you're gonna open it feels like super wide and press the legs in okay so using a little bit of your bicep strength here to rock back and forth really stretching out the legs yeah so here's the thing sometimes our friends can screw up sometimes our significant others can make us mad but the truth is if their intention is still good and they're not really trying to hurt you then I think that's something that's super forgivable and I think that as long as both of you are working towards a common goal as long as both of you are really trying to make each other happy then it's okay remember those times and remember that like I said not everyone's perfect but they can be as perfect as they can be in that moment in your life to take you to the next step and so on that note if you're in a relationship that may not be working out I know it's really sad but sometimes some people come into your life to move you on to that next that next level and then maybe there's someone else that can pick you up from there but every person plays a role in your life and I think we should be grateful for it whether they are playing evil role playing a positive role every role makes you stronger and you just need to realize what Bowl they are playing okay so go ahead and bring the knees into your chest give it a big big hug lengthen the arms forward lengthen the legs forward slowly roll up with control we're gonna end with a nice pike and bring it forward head into the shins hold it inhale through the nose exhale through the mouth and reaching a little bit farther four three two one and slowly lift up roll the shoulders back ah and breathe in through your nose exhale through your mouth give yourself a big round of applause you did incredible guys I hope you got a lot of this video not just physically but also mentally emotionally I hope you feel more open more deep talks and if you're ever feeling down watch this video again whether you're doing the stretches or not I think there's a lot of good messages in here and let me know in the comments below but you guys like to detox and what you do to feel better I love to hear your stories and how you have triumphed in times we're so good because I think that's when you become your own hero and I think that's really special all right guys give this video a thumbs up and I'll see you guys next time I love you so much bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
[Music] hey guys Cassey here so today we're going to talk about sleep now sleep is something that I used to take for granted when I was younger I thought I could get more done if I slept less like sneaking in a 12 a.m. workout instead of going to bed or pull an all-nighter instead of actually finishing my paper earlier in the week and it wasn't even until a couple years ago that I started going to bed before 12 I just found out that about 87 percent of Americans say that they have trouble falling asleep so if you guys want to learn how to sleep more and get healthier listen up here are five things that could happen if you don't sleep enough number one you'll start looking old you know how you get those bags under your eyes and those dark circles if you don't sleep enough well it turns out that if you continuously don't sleep enough those bags will basically become permanent get this size research actually shows that when you don't get enough rest you release a stress hormone called cortisol and in excess amount it breaks down the collagen in your skin which is the protein that you need to stay looking young number two your memory will deteriorate you know I've always had such a hard time remembering people's names or learning hoplites choreography and I didn't know that this is something I could actually control so if you're trying to learn something new like a new language you can learn it to a certain point while you're awake through practicing but then those practice skills are limited so something happens when you sleep that actually strengthens what you learn that process called consolidation number three your creativity will diminish breathing more actually makes me emotionally and creatively sharp so if you're an artist a writer an entrepreneur or someone that needs to just think outside the box you need to sleep on your bed while you sleep your brain not only consolidates your memories to make them stronger but it also reef structures and reorganizes them basically what it means is if I'm trying to cord wrap something for pop Pilates and it's supposed to be like eight Planck checks to four dancing dogs during the chorus and it keep like messing up every time I get to that part it means that when I go to sleep I'll somehow restructure that feeling of messing up and confusion into my brains but the next day when I get up and try to practice and I'm feeling like oh my gosh what's coming up next I feel confused and remember ah eight plain jacks and four dancing dogs number four you'll gain weight now I didn't realize how connected sleeping up and having a healthy weight were until like a few years ago lack of sleep mess with my metabolism and it increased certain hormones in my body like cortisol which made me feel hungry all the time instead of hungry all the time I ate more than I should have and I didn't even know where that hunger really came from because I really wasn't hungry I just felt hungry and to add on to that my lack of sleep added on to the stress going on inside my body because I had increased levels of cortisol which in turn deposited more fat's in my lower belly and as if this couldn't get any words University of Chicago researchers found out that dieters who slept more ended up losing more fat whereas dieters who didn't sleep enough well they ended up losing more muscle mass and you know how hard we worked for that muscle number five you're going to feel angry for no reason sleep and mood are very closely connected and when you don't sleep enough you're going to be irritable and I don't want to hang around you UPenn researchers tested subjects on four and a half hours of sleep per night basically what I was doing just a few years ago and not healthy don't do that and at the MV subjects reported feeling mentally exhausted angry instead and then when that happens you're likely to enter a vicious cycle and then you can't sleep because you're stressed out and then we'll go sleep-deprived people or put back on their regular sleep schedule they reported feeling so much happier come on guys have I convinced you to sleep more yet it's not like I'm asking you to rent a miles a day and only drink green juices no I can use to stay in bed a little bit longer I mean what kind of awesome so if you are in need as a sleep makeover I gotcha Covered here are some things you can do really easily to get the best quality sleep of your life first the one thing that always works for me is if I have a really intense workout at the beginning of the day it tires me out that at night I sleep like a baby this is a no-brainer put your phone to Do Not Disturb at night so you're not texting people when you're trying to get to bed next try not to look at your phone when you're in bed the light actually makes it really hard for me to follow see what really works for me is reading a book right before bed it helps calm me down and also contributes to Lane disease something that could really help you guys is if you try to stretch or meditate right before bed it will help you guys slow down the body and prepare it for bed finally try to go to bed at the same time every night this will allow you to create a routine your body can follow now usually these tips work for me but when I am jet lag and my time those are all super messed up I take sequel to help me fall asleep it makes me fall asleep in as little of 20 minutes and it's a little trick for getting in my seven to eight hours of sleep per night after my big trip so if any of you guys out there are having trouble falling asleep try zzzquil I always get the quality sleep I need plus I would feel refreshed and don't worry it's not a pain med and ever become dependent on it and I only use it when I need it all it does is block the histamine in your body so that helps be policy staff so guys I hope you have decided to make sleep a part of your daily routine it's just as important as eating clean or working out trust me I have been through it but probably one of the easier things you can incorporate onto your health journey whatever is keeping you up at night your boss the boyfriend the bills just shake it off for the night

just like that stretching out the legs the calves are stretching out the ABS opening up the chest there you go and I feel so different wearing entirely black I normally don't do this because the background is all white you're like it's a you don't wear my lips ever this rat unless it's for a photo shoot oh and back alright very good Matt's they have down dog but lift right so leg is gonna go pretty high here arms underneath the shoulders lifting all the way up I want you to lift up one leg okay now pulse pulse pulse just like that working the shoulders working the booty the lift lift

button into the spine nice good he going lift lift lift it's crazy I didn't think that I'd be feeling my shoulders as much but I definitely do beautiful words okay bring it down okay guys now we can do the same thing on the other side I want you to make sure the shoulders don't burn out so try to pull all the energy into your core here we go and lift lift squeezing my abs using my low back I'm not my butt and I'll see you like watch to lift the booty up and high point the toes now the amount that your leg is moving is not what matters it's how much you're squeezing okay so keep it nice and tight rich high high just like that and if you guys are working you're working on your flexibility right now don't worry about how high your leg goes that doesn't matter what matters is if you are pushing yourself as hard as you can alright guys so now we're heading into our hip twist so bring your elbows underneath the shoulders your hands are shoulder width apart all you're gonna do is tap and tap and tap just like that working our waistline okay my neck is in line with my back I'm not dipping my butt also isn't up in the air you want to inhale and exhale do not forget to breathe good strong arms now I know your shoulders might be a little bit tired from the down dog single like butt pulses but you'll be just fine come on working the obliques working the core you got five okay very

pushing through I know it's getting difficult this is when you've got to break through that mental barrier because that's all it is I know it feels hard typically but it is mental telling yourself you

eight minute workout you guys are amazing I love you so much and let me know the comes below what you're gonna be for Halloween okay bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
[Music] hey guys Cassey here today we're going to talk about kick button move for a kick butt light so like in the previous video we're going to go through five movements each one we do for two minutes each if it's a right and less than its one minute and one minute and during this process I'm going to talk to you about five ways you can really live your best life and lift your potential okay live your king blood leg okay so our five moves today are the straight leg pulses straight leg circles low rainbow butt crack butt kick and the side pulse um - this is gonna be fun okay so I am going to start the timer just shortly but before we begin let me go over proper form all right because we're holding each move for two minutes you want to make sure getting the most out of everything okay so palms flotsam at and nice wide fingers really gripping yourself down we're starting out with the straight leg pull your leg is going to be out like so flexing it your heel super strong you're simply going to lift and lower lift and lower alright here we go abs in shoulders rolling back eyes on the edge of your mat and all I want to do is to lift and lower lift and lower try your best to keep your legs super super straight okay you ready for the first um hip 14-foot life the first tip is to do more of what makes you happy and do less of what doesn't now it seems simple but you cannot imagine how many people don't follow this rule do you have a job that you don't like are you hanging around people that low-key make fun of you or don't make you feel good about yourself are you eating things that don't make you happy well really take a moment sit down and stop doing it do things that make you smile now you're having a chart hard time trying to figure out what makes me smile these are the things that come naturally to you the things that you gravitate towards that you do that no one has to tell you to do it things that you honestly who really love doing I want you to do more of those okay I'm switching right here other side leg straight left up and down look when you do more of what makes you happy it also makes you more confident it makes you a person who's fulfilled person who can really accept other people with happiness as well and you know what at the end of the day I really don't believe that happiness comes from success in making lots of money and owning cards and owning certain shoes and that sort of thing true success guys is finding and creating your own happiness in fact I'm I'm is a fine I'm going to say create happiness because this is a choice that you have this is something that you really build for yourself no one's going to give it to you alright you can't expect that you need to create the life that you want and this is the only life that you have so there's no excuse to be unhappy because you can make yourself happy by changing your environment by changing what you do really live your best life and um but ok cool our next one is straight like circles so going back to that first side we're listing us I simply want you to give me a mini baby circle just like that okay perfect our second tip is um basically Nike slogan just do it so I feel like a lot of people and hesitate they think too much about something that they end up thinking themselves and talking themselves out of just going for it and that's the beauty of [Music] sometimes kids don't know that much and that's let me just go forcing a fall look when a baby learns to crawl or when a baby learns to walk it doesn't even know that it's going to fall it's going to keep getting up and trying again and as they get older as we become adults you know all the things that you have you can break your knee and can break the phone and you're just so worried that you don't even try and that's the beauty of a finding your success is to not be so scared to fail switch okay so look don't hesitate I say just go for it because when you do hesitate actually things can go really really wrong so for example let's say you're about to do a backflip right you either give it everything or just don't do it at all because if you hesitate right before you do a backflip you might end up just crack in your neck or doing something crazy like that so just go full for it and here's the thing you will not know if you're going to be a hundred in success 100% successful unless you give it everything you have I would rather know that I gave it everything and I failed hard then like kind of give it halfway and be like oh well you know I could have been successful they just tried harder no don't do that go the whole way go the whole way so that you know for yourself your capabilities and your potential all right keep circling that leg as in super talented little circle simple you guys four three two one and perfect okay now to our low rainbow but you're going to lift up and come to the other side so check it out you're outside the map you're over the mat you're outside than that you're over the mat drawing that but already oh I'm not drawing the but drawing the rainbow that's hot we're dry okay number three don't live your life for other people oh man I did not learn this until college like look you guys know my parents wanted me to be a doctor and I didn't want to do that but I lived for them I live for them until about sophomore year of college and I was just so unhappy I was like am I really going to spend the rest of my life having a career from nine to five or even longer that I'm absolutely not going to love and why because my parents told me that I had to and yes her mom and dad brought me into this earth but I came to at the end of the day your parents just want you to be stable right they want you to not be on the streets that you want you to be able to feed yourself and so for my parents who are immigrants they wanted to make sure that I would be safe and for them having a strong foundation of Education meant success immense stability but for me coming from a different generation coming from a different time I knew that I could find success in a different way I wanted to find success you're doing things that may be happy which prospective tip number one right because when you put your full force into something you really work hard at that passion you're not looking for the paycheck guys you're looking for do so good the money was going to come to you and I know that the really broad out of statement so let me tell you it is so true do not be bound to your paychecks I want you guys to live and be good at what you do and then you will be rewarded I promise II okay so don't look for other people live for yourself this is your life after all and yeah don't be a people pleaser okay you're awesome number four we got our cross but pick so and bring the knee over the knee you bring it out the firefighters and you're gonna take it and come back okay ready here we go and it's out and in quote okay I feel like doing all this talking um and also very like not calculated what's the word all this very almost like blogs like talking while working out kind of like cardio workout I know Beyonce goes on the treadmill and she seemed to prepare for concerts I'm totally not doing that but what I'm saying is that this is a lot harder so cool uncle I'm challenging myself is something different okay on and number four don't affect anything oh man one of my biggest pet peeves are people who feel entitled like what notes being brought here on this earth does not does not mean that any one of you anything other side you guys need to earn everything that you want cake now look if you're giving something does it feel as good as if you had to work your butt off to win that thing or whatever it is to get that career to get that guy or to get that girl you know how it feels so much better when you actually had to earn it so I think living a kick-butt life means you work hard you work hard and you work March for what you guys want okay I don't think you should ask people for things that you don't deserve I think you can't you let people know that you deserve something I'm showing them how hard you can work so I think that works for pretty much everything in life take it low go hard don't expect but work hard and earn okay alright make sure you guys do that few more one more my butt is so pretty right now and out oh I will let you how to put that there soon okay number five side okay so bring that leg out right here all the way out to the side what do I do lift lift oh my goodness this is so painful my glutes everything are on fire so I'm going to distract myself I thumbs up tip number five is the lead the negative people out of your life and I think this worked for real people as well as people that you follow on Instagram Facebook Twitter YouTube whatever if you're watching someone who are around someone who doesn't make you feel good about yourself just get rid of them and here's a cool thing with social media once you delete them they're actually literally not in your life now it's a little bit harder when we talk about our parents or our siblings or people that we actually have to live with that's a very different thing and my suggestion for that is either one if you're able to financially able to then maybe move away move away from those people who are not making you feel good about yourself and if not then try to have them understand what you're going through I think a lot of problems arise out of miscommunication and people just making up stories about what they think of others instead of just talking it out I think the power of conversations the power of communication is so strong if both sides can come to understand what they're going through then you're really going to erase a lot of negativity okay I don't know if you guys can see this but I am sweating my legs are shaking and wait up it seems like a plan all right come on keep going so if you guys are around any people or following any people from making you feel less than I suggest you right now go through your IG your FB and unfriend or unfollow because I think that will be one of the best things that you can do right now to make yourself a lot happier look at this I'm sweating down my armpit it is so hot right now and that was amazing guys congratulations you just made it through your five kick button move for a cape but life and I hope you really enjoy that give this video a thumbs up and then let me know in the comments below and what you're currently going through right now what you need a little bit more motivation on and I'd love to talk about that in the next video I love you guys so much don't forget you guys are amazing and

[Music] hey guys Cassey here and welcome to another episode of cheap clean AIDS I am super excited and pumped today because we are doing a video on energy boosting you know sometimes an afternoon you get that like afternoon swamp and really basically fall asleep at your computer when you're studying or doing work sometimes it's because you hungry and you need some extra food and energy inside of you so today I'm going to show you how to make for energy boosting snacks and each one features a little something from graze and I love these because they're already pretty portion so you can't overdo it and have a really nice and interesting flavor profile the for recipes we're djr the protein is strawberry crunch apple pie overnight oats power popcorn and the fruit and seed smoothie Bowl let's go ahead and get started so first we're gonna start off with the protein crunch strawberries guys this is so easy to make you only need three ingredients your strawberries some cashew butter or nut butter of your choice and also some type of a granola today I'm using these strawberries and cream protein granola topper strawberries are gonna do is come in here give it a little dippy tip about like three-quarters of the way the cashew butter is going to keep you very safe it's healthy fats you dip that little guy right here right in its dipping bucket Salt Pond see now the difference between this granola topper and you know just a regular one you can get at the store is that it has an added protein that looks like a tadpole ten strawberries is the perfect amount for this granola topper package mm-hmm mm-hmm if you love apples and peanut butter bananas and peanut butter any fruit and nut butter this will blow your mind and these little bits of strawberry and yogurt oh gosh this entire combination is just live right now [Music] next we were making some overnight apple pie oats so if you guys are like I don't have any time to make breakfast in the morning no excuses because you can make this at night chill it in the fridge and boom you've got breakfast what I have here is some chopped apple some rolled oats some chia seeds Greek vanilla yogurt some cinnamon for flavoring stevia or any type of sweetener that you would like to use some almond milk and Eleanor's apple crumble as a topping go ahead and put in my oats first there goes my Greek yogurt almond milk ooh some chia seeds stevia some apples soaked in all of that goodness and some cinnamon oh I love smells it just smells like fall go ahead and grab your lid place it on a mason jar it's time to chill it overnight and we're imagining that I just woke up in its morning time our overnight oats are now expanded top it with some more apples finally I'm going to add the Amman or apple crumble the reason why I really like having oats is because they have a lot of soluble fiber and that means it is a slow-burning karge gives you sustained energy so this whole thing is just perfect mmm this is fall in a cup if you love fall and everything about it this is what you need to make now we're going to make some power popcorn so this is really good to have when you're studying or working just thing really easy to pick out and it's a lot so it's gonna keep you full starting out with some popcorn right here I already pop this I love watching the bag fit like watching a zombie cool I have some freeze-dried bananas oops and I forgot to spray my bowl first that you can do it now can help coat everything some powdered peanut butter cinnamon to help stabilize your blood sugar stevia or any type of sweetener that you would like hasn't left a repeater better yes some salted fudge peanut cookie to give it that extra pizazz mmm did you just need my eyes light up the flavor in here was so different it's make me do ninja moves [Music] and finally we have your smoothie bowls with these just make you wanna do left fit we got ourselves some frozen pineapple and I'm you put it in the food processor if you don't have a food processor you can totally use blender but only if it's strong enough K because I hate we get stuck so frozen blueberries frozen grapes which by the way is a great snap on its own so cold right now frozen Meniere's see if I can get them evenly in both of my bowls bow now we're going to top it with some vanilla Greek yogurt but you can use any yogurt of your choice finally I'm going to add in some natural vanilla seeds which is pretty much just Hunkin and sunflower seeds that are covered with the vanilla flavoring so they look like snow-capped perfect Mountains mmm it's all good and have so much energy right now there is no reason for you to grab that bag of potato chips or that fried whatever when to make really easy healthy snacks at home I hope

me your right knee right knee to the chest extending that leg you want you to lift up your leg now if you're feeling super tight maybe you're right here maybe you want to hold a towel but if you're feeling really good about yourself keep those hips square and pull it in stretching that leg now what I really like to do is I like to move my leg from the right to the left to really get all heads of the hamstring that just relax your shoulders relax your back allow the belly button to move into the spine good stuff and pull it in a little bit more and bring it down oh okay other side guys that feels so good go ahead and bring your left knee into your chest give it a big hold nice then I want you to lift at the leg again depending on your flexibility grab a towel or maybe hold right here hold it hold it if you're feeling good about yourself go ahead and bring that leg in my left hamstring is always a lot tighter than my right cuz in injury I had a long long time ago in college um when I was doing the splits after dance routine I just kind of fell into it and then I heard something pop and let's just take it let's just say it took about a year to even get my leg right here when I was just in bed stretching at night it was terrible um and now I want you to bring your leg to the right and left nice and slow you can relax your hand do whatever you want with the other one again getting all heads of the hamstring and bringing the hands above the head in health the nose on the exhale lift yourself up with control hiking moving the butt cheeks and bringing the chest into the thighs crown of the head towards the toes hold and slowly lift up and you guys that was amazing give this video a huge thumbs up if you made it this far that was extremely hard I did not expect it to be that hard and I clearly was dying my legs were shaking and if that's how you felt - awesome because that means you really really push yourself these exercises are not easy I think a lot of times people look at Pilates and think oh that's a great exercise or how can that possibly work your body but honestly tell most people to give pop Pilates to try and they will understand you know mean like get your friends do it your husband your boyfriend whoever anyone who's doubting you can do it and they understand how strong you are okay guys I love you so much and I will see you in our next workout bye just keep on [Music]
