On basically repeating the same things I said re: criticism of bloggers 8, then 5 , then 2 years ago and now in 2016 https://t.co/txXzk4kykD. @LorraineELLE @ELLEUK ... Who want to make it in this industry. If they see blogging as their route, then why shouldn't that be valid?. @LorraineELLE @ELLEUK Of course - completely acknowledge that. But they are also a handful of positions in amongst thousands of ppl.... And maybe stop running @MrStreetPeeper's photos and gaining their site clicks, if those women in 'paid-to-wear' outfits are so repugnant. ... and for the ivory tower to remain forever that.  Towering and impenetrable.. So it basically boils down to the same criticism I heard eight years ago.  The fashion establishment don't want their circles enlarged.... The Twitter comments when #absolutelyfashion was on regarding the staff diversity of @BritishVogue were not far off.. And I wonder why that is? Those higher echelons of magazine title positions are hard to reach and not accessible to everyone.. It's just that bloggers sadly don't have prestigious titles/publications to hide behind and represent themselves solely.. Secondly, bloggers who wear paid-for outfits or borrowed clothes are merely doing the more overt equivalent of that editorial-credit system.. ... that are stuffed full of credits that are tied to paid advertising but not explicitly stated as such.. Firstly let's not pretend that editors and stylists are not beholden to brands in one way or another, getting salaries at publications....

One good thing about us possibly going out the Euros - those heinous  #ENG fans see on @Channel4News can stop terrorising French cities. @midipiddock and this is what they called 'taking back control'.... @RogeroftheRaj agreed - can't really rely on central government to campaign for these initiatives though sadly.... @RogeroftheRaj providing funds we 'recuperate' from the EU will be properly re-channeled into those areas... doubtful of that happening 🙄. @ClaudeRdCardiff and of course, because the 'arts' and 'sciences' are seen as irrelevant to central government, these issues can be skirted. Why waste #BBCQT rehashing old ground- wanted to know how EU funding for arts/research/regeneration programmes was going to be made up?. Throwback to eating with Bill Cunningham in a Vietnamese restaurant in Paris and all he wanted was a fruit salad. RIP.. Mood https://t.co/AMu8g1SnGN. @danielle_fleet https://t.co/vB18vbbRCj. @danielle_fleet #Remainers are not the ones exhibiting this behaviour, merely commenting on it. @danielle_fleet that's not what I'm suggesting but there are some dangerous attitudes being encouraged by this campaign.. From Labour frontbencher @SeemaMalhotra1 - and so the true face of Leave begins to reveal itself... https://t.co/cl2mlPFJ5U. @misternewton at the very least they should have widened vote to 16/17 yr olds. @misternewton no in an irreversible referendum I do have a problem regardless. Who is dumb, and who is dumber? https://t.co/GdjrLKbm8C. @AskMrMickey it's what has driven a lot of ppl to vote Leave unfortunately... 😢😢😢. @Fashionista_com sorry to nag but it's not just about body shaming but also about encouraging ppl to embrace their own unique style. Frustrating convo going on my Insta feed about 'good' and 'bad' immigration https://t.co/maZvUJBaWr https://t.co/TFL71nhi6C. RT @FT: Regions with the biggest votes for Leave are also the most economically dependent on the EU https://t.co/j5LS9paSOV https://t.co/Kj…. @the_nittygritty perhaps a more positive spin to my comment would have been to allow 16/17 yr olds to vote to balance the decision. @the_nittygritty well no, because unlike a General Election, this is an irreversible decision. @the_nittygritty but which age group will ultimately pay the higher price?.

it's four-thirty we have tea we have cakes we also have the observer and today we're reviewing but a new magazine for men for men the editor's letter yep the guy will Steve Doyle the Knicks tension between kind of character got a really curly moustache that's mine from November is to grow something quite like that oh yes moustache for prostate cancer yes something like that explain what that is again don't explain that we're going to do it's lame but well I'm still trying to make the connection between rebirthday ring boy hook between prostate cancer and mustache it's like a like a symbol like the poppy is for Remembrance Sunday moustache is for like male cancer ok let's get back onto the magazine back onto the subject yeah so buck is aimed at 20 to 30 somethings HP sauce mustard that phone is quite interesting because I just jumped into the magazine and the first page is 10 things from 10-10 foodstuffs what neal's yard dairy cheese I hate cheese and for those that don't know I have a really really big fear of cheese and then it goes from like food from cheese to street style my favorite things from cheese to treat with it kind of aims at the 3s fashion food and furniture apparently ok the three magic x I'll see this is nice i like how they've split up london into north south east and west though I can't really attention it's nice that they have accepted their key reference yeah well maybe the east london circa little bit yeah that's here and it's not just London night be Cody yeah go stick or something come back tokyo bustling eyes no way dear I'll geographies

quite like the chief stupid but yes quite like the style oh yeah münster I'm anything but everything too much versus you of fashion actually but it's nice to see a bit of style it's the London issue is Miriam the next issue is our new york issue interesting so I thought buck was going to be like a London centric men's magazine so he's focusing on the boat so but it going to be local you're gonna flirt yes available three ways to wear buttoned up shirts see when you put these sort of statements in in women's magazines it sounds sort of contrived and silly but when you put it in men's magazine it sort of makes sense why is that like if we put the same state with three ways to wear because hmm I like the father the news I think that helps fonts rule so you could put any statement in this bond and it would look good yes okay note and diced excuse so this is the first fashion jewelry them yeah that's a toilet yeah boy yeah oh stop by Elliott James Naismith we like Elliot we do it is very Elliott though the styling it's the same point that like uses close yeah no there's nothing okay well I think you're going to have to help me fit the page now this I saw earlier and I thought it was quite funny yes interesting we've always kind of love I threatened to do hair style things you've always never had confidence enough to do it but yeah well we're a start you don't have enough hair because this dude has plenty of hair to do something like a quip and look it's got it's not like construction happy but i'm not sure that i haven't read i haven't read magazines with step-by-step instructions like beauty instructions in a long time like Nazis I don't know when I was a teenager likely i think magazines like this and I'm learning from them naughty online world that have kind of like lots of men start dogs I happen yes it is a present another thing that would look really really weird if I if I saw this and vogue or something but somehow it sort of looks funny here I think it is wrong ever get this kind of look you can go here yeah interesting for a men's magazine you don't see many other yeah i like i like these close-up shots of interiors kind of like what the Selby's

like Christmas that marking is outside of the m25 I can't believe ya see you see that but it's good for me I'm selfish so I like it oh I'm gonna continue by me so we've got introductions to markets
