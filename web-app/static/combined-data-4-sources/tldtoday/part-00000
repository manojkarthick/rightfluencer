- Yo guys, Jonathan here. Welcome back to another
episode of The Best Tech and Gadgets Under 50 Bucks. Today, we are kicking it off
with a pair of truly wireless earbuds that are a fraction
of the price of AirPods, didn't get cracked in the
face with an ugly stick like the clones I just looked at, and also surprisingly
don't sound half bad. So these are the AXGIO Dash,
which are clearly named after a very similar product in the space, but the idea and the intent here is to be a budget alternative
at a much lower price point. What I think stood out to
me most with these, though, is the fact that the pairing
process was not a giant, smash your face into a desk session, which I think is what
you'd normally expect with most truly wireless
earbuds at this price point. So on the headphones
is what they're calling a multifunction button
and what you're gonna do is hold this for six to eight seconds, and then once you see a red and blue light blinking and alternating, that
means you're ready to pair. Now normally, with other
truly wireless earbuds, you would need to repeat
this exact same process with the other earbud, cross your fingers, pray to Korean Jesus they
somehow didn't fall out of sync and magically work together
and the end of this nightmare. But with these, you simply power them on and they are magically connected. On top of that, I'm gonna reiterate, they don't look ridiculous. They're stealthy, they got that ear hook so they got that sporty look to 'em, and alternatively, as a
result of that ear hook, they're gonna stay in your
ears really, really well. So with these, if you're
gonna use 'em for workin' out or for running, not
only are they gonna stay locked down in your ears,
they are also waterproof, and that's something that the Beats X at three times the price
doesn't even offer. Beyond that, after all is said and done, if these sound like garbage,
none of those features matter. The good news is they
don't sound like garbage. They're not gonna be
Audiophile great headphones, they're not gonna sound
better than the AirPods, the Jaybird X3, the Beats X wireless. But for the price, nearly
a third of the price point, they actually sound surprisingly good. So next up is the Brightech
USB desk and table lamp which is sittin' right next to me. Truth be told, I actually ordered this for the next desk setup, which is geared to hit the $500 budget. But if you guys are excited for that, if we can hit 25,000 likes, I will drop that video this week. So jumping back to the product. It is no secret that I love
lamps, I love lighting, and therefore I am
constantly on the lookout. And this one is special because not only does it produce light, it
also charges your phone. Now for sure, if you're
using this on your desk, let's say next to your computer,
having an extra USB port to charge your phone really
isn't that big of a deal, but on the flip side where I
can see this being more useful and more practical is
somewhere like next to your bed where you can then charge
your phone at night. Now as far as the lamp itself
aesthetically, it is killer. And as much as I love colored lighting, I've really grown fond of
practical, warm lighting like this because it adds this really
relaxing tone to the room. And I don't care if you're shooting video or just comin' home to your setup, having something that is
aesthetically and visually appeasing kind of just
makes you feel good inside. (sings Batman theme song) Now if you were eyeing that
sweet iPhone right there, no, that is not a jet white iPhone. What it is is a super
clean skin from ColorWare. If you're thinking to
yourself, "I thought ColorWare "was that company who did
ridiculously awesome paint jobs," they just dropped a bomb in the skin game. On a serious note, though,
what separates ColorWare is their expertise in
paint and customization where they can then apply it to the skins which results in something truly badass. Honestly they have one of the
coolest looking color options for the Google Pixel out right now. And not only are these under 50 bucks, they actually start at under 15. You guys can check out the link below for the endless amount of customization, but I've actually teamed up with ColorWare to give away a custom wrapped iPhone 7. Next up is a really great lookin' wireless mouse from Lenovo. This is the N50 which has
this really cool, unique diamond prism design that
would look great on any desk. It's actually very similar
in terms of looks and design to the Logitech performance MX. It is less customizable, but that in turn yield
a lower price point. Right now this guy is currently
sitting under 40 bucks, and on top of its 10 meter wireless range, what's a nice touch is the fact
that you can actually store the USB receiver when you are
taking this mouse on the go. I guarantee you at some point
this is gonna make its way into one of my video because honestly, it is really hard to
find good looking mice. Apologies, Stuart Little. But the looks combined with the
fact that it functions well, it's priced even better,
makes this a fantastic all around wireless mouse. So next up is this strange lookin' device on the camera right here. And while it may look funny,
it is actually very useful for you videographers out there. So this is the lens shifter,
and what it's geared for is either to pull focus or
to adjust zoom in and out. In this case, because I'm on a prime lens, the only parameter I can control is focus, but in the case we're on a zoom lens and you wanted to control
both focus and zoom, there's a matching red version so you can easily tell the two apart. Now I guarantee someone
out there's gonna say that is stupid, I could
pull focus with my hands. What do you suck at video
or something, Jonathan? And to that I say once
you get past that mindset and start to use tools
like this to help you, you can then take your mind
off the tedious portion and therefore focus on the creative parts. (electronic music) What's also cool with this is
the fact that it's adjustable, so it should work with
lenses ranging from 56 up to 98 millimeters in diameter. And like I mentioned, it will work with both
zoom and prime lenses. So if you're someone out
there shooting video, maybe struggling with focus pulls, maybe they're not as smooth
as you would like them to be, something as inexpensive
and effective as this could make all the
difference in the world. So last up is the elago D Stand. Get your mind out of the gutter. So what this actually is is
a multipurpose charging dock geared for lightning-equipped
Apple devices. I do think this looks best, honestly, with the AirPods or the Apple TV remote. If you do for whatever
reason wanna charge your Apple wireless keyboard you
can, but it looks silly. And again, like most of the
products featured in this video, not only is this under 50, right
now it's actually under 20. It looks great, build quality is fantastic and just like the mouse, it's
gonna look great on your desk. The one thing I do
wanna point out, though, is that it seems like it's geared for Apple-specific lightning cables. So if you wanna use this
with a third party cable, you're not gonna get the best results. Apart from that, though,
especially if you're gonna use this to dock and charge your AirPods, this is a great, inexpensive option that fits the bill perfectly. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. If you're wonderin', "How do
I win that sweet iPhone 7?" Details are down below. And if you haven't yet, definitely
make sure you subscribe. Got a lot of killer content comin' up, including the $500 desk setup. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (beep) Damn, I rolled that R, I was like-- (rolls R) 
yo guys johnathan here welcome to the flip phone challenge where I'm going head-to-head against Ralphie where we're going to try and complete what normally would be some very easy tasks now huge shot it's a great call for sending out the Jitterbug flippin spawns from this challenge I know the initial reaction especially with the being 2016 might be to laugh off a flip phone but the fact of the matter is sometimes smart phones can be a little overbearing and complicated especially for someone like grandma or grandpa with this you're getting a simplistic incredibly easy to use phone the giant buttons make it super easy to see and navigate and the yes/no navigation system is actually kind of genius for example when you're in the camera it's either yes or a no to take a picture and I don't know if I could explain that any easier to Grandma the customer service is fantastic which you will see why later on and lastly it also doubles as a safety device with a dedicated button for 24/7 support so first up we're going to do a little t9 typing your 49 before multiple times so what we're going to do is try to type some coherent sentences we got a few recommendations the first of which for mr. marques Brownlee the crisp brown fox jumped over the 240p dog mmm crispy just the way I like 240 feet is not Oh so we have 60 seconds to type a coherent sentence we're going to text it to each other and whoever gets the most accurate and I guess fastest wins go brown what else Q it's 7 over you're on over yep dog you done see ya yeah thanks ready with the same dude that's that spot-on and no errors I even put the peanuts to the tube for you I'm Rick Harrison and this is my pawn shop I work here with my old man and my son big Hoss Eiling will finish in nope hey come on were you at were you at Harrison still oh this is my chance go I must name some big guys good day for every cameras done you see how much I typed I guess you win oh so Ralphie takes that round we're moving on to round 2 we're gonna see who can answer and hang up the coolest by flipping the phone I'm gonna tweet you guys to call us right now hello I'm great what's cracking yeah I'm actually not on the pixel right now you two men Rafi's gonna hang up now I love you how's your day going you know who you're talking to this is Austin Evans the flick of the wrist me ah all right we got one more call coming in so I'm gonna hang up in style all right who's the winner ah you got flippy Davis yes really I gotta get is that so next after our one-to-one battle we're gonna see who can take the best selfie on this phone ready set go okay where's my camera I still got your mind yeah so you guys let us know who took the best selfie with a comment down below team John or team Ralphy so for the last and final challenge we're going to settle this rock paper scissor style the winner has to die for one one and have who delivered but the loser has to call our food in and then find a taxi to pick it up oh and I go Randy win please go over not today okay good your mark right set rock paper scissors rock paper scissors man jitter back yes I'm mr. Dubey I'm looking for the nearest college junior please man yeah I'm actually looking for also a taxi service estimated time of arrival is three minutes so just make sure the phone is terribly not cool I appreciate it we gotta go boys I left this here in three minutes take a seat move man that's impressive though like for real a few moments later Oh step aside man we got the banquet here Oh what's wrong man I never called in any order good man you get ready to take over the cordon no it's a good way so there you have it that was pretty impressed not only did you find Carl's jr. you got a lift so just in case grandma or grandpa gets hungry I need a ride they're taking care of and they were really nice they save the number in your phone thank you guys very much for watching hopefully enjoyed the video if you did and you're feeling like Manasa make sure to smash that like button these are 25% off through December you guys can check that out down below along with Ralphie's Channel big thumbs up for him he actually kind of kicked my butt on this challenge so hats off and I'll see you guys later 
- [Man On Video] How 'bout
that wireless charging, though? - Wireless charging would be amazing! Yo guys, Jonathan here. Without a doubt, the Galaxy S8 is one of, if not the best smartphones out right now. It's putting a ton of pressure on Apple for the next iPhone release
and that poses the question: Is the iPhone 8 worth waiting for? (upbeat music) - What model should Apple launch next? Should it be the iPhone 7S,
iPhone 7S Plus, and the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus? - So, while we don't know officially know what Apple's gonna be
calling their next iPhone, I think they pretty much need to go with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, and that really comes
down to the Galaxy S8. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus
were unique in the sense that they pretty much
shared the exact same design as the iPhone 6 and 6S and,
for me, what it comes down to, I think if Apple were to release
the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, there would automatically
be this mental connection that the 7 would be inferior
to the 8 of the Galaxy S8, and I don't think Apple
would wanna go that route. - Hey, Jon. Woke up just now and saw
your Instagram story. Wanted to ask which has got a better fingerprint sensor positioning. Is it the iPhone 8 leaks
or the Samsung Galaxy S8? - So that is a very interesting
question, my friend. I'm gonna preface this by saying I really, really, really, really,
really like the Galaxy S8, it is an amazing phone
with amazing features, but the fingerprint reader
location is not one of them. Now, with Apple, what
makes this interesting is, for the first time in a really long time, we are actually playing the guessing game. I guess because this will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, allegedly Apple is testing
like 10 different models, which is crazy. That leaves us in the dark, which I like, but the end result is two possibilities as far as Touch ID goes. The first location, which would be ideal if Apple could pull this off, would be underneath the display. It's very similar to what Samsung did with their Infinity Display
and their virtual Home button, it would just take it one step further with the fingerprint reader
on the front of the phone, not forcing Apple to
move it towards the back. That, though, does not seem
to be an easy task at all. Samsung could not pull
it off with the Galaxy S8 and reportedly Apple is
having a ton of problems implementing this on their
own with the iPhone 8, and, if that's the case,
it's gonna force them to place it on their second option on the back of the phone
right below the Apple logo. Now, either way, based off those rumors, I think the iPhone 8 is going
to have the better location as far as the fingerprint reader goes, and that honestly comes down to almost a case of winning by default. Because the placement on
the Galaxy S8 is so bad, unless Apple completely
matched that and copied that, they will inherently
have a better location. But, with that said, if
Apple does go the back route, I'm gonna say the LG G6 has a better spot than both these phones. - Hey, Jonathan. My name's Nathan from Jakarta, Indonesia and here's my question for you: What is your favorite feature
on the GS8, Galaxy S8, that others doesn't have. - That is pretty much a no-brainer. Hands down my favorite feature would be... (laughing) Bixby. On a serious note, though,
what I think is really cool and sometimes a little overlooked with the Galaxy S8 is Bluetooth 5.0. And if you're not aware,
what that allows for is for the Galaxy S8 to send
two separate Bluetooth streams to two separate devices where you can then control them separately
and independently. - Hey, Jonathan, hope you're doing well. What would you like to
see in the next iPhone? - Shout out to your baby,
I think he might be hungry. But as far as what I would
like to see on the iPhone, I think I'm gonna reiterate
how cool it would be if Apple could successfully implement
Touch ID underneath the screen. I would've loved to see Samsung
do that with the Galaxy S8, so if Apple could do that with
iPhone 8 it would be amazing. Now, beyond that, something that maybe isn't iPhone 8 feature specific
but rather a chess move that Apple could do for Samsung including higher-end
headphones with the Galaxy S8, would be to include AirPods
with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Is that gonna happen? More than likely not because Apple's gotta make those margins, but I think that would
be a huge selling point and a really attractive feature
of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. (thumping upbeat music) Hey man, this guy wants
to know if I like sunsets. - You see that? - Yeah.
(hand slapping) (laughing) (yelling)
(hand slapping) Say who's your daddy. - Okay, he's my daddy! - Hi, so I'm just wondering, what do you think Google's doing right now to compete with the latest
phones on the market, like the iPhone 7 and,
of course, the Galaxy S8. So, I just wanna know that. - So, switching gears for a second from the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8, as far as what Google is doing to compete with Apple and Samsung, honestly, I think the release
of the Pixel and Pixel XL was their move into the game. Sure, it was missing premium features like wireless charging, water resistance, but they made huge
impact with their camera. As many of you know, the Galaxy
S8 has a phenomenal camera, but I'm willing to bet there are plenty of Pixel owners out there that would put their camera up against the Galaxy S8 any day of the week, and there is a reason why. So that combined with the fact it is a pure Google phone
with a pure Google experience has kept people satisfied
and so much in fact that they haven't felt the need to jump over to the Galaxy S8. - How do you feel about
the wireless charging on the upcoming iPhone. - So, for real, talking
about wireless charging, and I've talked about this before, if Apple does implement wireless charging, which I think they very well
might with the next iPhone, they're going to have to do it right. What I mean by that is taking
wireless charging up a notch, because, if we're being honest, you know as well I do
wireless charging right now is not that cool. You still need a dock or a pad, which is then connected to a wire, and then you need to
perfectly place your phone on that dock or pad or, if you don't, you might not charge your phone. What would be amazing is if Apple could implement a charging radius where, let's say, you place your phone maybe in a five foot vicinity anywhere on there, but it is still getting the charge. That way maybe say you're going to bed and your whole nightstand
becomes that charging zone, instead of fiddling and messing around with placing it perfectly, you just toss it on there anywhere and you're getting the
charge through the night. - Yo, what's up Jonathan,
it is SenshiPro on YouTube and I was just wondering
how much of video gainz do you think the iPhone 8 will be getting, especially with the leaked
rumor of the vertical lenses. So, thanks. - Now as far as those video gainz, which you can get at s2apparel.com. Right now, if you haven't seen, there's a rumor of Apple
switching the orientation of those dual cameras from
horizontal to portrait. Now, the reason behind that switch actually has more to do with what Apple could potentially do
with augmented reality as opposed to an improvement
in video and picture quality. What I would like to see,
however, as far as improvements go is a better secondary lens. Right now portrait mode
on the 7 Plus is awesome, having the ability to switch between two focal lengths is cool, but when you do that you definitely notice a quality difference
between the two lenses. What it comes down to
is the secondary lens on the iPhone 7 Plus simply isn't as good as the primary in terms of low light, that has an f-stop of 1.8, whereas the secondary
has an f-stop of 2.8, so that is a huge difference
as far as light goes. With that being said, though, if Apple can match those
two on the next iPhone so there isn't a huge difference
switching back and forth, that would be awesome. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. If you want a chance to be featured in a video just like this, hit me up on Instagram and keep
an eye out for the next Q&amp;A. Also if you want to see how
the current iPhone stacks up against the Galaxy S8,
check out this video here. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. (camera beeping)
I hate the Bixby button, man! I just wanna change the
volume and hit Bixby. (hand slapping) 
- Hey guys, Jonathan
here from YouTube.com/tld here with the Superfied Talk,
got some very special guests the one and only Sara Dietschy - Oh you can't do that! I was ready to do the
hey guys, this is Austin - He mixed it up. - Wait your turn. - Hey guys. - It's okay, you can do it. - And always lovely, Austin Evans. Today we are talking AI, where
it's at with smartphones, where it's head of the future and potentially how it could
affect love and relationships. So as I, from your perspective, what would be one thing you
would want that would be helpful on a relationship level. - On a relationship
level, probably you know I think it could offer insights
in terms of the other human you know, so say you're in
a relationship and maybe they had some bad emails come
through some bad text messages maybe the phones kind of
gaging their emotional state and then the significant
other gets a notification Hey, you gotta, kind of like tip toe around your other person's feelings today cause they had a rough one. - Okay I take back everything
I said before, this is amazing I need this in my life. - Right? I feel like it
would save relationships. - It's like having a
real assistant, right? Like not like something
just super basic but like imagine having an actual
friend to be over your shoulder like hey you don't see this but you're messing up in a big way. Pay attention and obviously
that's a little bit over the top and obviously your phone
is not going to be like that person yet but you
can kind of see like as things sort of start developing
that there's that sort of potential that it could
actually be something that's super useful in life. - So in nut shell,
hopefully it's gonna save - Relationships everywhere. - Everywhere. - Yes, I'm just gonna rely on the phone to be thoughtful for me. - You might fall in love with the phone, there might not have to be
another significant other. - Yeah that kind of got
me thinking right there when you talked about
about how it's reading your messages and emails like - Yeah - In a weird way it's gonna know that
you had a bad day right? (laughing) - It's the best personal assistant. - Or hey, maybe you're texting
this person, calm down. - Well, I never thought about that but talking in terms of relationships and love-life and stuff, you know maybe your phone can give
you red flags or something. - Like, are you sure you want to say that? No no no that's a bad idea. (laughing) - Yeah yeah yeah, it can
give you some advice, some dating advice. - It kind of works like
that to a degree right now because I mean when you go to
open up a text or something it will start to sort of auto
fill what you're going to say and it's like oh right, don't
say that, you're an idiot. You know, like there's some things that like you can start with but then you imagine as it
gets smarter and smarter and it really knows like oh this is the
relationship with this person... - More personalized - Yeah exactly, it's just like hey, remind that this is your birthday or this is an anniversary or
something like it can actually be proactive and be
thoughtful when you aren't, although I'm always thoughtful,
don't worry about that part. It's not for me, it's for other people
who aren't thoughtful. - Right right. - I'm gonna bet that you're
going to get the notifications that say, Hey bring flowers home. - No, never. I don't know
what you're talking about. But it's cool to think that as technology gets better and better that there's all these
possibilities that open up just as the tech that we use every day gets smarter and smarter. - And I think it's about
enhancing real life to where it's not all
about phone phone phone, but it's how can we take this technology, bring it to the real world, how can it enhance your love life. - It's like when you're on
a date and it's like hey, get off your phone. - Exactly. - Like don't look at me anymore. (laughing) That would be a great idea. - That's gonna be the savior right there. So I'm excited to see where it
heads in the future with that We just talked about AI,
and I got a surprise. - A surprise? Oh boy. Tell me more. - Close your eyes. - Okay. - Don't close your eyes. - Ooh, I think I know what this is. - What is it? - It is the Honor V10. - Now word on the street is this is packing some power inside. - Yeah, well it's got
the Kirin 970 processor, which I'm about to go
totally into nerd town but it's really cool, so not only is it a powerful processor in sort of the traditional sense but it has a dedicated
neural processing unit which essentially means that there's machine learning built in, stop looking at me like that, you know this gets me excited, this is cool stuff okay? So what it's doing, it's actually not only it gives you some cool features which we'll probably
talk about in a minute but also it is learning right? So the idea is not only is it
powerful and doing a lot today but it's only going to
get better as time goes on as it just learns more
and more about what you do it's more app supportive, there's just a lot of interesting stuff that it's going to be able to do. - Now what I think is cool is if you imagine it in
the work environment so say your team all had
these in their pocket. - So the idea that everyone
has an actual smart assistant to help them kind of not be late to work or remember to text me when
you're coming in late to work. - Or maybe in a situation where you're out on production in a
different country maybe - And you have the actual translation? - Yeah so I've been in situations where you have to do
interviews or meetings and sometimes it's a
little hard to communicate when you don't know that language. And I know you like, you're
always all over the place. - Yeah I mean I think you
know all of us make videos and we make videos across the world and so it's super exciting
to take that power of the processor and really have it come in
ways it's super practical. I mean Austin let's say that
you are a Spanish YouTuber that I'm about to interview
but I don't speak Spanish so how am I going to
ask you that question? - I don't either! Why do I
have to be Spanish YouTube? - We'll see. We'll see. So I'm going to say in
English the question and hopefully it will translate to Spanish and then we'll test out
your Spanish Austin. - Hey Austin, when did
you start making videos? (Spanish translation) Oh no, that's cheating though. You got to say it. - So the Spanish words
are now on the screen, Austin you are the Spanish YouTuber. Read that out to us. - Hey Austin, (foreign language) - You know what? Because I don't know Spanish,
I'm gonna say great job. And it's taking, I think
AI has a lot to do with taking data and taking so much information and really packing it into something that people can understand. And so especially you
know, we make videos, we collaborate with people, I think bringing that
into like the workplace with collaboration saying oh,
this person can't make it, maybe your calendar updates and depending on other
information it makes new plans. - And the idea that having something smart that opens up so many possibilities right? Where it's like you might
not necessarily think like oh let me connect this dot with that dot but the phone's like oh, I
know this is what you're doing I know this is who you're talking to like the more information it knows when it actually has some
intelligence behind it it can sort of connect a lot of dots to make your life easier in a lot of ways that you might not necessarily think of. - Yeah exactly. - I was going to say, you haven't collabed with
Austin Evans in two years or in my case, it's going to say you collabed with Austin like seven times. - Just stop. Like every time you collab I see your subscriber numbers drop, this is a terrible idea. It's like when the Austin
mode on the camera shows up it's like EH, there's
like a giant X on my face. (laughing) Yeah man, it's smart. - We're talking AI,
entertainment, gaming, traveling. Maybe even some selfies. - I do a few of those. Maybe not selfies, but I do all the other
things all the time. When you actually have AI
on board with gaming right, so of course you need a powerful processor to be able to game properly but there's also some other cool stuff that you can actually take advantage of. So if I actually pull up a game here, well the cool thing here
is that if I jump into it you'll see that not only does
it take up the full screen but say I get a notification
or something right now, while I'm in the middle
of my game I don't want to die because mom texted me
asking for milk or something, so what you can do is, Hey it happens okay? - [Jonathan] Hey, two percent or whole? - Whole! Two percent. Pshh. - Hey I don't know what your mom likes. - Well it's like there's
only so health like you don't need to be that healthy in life. That's all I'm trying to say. But yeah so you can actually game and not have to deal with
notifications or whatever, the phone is smart enough to know, oh look this is what
I'm doing, I'm gaming, I don't want to be interrupted. Mom just give me like five
more minutes, it's fine. And what's also cool is that because this
has such a large battery we're getting about a
day and a half of usage, but almost more importantly than that, say you're gaming all day, gotta hit that charger, for like 20 minutes you
can supercharge the battery up to like a full day of usage. So you're pretty much
not, you're unstoppable. - Quit gaming man, we're not
going to get anything done. We gotta go to selfies. - No no no, it's work okay. - Sara, take it away. - Okay well, the thing
that makes a good picture I think is something that
resembles some maybe more expensive cameras, you
have DSLRs, you know, they are really good about
blurring the background, which is called Bokeh. And so with this, it
uses AI to really detect where are the edges with the face, it separates the person and the background and I would like to
demonstrate that with a selfie. Alright so we're going
to take a selfie here, see the background is
already pretty blurred, okay smile Austin! - You got me didn't you? - Perfect. And see? Oh and see, it even got the
blur around Jon's fingers. - Yeah, the way it should be. - Yes, yes. It separates us
from the background, um yeah? That's a pretty darn good picture. And so not only do you
have that in this camera, but you can take your
selfies, Superfie them, make them look beautiful. - So clearly beautiful selfies
are not a problem but also, there's some love on the rear cameras too. We got of them here,
16 and 20 mega pixels, and what's cool is we got
a beautiful F1.8 aperture. - Which makes not only better photos but especially when it comes to low light, it allows you to gather
a lot more light in, cause I feel like with
a lot of smart phones you're in like a restaurant
or some sort of dim area and you're like, Hey let's take a picture! Oh ooh. But actually having that aperture makes a big difference. Plus having the secondary camera means that you actually have more to pull from. - There you go so whether it's
selfies, rear facing cameras, low light, gaming, love life, becoming a creator of
the next Austin Evans, this is where it's taking you. Thank you Austin Evans, thank you Sara, and we'll catch you guys later after we - Fight to the death. - That's like straight for the neck man! - Right at the jugular, you're
dead. Later, you're dead! 
- Yo guys, happy holidays. Jonathon here and I'm pretty positive you've seen this statement
echoed throughout the internet and probably in real life. So today I am here to agree
with that but not because the iPhone X isn't a good phone. It's because I got a bunch to give away. (electronic music) So to clarify you have a
chance to win one of 10 iPhone Xs. Yes there is definitely a theme going on. (electronic music) Now to answer it is stupid simple. One, subscribe to this
channel youtube.com/tld. Two, subscribe to dbrand
who may have outdone Santa this year and that's it. Now it's not required but
if you're feeling like being awesome and you
wanna hit that like button or even share this video
that would be amazing. From there if a free iPhone
was not enough to convince you instead of giving you five
reasons not to buy one, here are five reasons
why you may want one. One is the display. OLED is finally here on the
iPhone and that 5.8 inch near bezel-less display
even with the notch is one of the best out there. It's bright, it's crisp and I promise you watching Dream Desk on the
iPhone X will be at least 10 times better. Two it is water-resistant and
yeah, that's not a new thing but it's nice to know
whether you bought one, you got one for someone
else, or you won one from this video. You're not gonna have to
worry about getting that shiny new iPhone X a little bit wet. Three the cameras are amazing. Yes you get great photos,
you get portrait mode, but what stands out to me
with the iPhone X is video. With this you can shoot 4K
video up to 60 frames per second or you can shoot 1080p
videos slow motion up to 240 frames per second which is beautiful. Four is wireless charging and
much like water-resistance it is not anything but I
promise you once you use it you are going to appreciate it. Five the iPhone X is insanely
fast, arguably one of the fastest out this year. Plus on top of that these
are wrapped in a beautiful marble or TLD blue skin from dbrand and the best part about
these is they won't cost you a thing. So thank you guys for an amazing year. Good luck to everyone out there. There's a link below you
definitely wanna check out. This is Jonathon and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here. Usually, the goal is to keep
your desk and setup clean, but today, Dyson sponsored a
challenge to do the opposite, so that pretty white desk behind me is about to go a little dirty. So, this is the Cyclone v10,
which takes the flexibility and portability of something
like the v8, but replaces upright vacuums, because,
as of this announcement, Dyson will no longer be
designing new upright vacuums. In the box, you get the Cyclone
v10 itself, an extension, which effectively takes it
from handheld mode into upright mode, in the instance where
you need the extra reach. There are a ton of
attachments, which covers you on everything from a couch
to carpet to hardwood floor, or, in my case, concrete. Now I know it's a little weird
to get excited over a vacuum, and I'm not sure if it's just
me, but it seems the older you get, those are the things
that kind of excite you. Plus, not only is there a
ton of tech packed inside, there is so much power that
if you listen closely... (Tim Allen grunt) Timmy is proud. Now, on top of that, you
also get the sneak peak at an upcoming office tour. The Cyclone v10 happens to
be one of the new gadgets featured here, which happens to be located conveniently on the wall. Now, while this wall-mount
awesomeness might not be new specifically to the Cyclone
v10, what is new is charge time. Three and a half hours will
get you a full charge, versus something like five on the
v8, and with that full charge, you're gonna get about
an hour of suck time. Now, on top of that, you
can't look at me and tell me this doesn't look like a space gun. Either way, on top of that,
it also sounds like one too. (vacuum running) Now, there's actually some
science behind that too. There are magnets in here
that know the instant you take your finger off, the motor stops. (vacuum running) That's responsive! Now, if you're thinking to
yourself, there's some dirt inside this, that is
because I'm gonna show you how easy it is to empty this guy out. Space gun engage. Pop the top. Dump the dirt. And this is actually
gonna go back on my desk. Ready to clean! (blowing) Now, I talked about the tech inside this, and the v10 motor inside
this is insanely powerful, up to 125,000 RPMs of power. There are three modes. Right now, we are on minimum suction. (vacuum running) Not bad. Middle stage suction. (vacuum running) Pretty good. And last but not least, maximum suc-- (vacuum running) Another thing, it's time
we test out the vacuum. I've got some dirt, I've got
some dust, I've got some hair and things previously
sucked up into that vacuum. All of this is going on my desk. (disgusted noises) The desk is so clean, so pretty, so white. There's so much dirt. But we gotta do it. Ugh! Nope, ooh. Jeez. Guess we'll... Spread it around. I'm sorry, desk. So, one very dirty desk
later, I think the first thing I'm gonna do is try to
get up all that big stuff. Go, medium suction! (vacuum running) It's pretty good! (vacuum running) I'm not gonna say I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous but that
did a surprisingly good job. I'm gonna give it one
more, like, fine-touch up with the soft brush here, but honestly, I think that got most of it right there. (vacuum running) Ooh, I got a little dust right here. (vacuum running) And...
(vacuum running) There we have it, that is
one freakin' clean desk. So, mission: clean the desk is successful. I'm going to take
everything we just sucked up and dump it on the floor. The reason I do that is
to grab the extension and show you how we can
go into upright mode. So, we're gonna pop on that extension. (vacuum running) So, desk clean, floor clean. If that doesn't get you
excited about vacuuming, I'm not sure what else will. Hopefully you guys enjoyed the video. If you did and you feel
like being awesome, make sure to go maximum
suck on that like button. Again, make sure you check
out the brand new Cyclone v10 with the link down below. This is Jonathan, and
I'll catch you guys later. 
So this week was nuts for Apple They announced so much stuff at WWDC New iMacs, new iPad Pros, new MacBooks, new MacBook Pros You can actually expect a video on this brand new 13-inch MacBook in a day or so So stay tuned for that But first I want to talk about what was most interesting to me Kind of the surprise announcement of the show That Space Gray, iMac Pro Now, even though Apple had the iMac Pro out in the floor this week They had it locked down.. They didn't want no one touching this or getting fingerprints on it But that Space Gray was so attractive that naturally I had to sneak in there when no one was looking Unfortunately that was about as far as I could get without getting kicked out of the show But, I did get a chance to spend pretty a solid amount of time with it Talked to Apple, with that, I thought I could answer some questions you might have If there's anything that's not covered Go and drop me a line (he meant comment) down below First and foremost, I'm sure the biggest question floating around right now IS "Is the iMac Pro the replacement of Mac Pro?" The short answer is "No" I talked to Apple and they stressed and reiterated There is a brand new completely redesign modular Mac Pro coming in 2018 But for now, this is kind of like an option between the iMac and the Mac Pro and for those who need more power now or technically later this year Now aside from the surprising amount of power packed inside this iMac Pro if you missed it It comes in Space Gray, which looks amazing... I don't care if you're a part of the PC Master Race or you're a Mac user There is no denying, this is a beautiful machine On top of the Space Gray finish for the iMac, you also get a matching peripheral sets You get a Space Gray Trackpad, a Wireless Keyboard with Number Pad. Even though I'll personally never use it, you also get a space grey magic mouse Looks aside though, ultimately it comes down to the power and what is packed inside these iMac Pros Like I talked in my latest video, I didn't think I would ever see the day where I use 18-Core and iMacs in the same sentence But it is happening Out of the box, these comes configured with 8 Core Xeon Processors but could be bumped up to a 10 Core processor or an insane 18 Core Which if you think about it, is insane on an iMac Now on-top of the sheer CPU power they're not messing around with graphics either Inside, you have an AMD Vega Graphics either an 8GB or 16GB flavors I think what's cool with this is that those Vega Graphics aren't even out yet So it is brand new technology The current and now super dated Mac Pro, when that came out, it was kinda using almost recycled GPUs but with this, it is cutting edge and completely new Now admittedly what gets me excited and pulls on those nerd heart strings of mine are flash storage and SSD Performance and not only the recent Macs, whether it's MacBooks, MacBook Pros, iMacs, Apple has been killing it with SSD performance With these iMac Pro you can configure them out to a crazy 4TB of flash storage Which is beautiful What has me super curious though If you look at this note here, that says "Dual SSD options" So I'm curious, do you have the option for a second drive Or, if you opt for that crazy 4TB SSD Does that mean you're gonna get two 2TB SSD in a Raid Which would be insanely fast As far as memory goes, these are the first iMacs that could be configured up to a 128GB of RAM So there is no shorts of power no matter where you look So unfortunately, with that memory.. It is non-user upgradable I have confirmed this, I think ultimately what it comes down to is the cooling that Apple had engineered inside this iMac Just to make this possible They said something along the line that it is 80% more efficient as far as cooling goes in these standard iMacs Which is kinda crazy if you think about it It definitely kinda suck not being able to upgrade your own RAM Especially on what is being called a "Pro" machine but I guess it kinda paved away for the Mac Pros It's gonna be user upgradable modular machine and the iMac Pro kinda is what it is Now as far as connectivity goes, I was little surprised with these iMac Pros Especially with what Apple did with the iPhone 7 (he meant headphone jack) and the new MacBook Pros, those only had USB-C ports so I kinda assume naturally that route not only for the new iMac Pro, but the new iMac as well and that did not happen at all With these iMac Pros you get a headphone jack, SD Card slot, 4 USB 3.0 ports, 4 Thunderbolt 3 Ports in USB-C form factor and last but not least, a 10 Gigabit Ethernet port which is awesome Ultimately what it comes down to is that you gotta put things into perspective This is using Xeon Processors, graphics that aren't even out yet especially on the PC side of things Workstation memory, insanely fast flash storage I think the biggest thing that most people forget about is that all this comes with a beautiful 5k Display Now again, this is not intended to be a PC versus Mac war If you're all about that PC Master Race life, awesome You can incredibly powerful machines, For myself, I use Final Cut Pro to edit. It is what I use everyday, that's where iMac Pro makes sense Ultimately at the end of the day, you're gonna stack these side by side to compare the iMac Pro against a comparable PC Workstation, NOT Gaming PC but PC Workstation. I think you'd be surprised as far as price goes Personally, I am excited. If you are as well.. let me know by dropping a like down below and if you haven't yet definitely make sure you subscribe I have a ton more coverage on the way This is Jonathan and I'll catch you guys later! 
- Over the past few weeks
you may have noticed a new shooting set up. If you did you are correct. And the reason for that is I moved. Now with that I kind of
have this blank canvas in front of me to build out
my dream smart home set up. And I thought it'd be cool
to document the process and take you along for the ride. So part two is going
to be all about the TV, all about the audio. Super excited for LG 65 inch 4K OLED and potentially even more
excited for a pair of speakers coming in from Focal that has me drooling just thinking about them. Today though part one is
going to be the foundation, the groundwork, Internet WiFi security and because of that I reached out to nest and asked if they'd be
down to send out a couple of their brand-new NEst IQ cameras. They said, "Yes." I said, "You are awesome." So huge shout out to them
for sponsoring episode one. You also know what that means so for your chance to win a Nest IQ of your own details are down below. And if you're down with that let me know by dropping a like. As far as the Internet
goes it's kind of been a little bit of a roller coaster. Initially I was trying to get Frontier AKA used to be Verizon they hold the key to Fios. It wasn't going to be anything crazy about a hundred up hundred down
and I'm sure I'm going to hear about some of your
insane Internet speeds in the comments section below. But ultimately after going back and forth for two weeks I found out there were no open ports and I would essentially have to go on a waiting list and who knows how long that would have taken. So ultimately what I ended up doing was going with Spectrum who
weren't quite as tasty on the upload speeds. We're looking a hundred down and 10 up which does make me
slightly sad just thinking of that hundred up within arm's reach. But ultimately after
feeling like a caveman for two weeks without Internet I am just happy to be connected. Now as far as WiFi I went with Google WiFi which comes in a pack of three. The reason for that is
the layout of the house is three stories. Technically though the first story is just the hallway and extra calories burned to get to the living room. Because that the router
lives on the second story I wanted to make sure there
were strong consistent WiFi upstairs and throughout the house. Google WiFi works as a mesh network with
different access points to give you that solid consistent signal. There's a few different brands that make very similar things but for me Google WiFi has worked perfectly
and I have zero complaints. Popping over to the Nest IQ though this is where things get really cool. And if you're founded tech this is one of the coolest gadgets you can put in your house. Now what makes my geek heart
happy is inside the Nest IQ is a super crispy 4K sensor. You pair that with the
130 degree wide angle lens night-vision HDR and that
is a killer combination. The way the 4K sensor works though is actually kind of genius. It's not outputting 4K because one that would eat up extra bandwidth and two would be harder on your system to stream smoothly. But rather, it's very similar
to shooting a video in a 4K and then output it into a (mumbling) You have to go to punch in crop and overall everything is just extra sharp. What takes that one step
above and beyond though is when the hardware
works with the software. So Nest is actually smart enough
to decipher the difference between just motion and a human being and when it spots a human it will actually lock onto them crop in
and follow the movement which is crazy. What's cool though is
because of the software base if you're looking back at old
footage and it's locked in and following that person
you still have the ability to zoom out and see the
entire field of view. Now full disclosure, as you know, Nest was awesome enough to sponsor my home setup. But no joke, because they work so well, I got a couple more for the office. In addition to the security they have also become the ultimate
behind the scenes camera. Now speaking of software,
one of the craziest features on Nest IQ is face recognition. And it works really good. So the way it works is when Nest IQ sees a face it doesn't recognize it instantly sends you a notification saying, hey, there's an unfamiliar face in your spot. From there you can kind
of then create a database of whose face is who's
and then from now on it will let you know when
that person enters the room. I do wish there was an ability to turn off familiar faces and then only receive notifications for unfamiliar faces. I did reach out to Nest
and they are working that potentially in the
future which is good news. But either way it works lightning fast. To demo that over here in the office I added my face, I added Rich's face. I am going to call Ralphy to come over in a real time you're going to see how fast it works. - [Ralphy] Hello.
- Hey what you're doing? Come to me and Rich. - [Ralphy] Okay. - Ralphy just entered the room. Take a few steps this way. Look up there. Your cameras spotted if
someone it doesn't recognize. - What's up? What's up? - Look man. - Where, I don't see it. How am I supposed to see myself if I'm over here? - Look at that mean mug. Hold on hold on hold on. (laughing) - That's very good man. Yeah. I got you. That's a clean face right there man. - Do you know this person? Uh. Yes. Yes. Hey, just sent me a notification for a familiar face Ralphy which also comes through
on an Apple watch. So there was kind of a real-world example of not only how quickly it works but also how well it works. Immediately when Ralphy came
in it had no idea who he was and it let me know that. But as soon as I added his face it instantly knew who he was. Beyond that what's also
cool is you can now talk and listen through the Nest IQ. So I'm gonna send Rich over
to the Nest IQ right now. Hey, it sees you. Rich. - Whoa. - Don't break yourself. So as you're looking at this Nest footage hopefully Rich isn't making it too shaky. But not only can you
see the wide-angle view but you can also see how
to adjust on the fly. Night vision works
extremely well to the point where things can be
pitch-black in the room and you can no joke see everything. Now because Nest IQ is
plugged in at all times you essentially have 24/7
live streaming that you can access at any given moment. Now if you want to archive that footage you have two subscription options which we either go back the last 10 days or all the way up to the last 30. And details on that are down below. All in all though I think the Nest IQ is the result of one great
hardware meets great software because both ends of the
spectrum are equally satisfying. If you've been looking
for a smart home camera and you want the latest cutting-edge tech the Nest IQ is an awesome choice. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. 
- [Woman] Stop, let go! Let go! (upbeat music) - Yo guys, Jonathan here, and we are days away from Black Friday. The annual tradition where people line up, get crazy, trample each other, steal things from kids, all to save some cash
on some outdated tech. So if that sounds appealing and you are one of the brave souls that wants to make his
or her way out there, more power to you. Or if you want to stay home save some cash on some cool tech, this is the video for you. So kicking off the list is the PS4 Slim which is currently on sale for $199. Now, a couple cool things. One, this is the one terabyte version, so you got tons of room for games, and game like things. And two, this deal is available right now. Now of course prices
fluctuate, things sell out, for the most up to date pricing and deals, make sure you guys check
out the links below. From there maybe Sony isn't your thing. Maybe you're more of a
Microsoft kind of guy, or girl or dog. This Friday you can scoop up an Xbox One S for $189. I believe Microsoft is doing this. Best Buy is doing this. I would assume Amazon
will probably follow, and do this as well. Or if you don't wanna wait until Friday, you could scoop up a
bundle right now for $229. Best Buy currently has both the Madden and Forza bundles in stock right now for $229. Or if you're about that Amazon 1-Click, I believe they have that same exact Forza deal, as well. Now for these next two deals you will have to wait until Friday. But if you've been holding out for a Google Home Mini or a Google Home, this is the time to save some cash. With the Google Home Mini, you can pick this up for $29 plus a $10 gift card. You can do it from
Target, Walmart, Best Buy. Or maybe you need a little bit more size and the Google Home is more your thing, you can pick this up for 79 bucks. Same deal, Target, Best Buy, Walmart. Or if you want to score
that deal on a sweet Black Friday shovel
deal plus a Google Home, you could pick both of
these up at Home Depot. Next from there, B&amp;H is doing some crazy deals and sales on MacBook Pros. They're advertising up to
a thousand dollars off. I believe for the MacBook Pro, it's actually up to 700
from what I've seen. I do wanna point out, though, these are for 2016 MacBook Pros, not the newest models. With that said, though, the performance difference is not that big of a difference between last year and this year. So I think it's a fantastic opportunity to scoop up a MacBook Pro. So, going on that list, the biggest savings are gonna come on the late 2016 15 inch MacBook Pros. You can scoop one up for 600 bucks off, at $1799 or you can pick up the higher spec'd one for $2099. Now the biggest difference between these two models is storage, so with the higher end
one you're gonna get double the storage at 512 gigabyte, and slightly better
graphics card performance. So for that difference of 300 bucks, I would personally go for that one. Now, from there the 2017 models, the 13 inch MacBook Pros, the iPads, MacBook Pros. They even have some Mac minis on sale. Those aren't quite as drastic, but I will post everything down below. Next from there, I got got some inside on what the robots over at dbrand are doing on Black Friday. One, they are launching the brand new red dragon skin. Two, 30% off everything on the site, and three, every order over $10, automatically enter for a chance to win one of 10 iPhone 10s, so many 10s. But definitely make
sure you check them out on Black Friday. Now this next deal
really isn't Black Friday specific but the Essential Phone recently just dropped to $499, and this week it actually dropped down to $449 at both Amazon and Best Buy. Which makes this a really
attractive pick up. So with that price drop it does kind of raise the question, an Essential Phone or OnePlus 5T, because they are neck and neck. I asked on Twitter, and for the most part it seemed like most people would
pick the OnePlus 5T. To me, the Essential Phone with that price point is pretty compelling. It is a very, very attractive phone. But with the OnePlus 5T you get a great display, you get
better battery life, and what's most important to a lot of people out there you get a headphone jack. Going down the list, next up are the BeatsX
wireless headphones, which are currently $50 off. I actually really enjoy these. And if you use a Mac, an iPhone, an iPad, using a pair of headphones with a W1 chip is amazing. How easy it is not only to connect, but to hop between
different devices is crazy. Once you've used it you will understand. So next we got a battery bank deal. This is the Anker PowerCore Fusion 5000 which is on sale for 20 bucks. Now what's genius with this is the wall plug is built directly into the battery bank. And I guarantee you at least one you out there has been in a situation where you go to charge
your phone and realize, "My battery bank is dead." So what do you do? You go to grab the cable to charge your battery bank and you realize you forgot that. It turns out to be some weird Twilight Zone episode where your phone is booked, your battery bank is time, and that missing cable is broken glasses. - There is time now. - So next, for anyone part
of the PC master race, it is about to get hot and heavy. We got 16 cores, 32 threads, 40 megabytes of cache and $200 off the AMD Ryzen [Inaudible 00:04:19] 1950X. So now, your thousand dollar gaming PC is even cheaper than my MacBook Pro. Now jumping from extreme gaming PCs to tablets that won't cost you more than $115. Amazon has the Fire HD
10 for $114.99 right now. So the hundred dollars you saved from that PS4 Slim, you could basically buy
yourself a Fire HD 10. Alternatively, Amazon also has the classic, old school black and white Kindle for 49 bucks right now, and for that price it is
a great deal to pick up. Next, jumping over to TVs, you guys are gonna thank your boy, Rich, for this one. So Rich found a 70 inch LG 4K TV for $999. That is cheap as - [Inaudible 00:04:56] - Rich also found a 49 inch 4K TV from LG for 330 bucks
which is stupid cheap. I have no idea how long
these deals will last so make sure you guys jump on them. But if they sound appealing to you, I would drop to the links below. From there maybe you're going to the market for a TV. B&amp;H has a 32 inch 4K monitor for $369. That would actually make a great pair with that AMD Ryzen Threadripper. Aside from that thank you guys very much for watching. Hopefully enjoy these deals. If you did and you are feeling like being awesome make sure to go Cookie Monster on that Like button. Now I will be giving away a brand new iPhone 10 on Twitter this Black Friday so if you haven't yet, make sure you follow me for details. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
(clapping) Who is knockin' outside? (electronic beeping) Today's video is sponsored by LG. Yo guys, Jonathan here, and behind me is a very big wall, and that has led to a very big setup, 110 inches to be specific, and the best part about it is
that it's completely wireless. Not one HDMI cable in sight. (upbeat music) So, the cordless setup is LG's HF80JA, which is a smart home projector that will output a super crisp,
super bright, 1080p image up to 120 inches, and it's
doing so through lasers. Now, in my case, I've opted
to go completely wireless, but there are also two HDMI inputs if you want to use this in conjunction with an Apple TV, a Roku,
Fire TV, PlayStation, X-Box, or even Nintendo Switch. You can do that, as well. What I love about this specifically is LG's WebOS interface is built directly into the projector. So, it functions just like
it would on a normal TV, but there is something
just a little extra-special about controlling and navigating through a 100 plus inch projector screen. I know it's not magic, but
it kind of feels like it is. Now, because of WebOS, that is ultimately what allows everything
to be self-contained, which means you do not have to rely on any external streaming boxes. There is built-in Netflix, built-in Hulu, and probably, the most
convenient thing about this is there is also built in Chromecast. So, when that notification pops up for that brand new Dave2D video, you can instantly cast it
to your 110 inch setup. From there, one really smart
and well-thought-out feature on this projector is the
fact that it will output wireless audio to a Bluetooth speaker. In this case, a soundbar. Yes, there are built-in speakers directly into the projector, but in this case, it's
not going to give you the most desirable sound. So, I have it paired
with LG's SJ9 soundbar, which also features a wireless subwoofer. Even though the projector
is mounted up in the air 10 plus feet away, you
are still able to get rich, crisp, full audio, and
the best part about it, again, everything is kind of self-contained. So, that one remote, that
controls your interface, it controls your volume. It's just a really enjoyable experience. Beyond that, with that
Bluetooth connectivity, you are not just limited to soundbars. That also means you can use this with your favorite pair
of Bluetooth headphones. So, could you imagine that kind of sound pulsing through your ears? You got a 100 plus inches in your face, and I'm going to leave it at that. Next, something to make you
feel warm and fuzzy inside. As most conventional projectors, those are only slated to
last around 3,000 hours, but with this, because it uses lasers, that is going to give you up
to 20,000 hours of output. I'm not even going to do
the math on that, but-- Jon, I did the math. It's seven years if you watch
eight hours of TV everyday. That is a lot of Dave2D. So, this entire time, I've
had the projector running, but I've also had a really
bright light blasting at my face, and if I were to cut it, you would see, that gets just a little more impressive, and specifically, this is
outputting at up to 2,000 lumens. So, you're getting a clean
and very bright image. The small things from there, like being able to wirelessly
stream from your phone and the USB connectivity, kind
of just add the cherry on top to this entire experience, and from there, I'm not going to lie, something about having
a setup this massive is kind of special. Yes, OLED and big TVs are awesome, but there's something
very movie-like about this that you can't just
replicate through a TV, and the best part about this
is, compared to giant setups, this is relatively inexpensive, and it is extremely minimal and simple. You have the soundbar,
you have the projector, you have the projector screen, three pieces for a really
awesome giant setup. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. Hopefully, you enjoyed the video. If you did, and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to go-- Allora! On that like button. If you guys want to check
out more on the LG HF80JA, I'll drop a link down below. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. (electronic beeping) MTP is bringing the fire. That's a pretty face, man. That is a pretty face. (laughing) Youtube.com/ Techexamined. Ooh. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and this is not a tech video, nor is it click bait. It has been a really
frustrating almost two weeks now battling an eye infection
which is the reason I'm wearing shades inside, and also so you're not subjected
to staring at my face. So not this weekend, but the weekend prior I noticed some pain, some swelling. It was definitely annoying,
not pretty to look at, but it really didn't slow me down too much the proceeding week. This weekend I thought I was in the clear, I thought things were getting better, but I woke up Monday,
looked in the mirror, and said, "welp, my eye
is swollen half shut, "and it is gross as shit." So with that, I normally
like to keep things positive, and not focus on negative,
but with this, I think it was one of those things
where it kind of just wore me down day after day, where I wanted to make videos and had these ideas, but your mind says one
thing, and your body essentially gives you the finger. Now because of that, I kind
of wanted to spin things, especially with the holidays coming up and throw out a reminder that
it's okay to have a bad day, it's okay to be down, it's okay to be sad. Not specifically focusing on me, but if you're having a bad
day, whoever you watch, whoever you look up too, they're going to have a bad day too. Conversely, with all
that said, and me having way too much time inside my own head, I thought it might be a good
time to talk about something I've never really talked about. Most of you out there who know me, especially those who are close with me, know me as "the healthy
guy," that stereotypical LA dude is going to eat
kale, drink a juice, but I never really explained
how I got to this point. So this actually dates all the
way back to November, 2011. I remember it was
Thanksgiving, I was trying to do this Black Friday deals video but had the worst toothache that shot pain into my sinus and up into my eye, so at that point I knew it
was time to see a dentist. From there, I went ahead
and got a root canal, which I was strangely excited for, just to get things fixed
and on the up and up. But good God, that was just the beginning. Two weeks passed and somehow things seemed to have gotten worse. The pain is amplified, my face is swollen, my eye is swollen, and so I go back, get a second root canal, two more weeks pass, and same situation. The dentist, or the endodontist, rather had no idea what was wrong,
or what was going on, just super confused without any answers, so she sent me to an ENT. Naturally, the ENT thought
it was just a sinus infection so all they did was prescribe antibiotics. At this point between the root canals, and the ENT, that quickly
tallied up four courses of antibiotics, and if you could take one thing from this video,
it is please only take antibiotics when you absolutely have to. Question things, do your research because where I was at that point in my life, I really wasn't in that state of mind, I just wanted to feel better, and that was just the beginning of way
worse problems later to come. So about four months pass, I am miserable, no one has any idea what is wrong with me, or what is going on. After tons of research,
and looking around, I finally found this really
well established oral surgeon and it wasn't until
then where he discovered that all this time I had a freaking micro-fracture in my tooth. Also, it turns out that the roots of my teeth are really deep. So deep in fact, that they go straight into my sinus cavity, and that is awesome if I got punched in the
face because I'm probably not gonna lose my teeth very easy. But in this case, it is
what ultimately screwed me. Because there was a microfracture, bacteria would constantly
seep through there. So no matter how many root canals, or what was done, it
would never get better. And eventually what ended up
happening, was the infection ate straight through my sinus cavity. That is not something I wish on anybody. I remember on cold days
breathing through my nose, and feeling the air hit
the root of my tooth, and being in excruciating pain. At that point the only
solution was to pull the tooth, which started a completely
new bag of problems. I remember being awake during the process, and seeing how much the dentist struggled to pull the tooth out, I
guess because the roots were so deep, that tooth did not want to come out of my jaw. The positive to that though
is if it got any worse, because it was so deep in my jaw, it could've easily infected my bone, and that would've not been good. Once the tooth was out, that left a giant hole straight through my sinus, so they had to do a bone
graft, and that would take about a year and a half to fully heal. Jumping back to the antibiotics, because of this surgery, that required two more rounds plus steroids
to keep the inflammation down. The pain from that post surgery was one of the worst things I've
ever experienced in my life. Just imagine every single
nerve in your face, and your teeth just
feeling like it's on fire. Honestly, it got me to a point where I was in a pretty
dark place, pretty down, didn't really make that many
YouTube videos that year. The pain was so excruciating
and so constant, that I looked forward to being asleep because it didn't hurt when I was asleep. Through all that though my family, and especially my fiancee, Pearl, was really what kept me going. In some strange way, it was almost this really valuable life lesson where all the electronics
and technology in the world didn't matter, because what good was it if you didn't feel good to enjoy things with those that you love. So a couple months passed,
things are getting better with my sinus, I'm making
progress, I'm excited, and then I start to get a really terrible pain
in my lower stomach. The best way I can describe this feeling is if someone took a
razor blade or a knife, and started scratching you from
the inside of your stomach. It had gotten so bad, that the
inflammation from my stomach actually pinched a nerve in my back which in turn caused my leg to go numb. I went back to the doctors, and they really didn't know what was going on, they thought it might be diverticulitis which seemed weird and went ahead and prescribed me even more antibiotics. Things weren't getting better, the pain in my stomach was getting worse, my leg was still numb, I ended up seeing chiropractors and doctors, and no one had any idea what was going on. So for the next few
months I said, "screw it, "I'm gonna do some research, I am going "to figure this out on my own." Everything I learned, everything I read pointed to a yeast infection or candida, which may be a little
embarrassing if you're a guy, but if you've taken major
courses of antibiotics that wipe out your good bacteria, that is a serious possibility. I'll never forget it, I
went back to the doctor, and told them what I think I had, and he essentially laughed at me, and told me I was crazy,
that it was just allergies, take these, it's gonna
make you feel better. So I of course believed him. I took the allergy medicine. I remember it was my nephew's birthday, I ate cake, candy, ice cream
and that destroyed my body. For the next three days, it just felt like my body was lead, I couldn't think, I remember that Monday taking my fiancee through Starbucks, and there were maybe two cars ahead of us,
and I could not remember the two drinks she was asking me to order to save my life, and at that point I knew something had to change. So after that, I gave
up bread, sugar, dairy, essentially anything that tastes good, and pretty much lived off vegetables, and bone broth for the next few months. Sure and behold, my leg
started getting better, the numbness went away, I
could think more clearly, I had more energy, it was night and day. Now with that, the turn around was not all rainbows and unicorns, there was definitely
some hardship to that. With that, I lost a ton of weight, I remember at one point I
had gotten down to around 145 and people were noticing
it within the videos. The biggest side effect of the
antibiotics, of the steroids, of the heavy doses of ibuprofen,
was the stomach damage. The yeast overgrowth,
when it gets really bad, will actually turn into a fungal form, where'll it'll eat through your stomach. That in turn causes toxins and things to leak into your
bloodstream which is not fun, and completely wipes me out. It's something that I
still battle to this day. But over all, three years strong now, I would not change anything
if I could go back in time. It made me wiser, it made
me appreciate things, I'm not gonna lie, it is definitely a challenge from time to time. Trying to go to a restaurant, and not being able to eat 99% of the things on the menu
is extremely frustrating, especially when you have a fiancee. Bless her heart, she has
been amazing through this, and again, I would not be
here if it weren't for her. So now you guys have a
little deeper insight of why I am the way I am. It's definitely tempting to
eat a doughnut or ice cream, or candy, or just give
in every once in a while, but for me, actually feeling good far outweighs that moment of giving in. Because small things
like not paying attention and eating a sauce that has a sugar in it, or even eating too late in the day to where I can't digest it, those things will knock me on my ass for a couple days to where I am useless. If this inspires or changes
just one person out there, then I am glad I made this video. Hopefully my eye is on the up and up, I am hungry and chomping at the bit to make some videos,
so look out for those. Ending on a positive note,
the t-shirts finally dropped, thank you guys for all the
support and the love on those. If you haven't checked those out, I'll drop a link down below. I love all of you guys,
and I'll catch you later. 
- Hey guys, Jonathon here and last year I did an iPhone 7 "one hour in water test". But, I would say at the very least, that bowl of water was lacking in size. This year, we're upgrading. We got an entire fountain. It's bigger, it's better. There, of course, is way more water. Not only that, the brand new iPhone 8, I also have the Galaxy S8 and we're gonna put these two side by side. Now, the Galaxy S8 is IP68 certified, whereas the iPhone 8 is IP67. Before anyone jumps out there and claims victory of the Galaxy S8, essentially what that means is that this is supposed to be able to handle just a little bit deeper, in terms of depths of water, than the iPhone 8. So, with that said,
let's drop these guys in, and see how they fair after one hour. Part of me wants to
get it in the fountain. I don't know if that's a good idea though. (grunts) I don't know how deep it is,
I don't know how deep that is. I mean, it's in water there. We good. (grunts) Oh, sorry UltraBoosts
for what I have done. Did he jump in? - [Ralphy] I don't know. - [Rich] Yeah. - [Ralphy] Where'd he go? - [Rich] Don't know. - [Ralphy] I don't
wanna like, point at him. - Wait, he jumped in? Wait, why did he jump in? (playful music) (rocket launching) So, we are just about a minute away and things might be a
little awkward right now, because when I started this video, I probably didn't look like this. But, that is because during that hour, I actually tested out some
240 fps slow motion video on the iPhone 8, comparing
it to a $30,000 red camera. So, if that sounds interesting, stay tuned because that's
gonna drop tomorrow. Turn notifications on if you haven't yet, so you don't miss that. But, right now, we're
about 50 seconds away from seeing how the iPhone 8, how the Galaxy S8 faired in an
hour, in a fountain. Ten. Nine. It's a little colder now. And, I'm way more colorful. Eight. Seven. Six. Five, four. Three. Two. One. I see the iPhone. (grunts) Ooh, damn, shoulder cramp. Shoulder cramp. (grunts) Timer's on. See what's new on iOS 11. Alright, we are good. Home button works. See if I can enter the password. Both of these are still alive and well. 1-2-3-4-5-6, for those of you who want to hack my phone. Galaxy S8 on the left,
iPhone 8 on the right. Both are looking pretty good. Home button's working, the virtual home button on the infinity display. We got a train coming
along but, that's okay. Shout out to Thomas. Right now from there, since
the screen's look good, I'm gonna actually test
out the cameras right now. Get a little video test. That looks good. Rich, say hi. Damn dude, that's a smile. Hey, I like your Fry-Day shirt. Hopping over to the Galaxy S8. Flip that camera. Video. There we go. Rich, gimme that Fry-Day smile. - It's Friday. - Back to Ralphy. So, both are actually working pretty well. Submerged for an hour in the fountain. You guys missed a full comparison on that. And also, a chance to win either a brand new Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 8. Check out the video here. Thank you guys very much for watching. Hopefully you did and you were
feeling like being awesome. Make sure to smash that like button and I'll catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here. This is not an Apple product. This is the brand new Xbox One X, and here are five things
to know before buying. (pop music) So first up, I'm gonna kind of sandwich three things together in one. Name, pricing, and then availability. Prior to today's announcement, this was known as Project Scorpio. Now we have the official name, Xbox One X. The now big brother to the Xbox One S. Although, this technically isn't born yet. It doesn't come out
until November seventh, so does that make it the
little but better brother? Anyways, it costs $499. So next up at number two, even though this is the
most powerful Xbox ever, it is also the smallest Xbox ever, which is kind of crazy
if you think about it. Also strangely enough,
there was a ton of people who really, really wanted a
black finish on the Xbox One S. That of course has not happened yet, and it's debuting here
with the Xbox One X, so if you're holding out for that, that may have made your decision for you. Now even though this looks
very similar to an Xbox One S, the only component that they share that is the exact same
is the blu ray drive. Everything else inside this
is completely different. Now one that I thought was
particularly cool with this, is even though it's more
powerful than the Xbox One S, even though it's drawing more power, something like 125 watts more, if you look on the back, the
power cord is exactly the same, and to take that even further, the layout and the outputs
are the exact same as well. So in theory, if you wanted to unplug and pop your Xbox One S out
and replace it with this, it is gonna be seamless. Now next up at number three, is for those who wanna get down and dirty, and know the specs and what
is inside this Xbox One X. This is packing a six teraflop GPU clocked at one point one seven two gigahertz. 12 gigabytes of memory. What's nice about that is nine of those are going straight to games. So it's kind of refreshing to see even though they're packing
in the specs and the hardware, there's a good amount of allocation going to the gaming side. With that memory, you're also getting 326 gigabytes per second
of memory bandwidth. So the key message here
is true 4K gameplay, and yes I guarantee you one guy out there is gonna say I'm just
gonna build a gaming PC. And that's fine, you can do that. But the fact that there
is this much power packed inside a console I think is awesome. Here at E3 they debuted Forza 7, which is pumping out
4K, 60 FPS gameplay, and I don't care what side of
the fence you put yourself on, whether it's a console gamer or PC gamer, if you enjoy tech, that
is a really great thing. Now, next up at number four
is backwards compatibility. All Xbox One accessories will
work with the Xbox One X. Of course your games are gonna work. They're gonna look better. But what was special today, is on top of the backwards compatibility
with Xbox 360 games, Microsoft announced
compatibility all the way back to the original Xbox, and
tons of loud beeping too. (beep) Is on top ... Will work with the Xbox One X. Now, last up at number five is even if you don't own a 4K TV but still want to pick up
an Xbox One X, that's okay. Firstly, gameplay is gonna look better. And the best way I could describe that from a video standpoint, it's very similar to where
if you shot in  4K, and then output it in 1080P, it's still gonna be crisper,
it's still gonna be sharper, and that is definitely not a bad thing. On top of that, you're gonna
get much better framerates on the Xbox One X, simply
because there is more power. So maybe you've been holding out, and you haven't bought an Xbox One S yet, this is definitely gonna be
the better future-proof option. Lastly, something I haven't talked about is there is a faster hard drive packed inside the Xbox One X. It's gonna ship with
a one terabyte option. And what that's gonna equate
to are faster load times. All in all, the Xbox
One X looks really good. I am not a crazy gamer by any means, but this looks really, really tempting. If you guys are excited for this, let me know by dropping a like down below. As far as where you could
pick one of these up, I am not sure yet. Amazon may have leaked it, but I'm not sure if that
link is still there. That will also be down below. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo, guys, Jonathan here, and this is the OnePlus 5T. (upbeat techno music) So, alongside the OnePlus 5T, you get a Dash Charge USB-C
cable, the power brick, quick-start guide, sync tool, and if you flip that quick-start guide, you get a not-that-great of a case, but it's still cool that they included it. So today, I wanna break
this down into five things to know before you
potentially go out there and buy a OnePlus 5T, unless
you're a OnePlus 5 owner, then you're probably a little upset. I'm sorry. With that said, though, the
first thing I wanna talk about is pricing. Now, there were rumors that the OnePlus 5T could cost upwards of nearly 700 dollars. And if that upsets you,
take a deep breath. You'll be happy to hear the
OnePlus 5T starts at a 499. That'll get you 64 gigs of storage with six gigabytes of
ram, or alternatively, you can double your storage
and bump that RAM up all the way to eight gigabytes for 559. Now, I've seen argumentatively, you can pick up an unlocked Galaxy S8 in the 500-dollar-range on Amazon, but to clarify, those
are refurbished models. The cheapest new Galaxy S8 I've seen is about 630 bucks right now. Regardless, though, I will
link both of those down below. I'm curious to hear, what
sounds more enticing? A refurbished Galaxy S8 or a OnePlus 5T? Next up is probably the biggest
change of the OnePlus 5T, and that is the display. OnePlus has finally
joined that 18 by 9, super-tall screen party. So it essentially is a six-inch
display, 2,160 by 1,080, which may be a turnoff for some of you enthusiasts out there. Again, given the price point, I think the screen looks fantastic and if you need more resolution, you can hop up to a Galaxy S8 or even the fan-favorite, the LG V30. What's nice about this though, is if you stack it up side-by-side
against the OnePlus 5, the form factor really hasn't changed, you are just getting a taller display. Because of the display, though, you do lose the fingerprint
reader on the bottom, but effectively is moved towards the back in a much better location
than the Galaxy S8 or Note 8. It's right smack in the middle
and it works really well. Now, at the event, OnePlus
was not shy to take shots at Google and their
Pixel 2 display issues, and for those curious
about the OnePlus 5T, I have not seen any blue
shift on this phone, it looks fantastic. And again, the only potential drawback for some of you out there
is it's a 1080p display. Now from there, the
third thing to talk about is the camera, or dual cameras, rather. It still features a 16
and 20 megapixel sensor, just like the OnePlus 5
did, but what's kinda weird, is that secondary lens is
no longer a telephoto lens. It's the same exact focal
length, the same exact aperture, and from what I understand, OnePlus is claiming
that the secondary lens is going to be a low-light lens, so when it knows you're in
a lower-light situation, it's gonna opt to use that one instead. So with that, comes a
couple different things. One, portrait mode will
still, in fact, work. The only difference is because those are the same focal length, the
image will no longer be cropped. Then, number two, when you punch in on the OnePlus 5T camera,
that zoom is purely digital. So, to give an example
of how everything looks, here's a shot taken on the OnePlus 5T. Here's that same shot punched in, and I'm curious to know what
you guys think of the quality. Same thing here is a shot, straight out of the OnePlus 5T camera, and as we zoom in, I gotta
say, I don't notice too much in terms of a quality loss,
but it's still kinda weird to me that they opted
for no telephoto lens. Now, this here was one
of my favorite shots. On a couple notes, one,
this was using that fake, digital, telephoto zoom-in. And two, this was not using portrait mode, it was just straight out of the camera. Now from there, as far as low-light goes, I actually got a pretty amazing test, thanks to Mr. Linus Tech Tips, and the event was super dark, so here is an example of the
flash from the OnePlus 5T. Looks very nice. From there, brace yourselves,
this was straight low-light, no flash or anything, you're welcome. From there, here's a quick
selfie shot from the OnePlus 5T. Nothing special or magical,
but still really solid. I gotta say, overall first impressions with the OnePlus 5T
camera are really good. Now, from there, the
fourth thing to talk about is there is now Face
Unlock, love the name, now on the OnePlus 5T. From what I can tell,
OnePlus is not banking on this being the primary form
of security on this phone, especially because you can
only use it to unlock things. As far as purchases go, you
must use your fingerprint to do those. With that said, though,
setup was insanely fast and I think the unlock
process may be even faster. No joke, you literally pick up the phone, hold it up to your face,
and you are in the phone. So is Face Unlock a game
changer on the OnePlus 5T? Nope, but it is a super
fast and convenient way to get into the phone and
for those who still want that trusty fingerprint reader, you get the best of both worlds. Now, the last thing I wanna talk about is the OnePlus 5T isn't
that much different than the OnePlus 5. The weird part is, the
OnePlus 5 was not released that long ago, so I'm
sure some of you out there who just bought that phone, gotta be feelin' a little
left out in the dark. They did this last year
with the OnePlus 3 and 3T, so it's kinda setting a track record to not buy the first
iteration of the phone. The other kinda weird part, too, is it's so late in the year. We're getting closer to the Galaxy S9, or Samsung's prolly gonna
call it the Galaxy S10. Either way, though, it's
really late in the year. And from there, I'm curious to know what you guys think of this. Now, at the event, OnePlus
kinda defended this by comparing it to a software update, in the sense that if you have the ability to upgrade hardware, why wait a year? For me, it just kinda feels like this is what the OnePlus 5 should've been. Based off of reactions on
Twitter or at the event, I think most people would tend to agree. Granted, there are some pretty
solid updates to OxygenOS, which is super clean and customizable. One feature in particular
that I think is really cool, are parallel apps. So for example, maybe you
have two Twitter accounts, two Instagram accounts,
two Facebook accounts, you can actually have a
parallel versions of these, where you're logged in at the same time and choose which one you wanna launch. From there, maybe the
OnePlus 5 really didn't do it for you and you held off
buying that, and now, the OnePlus 5T makes way more sense. Aside from that, hopefully
you enjoyed the video. If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to go super-sexy-Linus
on that like button. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Hey Google, how do you say, hit that 'like' button in Korean? - [Google Home Mini] (in foreign language) - Yeah do that. - What's your favorite thing
about the Google Home Mini? - Does it get loud? How was the audio quality? - Do you feel like the new
Google Home Mini is worth it? - Jonathon here and today
I'm answering some questions on the brand new Google Home Mini. Got a chance to spend the
last two days with it, get familiar with it. And big shout out to everyone
who sent in questions. You guys are amazing. Now his Q&amp;A is a paid
partnership with Google so big thanks to them for
making that happen, but also for letting me check out the
Google Home Mini early. So as far as the unboxing goes, you have some clean packaging,
which really matches the aesthetic of the Google Home Mini, but before you can get inside you must first get through a
really satisfying pull tab. From there, right smack in the front is the Google Home Mini. And this color is what
Google's calling Chalk, but there's also Charcoal and Coral. Now I've yet to see
Charcoal or Coral in person, but I gotta say I really
dig the looks of Chalk. I think clean is probably
the best word to describe it and overall I think Google Home Mini is a really good looking piece of tech. From there, set up was super simple. This is done through the Google Home app and whether you're on Android or iOS, Google Home Mini is going to work on both. So now that we're all set up I think it's time we
test this little guy out. Hey Google, tell me about yourself. - I'm your Google Assistant
and I can play games. I was just practicing my game show voice in case you wanted to play Lucky Trivia. (laughs) - Hey Google, what am
I thinking right now? - You're thinking if my Google Assistant guesses what I'm thinking,
I'm going to freak out. - Hey Google, how do you say Austin Evans is jacked in Spanish? - (in foreign language) (laughs) - (in foreign language) (laughs) - (in foreign language) (laughs) - Okay, I'm done. - So my only question is, what's the difference between
the normal Google Home and the Google Home Mini? - So that is hands down the question that I got asked the most and
before I answer that directly, I'm gonna first say I was really surprised with the sound quality
on the Google Home Mini. Okay Google, play Gramatik. (electronic music) Okay Google, stop. (electronic music) So that is obviously
not gonna fill the room like the Google Home would, but it's pretty impressive nonetheless. So to dissect that question
just a little bit further, I think it's gonna come
down to price point. Yeah, the Google Home does sound better but maybe you wanna put
these in multiple rooms, you can do that. You can get three of these for basically the price of a Google Home. - Is the Google Mini really mini? - I don't have an official mini scale, but looking at it up close
I would say, yeah it's mini. - Does the Google Home Mini also function as a Bluetooth speaker? - It does and that's actually
how I was able to hop back and forth between the
Google Home and Google Home Mini for that audio comparison. The one thing you will
need remember though is that it's not a portable
speaker so you will need to be plugged into a
wall, but other than that you definitely can play
music through Bluetooth. - Jonathan, do they have a headphone port so you can plug em to external speakers? - So the Google Home Mini,
there is no analog audio output, but if you do wanna get this
to an external set of speakers you can still do that
with Chromecast Audio. - Is someone like me with a gaming setup, what would I wanna use it for? - So if you're with a gaming
setup I'm going to assume one you are part of the PC master race and two because of that you more than likely dig
that color RGB lighting so with that the ability to
maybe match your lighting with your gaming setup and
control it with your voice is reason enough to jump into that for me. - Hey Jonathan, can the Google Home Mini tell you where's the
best place to eat tacos or any Mexican food? - Hey Google, where's the best place to get tacos in Los Angeles? - I found a few top rated places. The first one is Best
Fish Taco In Ensenada on 1650 Hillhurst Ave in Los Angeles. - The answer is clearly yes. So to answer that dog's question, yeah it works great with
both Phillips Hue and LIFX and it's kinda nice knowing that two of the major
lighting players in the game will work with Google Home
Mini so you can do things like, hey Google, turn the lights blue. - Okay, changing the LIFX to blue. - Hey Google, dim the light to 0%. - You got it. - Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching and again, huge shout out to Google for making this video possible. If you guys have any
questions on the brand new Google Home Mini, drop
me a line down below and I'll try to reply to
as many comments as I can and if you wanna check out some more Google Home Mini goodness,
check out these videos here and I will catch you guys later. 
- Seven paragraphs in a second, man. It's true, man, cocked and loaded, ready to rip me a new one. Yo, guys, Jonathan here and
this is gonna be a fun one. The iPhone 7 Plus has been
out for a little while now. It is tried, it is tested, and I think most of us could agree, it is a pretty solid smartphone. But, the Galaxy S8 is here, specifically, the Galaxy S8 Plus. It is big, it is beautiful, and we're about to see how
these two stack up side by side. Before I jump in, for the
keyboard warrior out there in mid-stroke right now, yes,
I realize the iPhone 7 Plus is just over six months old right now. But you gotta consider,
some people may be looking to upgrade right now and
some people may be watching this exact video on their
precious iPhone 7 Plus tempted and looking to
jump ship over to Android. Plus, at the end of the
day, I'm willing to bet that most of you out there will be happy with either of these phones, especially if I were to give one away. If that's something you want to see, maybe drop a like down below and subscribe and turn on notifications
so you don't miss when that happens. Jumping into things, I am
not going to sugarcoat stuff. The Galaxy S8 Plus is the
better looking smartphone. What Samsung has done here
genuinely has me excited and, if I'm being honest,
makes the iPhone 7 Plus look a little dated. The kicker here for me, and I'm sure for most of
you out there as well, is what Samsung is calling
their infinity display. What it is, essentially,
is edge-to-edge glass that gives the middle finger to bezels and looks freaking beautiful. As far as the footprint
goes, if you look close the Galaxy S8 Plus is just slightly taller than the 7 Plus but,
surprisingly, it is more narrow, which makes it easier to hold in one hand. Honestly, the craziest thing about this, regardless of how close
they are in size physically, the S8 Plus is packing a 6.2
inch display inside there where the iPhone 7 Plus is
looking kinda small at 5.5. So, those are some serious screen games. - All kinds, screen gains, oh. - Now as far as within those 5.5 inches, the iPhone 7 Plus has a
resolution of 1920 x 1080 whereas the S8 Plus is
packing all kinds of pixels with a resolution of 2960 x 1440. Now, notably most of those extra pixels are coming vertically. What that's gonna do is give
you a much taller display on the Galaxy S8 Plus, and that's cool, especially if you're holding
your phone in portrait mode because you can then,
essentially, stack layers on top of each other. But, if you flip things
and watch full-screen video like this, then that's where
the 18.5x9 aspect ratio does get a little bit weird, specifically, you'll notice two black
bars on the side of me. While that definitely
isn't a deal-breaker, some people may be turned off by it. On the flip side, with the iPhone 7 Plus having a 16x9 aspect
ratio, those black bars are non-existent. In terms of quality,
yes, the iPhone 7 Plus is a really solid, great-looking display but if we're talking
wow factor, brightness, vividness, if I'm A-B-ing
the two side-by-side, I'm going with the Galaxy S8 Plus. Now, admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of spec comparisons. But for those who gots to know, the iPhone 7 Plus is packing
Apple's A10 Fusion chip, which essentially is a pair
of dual-core processors, one high performance and
then one low performance, three gigabytes of RAM, and a
2,900 milliamp hour battery. Flipping sides to the Galaxy S8 Plus. It's also similar in
the sense where we see a pair of processors. But in this case, that's actually a pair of quad-core processors, 4 gigs of RAM, and slightly larger 3,500
milliamp hour battery. This is the point in the
video where I explain why I'm not the biggest
fan of spec comparisons because on paper, one might
see the eight total cores on the Galaxy S8 Plus and assume that it is infinitely faster and better than the four total cores
in the iPhone 7 Plus, when that really isn't the case. Even in things like synthetic benchmarks take Geekbench 4, for example. The Galaxy S8 Plus barely
beats out the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of the multi-core score and that is with double the cores. Hop over to the single
core side of things, and it's a completely different story. The iPhone 7 Plus actually
smokes the Galaxy S8 Plus. But does that mean the iPhone 7 Plus is infinitely better, faster, and that you should
solely base your decision based on benchmarks? No way. The point that I want
to echo and get across is that in terms of performance, both of these are really fast phones. So much, in fact, that
performance and benchmarks should not be the sole focus
of your buying decision. Rather, it is the features around it that kind of bring everything together. Giving you an example of
where specs aren't everything, what I did was take a 4K video,
chop it down to 45 seconds and then export a 720p version. The iPhone 7 Plus has half the cores, so, in theory, it should be slower
than the Galaxy S8 Plus. But it actually exports
the video much faster, around 15 seconds,
where the Galaxy S8 Plus is actually over 20. Now, again, this doesn't mean the iPhone 7 is automatically better. If you like Android, I'm
sure those extra six, seven seconds aren't gonna kill you but it is a prime example
of why you shouldn't always listen to specs,
numbers, and benchmarks. As far as the cameras go,
while the rear shooters are pretty similar at 12 megapixels, as far the front cameras go, there is a pretty distinct
advantage on the S8 Plus. This features an eight megapixel sensor as opposed to the seven
on the iPhone 7 Plus. Really, beyond those megapixels, I think the Galaxy S8 just
simply outperforms the iPhone. What I notice most about these two shots, beyond the wider angle on the S8 Plus being nicer is the dynamic range. With the S8 Plus, you
can still see the clouds in the sky, whereas
with the iPhone 7 plus, everything kind of gets blown out. Plus, if you've ever wanted
to look like a flying dog with steam coming out of his ears and some oddly placed paws or a pair of some pretty weird sheep, like me and my buddy Rich, you can only do that
on the Galaxy S8 Plus. - Ooh. - Damn, look at that face track. So, as far as the front-facing cameras go, to make things a little more interesting, we know both phones are
water and dust resistant so I think it's only fitting that we test it out that way. First up is the Galaxy S8 Plus. Next we have the iPhone 7 Plus with that sweet gold carbon
fiber wrap from ColorWare. Now, of course it is water time. First up, Galaxy S8 Plus. Focus, man, there we go. So, we're alive, we're working. Follow things up with the iPhone 7 Plus, we are back in business. Things are wet but both
passed the water test. As far as quality goes, let me know with a comment down below what you think looks better. Beyond just video quality
in the front-facing cameras, if microphone and audio
quality matters to you, I would say both of these
perform pretty closely. Although, I'll give the slight edge to the iPhone 7 Plus. And shout out to these two dude for tearing it up on music. You can show 'em some love by checking out the link down below. Hopping over to the rear-facing cameras. Again, both of these do
feature 12 megapixel sensors. Although, the Galaxy
S8 Plus should perform a little better in low
light with an f-stop of 1.7 compared to f/1.8 on the iPhone 7 Plus. One noticeable difference
with the iPhone 7 Plus that you are not getting with the S8 is dual lenses, which
essentially gives you two focal lengths. Here's a shot on the iPhone 7 Plus using the main lens at 28 millimeters and then here's a shot hopping
over to the second lens at 56 millimeters. One thing worth mentioning
is the second lens on the 7 Plus isn't gonna perform nearly as well as the main lens. With that second 56 millimeter lens, you're getting an f-stop of f/2.8 compared to the main 28 millimeter lens with an f-stop of f/1.8, you are letting in much less light. Another advantage with that second lens is what Apple calls portrait mode, which is gonna help you get that nice, blurred out background. It's not perfect, by any means, but it's definitely a lot better than the software simulated one here on the Galaxy S8 Plus. I felt like in certain shots,
I preferred the S8 Plus. In others, I prefer the iPhone. This one in particular is
where I prefer the iPhone over the S8, specifically, one, because the sky is much nicer, and then, two, the Adidas
text is much clearer and easier to read on the iPhone 7 Plus. And shout out to Rich's tri-colors. Conversely, here's an
example of where I prefer the S8 Plus over the iPhone 7. I think, really, it comes
down to the S8 performing much better in low light. For me, what pops out
specifically about this picture is actually the light around the sign. It's a little more natural and, overall, just a more pleasing image. Flipping sides again,
in these two shots here, I prefer the iPhone 7 Plus. The S8 Plus image is definitely sharp here but if you look closely at
the trees and the flowers, it almost becomes a little over-processed. Where everything in the iPhone Plus just feels a little more natural. Next, reiterating my
point about low light, the Galaxy S8 Plus clearly
takes the cake here. Really what it comes down
to is, out of the box, you're gonna get some
instantly satisfying pictures. With the S8 Plus, it is
better in low light for sure, but I think both are really solid cameras and the iPhone is
definitely gonna give you a less saturated, less sharp, and an overall more natural image. So, here we are on the iPhone 7 Plus and it's a pretty good low light test since we're pretty much right at sundown. If I'm gonna guess, I'm gonna say the iPhone 7 Plus probably doesn't look as good out of the box as the S8 Plus but the stabilization is
probably gonna be top notch. Once we start to move around,
we get a little closer, and it starts to pull focus,
you kind of shift that way, I'm gonna give that edge
to the iPhone 7 Plus. Here we are over on the S8 plus, not exactly sure how this looks. Rich, how's it look? - [Rich] Not looking
as good as the iPhone. - Apparently not as good
as the iPhone 7 Plus, but you guys let me know
with a comment down below. - [Rich] Imagine it looks better and all I get is hate comments. - Rich, you blind as-- So, hopping back into design. Because of Samsung's infinity display, you may have noticed there is no longer a physical home button. It's actually kind of
similar to what we saw on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, where the best way I can describe this is if both phones were off
and you press the button, nothing would happen. The difference with the Galaxy S8 Plus is the home button is built right in to the freaking screen. The iPhone 7 Plus still
gives you some sort of a physical home button feel whereas with the Galaxy S8 Plus, you're actually pressing the display. So, in terms of pure tech bad-assery, yes, the S8 Plus having the
home button in the display, feels super futuristic, but it
does leave a couple problems. The first of which being
the fingerprint reader on the S8 Plus is now
located, oddly, on the back. And, don't get me wrong, I don't mind fingerprint
readers on the back of the phone when it is executed properly but with the S8 Plus, it's kinda weird because you really don't
know where you're pressing. Oftentimes, I kept swiping
and smudging up the camera. As far as the fingerprint reader goes, I definitely prefer the iPhone 7 Plus. It's easier to access,
it's a little more natural, and it really makes me wish Samsung would've gone the extra mile
and put the fingerprint reader into their infinity display. If you hop into settings,
there is actually an option where you can unlock
your phone by pressing the home button from your lock screen. The problem here, though, is there is no level of security. Again, if Samsung could've incorporated the fingerprint reader here,
it would've been amazing. Yes, the S8 Plus has an iris
scanner, it has face unlock, but those still feel a little
gimmicky at this point. I really have no desire to unlock my phone with my face. Moving on, we're gonna
play a game of things I really like on the S8
Plus, starting with USB-C. As most of you are aware, Apple uses their
proprietary Lightning cable and it really makes me wish, Tim Cook, please, man, move on the USB-C because if everything
was one singular cable it would be amazing. Next to that sweet USB-C port, you'll also notice on the Galaxy S8 Plus, there is still a headphone jack. Speaking of headphones, a pretty
cool move Samsung did here, was to incorporate a pretty sweet pair of AKG headphones in the box. These supposedly are
around a hundred bucks. If you compare these with
the Lightning-based EarPods which sell for 29, Samsung
definitely takes the cake here. What I do really like
about this move, though, is is kind of puts some pressure on Apple to step things up. I think the equivalent here would be for Apple to include a pair
of AirPods with the iPhone. They clearly don't want us using cables. So, if that's the case, make it easy and give us AirPods. Flipping things for a second, one thing I really like about the 7 Plus is the fact that it
incorporates stereo speakers. That's something that Galaxy
S8 Plus does not have. ("Love &amp; War" by Yellow Claw) Now, I totally understand, hearing those two compared
side-by-side through video is not better than hearing them in person but I will say the Galaxy S8 Plus does hold it's own in terms of volume. But as far as sheer sound
quality and clarity, the stereo speakers on the 7
Plus definitely sound better. As far as battery life, even though the iPhone 7 Plus is technically a smaller capacity, whenever I've used one,
I've never had a problem getting through an entire day. They're actually pretty close
in terms of battery life. A couple of other cool things
with the Galaxy S8 Plus is you're getting Micro SD card expansion up to 256 gigabytes. Beyond that is Bluetooth 5.0, which is kind of cool
because you can control two separate Bluetooth
devices independently, something you cannot do
on the iPhone 7 Plus. You also have wireless charge on S8 Plus, even though whenever I
bring up wireless charging everyone freaks out
because no one actually likes wireless charging,
but you have it anyways. I'm not gonna dive too much into Bixby. Although, I will say I cannot stand the dedicated Bixby button on the S8 Plus because every time I go to
press the volume rocker, I activate Bixby and-- - Bixby, why you being such a (beep). - [Bixby] Why don't you
ask your little girlfriend Google Assistant or Siri, your side chick? - Also, there really
isn't a whole lot to cover on iOS versus Android. Each of them have their
strengths and their weaknesses. Android is gonna get you
a ton more customization and tweak-ability. And iOS is gonna get you iMessage. So, at the end of the day, you can see the Galaxy
S8 Plus is gonna put a ton of pressure on
Apple with the iPhone 8. Stacked up next to the iPhone 7 Plus, in terms of sheer technology, the Galaxy S8 Plus is
definitely the cooler phone. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. And about that giveaway,
that is going down right now. I've teamed up with Miss Krystal Key, we're giving away a
brand new Galaxy S8 Plus and iPhone 7 Plus. For a chance to win, make
sure you're subscribed here as well as her channel. If you guys cannot get
enough of camera comparisons, she did a much better job than me. You can check that video out here. Go watch it now. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (beep) Damn 58 strokes a minute. How many strokes a minute you do, Rich? - [Rich] I get up to
like a hundred something. - Hundred and something? 
(pensive music) - So if you couldn't
tell, I'm a pretty big fan of Ed Sheeran. I've dug his music for
a couple of years now. I saw him live, which was amazing. Then recently a couple of months ago, Divide came out. Naturally I was super excited. And I swear, I must've
listened to that album for like two weeks straight. And during that time, I
remember it was late at night, I was frantically running
back up and down stairs trying to fill circles on my Apple watch. And while I was listening to it I thought it would be amazing to do an Ed Sheeran dream desk. Now I totally understand when
you hear those words together it might sound a little silly. In fact, I remember the very next morning I told Austin at the gym I'm gonna make an Ed Sheeran dream desk and naturally he kinda laughed at me. What I think he had in his head was probably more like a fan desk with autographs and pictures. But for me, it was more
than just the music something about the divide
symbol, the color blue, I thought it would be amazing if I could somehow
implement that into a desk. At one point I even
talked to my buddy Chris over at Foureyes' Furniture
to potentially make a custom desk for this. But then it was at that
point when I realized that I had the answer right in
front of me the entire time. This desk here, which we already had, by itself is beautiful. But what makes it so
special is on the back, or in this case the front
because of how I have it set up, it attaches magnetically. At its core it's used
for cable management, but it kinda set off this
lightbulb in my brain that this would be perfect. What I kinda saw in my head was this semi-transparent divide symbol that we could shoot colored light at, and not only get that divide blue, but if we wanted to throw
back to orange or green, we could do that too. From there Chris was able
to whip up some concepts that looked amazing. So I gave him the green light, not only to cut out that
portion of the panel, but also to have that acrylic made. And I think the end result is amazing. Now with this dream desk,
it was less about the set up or the computer or the
tech or the gadgets, and more so about the desk itself. For me, it didn't matter if it was a Microsoft Surface Studio, the original 1984 Macintosh
or a picture of DJ Khaled, this was about the desk. ♫ I'm in love with the shape of you ♫ We push and pull like a magnet do ♫ And though my heart is falling too ♫ I'm in love with your body ♫ And last night you were in my room ♫ And now my bedsheets smell like you ♫ Every day discovering
something brand new ♫ I'm in love with your body - Now this is the point of the video where I would normally find someone and surprise them with
something really, really cool, but this dream desk is different. My initial plan was to find
an Ed Sheeran super fan and then surprise them in
this video with tickets to an upcoming concert, but
in searching for that fan, I stumbled upon a tweet
that changed everything. This tweet here is from
this amazing mother, Sheryl, who had reached out to Ed
Sheeran in hopes of him maybe dedicating a verse or a
song to her baby boy Thomas, who had terminal cancer. - And all I could think of was Ed Sheeran. And obviously it was like emotions and I'm like oh I'm gonna,
I'm gonna tweet Ed Sheeran. So that was the initial reason for that. And then you got it. So maybe that's one
step towards Ed Sheeran, but we'll never know. So about six weeks old for Thomas, we saw him and he was doing all the checks and making sure that he's growing fine and development, like responding well and like sounds and light
and things like that. And then he felt a lump on his abdomen. And since like we saw
the doctor the next day and it just snowballed from there. Like he was already ringing
the children's hospital and the following week,
when he was 11 weeks, they just said the cancer has spread, 'cause they found nodules
in his lungs as well and his hip, he can't move
his right leg anymore. And it started at the hospital and we were like wondering
what's wrong with it? Is it something from the
surgery, but they said no, there's a tumor now. - Now at this point I was already so emotionally attached to this, but it wasn't until the point where Sheryl flipped the
camera and I saw Thomas, and that broke my heart. - [Sheryl] But he just, he
looks unsuspecting stranger will know nothing, they'll
just think that he's, yeah, like a baby. - Here was this beautiful
innocent baby boy who's laughing, who's smiling. All I could think to myself
is he does not deserve this. - Hey Daddy. What's Daddy doing? Hi Daddy. - Now from there I was fixated on trying to make this happen. I was on Twitter, I was Instagram, I was e-mailing anyone I
could possibly think of that could potentially help. I did this week after week after week. I didn't care that the next
dream desk was delayed. I just wanted to help make this happen. So fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I'm still trying, I don't wanna give up. But then I see a tweet from Sheryl and learned that baby Thomas passed away. So at that point I kinda
felt like I failed them, like I let 'em down, I
couldn't pull through. But then thinking of Sheryl
and how strong she's been, this was nothing compared
to what she has to deal with or her husband or her baby boy. So with that I wanted to
finish this dream desk. Maybe somehow, some way,
Ed Sheeran will see this and reach out to Sheryl. So if you guys can help in any way by sharing this, that would be amazing. Sheryl thank you so much for
letting me into your family, for giving me a chance to know Thomas. I'm so sorry for everything
you've had to go through. You're an incredible mother
and I know you're gonna inspire so many people. ♫ 'Cause you are my one and only ♫ You can wrap your
fingers 'round my thumb ♫ And hold me tight - [Kid] I love you so much. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - Thomas. - I am sorry you had to go
through that little buddy, but I promise you, you
will never be forgotten. ♫ You're just a small boy, so young ♫ Two years torn from life ♫ Maybe you were needed up there ♫ But we're still unaware is why 
- You guys, Jonathan
here for Black Friday. We saw some really, freaking' good deals but I think Cyber Monday
might be even better. Number one deal on this list, Austin Evans, recently dropped from $67.99 to $12.46. - Ouch. - [Jonathan] Link below. Next we got some headphones on sale. The Status CB-1's are
on sale for 55 bucks. Honestly, I love these
things when they were priced at a hundred. One of the most underrated
pairs of headphones out there, period. So for 55 bucks, they are a freaking steal on Instabuy. And if you're looking to
upgrade your headphones jump on these. You will not be disappointed. What's next on the deal list? Next, we got another smart phone deal. The original first generation Google Pixel is on sale for $459. Now I not sure how
attractive it is with things like the one plus 5T, or the essential phone. But if you want that
pure Google experience, I think it's a really solid deal for under 500 bucks. So next if you're looking
for an inexpensive tablet, this is about as cheap
as it possibly gets. Well, at least without
worrying about the tablet being a pile of shh. - De-monetize. - Rich gots food poisoning right now. If you hope Rich feels better, drop a Like down below. (laughs) The Kindle Fire 7 is on sale for 29 bucks. 29 freaking' dollars. You probably spend more than
that on coffee in a month. So if you've got kids, or you got family or
somebody you wanna bring some tech into their life without dropping a ton of cash, this is your guy. Or girl. Next we got some more headphone deals. The Sennheiser HD 579 Open Back Headphones are on sale for 99 bucks. Now keep in mind, these are open backs, so they're gonna bleed a little bit. Not gonna be the ideal pair of headphones to wear out in public, unless you wanna share with people what you're listening to, but if you're looking
for a fantastic standard pair of headphones to enjoy at home, I would scoop these up asap. Next maybe using an IPhone 8, 8 Plus, 10 or Google Pixel Two and you are missing that headphone jack, the Bose SoundSport headphones are on sale for 99 bucks. Now the original price there are probably
better options out there but at 99 bucks, I would scoop these up in a heart beat. Now this next MacBook deal is actually a much better deal than you might think. It's for an early 2016 12 inch MacBook and it's on sale for $999. I think the initial reaction
might be to ask yourself, "Well this is for the
previous generation model. "Is it actually a good deal?" What just makes this a good deal is if you look closely, it's actually a bumped up tier so you're getting 512 Gigabytes of storage so at one point even if the list price is $1299 this was a 1600 dollar machine which is pretty damn good, man. From there, if you caught my recent What's In My Tech Bag video, I feature the Hershel Apex Lawson which is one of my
favorite backpacks to date. Today for Cyber Monday, if you spend 60 bucks, you get 20 back. If you spent 110, you get 40 back. Or, if you spend 140 bucks, you get 60 bucks back. So if you're looking at that video, maybe you're interested in that backpack but didn't want to spend that much. Today is the perfect day to scoop it up. From there, kind of jumping outside the tech world, Urban Outfitters is doing a similar deal where if you spend 150 bucks, you get 50 dollars back. A couple deals I saw is the EP 33 Bluetooth turntable which I featured way back. Got some questions about it but today with that discount, it's $119.99. Next for you sneaker heads out there, one of my favorite pairs of NMD's are included with this discount. This is an all silver pair of XR1s. You get the silver boost which really makes them stand out with the discount. These are on sale for 110 bucks. Next, we're looking to jump into these smart home lighting game, there's a Philips Hue White Starter kit on sale for 67 bucks. What's awesome is you actually
get the hue motion sensor included with this. That is normally about 30 to 40 bucks by itself, so for this with the bundle, it's a steal. For Black Friday, we saw some really awesome
Google home videos, but today, there are some
really freaking good deals for Amazon Echo's. You can grab these second
generation Amazon Echo for 17 bucks and aesthetically with the different colors and options. These are on point. The Echo Dot is on sale for 29 bucks which is rivaling that
Google home mini price. You don't get the 10 dollar gift card but still it is a really,
really enticing deal. Also, the Echo Plus is on sale for $119.99 but you're also getting
a Philips Hue light bulb so you're kind of getting a two in one into that smart home set up. Next, there are probably
way too many to list out individually, but Amazon
is doing a huge sale on cases from there. From ten, 8, 8 Plus, Galaxy S8, Note 8. There's even some accessorize, too so I will post everyone
one of those down below. Next, if you're looking to pick up your own first drone, there's a DJI spark bundle for 399. I believe Best Buy and (mumbles) did this for Black Friday, but it's currently also
available on Amazon. I have no ideal how long this will last but it is a damn good deal. Next, I actual Tweeted this deal out a day or two ago and it looks like it is still active. There's a 128 gigabyte micro SD card from Samsung for 36 bucks. If you're looking for an upgrade, that is about as cheap
as it comes right now. Next, the GoPro Hero5 Black is on sale for 349 each. Pick this up at Amazon, Best Buy, Target being (mumbles) so it kind of seems to be the universal Cyber Monday price right now. Last up on the deals list is the Sanyo wireless charger. So if you have a IPhone 8, 8 Plus, IPhone 10, Galaxy S8, pretty much every phone but the Google Pixel two. One plus 5T. Essentially phone. This will work for you. With that price, I actually
ordered one right now. If you own one, I would love to hear what you think on how it works but aside from that, thank you guys very much for watching. Hopefully, you enjoyed this video. If you did, and you are feeling like being awesome, make sure to go. (bell rings) On that Like button. Again, every one of these deals are linked down below. Time is running out so make sure you jump on 'em. This is Johnathan and I'll catch you guys later. (beeping) (laughs) That's good, man. Comb your hair. Hope you feel better. - [Man] Thanks buddy. 
- So this is the Galaxy S9
in glorious lilac purple. It also comes in midnight black and-- - Coral. - --blue.
(light jazz music) Yo guys, Jonathan here. Get excited, because the Galaxy
S9 and S9 Plus are official. They've got a pretty cool trick up their sleeve that impressed me. I got to go hands on with them. And these are 10 things
to know before buying. So first up, and this
may inherently disappoint some people out there, and that's the fact that the Galaxy S9 is not a redesign, but rather it takes
everything that was good about the Galaxy S8 and even
the things that were lacking and improves upon them in
pretty much every possible way. We still see that same beautiful 18.5 by nine infinity display. The Galaxy S9 sizes in at 5.8 inches, whereas the Galaxy S9 Plus is 6.2 inches. Now the big difference
between the Galaxy S9 Plus and S9 aside from the screen size is going to be RAM and battery life. With the S9 Plus, you get six gigabytes versus four on the S9. And then with battery life, you're getting 3500 milliamp hours on the S9 Plus versus 3,000 on the S9. I realize those numbers might
be slightly disappointing for some people out there,
but the good news is, especially for those in the US, is the Snapdragon 845 inside these will not only lead to better performance but also better efficiency,
which should translate to overall better battery life. Now, the other giant
difference between these two is going to be dual
cameras in the S9 Plus. You get a wide angle and
then a telephoto lens, very similar to what we
saw in the Galaxy Note 8, versus the single
shooter on the Galaxy S9. From that, number two,
speaking of cameras, both the S9 Plus and S9
have a really cool trick up its sleeve, variable aperture. So the best way to imagine this is the camera on the Galaxy S9 essentially is going to react to light in a very similar way
to how your eyes would. You're outside where it's super bright, effectively your eyes are
letting less light in. And then you go inside
where it's a little bit lower lighting situation, then your eyes adjust
and let more light in. The same thing is happening here where the camera on the
Galaxy S9 will adjust and adapt and effectively switch the F-stop from 2.4 down to 1.5. That lets a ton more light in. And the crazy cool thing is you can actually see this happening. That, in turn, should lead to much better low-light performance,
so I am super excited to check that out for the full review. And if you haven't yet,
definitely feel free to subscribe so you don't
miss out on that video. Now, to clarify, because
the whole variable aperture and dual cameras on the S9 Plus versus single camera on the S9
might be a little confusing. The way that works is both phones do get variable aperture, but the S9 Plus, that's going to be on
its main wide angle lens, whereas the telephoto lens is only F/2.4. Next from there, we're
going to jump over to video. And the third thing to
know is the Galaxy S9 can record super slow motion video up to 960 frames per second. What's really cool with
this is the Galaxy S9 is smart enough to know and react when the motion happens, so
you're not having to guess or react when that's
happening to yourself. I got a chance to blow up some confetti, which of course looks way
cooler in slow motion. Watching that back on the Galaxy S9, everything about this was all automatic. So there was no triggering, no reacting. It was simply pressing record. It knew when the confetti popped
out, and we have this clip. From there, beyond just saving the video, you can turn it into a GIF. You could even turn it
into your moving wallpaper if you wanted to. The 960 FPS comes in at 720P, so it's not the highest resolution, but still pretty impressive, nonetheless. Beyond that, you can do 1080P
at 240 frames per second or up to 4K at 60 frames per second. So there is a ton of video
options on the Galaxy S9. From there, number four, in a world where headphone jacks
aren't that common anymore, where wireless charging
still isn't a standard on every major flagship yet, the Galaxy S9 is packed full of the essentials. The headphone jack is still there. And I'm one to admit, I
actually love and prefer wireless headphones,
but to a lot of people, that headphone jack is a
valuable and sacred commodity, and it is here on the Galaxy S9. You have USBC, which in turn
gives you quick charge 2.0, but you have the best of both worlds with fast wireless charging as well. MicroSD card expansion, and as of now, there are 400-gigabyte microSD cards, which will work in the Galaxy S9. Again, it's not new, but the Galaxy S9, of course, is water and dust-resistant. So these core features by themselves are not game-changers, but together, show that Samsung has
done a really good job trying to accommodate to all
kinds of users out there. Next at number five, the
Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus now feature front-facing stereo speakers. And if you've never had
that on a smartphone, it is a beautiful thing. I got a chance to listen
to this at the event. It was a little loud, a little noisy, so it wasn't the best environment
to really form an opinion, but at the very least,
you could still hear a really big difference
between the Galaxy S9 and S8. From there, beyond the stereo speakers, there is now Dolby Atmos support. In talking to Samsung, again, their idea with this was the refinement process. With the Galaxy S8 and
its infinity display, that kind of kicked off the
ultimate viewing experience. With the Galaxy S9,
that kind of takes that, rounds off the audio experience, so now you get the best of both worlds. Next at number six, Samsung
listened to everybody that complained about
the terrible location of the fingerprint reader on the Galaxy S8 and moved it on the Galaxy S9. So no longer do you have
to move your finger around in an awkward spot and kind of guess where it is to unlock your phone. Now, on the Galaxy S9, it
is right below the camera, which is a much better location. With that, though, that
means the fingerprint reader on the Galaxy S9 is still going to be the main form of security. You of course can unlock your phone with your eyes, but that's
going to be an option as opposed to the main form of security like something on the iPhone X. Next up at number seven, I'm not sure if AR Emoji is cool or creepy. What is AR Emoji, you ask? It takes a 2D image of your face and then maps over 100
different facial expressions and then translates
that into this 3D image that reacts to your expressions. It's almost like Bitmoji and Animoji got smashed together, except
just a little bit weirder. I will say, weird or not,
it is very responsive and works as advertised, so this is me moving my face around as an AR Emoji. You can pop in different backgrounds. You can save it as a GIF,
as a picture, as a video. The possibilities seem to be endless. I will say I guess the
potential advantages over Animoji is, one,
you can record longer than 10 seconds, and two, you
have way more customization. Either way, though, I'm not
sure this is going to be the main or most attractive feature of why you'd want to buy
a Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus. If it is, though, or if
you're remotely excited for AR Emoji, let me know
with a comment down below. Next up at number eight,
Bixby is better than ever. Now, when I hear Bixby, to this day, I still can't not think of Bubsy Bobcat. I realize Bixby, especially
that dedicated Bixby button, gets a lot of hate, but one feature that I thought was cool on the Galaxy S9 is the ability to instantly translate signs or different languages
through the camera. Previously, you would
need to take a picture in order to translate that text, but now, through AR, it is
instant through the camera. And honestly, it works really good. You can see if I turn the camera slightly off axis and then back, how fast the translation actually happens. So if you're out traveling, I could see this being really useful. Is this enough to warrant the praise and full-time use of Bixby or even being happy
with that Bixby button? I'm not sure if I'm quite there yet. But still, it's nice to
see some useful features coming to Bixby, especially
on the Galaxy S9. Now, next at number nine, along with the Galaxy S9
comes improved DeX experience. If you remember last year,
I turned my Galaxy S8 into a desk setup because of DeX. That stands for Desktop Experience. Now it is better than
ever with the Galaxy S9. It's actually more of an alternative as opposed to a replacement,
so you still have the option to dock your DeX setup. But this is rather an option where you can place your Galaxy S9 down and then use that as a mouse and keyboard. So the touchscreen, kind of
very similar to what we saw on Razer in the Project Linda, that's happening here with the Galaxy S9 where you can plug this into a display and then use that as your control. So the idea with this is most
places you're traveling to will probably have some
sort of TV or monitor, and this allows you not to have to carry a keyboard or a mouse and kind
of keep things lightweight. On top of that, with those
performance improvements on the Galaxy S9, that's
kind of where they showed off a gaming scenario plugged into a monitor. I'm not sure if I'm quite sold on the whole gaming plugged into a dock kind of thing with your smartphone. For me, I'd probably rather just stay on the smartphone itself, but either way, it's kind of cool to see
Samsung staying on top of this. So last up at number
10 is when you can buy the Galaxy S9, and to answer that shortly, pre-orders begin March 2. They will hit the stores March 16. So that is very, very close. Typically, Samsung announces
their Galaxy S lineup in March. That in turn hits the stores in April. That's what we saw with the Galaxy 8. But this year, we're
getting our hands on it just a little bit early. So with that, I would love to hear what you think of the Galaxy S9. Is it enough of an upgrade? What do you think of the colors? Are you team lilac purple, midnight black, or probably in my case, coral blue. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video. If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure you guys smash that like button. Again, stay tuned for the full review, which is coming very soon. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. (bouncy music) 
- Hey guys, Jonathan here,
and the iMac Pro is here, like now, and I'm not gonna
lie, I'm a little excited. So, first things first, we
got that box within a box. Clearly, I've opened up
one too many Amazon boxes where you don't need a
knife, you know exactly what I'm talking about. With this one, I probably
should have used one. So getting to the first box,
excitement level just went from here to here, seeing
that space gray iMac Pro right smack on the front of the box. So iMac Pro is stamped
on the top of the box, and on one side we see
that beautiful 5K display, but as we flip things,
there's a side profile shot of the iMac Pro, and
because of that space gray, it looks like this shadowy silhouette, which is kind of awesome. And before we get into the iMac Pro, first we gotta get to those sweet, sweet space gray accessories. First is the Apple wireless
keyboard with number pad and those black keys paired with that space gray finish looks really good. Next is the Apple magic
mouse, and as much as I love that space gray finish, not sure exactly how much I'll be using this,
at the very least, though, it is reflective as all hell, so much so, you can see right
bouncing right off of it. Next is that space gray
track pad which looks-- - Very nice. - This, I definitely will
use, I'll probably pair it with a Logitech Performance
MX or something like that. Last but not least, we have
a black lightning cable, I'm not sure why this excites me, because I know you can pick up a black lightning cable on Amazon, but it is still cool nonetheless. Update, I was looking for
some black Apple stickers, thought there would be maybe
a hidden compartment here or somewhere inside, but
sadly, we are out of luck. So now finally, it is time
to get to the iMac Pro. I can see the space gray. Now, if you've ever un-boxed an iMac, from what I can remember,
it's always been styrofoam, so this, nope. That's kinda different, kinda nice! So we got one more box before
we get to that iMac Pro, and nothing exciting here,
we got that black power cord. Last but not least, we got the iMac Pro. They even got the space
gray wrapping around it. Oh my goodness! It looks so good! Plastic off. But I have wanted, I think
along with many people out there for a while
now, a space gray iMac, and the fact that it is a space
gray iMac, and an iMac Pro, it's kind of awesome. Last one. Look at that. Space gray. Holy crap, I feel like I'm sweating getting that thing out of the box. The plan is to use it
over the next couple days, test it, edit with it. Tonight I just wanted
to get it out of the box so I can get a early start
tomorrow and set it up. So that next day has kinda turned into about a week and 1/2,
but within that time, we got a chance to extensively
test out the iMac Pro. To quickly recap and
reflect on my thoughts on this configuration, which is a 10-core AMD Vega 64 model, 120 gigabytes of RAM and two terabytes of flash storage, I think the sweet spot in
terms of price to performance would be taking that base model, and solely upgrading the
process of two 10-cores. Now, the reason behind that is yeah, those 14 and 18 core machines, they're gonna be monsters, but
they're much more expensive and in terms of the 10-core,
that's actually the fastest clock speed you're gonna get in terms of single threaded performance. As far as that performance, actually the livestream this week
showcasing performance and comparing the iMac Pro
versus a maxed out 2017 iMac, and finally a MacBook Pro it was more so a real time
kinda benchmark archive so you can go back and
watch that if you wanted to. I will drop a link down below. In terms of single core performance, they're all pretty close across the board which really wasn't
too much of a surprise. The iMac and MacBook Pro, those were close with multi core scores. Where the big difference was
though, was with the iMac Pro. Those 10-cores pumped out
a score of over 36,000. From there, in terms of
disc speed, I kinda assumed all these would also
perform very similarly. It was mostly true except
where the big standout was on the iMac Pro, the
write speeds were nearly three gigabytes a second,
which is kinda crazy. So yeah, benchmarks, those are
cool, but to kinda showcases some real world examples for me-- I shoot video, I edit video. That is what I do for a living, so my main use with this iMac Pro is Final Cut Pro 10 and editing video. With that said, though, I
realize not everyone edits video, especially within Final Cut Pro. I got a chance to sync up
with my buddy Matt Workman who is an insanely
smart and talented dude. He was awesome enough to
tweak a Cinema 4D scene so I could render it across the iMac Pro, the iMac and the MacBook Pro. What's interesting is he
actually tested this out on this system which is a
16-core AMD Threadripper. Configured total cost in that
machine is about 5400 bucks. That kinda puts some
perspective on the iMac Pro that's not crazy, because
with that configuration you gotta remember you're
also not getting a 5K display. Regardless, though, his
system is an absolute monster and to render out that scene, which is purely CPU based, no GPU, it took about three minutes
and 18 seconds on his machine. The iMac Pro was just over five minutes. The iMac non Pro is about 12 minutes and the MacBook Pro finally
finished up at 22 minutes. You can kinda see the performance
across all these systems. For reference I do shoot
on an AK RED camera. Prior to the iMac Pro for the most part I would shoot in 4K ProRes. What that does, it takes
a beautiful AK sensor, kinda down samples it into
a buttery smooth 4K ProRes which is amazingly fast to edit. You do lose those raw controls, but you get a super
sharp image, great color, and more importantly, an insanely
smooth editing experience. You definitely could edit
AK raw footage on an iMac or even if you wanted to, a MacBook Pro but it's not the smoothest experience and rendering and export
takes absolutely forever. On the iMac Pro it's
almost like you unlocked this completely new level of editing. AK raw on the iMac Pro kinda felt like I was editing 4K ProRes on a MacBook Pro. If that makes sense, it's crazy. For me what was the most
impressive thing about this was taking that AK footage. It was shot at a 12 to one compression which is actually pretty
demanding on a computer and from that take in that footage put it into a timeline,
playing everything back. While that is happening, tweak the raw controls,
ISO, white balance. It is kind of mind blowing. If you caught the livestream essentially what I had
going on was AK footage dropped into a 4K timeline. I turned background rendering off to kinda make this a little
harder on the iMac Pro. It took that AK footage in the 4K timeline then trans-coded it into
ASOT 264 un-rendered. The total time was about
just over five minutes for a three minute
timeline which is bonkers. From there, while the
MacBook Pro and the iMac were still painfully chugging along I turned background
rendering on, exported again and that was about a minute and 40 seconds which is faster than real time. That kind of power has enabled
me to take full advantage of AK raw, RED's new IPPII color science which has been incredible. But then, Final Cut Pro 10.4, the new color controls are amazing. There's built in light,
so you can see here this is pure RED raw footage. The next step from there would be to apply a REC7 and light to give
us a great starting point, and then from there, I
can then tweak things to really fine tune
and dial everything out so you can see before and after. So, that's kinda been my impressions with the iMac Pro so far. I definitely wanna do some
more extensive testing and kinda complete these tests on the iMac Pro and MacBook Pro and kinda do maybe a little
more realistic tests. This was kind of an extreme example to showcase the pure
power on the iMac Pro. So, as I continue to test this, definitely let me know what you wanna see in the full, blown out crazy review. Aside from that, thank you
guy very much for watching, hopefully you enjoyed it. If you did, make sure you
smash that like button. If you missed the livestream which kinda showcases these benchmarks in real time, I'll drop the link down below. This is Jonathon and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and this is a $50 MacBook Pro dummy. So if you're thinking to
yourself, "Why is he sliding that "poor MacBook across the table?" Do not worry, it is fake. What had happened was I
got this email from China as you do, asking if I wanted
a buy a $50 MacBook Pro dummy and thought to myself, I
would be stupid not to. So 7 to 10 international
business days later, this thing arrives in this
super sketchy mysterious white box. I honestly had no idea what to expect, but much to my surprise, I was surprised. Oh man. It's metal, holy. Honestly, I thought it
was gonna be plastic. This thing feels like an actual MacBook. It's got the space gray,
USB-C ports, headphone jack. It's got some heft to it. I am actually really
surprised for 50 bucks. This is kinda crazy. I don't think it turns on. (laughing) It's a fake screen. So the screen is weird. It is almost so fake that
you kinda gotta double check to make sure that it's not
real, if that makes sense. I will give these guys an A for effort for trying to replicate the screen, but once you look closely,
you can see how hilarious some of the translations are. So if you look towards the
top next to the Apple logo, we see Finder, file, the
editor, according to, to travel to, window, and help. Next to the battery
icon, we can see spell, and then my personal favorite, the date On Thursday Afternoon 5:31. This is clearly modeled
after a 13 inch space gray MacBook Pro and I am
surprised at how much detail went in to this down to the
giant trackpad, the ports, the weight, even the
space gray finish is close until you get them side by side. What I immediately notice
with the real MacBook Pro, it actually had more of a gradient to it when the light hit it
as opposed to the clone where it was kinda flat. If you look closely too
as I move my hand across you can see how much more of a reflection the real MacBook Pro picks up
as opposed to the fake one. So with that much detail, if
this thing would've turned on, it would've been freaking
amazing, but of course, with it being a nonfunctioning dummy, I still had a backup plan. Earlier today I brought over
my buddy Chris to talk about the next Dream Desk design,
so drop a like if you're excited for that. But I also wanted to see if
I could get him to believe this was a real MacBook and
drop it right in front of him. Alright Chris. Don't laugh at this okay. - [Chris] Okay. - I drew this up in like--
- This is your first 3D rendering?
- Yeah. Here, grab it. Oh, Jesus! You, oh no. Jesus. - This is fake. - Yeah, it is. (laughing) - Did he catch it?
- He caught it! I gotta get someone else next. - [Cameraman] Evans. - I know, we're gonna get Evans. (laughing) - Well, it's actually pretty hefty. - [Jonathan] Yeah, I was surprised. The only dead giveaway is the screen. It's a $50 MacBook clone. - Really?
- Yeah. - That's made to just be a prop? - Yeah, I guess so.
- That's funny. So have you guys dropped it? - No, you got catlike reflexes. (laughing) Who catches that? Like, on the first? He caught it like right here too. He was like. Yeah, I was like, aw, well, this sucks. That clearly didn't work
thanks to Mr. Chris's ninja reflexes, so my next target was Mr. Austin Evans. I was a little apprehensive
because he knew in someway there was a fake MacBook around, but I wanted to try it anyways. - Oh my, dude! Evans, you reacted so good, man! - Well first thing I looked and I saw that it was all bent up. (laughing) - [Guy On Couch] Yeah, you
took too long to grab it. You had to analyze it from the outside. - Yeah, you should've dropped it quicker. That was pretty good. You almost got me. - [Guy On Couch] That reflex, man. You were too late. - So that reaction with Evans
is definitely a little better, I am not sure what else
this dummy could be good for aside from a joke. It would be insanely evil
and super heartbreaking if you got somebody a MacBook
Pro for their birthday or as a gift and popped
this inside instead. Realistically, it could be
used in a store as a demo model so no one jacks the real thing, but other than that there really
isn't much use out of this. Now again, I will say
there was a ton of detail that went into this. So much in fact that I was
curious to see what was inside this pile. So after trying to pry this
open, shaking it around, pulling it open, we of
course are left inside with more plastic. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching and I know, a $50 MacBook
Pro dummy giveaway is not interesting but what
is is a Nintendo Switch and also some custom painted AirPods which you can check out here. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Without a doubt, this is the biggest unboxing I have ever done on this channel. Maybe not size-wise, but for sure sheer mass. Apple dropped a ton of new computers this month, so I decided to channel my inner DetroitBORG and get pretty much every single one of them. Here is a high-end 27-inch iMac. Here is the lower-end 21.5-inch iMac. This is the 15-inch space
gray Touch Bar MacBook Pro, and last but not least, the lowest-end non-Touch
Bar 13-inch MacBook Pro. This may be a terrible idea. So my debate is if I should go from smallest to biggest, and I think what I'll do is I'll go from cheapest to most expensive, that's gonna give us a nice cross pattern here to here to here to here. That means we're gonna start with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which again is the cheapest MacBook Pro you can buy, this is the non-Touch Bar model. Maybe people don't need it, this might be a fantastic option. (crinkling paper) Nothing more satisfying than some sweet, sweet --
- Can. - We have the USB-C cable, some literature, and that USB-C power brick. I wish everything would go USB-C. Nothing really new has changed on the outside with these MacBook Pros, it has all been internally upgraded. So on the outside, they look exactly the same as last year. Drop that. - ♫ Drop that ass - So, next up is the 21.5-inch iMac, and from what I've seen, this is the $1,499 configuration and I think it might be the best bang for your buck, which is really strange as far as Apple products go. But, iMac unboxings are always a really smooth, smooth experience. I am potentially gonna murder that. Bring it down. Keyboard, mouse. (sliding styrofoam) Oh, no. Oh, I hate styrofoam. Ugh, I'm sorry. Why did I think this was a good idea? And why is the top not coming off? It has been a while since I've seen a 21.5-inch iMac in person, they always look like, that's not good. - Okay, okay. - Alright, power supply next. Let's undress this guy. The baby iMac. God, there's so much plastic with these things. (crinkling plastic) iMac one, out. Box, go away. 13-inch MacBook Pro out, 21.5-inch iMac out. I'm gonna give you that sweet view of the backside so you don't stare at
some glossy reflections. Cheapest to most expensive. This is the highest-end GPU can get, so I'm pretty excited to see as far as performance goes. I've actually still been using my 2016 MacBook Pro and haven't really got a chance to see the performance bump on these. So I'm kinda nerding out a little bit for that. We got baby brothers, and bigger brothers, in every shape and form right now. Of course, all space gray. I wish these were space gray, but unfortunately we're gonna have to wait for the iMac Pro for that. For reference, quick size comparison. 13-inch MacBook Pro, 15-inch MacBook Pro. Smashed next to the 21.5-inch iMac. So I'm gonna set these down. Actually, let's get a little stack action. You guys saw what came with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, it's exactly the same minus a slightly bigger, more powerful power brick, with the 15-inch MacBook Pro. 15-inch MacBook Pro away, and we are on to the big daddy. The 27-inch iMac, again much like the 15-inch MacBook Pro, this is pretty spec'd out. Highest-end GPU, 512 gigs of that sweet, fast flash storage. Hopefully this is a little, that was much easier than the 21-inch model. So this is a terrible idea. Okay, there we go. We are almost there. Oh, that was nice. That was like a nice rip. (exhales) (crinkling plastic) One more piece of plastic, and we got the whole family completed. 27-inch iMac here, we're gonna go 21 1/2-inch iMac here. 15-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and before I continue, I wanna give a huge shoutout to LastPass for making
this craziness possible. So a huge shout out to LastPass for sponsoring this video. With LastPass, they eliminate the need to worry about remembering passwords and potentially getting
locked out of your account. True story, Rich actually missed out on a pair of Zebras this weekend because he could not
remember his password. With LastPass, you don't need to write, remember, or even reset those passwords. They essentially do all the work for you. Put you on auto-pilot mode so you can do things like unbox an insane amount of computing machines. Now I get it, you love grandma, but it's not always the most convenient thing in the world trying to remember her maiden name when you're trying to figure out that security question. This is gonna allow you not to do that, plus on top of that, it's also gonna enable you to never use the same password on every single website. Hopefully, you're not doing that, hopefully you're not using 1234. If you are any of those people, make sure you guys check out LastPass which is linked down below. Now, for reference this 13-inch MacBook Pro is the only dual-core machine. This, this and this are all quad-core. Right off the bat by far, as far as price and performance goes, this is hands down the most impressive. On Geekbench 4, we got a single-core score of 4,924, multi-core was 14,215, and why that is so impressive is this; this is a $2,800 dollar MacBook Pro, it scored 4,776 on the single-core score side, and 15,851. So this on the single-core side outperformed this MacBook Pro. It was really, really close on the multi-core side. Now for comparison, this 13-inch MacBook Pro did pretty well on the single-core side, 4,516. Obviously, you are
getting nowhere near the power on the multi-core side with two cores versus four here. That scored 9,497, but as we move over to the giant, this is the clear winner
as far as performance goes. Single-core score of 5,805, and then we hop over to the
multi-core score, 19,737. From there I'm gonna go
ahead and test out the disk speed test performance. This is actually the only oddball here as far as that goes. All three of three of these machines are pure fast flash storage, whereas this is the Fusion Drive. Still though, a much better option than
a 7,200 RPM hard drive, or for whatever reason, Apple still sells a 5400 RPM hard drive in the baseline iMac. It is 2017, and no one should use that. So hopping over to the 21.5-inch iMac. As far as performance goes, this is 357 megabytes
per second on the write, and then 566 megabytes
per second on the read. So, jumping over to this MacBook Pro, that is where we really start to see the speed gains as far as flash storage goes. On the write side, this scored 686 megabytes per second, whereas read was a crazy fast
1,848 megabytes a second. Where we see the absolute
fastest performance though is when we hop over to this MacBook Pro and this 27-inch iMac. On the write side here, this was 1,987 megabytes per second, and then read 2,415. Same story here, where the write side comes in at 1,990 megabytes per second, and the read side 2,547, so just slightly faster
than the MacBook Pro, but still both of these are crazy fast. Now, whether you go from the 27-inch iMac, or the 21.5-inch iMac, both of these, in addition to the USB 3 ports, also have Thunderbolt 3 in the USB-C flavor. So you definitely have more port options compared to the MacBook Pros. These are stuck with
just Thunderbolt 3 ports in that USB-C flavor. Now, one more thing that I think often gets
overlooked with these iMacs is the fact that on top
of the computer inside, there is a beautiful display attached. This is a 21.5-inch 4K display, whereas this a big, beautiful 27-inch 5K display, and yes, the specs may not be as thick or as meaty as the PC
master-race may want, but all in all they are
pretty solid machines. Ultimately what I've seen here is I think this is surprisingly the best bang for your buck
as far as the Mac goes, you're getting great performance, and the only downside I would say would be the Fusion Drive, so if you do go this route and you can't upgrade
to pure flash storage, that is gonna be the
best total experience. This one is still a great value if you need the power
plus the portability, the 15-inch MacBook Pro
is the way you wanna go, and if you need the most power, it is clearly the 27-inch iMac. Hopefully you enjoyed this video. If you did, and you're feeling like we did awesome, make sure to drop a like down below. This is Jonathan, and I'll catch you guys later. 
- Yo, guys, Jonathan here,
and welcome to Dream Desk 4, which is simple, but powerful,
packs a ton of pixels. But this one is special,
because this dream desk is mine. ("Shelter" by Porter Robinson &amp; Madeon) (phone ringing) - [Meredith] Hello? - Hi, Meredith? - [Meredith] Yes. - How's it going? - [Meredith] Good, hi
Jonathan, how are you? - I'm good, sorry if this is super random. - [Meredith] Oh, no problem. - Yeah, so, back with Dream
Desk 3, I remember you tweeted, and that kinda really stuck with me, just, I remember seeing that tweet about how your son woke you
up to go watch Dream Desk 3. Well, I'm building my desk right now, so I kinda had the idea
of surprising your son with a setup like mine. - [Meredith] Oh, man, he'd love that! Yeah, yeah, oh, this is so cool, like (laughing) how do I keep my cool when I'm so excited on his behalf? Oh, neat. Man, I wish you had any idea
how much of a fan he was. You have inspired so many desk changes, and, you know, just
inspiration for him in general to continually try and
redo what he already has. (electronic music) - So, this setup is centered around a 2016 15 inch MacBook Pro
and LG's Ultrafine 5K display. Being able to dock a MacBook
Pro into a 5K display is something I've wanted
for a really long time. Using a 5K iMac and then
going back to a 4K display always felt like a bit of a downgrade, so this gives me the best of both worlds. Now, the desk itself, funny enough, is technically a dining table, so if you walked into the
office section at IKEA, you would never see it. So when I happened to stumble
upon it in the dining section, I immediately fell in love. It has a beautiful,
glossy, reflective top, tons of room for activities, really well-built legs that are classy, but also let you do some serious wizardry with cable management. Now, the MacBook Pro itself
is the top spec i7 model with Radeon Pro 460 graphics. And controversy in dongles aside, performance for me has been fantastic. The video you're watching right
now was shot in RED 6K RAW and was edited entirely on this machine. Jumping back to the Ultrafine 5K, huge shout-out to LG for not
only sending this my way early, but also sponsoring Dream Desk 4. It is a beautiful 5K display that connects through a
single Thunderbolt 3 cable, and on top of giving
you dock functionality with three extra USB-C ports, it is also powering the
MacBook Pro, which is awesome. Small things like being able
to control the brightness within Mac OS is a nice
touch, but more than anything, it is a really impressive-looking display. If you've used or you're
coming from a 5K iMac, it is every bit as good, and
possibly a little better. It's super bright, has beautiful colors, and honestly, so far I couldn't
be happier with this combo. Now, behind the monitor, making everything look nice and pretty is the Hue Lightstrip Plus from Philips, who are also awesome enough
to sponsor Dream Desk 4. Getting to partner with Philips has been one of the coolest
experiences so far for me. If you've watched any of my
videos, you know I love lights, and there's something special about adding color to your
setup, especially your desk. It kinda just gets your brain going, and for me, helps creatively. Now, as far as the speakers, I've been searching and
looking for the perfect pair pretty much all year, but
finally, I think I found them. These are the ADAM ARTist
3s, which look amazing and pack an incredible sound
in a relatively small package. They have a ton of inputs,
but also connect through USB, which is super handy. The 4 and a half inch carbon fiber woofer pumps out some pretty impressive low-end, but what stood out to me
most was the high-end. I am not sure what kinda
magic is going on here, but these are some of
the clearest speakers I've ever heard in my life. Being able to hear every instrument, every nuance is incredible, and then things like Stereolink, where a single control on one
speaker controls both of them, is icing on the cake. Now, to the right of the desk, this is the LaCie Bolt 3, which is a two terabyte
Thunderbolt 3 external  SSD with insane speeds. Inside are two one
terabyte M.2 PCIe drives, which pump out over 2,000
megabytes per second on the write side, and
over 2,500 on the read. So, with this, you're essentially getting the same performance of
the MacBook Pro internally, but on an external drive. What's kinda cool is that it
comes with a removable stand that attaches magnetically, and
also a magnetized cable door that pops open to plug things in, and closes to keep things nice and tidy. As far as the rest of the setup, to keep things clean and to
connect through Bluetooth, I'm rocking the Apple wireless keyboard and the Logitech MX Master. I've finally given up the Performance MX, and it seems like any
problems or bugs I had with the MX Master before are gone, and so far, after this switch, I am really enjoying this mouse. Rounding out the desk,
things would not be complete without the Tomons Desk Lamp, which gives me some of that
Toy Story Pixar action. Now that my setup is complete, though, it is time to hop on a
plane, and head to St. Louis. So, made it out to St.
Louis, holy balls is it cold. My face is numb, but
that is beside the point, because it is now time to
meet Ms. Meredith, the mom. Let's go. Now, because Meredith and her son were going to see family for the holidays, the timeframe was extremely narrow, so what I did was overnight
the computer, the monitor, the speakers, the accessories,
from B&amp;H and Amazon. Luckily, they came through. The only thing missing, though, was the most important part
of the setup, the desk itself. So, after we made sure
everything else was there, we headed out to IKEA. Now, I gotta tell you guys, Meredith is an incredible single mom. The initial tweet of her being
that involved with her son spoke volumes to me, but getting a chance to hang out with her was a completely different level. She battles Vascular EDS, and, no joke, just came
off surgery this week, and instead of staying back, resting, she was right there with me at IKEA, going to Lowe's to rent a truck. And seeing how selfless she is, and how much love she has
for her son is incredible. - You know, that keeps me going. My disease is second to
the fact that I'm a mom, and I make everything fit
into the mom part first. And, you know, I obviously do what I can to take care of myself, but it's all secondary to being a mom. You get inspiration from having a kid that's unreal. Like, I didn't know what inspiration was until I had a kid to fight for. You know, it has kept me going when things were not looking great. - Now, to keep things a surprise, she was able to work
with her sister-in-law to keep her son distracted. Trying to do this in a single day may have been a little
ambitious, time was flying by. But it was now time to
build out the setup. (bright music) Now, for her son, BB, there
were four elements of my setup that I really wanted to bring to his, the first of which being the same desk, which we were able to find, a 15 inch Space Gray MacBook Pro that he could dock into a monitor, white speakers so he could get that really clean,
white, Stormtrooper look, and, most importantly, I
wanted to give him a splash of that TLD lighting, which
ended up working amazing, because after talking to Meredith, he had been wanting Philips Hue forever. So, it's the end of the day, been battling the clock, but, somehow, managed
to pull everything off. Meredith is on her way
right now to pick up BB, who has no idea what is coming next. (muffled talking from outside) (deeply exhaling) My heart's, like, pounding. (sweet music) How's it going, dude? - [BB] Hi. - [Jonathan] Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Yeah, surprise. - [BB] Is this real? - Yes, sir. You know, seeing her say that,
like, you clean your desk because of--
- Yeah, yeah. - My videos, was cool. - Yeah, I watch all of 'em. - That's so cool, dude. So, I figured I was building my desk, and let's make you a setup like mine. - I can't even say thank you enough. It just amazes me so much
that you would actually think about that tweet, and end up coming to my house, and showing up with a amazing desk. - The experience of it, I think,
was a lot of fun, you know? I knew you were gonna do
something great for him, but I didn't really think
I'd take a part in it. So, it was neat to
spend the day, you know, with you, and you know,
getting to meet you, that's just great, (laughing)
that's really cool. This was a great way to spend a day. He's happy, he's so happy, and surprised, and I don't get to do that very often, so, I mean, who gets to
hang out with, you know, with somebody that they admire that much? So, to see him actually get
to meet you in real life, I think, as awesome as the desk is, just getting to hang with you is probably what will
stick with him for life. - So, the jet black in the Apple phone... (phone rings) Is that Austin? ("Fade Away" by Logic) 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here and when Tim Cook took the stage today and said this was gonna be
the best and biggest WWDC ever I think he was telling the truth. There was so much stuff announced today that if you're gonna
buy one of each product on Apple's website with that
shiny, attractive new tag, you'd be dropping $34,547,
and let me break that down. So, we are seconds into the video and I've already made a terrible mistake. I forgot all about the brand
new Apple Magic Keyboard with number pad and that's gonna tack on
an additional 129 bucks which brings us to a grand
total of 34,676 bucks. So, I'm gonna start with the two products that a, look most interesting to me, and b, aren't available
til later this year. This is the brand new HomePod speaker and the oh my God that
looks amazing iMac Pro. Now, the HomePod is actually
that rumored Siri speaker that we've been hearing
about and not gonna lie, HomePod doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue. Honestly at this point Siri Speaker might have been a better name because HomePod is almost
like they were high Sierra as they were naming it. What can tell you about the HomePod though is it kind of looks like a Mac Pro Mini covered in fabric. I was not allowed to touch it, I was not allowed to listen to it but for your reference here is how it looks stacked up next to an iPhone 7 Plus. There was a ton of talk and
hype surrounding the HomePod mainly around it's Siri capabilities and the tech inside it. It's actually packing Apple's A8 chip which is kind of crazy for a speaker but ultimately it comes down
to how does the speaker sound because if it sounds bad, none of those cool features matter. At the very least though, I am super curious to
actually get my hands on one. So, next up is the insane iMac Pro and no, that is not a mistake. The iMac Pro is a real thing. These start at 4,999 and beyond the super
attractive space grade finish, there's actually some
serious power packed inside. For starters, out of the box this comes with an eight-core
Intel Zeon processor but you can configure it up to 18 cores, and I'm not sure I thought
I would ever say 18 cores and iMac in the same sentence. As far as graphics go, these are packing AMD's Vega GPUs and can be configured up
to 16 gigabytes of VRAM which is kind of crazy for an iMac. You can also configure these
up to 128 gigabytes of RAM which is also kind of nuts and even though this
is more of a WWDC video I did get to spend some time with the iMac Pro, so if you guys want to see
a dedicated video on that, let me know by dropping a like below. Moving down the list there were two new iPad Pros today, a completely brand new 10.5-inch iPad Pro that replaces the 9.7-inch model and a much needed update
to the 12.9-inch model. These come in at 649 and 799. Now, there's some pretty serious power packed inside these iPad Pros. Both of them come equipped
with Apple's A10X chip. That's a 6-core CPU 12-core GPU and then you pair that
with all the iOS 11 updates specific to the iPad Pro and those look pretty attractive. Now from there there are updates to pretty much every single
MacBook across the board starting with the 12-inch MacBook. There's a 1.2 gigahertz,
256 gigabyte model for 1,299 and then a 1.3 gigahertz,
512 gigabyte model for 1,599. Now, as far as the MacBook Pro starting with the 13-inch model, there are four brand new
stock configurations. There is a 2.3 gigahertz,
128 gigabyte model but no touch bar for 1,299, and then you can double the
storage on that for 1,499. Jumping over to the touch
bar 13-inch MacBook Pro is you can pick up a 3.1 gigahertz, 256 gigabyte model for 1,799 or you can double that storage for 1,999. Now, moving on to its bigger brother, the 15-inch MacBook Pro, there are two stock configurations there, a 2.8 gigahertz, 256
gigabyte model for 2,399 or a 2.9 gigahertz, 512
gigabyte model for 2,799. So, clearly there is so
much to talk about there that I had to get up out of there and move to a different location but touching upon those
MacBook Pros for a second, they're pretty much solely
just a Kaby Lake spec bump and nothing more. If you were holding out for a
32 gigabyte RAM option upgrade that did not happen but I guess the good news is if you just bought a MacBook Pro or you own a 2016 model there really isn't a
huge reason to upgrade. So, moving on from the MacBook Pro's both the 21.5 inch and 27 inch, iMac's go updates across the board. The 21.5 inch
iMac starts out at 1,099 and it's gonna get you a
2.3 gigahertz processor, a one terabyte hard drive, integrated graphics and a 1080P display. Now, if you want to jump
up to a Retina 4K iMac those start at 1,299. That's gonna get you a
3.0 gigahertz processor, a one terabyte hard drive but this time you get a bump up to Radeon Pro 555 dedicated graphics. Now, for 1,499 this is gonna be your best bang for your buck as far as the 21 and
a half inch iMac goes. That's gonna get you a
3.4 gigahertz processor, a one terabyte fusion drive, something the prior two iMacs don't have and you can jump all the way
up to Radeon Pro 560 graphics. Jumping over to the 27-inch 5K iMac, those start at 1,799. That's gonna get you a
3.4 gigahertz processor, a one terabyte fusion drive and Radeon Pro 570 graphics. Now, for 200 bucks more you're gonna get a slightly faster CPU but more importantly you're gonna bump up to Radeon Pro 575 graphics, and lastly, for 2,299 that's gonna get you a 3.8 gigahertz processor,
a two terabyte fusion drive but the kicker here is you're getting Radeon Pro 580 graphics with a crazy eight gigabytes of VRAM. Now, if you do want to max this iMac out it's gonna run you 5,299 which puts you directly
in iMac Pro pricing. Maybe that kind of puts
things in perspective as far as that goes. Now, if we stop there and we were just talking about hardware, that would put us at a
grand total of 31,482 bucks but we're not done. Apple dropped a crap
load of new accessories. This is gonna be a mouthful but there are eight
brand new Apple watches at 49 bucks a pop, five brand new iPhone Seven cases, three of the silicone being 35 and two with the leather being 45. Double that for the
iPhone Seven Plus cases but add four dollars onto
each of those prices, and then from there there are
a ton of iPad Pro accessories starting with the Apple pencil case. Those are 29 bucks a pop, at four different color options. That brings us to a
grand total of 116 bucks. Four leather sleeve options
for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is 516 bucks, seven 10.5-inch iPad Pro
smart covers is 343 bucks, four leather smart covers
for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro equals 270 bucks, the brand new 10.5-inch
iPad Pro smart keyboard is 159 bucks. We then of course have the brand new 12.9-inch iPad Pro as well. There are three leather
sleeve options for that totaling 447 bucks, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro
smart keyboard is 169 bucks, the three leather smart cover options for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro are 237 bucks, and lastly, that brand
new Apple Magic Keyboard with number pad is another 129 bucks which brings us to a grand
total of 34,676 bucks. Also, if you were curious
about iOS 11 coverage make sure you check out Miss Krystal Key, she's got you covered there. Just dropped a brand
new Dream Desk as well which I am super proud of. Thank you guys for watching and I will catch you guys later. 
- (Jonathan) Yo guys, Jonathan here, it is early morning
here on the west coast, but I think it's only fitting because today is what I
would call a good day. Not only am I checking out
the brand new iPhone 8, but the 8 Plus as well,
gonna see what's new and ultimately how they
stack up side-by-side. (upbeat music) And before I hop in,
what would an unboxing be without a giveaway, so if
you're excited for that, let me know by droppin' a like down below, queue shout out to 23andMe,
where you can discover more about yourself through
DNA for sponsoring this unboxing and giveaway. Because of that, you have
a chance to win either an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus,
the choice is yours. Definitely make sure you're subscribed. For the complete details on how to win, check out the link below. Now I'm sure most of
you out there have seen an iPhone unboxing or
two, but if you haven't, and this is your first
time, I'm gonna throw a virtual high five your way, and we're gonna experience this together. Inside the box you have
the USB wall charger and Lightning cable, a wired
pair of Lightning ear pods, not air pods, I am super
used to sayin' that by now. And just in case Lightning
ear pods aren't your thing, on the flip side, you do
get a Lightning 3.5 mm audio adapter so you can
use any pair of headphones. So now that we've got the
accessories out of the way, we are here for what we all came for, the iPhone 8 and the 8 Plus. This here is the gold iPhone 8 Plus, along with the silver iPhone 8, and I gotta say, between all
the colors across the board, including the iPhone 10, I think the gold is my favorite by far. Somethin' about it that
just screams classy, and I think the word that comes to mind with the gold iPhone is creamy, and because of that,
I can't help but think these would look perfect next to a pair of cream Yeezys. Now there's no denying design wise, this is very similar
to the iPhone 6, the 6s and the 7, but once you
stack them side-by-side, you can start to see the
evolution of how things change, plus there's just something
about that glass back that changes out the look and feel that has me excited again,
and honestly excluding the iPhone 10, I think this
is maybe the best looking iPhone since the iPhone 4 and 4s. Beyond that, the glass
back isn't just for looks, it also brings for the first time ever, wireless charging to the iPhone. For you there, this is
not me trying to say Apple revolutionized or invented
wireless charging, in fact, Apple opted to go
with the wireless Qi standard, and not some crazy,
proprietary Apple nonsense, and that is absolutely a
good thing for everybody. One, it is going to increase the number of wireless charging products
out there, and two, definitely make it more
widespread across the platform as a whole. Now stackin' up the 8
and 8 Plus side-by-side, regardless of the size difference, you are getting the exact
same A11 bionic processor inside both these phones. In fact, that is the exact same chip found in the iPhone 10. So just in case the iPhone 8
or 8 Plus is more your thing, maybe you're not ready to
give up that home button, it's nice to know you're
not sacrificing performance across any of these. Now if those are simply
just numbers to you, and it doesn't mean
anything, to put things into perspective, that is on
par with a 13" MacBook Pro, which is nuts to think about. Because of that, I am definitely gonna see how it stacks up side-by-side against that MacBook Pro, a Galaxy
S8, and if there's anything you wanna see it compared to side-by-side, let me know with a comment down below. Now as far as the displays go, while size or the
resolution hasn't changed on these phones, what's
new is True Tone Display. It's a little hard to
show off through video, I think I have an idea of how to do it, it's just gonna take a little bit longer, so stay tuned for my full review. But essentially it is this realtime adaptive white balance for your display, so no matter what the
lighting conditions are, you're gonna have a better representation of what those colors are. So again, while the
screen size or resolution hasn't changed, the iPhone
8 features a 4.7" display with a resolution of 1334 x 750, whereas the iPhone 8
Plus is a 5.5" display with a 1920 x 1080p display. Now as far as what that
extra screen real estate equates to, take a look at 23andMe.com. You can see on the iPhone 8 Plus, we see two entire sections,
whereas on the iPhone 8, we would clearly have to scroll up. From there, jumpin' into
their Neanderthal ancestry section, and yes, if you've
ever wondered to yourself how much Neanderthal DNA is part of me, that is somethin' they offer. But regardless, on the iPhone 8 Plus, you can see every single paragraph, where on the iPhone 8, you would clearly have to scroll down. Also, for reference, we know
Austin Evans is jacked as hell and seein' those biceps
on a bigger 5.5" display is a beautiful thing. Now from there, one big difference between the iPhone 8
Plus and 8 has got to be battery life. With the iPhone 8, you
can pretty much expect that you're gonna have to plug in at least once throughout the day,
whereas with the iPhone 8 Plus, that's gonna get you for
sure a couple more hours, more than likely last you
throughout the entire day. From there, both the
iPhone 8 and 8 Plus feature improved cameras, clearly
the biggest difference is going to be the dual
camera setup on the iPhone 8 Plus, so I'm
gonna start with something they both share, and it's video. Both of these phones
will shoot video up to 4k resolution at 60 frames per second, which is actually kind of crazy, not many phones or even
cameras out there do that right now. This video was shot in
24 frames per second, so I can't show off the 60 fps here, but if you wanna see a full
4k 60 fps demo on the iPhone, let me know and I will
get that out for you guys. Speaking of 24 frames per second though, there is now an option to shoot 24 fps on the iPhones, you're not gonna have to download an additional app, you can do it straight from iOS. The other really impressive
thing on both these phones is 240 fps slow motion video at 1080p. Here is a quick test of Rich
doin' some majestic jumps, and the more impressive thing for me here is actually lighting
here wasn't that optimal. It was getting closer to
dark, so there wasn't a ton of light, but it still
performed really well. I'm definitely gonna be
doing some more tests both on the 4k 60 side, and
the 240 fps slow motion, but regardless, initial
impressions on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, this is one of
the most underrated features. From there, jumpin' into picture quality, this was shot on the iPhone 8 Plus, but it's using the main wide angle lens, so it's something you can
expect the exact same results on the iPhone 8 as well. Same thing here as well,
and I love this picture here because of the dynamic range. Everything is sharp, we
don't lose the dark areas, you can see how the color
of those bike racks pop, and lastly, the sky. We can see the blue,
we can see the clouds, and nothing is blown out. Now from there, jumpin'
into more of a lower light situation, this was
one of my favorite shots. Everything holds together really nicely, even though it was getting dark. I particularly like the roll off here, straight from the camera and no artificial depth added at all. From there, this is pretty
much right after sunset, so it's getting pretty dark here, and yeah, you can definitely
see a little bit of noise towards the street on the
bottom side of the picture, but it's nice to retain both the shadows, the sky, you can really see that orange, and overall I really like this picture. Now as far as what
advantage that dual camera on the iPhone 8 Plus get you over the 8, here is a shot on the wide
angle lens on the iPhone 8 Plus, and then here is another
shot using the telephoto lens at the exact same distance apart. We then of course have portrait mode, which is by far one of the
best and most enticing features of the 7 Plus, and it is no different here with the 8 Plus. What's also cool with the
iPhone 8 Plus beyond portrait mode is what Apple is
calling portrait lighting, which is really kind of crazy. What it is essentially,
is it allows you to manipulate different lighting environments through both hardware and software. I've talked about this before, but what's awesome is you
can do this both while you're taking the photo,
or even adjust it after if you didn't take it in the first place. So I think as good as
portrait mode was on the iPhone 7 Plus, with the improved optics, and of course portrait lighting,
not only is it more fun, not only do you have more flexibility, it's just a better experience overall. From there, jumping over to
a front facing selfie test, this was shot on the iPhone 8 Plus, but again, because the front
facing cameras are the same, you can expect the exact same
shot on the iPhone 8 as well. Here we have one more
selfie for good measure, and it's kind of perfect with 23andMe.com sponsoring this video,
because I've often got asked what ethnicity I am. I know for sure I'm part
Hispanic, part white, with a little bit of
Irish, but beyond that, I have no idea. So with that I sent off the 23andMe kit, which should give me a full
breakdown of everything I am. It's a little scary,
but also really exciting to think about, so if that's something you wanna check out, or something
you've been curious about, make sure you check out the
link below for full details and also stay tuned for a
future video where I find out exactly what I am. So nothing new here, but
of course the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are still
IP67 and water resistant, and I think that means
we gotta test that out. So into the water we go. (water gurgles on mic) (water gurgles on mic) Looks good, it's clean,
it's still recording, and I'm also curious to see,
this is also a pretty good low light test, it's about 7:15, the light is gettin'
sucked away pretty quick, so let me know what you
think of the quality with a comment down below. Next from there, kind of
utilizing both the cameras and the processing power
of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, this was really kind of
my first time to truly play with AR. I got a chance to mess
around with Sky Guide, which is kind of amazing. It utilizes a compass with the cameras and augmented reality to
give you this realtime look into the sky. It is kind of crazy. I think by far the most
impressive thing for me wasn't how fast, or how
instant everything was, it was the fact that it could react and adapt to your environment in realtime. So if you notice, if you
look behind the tree, the text is actually sitting behind there, which is bonkers. So all in all, while I
think the iPhone 10 is definitely the phone most
people are waitin' for, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus
still have a lot of really attractive features. You saw the power of the performance, the cameras, you have water resistance, wireless charging, and
maybe you're not ready to give up that home
button, that is something that is still here and readily available on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Definitely gonna spend
some more time with it, so if you have any questions, or other features you want
covered more extensively, let me know with a comment down below. Aside from that, thank you guys very much for watching, this is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later. 
Yo Guys johnathan here, I'm excited. Hopefully you are too, and that is because it is iPhone 10 unboxing time This is it let's go so here we have the box iPhone X previewed on the outside We got that pretty pretty pretty wallpaper that notch, which maybe for better or for worse But we shall see towards the bottom with the flash out icon the camera icon and from what I understand you can access those by 3d touching and actually what might be the coolest part about this box I'm not sure if you can pick it up, but this outer part Which would be the stainless steel portion of the iPhone X on the box actually has this a little bit of like Reflective shine and it's kind of Awesome now shiny reflective box aside let's pop this open Throw that in there we got the designed by Apple in California That of course includes, I am sure The hello Quick Start Guide Little overview of the iPhone X and of course who could forget the Apple stickers as much as we love Apple stickers though That is not Why we are here we are here for the iPhone X let's pop that out This is in the 256 gigabyte silver which is a very very beautiful color I think I actually prefer this over the Space Gray. It just looks really really nice. I'm gonna Second part through and that is a really really Wow That is shiny like if you got the box with shiny This is super shiny so taking a closer look at the iPhone 10 We have an all glass back, which looks very very classic It is very shiny like I mentioned across the sides we have that stainless steel, which is very reminiscent of the iPod Classic So I'm getting some throwback vibes here. We of course have the dual cameras What's interesting with this though is actually the telephoto lens is now stabilized unlike the iPhone 8 plus? So that is new here on the iPhone 10 so this button right here Which is formerly known as the power button is now dubbed the side? But it's elongated there are three main functions one We're gonna hold it That's gonna activate Siri, and yes, just like the Galaxy s8 has a big Z button the iPhone 10 now has a Serie B So let's get the laughs out to we're gonna press it once It's gonna wake the phone in three Double tap that will activate Apple pay so flipping it this way we have the mute switch the volume up volume down towards the bottom Nothing new here We have the Lightning port it actually looks really nice in that stainless steel and of course No headphone jack now before I go and set up the iPhone 10 I'm gonna give you a quick rundown of the accessories. This isn't really new here. We have the USB wall brick We have the Lightning earpods and on the flip side of that is the Lightning the 3.5 millimeter audio adapter that is in the box So unlike most Apple things you're not paying extra for this and last But not least we have the lightning cable now for the aforementioned excited people out there What would an iPhone 10 unboxing be without an iPhone 10? Giveaways so to enter it is very simple just make sure you subscribe if you haven't yet do that turn on notifications And it's not required But if you're feeling awesome make sure to drop a like down below From there one of the things I am most Interested about a setting up face ID because that is something brand new to the iPhone And it should be interesting First position your face and the camera frame then move your head in the circle to show all angles of your face get started There we go Got to my face and now I got to move my head in a circle Like I'm getting a neck stretch Stretch it out first ID scan complete move your head slowly to complete the circle. I guess we'll go The other way and Got it So from the unlock state there are three ways to unlock the iPhone ten one we can press that side button you can see up Here that little lock icon opens up too. We can tap again look for that icon or three We have the classic raise to wake and again that icon opens up now from what I understand the quickest way to unlock the iPhone 10 would be to from the sleep states tap and then swipe up and Instantly we are in that works really well so another were inside the iPhone 10 the biggest thing of course here is the lack of? Home button so to mimic that if we actually go over to Safari Press that there's a little reminder here We're gonna swipe up and it's gonna bring us back home This is the same exact thing if you're on a different row of app swipe over Swipe up if we swipe from the top right hand side that is actually gonna Give us control center from there swipe down in the left hand corner And that is gonna give us notifications now to access multiple applications There's actually a couple of different ways to do this one We can actually swipe up and kind of give a little pause that's gonna give us all of our apps here Which we can swipe through or if we're inside an app so say we open up iTunes We can actually swipe across the bottom and that's gonna give us a run down through different apps We can swipe right swipe left, so it's kind of cool. They have a couple ways to do things now from there I gotta say the screen actually is pretty solidly bright. There's a lot of questions and concerns There was the screen gonna be bright enough We're outdoors right now, and it actually looks really good and I have any problems seeing the screen it is a beautiful looking display as far as the Resolution on the screen goes get ready for a number You are probably not gonna remember 24 36 by 11 25 classic Apple resolution nonetheless It is a great looking display from there to address a couple questions You might have with the lack of home button on the iPhone 10. How do you access Siri? You can do that a couple ways one by holding the side button Or you can just simply say hey, Siri Tell me a joke That suck from there if you're curious how do you actually take a screenshot on your iPhone you can do that by pressing the side button and the volume up together Screenshot and last, but not least how do you power off your iPhone 10? You can do that with a side button and either the volume buttons just hold those together and you Are good to go so now it is time for probably most of you out there I've been waiting for I am excited to check it out. It is an emoji time. I am stoked to send rich a Tract monkey with my face right now it's Everywhere, I move my head. It does a crazy job tracking your face your eyebrows your eyes does it do your nose Whoa those lips you're rich. I'll break your legs. I'll give you a kiss ma a Crazy man, holy crap from there. I'm gonna go get that full screen preview We got the robots the yellow cats from what I understand it does not track tongues, so if you're into that sorry got bad news The dog shows a tongue though in that preview though where's that tongue? Alien that does some we look at his heads popping out Ritchie scream man give me your best alien voice and then like scream put your face in there Ralphie I'm an alien what? Perfect So hours many many hours I could see potentially spent here I don't know if I would call it being wasted, but it is fun in the lesson I get as some people might hate on it, but I can add an eye that it is pretty cool just to be able to see your face being tracked on to aliens dogs a big pile of Emoji Crap we got that panda shoutout to the pixel to excel and a bunny with those teeth Hey that eyebrow from there you can actually save these into your camera roll Or if you don't want to send a video you can actually just simply send a sticker so surprise panda hold drag it over and We got a shout-out to Justine so from there I got a chance to check out the camera on the iPhone 10 dual cameras aren't new But what is new is one obviously the portrait orientation and also the actual telephoto lens on here is stabilizing Like the iPhone 8 plus, so that should give you some better performance so this shot here is mr. Brandon locking down the Camera this is with the wide angle lens hopping over to the telephoto lens you can see we don't really lose much in terms of Light so it's pretty solid jumping from one to the other got that beautiful rich smile here with that portrait mode But I was also really interested to check out portrait mode on a selfie camera because we've all seen how good the pixels 2 is So I was curious to see could this even stack up with that and initial impressions are so far. I like it There's a little bit better of a job in terms of natural skin tones at a more softer image sometimes that pixel too is Almost over sharp, but for whatever reason the iPhone 10 seemed to hate my ears I'm not sure if I have big ears or whatever it was if I do, it's okay I can handle it insert Dumbo joke here but for whatever reason It just ended up being a little soft around my ears most of the time same thing with the hair from there though first day with the camera got some really incredible results this year, which seems to be a Super fancy fire hydrant if I zoom in Do not remove by the order of the State Fire, Marshall. I will not mess with that these shots here of this pretty Pinkish purple flower. This is what the wide-angle lens, but as we hop over to the telephoto lens I really like this one right here because there is no portrait effect that is just natural out of the camera it looks Amazing so this here It's not a crazy image or anything right here But I just love the dynamic range the sky the clouds the shadows everything is just super Visually satisfying as things started a little darker really great low-light performance This right here was actually just about sunset you can see with no portrait mode It is a beautiful beautiful shot here again hopping over to a close-up of a leaf This is the telephoto lens and again It's super sharp super detailed and overall it was a really good experience with that camera now was also just as impressive was video Like this shot in particular right here. Holy crap same thing dynamic range. We got the sky Stabilization is on points So I am really excited to stack this up against the pixel 2 that something you guys want to see let me know over the comment down Below this was probably the biggest testament to the camera. It was right about sunset You can see one how well that stabilization works into how well everything is being held together like that Sun that glow That grass the buildings the trees This is a really really impressive video right here So now we're hopping over to the front-facing camera test as far as video quality goes with the iPhone 10 really impressed with the rear camera 4k 24 frames per second because 24 is better than 30, I'm sorry let me know what you guys think of the quality of the front-facing camera We'd love to hear what you're seeing with a comment down below I'm know if you guys want to see more pictures and photos taken from the iPhone 10 make sure you're following me on Instagram I Will be posting a ton of stuff over there over the next week aside from that that has been my first day with the iPhone 10 Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if you have any questions at all make sure you guys drop a comment down below I'll be doing a follow-up video to this so let me know what you want to see with the iPhone 10 This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later 
(pretty digital music) - Yo guys, Jonathan here. This is the Google Pixel
Two and the Pixel Two XL, the almost perfect smartphones. Now when these were announced,
everybody was excited. The XL marked scores through the roof. Finally a bezel-less display,
at least in the Pixel Two XL but then, devices
started rolling out. People started started getting
'em in hand and it almost turned into this horror story for Google. (dramatic music) Now aside from the beat
down Google's taken over the past couple of weeks,
there's actually a lot to like about the Pixel Two
and its bigger brother. So what's kind of weird
is both the Pixel Two and Pixel Two Xl come in
different color variants. With the regular version
we have just black, clearly white and kinda blue. Like the XL Two screen. (extreme alarm) Is that right? On a serious note though,
I actually really like the kinda blue. It is a super soft,
almost bluish-mint color. I even prefer it over
last year's really blue. Jumpin' over to the Pixel Two
XL, this actually comes in two colors: just black and
black and white, aka panda. Now if you ordered a regular
Pixel and you need some of that panda action in your life,
the easiest fix for that, is to hit up the robots and
throw a dbrand skin on it. This is not a panda, but it
sure as hell looks like one. They even got you Dodger
fans covered, too. Links are below. So when you stack the Pixel
Two and the Pixel Two XL side-by-side, the very
apparent bezels on the regular Pixel Two really stand out. The Pixel Two XL looks like
it's a phone from 2017, whereas the regular Pixel Two
kinda feels a little dated. Regardless, though, the layout
on either of these phones is awesome. I really enjoy the location
of the fingerprint reader on the back. It works flawlessly. The volume up and down buttons
are right smack next to your thumb; super easy to access. Same thing with the power button. It just feels good. Now the bottom of the Pixel
Two there is a usb-c port which is always awesome. There is no wireless charging
with this which for me is not a deal-breaker. Some people either really,
really love wireless charging or some people don't care at all. I would love to hear what
side of the fence you're on. Regardless, though, wireless
charging not a positive with the Pixel Two as you're
getting up to seven hours of battery life with 15 minutes of charging. There's absolutely no room
to complain about that. From there you might notice
that usb-c port's kind of just hanging out there by himself. There is no headphone jack,
and the only weird part about that is Google made
a really big deal about the headphone jack last year
when the Pixel debuted and this year they were kinda like, (intense music). On a serious note though,
I don't think not having a headphone jack is a deal-breaker. Especially for me. Anytime I can go wireless,
I am going to go that route. Yes, there's the whole debate
about audio quality and having a wired cable but for
me, there are tons of fantastic sounding wireless bluetooth
headphones out there, so I'm gonna go that way. So while Google did cut
off the headphone jack, one giant feature they added this
year is water-resistance, and that might be reason alone
to upgrade over last year's Pixel. Maybe if someone who always
has their phones near the water or if you're in the
shower or a bath, super staff. Now when you pick up your
shiny new Pixel Two or Pixel Two XL, in the box you
get an 18 watt usb-c charger, the usb-c cable, and a usb-c
3.5 millimeter audio adapter. So just in case you're holding
on to those wired headphones, you can use it out of the box. What's kind of weird though
is there are no headphones in sight within this box. It would have been really
nice to have a pair of usb-c headphones with the Pixel Two. On the other hand you have
companies like Samsung going above and beyond and including
a nicer pair of headphones. So if that matters to you,
that is some food for thought. From there it's time to hope
over to probably the most controversial subject with
the Pixel Two, and that is the display. Specifically that it's geared
more towards the Pixel Two XL display as opposed to
the regular Pixel Two. That features a five inch,
1920 by 1080 amoled display, whereas the Pixel Two XL
features a six inch, 2880 by 1440 p oled display, which seems
to be causing all kinds of problems. Like there's no denying there
is a very apparent problem with the Pixel Two XL screen. There is major blue shift
(mumbles) access this like, any sort of way. The part where it gets a little
tricky though is, I think if you just handed this phone
to the average person out there, they are not gonna pick up on this. It is the super tech audience
that is going deep, diving deep and really getting
crazy technical with this, like throwing it down to
10, 15% brightness with a gray screen, like that is kinda crazy. Is that reason enough, just
for the screen, to not buy the Pixel Two XL? I'm gonna say no, because
there are many, many enticing features with the Pixel
Two XL, it's just very disappointing, because if
there was ever a company that you would root for to put
Apple and kinda kick their ass, it is Google. They're giant. This is a flagship phone with
flagship pricing, and you would expect better from them. So with that, it's kind of
confusing and has me a little torn. On one hand, you have the
regular Pixel Two which has a totally fine display but
really, really big bezels, and then you have the Pixel
Two XL which is kind of like that person that you see from a distance. It's good from far, but you
get it up close and it is far from good. - Blech! - On top of that, I do get
that Google was going for that non-saturated look that we've
kind of grown accustomed to with smartphones over the years,
but the fact of the matter is, certain colors just look
really off, especially with red. Again, it's not a bad display,
and I don't think it's just solely be a reason to
turn you off from the Pixel Two or Pixel Two XL, but when you
compare it to something like a Samsung Galaxy S Eight
or Note Eight, there is no comparison. Now packed inside the Pixel
Two is a Snapdragon 835, four gigabytes of ram. There is no micro sd card
expansion, but there is a really solid amount of storage with these. The base Pixel Two comes in
at 64 gigs or you can bump it all the way up 128 gigabytes. On top of that you also do
have unlimited storage with Google Photos so yeah,
that is definitely a thing. For me though, now that we
got the ugly, controversial part out the way, there is a
lot to love about the Pixel Two and Pixel Two XL. For starters, out of the box
you are getting sweet, sweet, pure, unadulterated Android 8.0 Oreo. It's super clean, super smooth,
and unlike other Android phones, Google is promising
three years of support and updates. I really, really love the
wallpapers, especially the live versions. Those are just kind of fun
to look at and zone out at. And what is really, really
freaking cool with these, is that it's smart enough to know
what your wallpaper is. So if you have a dark one,
gonna automatically switch the theme of your phone to dark
and if you have a light wallpaper, it will automatically
switch it to light. Now I wouldn't mind if we
claimed it as geared specifically towards the Pixel Two XL is
because it has that extra tall 18 by nine screen. I wish they would implement
some sort of feature like Samsung does where we can
punch in or crop it on YouTube videos. It's not the end of the world,
but just something I would like to see in the future. From here I wanna talk about
Google Assist, and also roll in the squeeze feature because
that is one way to access the Google Assistant. Is this a revolutionary,
mind-blowing feature? No, but I don't hate it and
it actually works pretty well. Schedule a timer for 12 minutes. - [Google Assistant] Okay
12 minutes, starting now. - What was the score of the Bulls game? - [Google Assistant] The
Bulls' last game was against the Cavaliers. They lost 119 to 112. - Man, it sucks to be
a Bulls fan this year. Punching people in the face. What is the traffic like
to Los Angeles right now? - [Google Assistant] There's
moderate traffic from your location to Los Angeles, so
it'll take about 42 minutes. - See, that is super fast. So that part of this phone is
awesome, and it works really well, just as advertised. From there, I'm gonna kinda
kill two birds with one stone. Play Porter Robinson. (Porter Robinson plays) So yeah, there's a ton of volume. That is definitely not
anything lacking there. I think overall, I would say
if there was anything missing, it would be the low end. There's not a crazy amount
there, but regardless, I would definitely take stereo speakers
over non-stereo speakers any day of the week. From there, always-on display
is an awesome feature to have. Something that I wish worked
just a little bit better was the song recognition. It's not that it's bad, and
it's kind of confusing because by default, it is turned
off, so if you picked up a Pixel Two and it's not working,
more than likely you have to go into settings to enable it. But from there the database
and the library isn't exactly the biggest, so it's not always
gonna recognize every song. And from what I understand,
it actually checks every 60 seconds to save battery life,
so it's not always gonna feel the fastest or the quickest. Next, we're gonna talk
about, hands-down, the most impressive thing about the
Pixel Two and that is the camera, seriously. Forget the 94 on that DXL mark
score, it should just read next to Google Pixel
Two, really (beep) good. Seriously, what Google has done
with this camera is nothing short of incredible. Some of the best images I've
ever captured are from the Pixel Two. It's a 12.2 megapixel sensor
with an f-stop of 1.8 and the color, the sharpness
and detail, everything about this camera is awesome. The one thing I really like
with the Pixel Two is that portrait mode is gonna work
on both the Pixel Two and Pixel Two XL. You're not gonna have to choose
between one of the phones because it actually works
on one single lens which is kind of crazy. One small thing that may turn
off some people, is there's no way to preview the portrait
mode before-hand, so you kind of just gotta take the
photo and hope for the best, but most of the time it
works out really well. One other thing is you're not
gonna get as much flexibility as something like the iPhone Eight Plus, the Galaxy Note Eight, or the upcoming iPhone 10
where you can kind of tweak and manipulate things and post
but regardless, it is still really impressive. But almost scary to see
what Google is doing with a single lens and I'm stoked to
see where they take this in the future. Next, I'm gonna talk about
portrait selfie mode. It works incredible, and
it is super impressive, but I had a hard time getting
it working and for you out there that's freaking
out right now saying, you're just an Apple fan-boy,
you don't know how to, Android is too complex
and superior for you. No man. There are threads in
forums deeper than your-- Like I was seriously asking
for help on Twitter and I got people yellin' at me
asking if I could rename photos. (air horn) The simplest way is to find
the update link, click on it and hope that it opens in
the Play Store because it is not publicly available. If that doesn't work, you
gotta go into settings, clear cache and data on the play
store, potentially the camera app as well, reset things, go
back into the play store and hope that an update shows up. Now for most people out there,
that will fix the problem, but there are certain cases,
like I experienced, where it actually affects certain
Google accounts so for me, for whatever reason, that
update did not wanna show up. The absolutely weirdest bug
fix and workaround that I've ever heard of, happened
with the Pixel Two. If you have a friend where
their Google account shows the camera update, have
them log into your phone, update the camera, have them
log out and then magically your phone is now fixed. It's crazy. At the end of the day, though,
I finally go it workin'. Even if I had to side-load a
freaking APK, it was worth it because the Pixel Two selfie
portrait mode is amazing. Now on the flip side of
that, some people are over-critical of the Pixel
Two selfie portrait mode, like looking for any possible mistake. Yes, it's not gonna be perfect every time. Yes, it's not always gonna get hair right. Yes, it sometimes may
mistake a piece of the background for the foreground but overall, it is crazy what Google
is doing with that. So yeah, between the
front-facing camera, the rear camera, portrait mode on both
sides, the Google Pixel Two as a camera overall is
two giant thumbs up. So we're hoppin' over to the
4k 30fps test here on the Pixel Two. Ralphie, Rich and that hard part. Lemme get a close on that. Some quick auto-focus. Also I'd love to hear what
you guys think of the video quality and the stabilization. Drop me a comment down below. Lastly, shout out to
Mr. Brand on the camera. He makes some pretty awesome videos. Check him out, too, the link below. Lastly, battery life on the
Pixel Two and Pixel Two XL overall are really solid. Obviously, you're going to
get more of a workhorse with the Pixel Two XL because you're
getting a larger battery. At the end of the day, that's
kind of what it came down to between these two phones. Battery life and the screen. So clearly if we need that
better battery performance, the Pixel Two XL is the way to
go and normally, a little bit of no-brainer, you
want that bigger, better display, go for the Pixel
Two XL as well, but with that weird p oled display and
that blue color shift, it kind of makes things
a little confusing. One one hand you've downsized
to the regular Pixel so you don't have to worry about
those weird display issues, or you suck it up for that better
battery life and go with the Pixel Two XL. So with this video, hopefully
there was enough cover with the features and the software
to kind of get you to that almost ready to buy point,
and then from there, the best advice I could possibly give
you is head into a store, if you can, and look at
these displays in person. I could show you a million
times over a YouTube video how that blue shift looks like
but it's never really gonna simulate real life. And then from there you can
ask yourself, is this enough to make me not wanna buy the Pixel Two XL. Are the bezels big enough
to where they're gonna annoy me and I'm gonna wanna go somewhere else? And that will ultimately
help you make your decision. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed the video. If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to smash that like button. If you are not feeling the
Google Pixel Two, maybe check out the Galaxy Note
Eight, which you can watch here. Again, huge shout out to dbrand
for sponsoring this video. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. - Damn! - Evans. Wait, I didn't see that do it again. - [Male Friend] (mumbles)
Get the top part, Get the bottom arms. (laughing) - Damn you're a veiny sucker. (explosion) 
- [Jonathan] From a crazy
triple monitor gaming laptop. To a dancing Dr. Fuji. To an insane 8K display
that packs as many pixels as four 4K monitors. This is some of the best tech at CES 2017. Yo guys, Jonathan here. Just got back from CES, which
is giant, crazy, massive tech show. And what I want to do is
break it down into five of the coolest pieces of tech
and gadgets that I saw. And huge shout out to Samsung
for sending me out there and sponsoring my 2017 CES coverage. Now speaking of Samsung, they were killing the home tech game and
first up is their brand new family hub 2.0 refrigerator line up. So, if you're thinking to
yourself, how much tech could actually be inside of a
refrigerator, this is packing a massive 21 and a half
inch touch LED display. No joke, this display
is massive, but it works because it essentially becomes
your central control panel. What's also rad is now
integrated voice control. Which to be honest I really
didn't get a chance to check out because of how loud it was on the floor. But the idea is you can use
your voice to look up stock in your fridge, to order groceries,
or even look up a recipe. Now speaking of recipes,
what I found really cool, was the fact that not only
will it display the recipe on the giant display, it will
also read it back to you aloud. Hands down the coolest
feature with this though, are the ninja cameras inside. Now, I feel like most of out there, at one point in our lives,
have been yelled at for leaving that refrigerator door open. And not only, does this elevate that, but what it also does, is
allow you to check on the inside of your refrigerator
remotely at any given time. So in this case, if
you're out at the store, and you're not sure if
you bought eggs or milk, you can now check on your
phone to see what's inside your fridge, which is awesome. Now runner's up for Samsung
were their Flex Wash and Flex Dry washers and dryers. And these were especially
cool because you have your main compartments up front and
a second compartment up top, where you can actually
do two separate loads, either separate or simultaneously. So the idea with this is you
have your normal large wash that you can do in the main
compartment and then up top, you can use that for smaller
things, like delicates. Now in the instance where you
don't need to run a large wash you can simply run the top. And what that's gonna do is
save both energy and water. Now from there jumping from
home tech to crazy tech, initially I thought the
Acer $9,000 gaming laptop was the craziest thing
I was gonna see at CES. But that was overtaken by
Razer's Project Valerie, which is monstrous triple
monitor gaming laptop. Now, unfortunately as of today,
someone straight home aloned those laptops off the
CES floor which is crazy, because one, if you sell
it you're gonna get busted. And two, if you make a video,
you're gonna get busted. So, really, the only
thing I could think of, is someone looking for
intel or secret information. But either way whoever took
those laptops should probably give them back. Now as far as the tech
inside Project Valerie, this is crazy. It is a single laptop that packs triple 4K, 17.3 inch displays. For those of you who love
to crunch numbers out there, that is a massive total
resolution of 11,520 x 2160. Which is bonkers! Now powering this laptop is a
full fledged Nvidia GTX 1080, which seemed to do the job really well. I unfortunately, personally,
did not get a hands on with it. Rather, simply, I got to
admire it from a distance in a plexi-glass container. So because of that, I really
didn't get a chance to see the displays open up like a Tesla Model X or really test gameplay. But from what I can see,
it looks really impressive. Now initially on my latest video, I talked about a PC dream desk
with that crazy Acer Predator laptop but after seeing this,
I think I've changed my mind and if you agree, let me know
by dropping a like down below. Now next jumping from
triple monitor craziness to a single display, if you
love pixels, take a deep breath. Because Dell unveiled their
insane 32 inch 8K display. Now by itself, 8K sounds crazy but when you put it into perspective, it makes it all the more insane. Because that is equivalent
to four 4K monitors. The total resolution is 7680
x 4320 and if the visual of four 4K monitors wasn't enough, that is equivalent to 16 1080p displays. The only thing more
massive than the resolution on this monitor, is the price tag. Which is coming in at nearly 5000 bucks. Obviously this isn't really geared for your average consumer. The price tag is insane,
you need two cables to drive this at 60 hertz and honestly
I don't think the technology is quite there to use this
on a day to day basis yet. But practicality aside, oh
my god, seeing an 8K display up close is insane. The amount of detail you
could see on this would blow your mind. Where you could really see
that difference is where you would zoom in looking at a
picture, and you're thinking to yourself, yeah that
looks good, it's sharp. But then holy crap, they
zoomed out, and you can see how massive that image was. Now personally, as much as I love pixels, I don't think this is something
realistically I'm gonna use anytime soon. But if you had your choice,
would you choose the crazy Razer triple monitor gaming
laptop or this 8K display? Now next up at number 4 is
something you might not expect. I've been talking about
laptops, and 8K displays, but the gadget that I thought
was really cool was the Polaroid Pop. If you haven't checked them
out yet, Instant Prints, have really made their way back. But the problem is,
especially with Polaroid, is those print outs were
never really true 3x4 size, but with their 80th anniversary, they have made their way back. So with the Polaroid Pop,
this shoots and prints, 3x4 instant photos using inkless paper. It's packing a 20 megapixel
camera with dual LED flash. And while it's not 4K, this
can also record 1080p video. Now the model I got to check
out was a pre-production unit. So it did not power on. But the actual production
model will also feature a 3.9inch touch screen. What I like about this
especially, is the fact that it's multi-function. So obviously, you can take
photos with the built in camera, you can transfer wirelessly
from your phone to the pop. But on top of that, there
is also an SD card slot, so you can transfer photos directly. So it's kind of funny, with
all the crazy tech at CES, this is one of the things
I was most excited for. So once it drops, I will
definitely get my hands on it. Last up, at number five,
brand new for CES 2017, is the Panasonic GH5. The follow up to the highly
sought after and loved GH4. Now the big improvements
with the GH5 is that it now shoots 4K video up to 60 FPS. Personally, I am team 24. But where I could see 60
FPS being really useful, is if you use that for slow motion. What's also cool is the
fact that there is now internal image stabilization. Which is actually really important. We've seen that on Sony bodies. But the idea here is instead
of image stabilization solely on the lens, it's actually
happening inside the body. And where this is really useful
is if you're using a lens that doesn't have image stabilization, that's gonna add the
element to your shooting. There are now also dual SD
card slots where you can record two separately or use as a backup. And potentially the two biggest
selling points of the GH5, are one the fact that the
crop factor is now removed and second that its supposed
to perform better in low light. Personally, I really didn't get
a chance to test it out much on the show floor. And CES really isn't the
best place to do that. But the one thing I can attest
to, regardless of testing or not is again the fact
that the crop factor is gone, which is actually a really big deal. Personally when it comes to that market, I tend to lean towards
the Sony side of things. But I'm really interested in
seeing for the GH5 performs. Either way though, a ton of
really cool tech to kick off 2017 already. Again, huge shout out
to Samsung for making my coverage possible. And as far as your favorite tech, let me know what that was
with a comment down below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Hey, guys, Jonathan here, and unfortunately, it
is that time of year, back to school. But on the bright side of that, you're about to check out
some really cool tech. This time of the home tech flavor. So, whether you are at home or whether you're at a dorm, this should hopefully help
ease you through the year. So, first up is for anyone
looking for a TV upgrade or really just looking
to pick up a TV, period. This is a 43 inch, 4K TV from Insignia and I will be the first to admit I've always been a little apprehensive and maybe haven't had the best impression of Insignia. Honestly just saying the
name, to me, was very similar to those hyenas saying, - Mufasa
- Oooh! - There was just something about the name, and maybe I was wrong for judging. But this time, I went
in with an open mind. Specifically, there were two things that really drew me towards this TV. One was the price. It was on sale for 299 bucks, and two, there is Roku TV built in, so that combined makes it a
really attractive package. Honestly, the weirdest
part of this experience was taking the TV out of the box because for some reason the packaging smelled like straight up Sharpie, but
everything else was great. Personally, I really don't use Roku, but given the chance to use it here, it is a really nice experience. I particularly like how
everything is broken down, especially 4K content,
and every major player that you could want, whether it's YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, everything
is pretty much there. The interface isn't the prettiest thing in the world, but it's
intuitive, it's easy to use. I particularly like that
they include a Roku remote in the box. It kinda just makes you
feel like you're getting that entire experience, and not just a watered down version of it. Picture quality wise,
it's obviously not gonna out perform higher end
models from Samsung, from LG, from Sony, but for the price, I have zero complaints. It's sharp, it's crisp, and again, if you can scoop this up
for the 299 sale price, I would jump on this any day of the week. So next up is for anyone
looking at a little Amazon Alexa functionality into their life without breaking the bank,
this is the Eufy Genie. Huge shout out to them for
sponsoring this episode. There is also a really
sweet giveaway which I will link to down below. But I think you're gonna like this for a couple reasons. One is the price. It is currently 35 bucks,
which is a fantastic deal. And two, you get all the functionality of an Echo Dot, and then some. What I mean by that is,
it is supported directly through Amazon, so you're
not missing functionality or features, but on top of that, I was surprised with
how good the speaker is. With the Echo Dot, if you
wanna listen to music, you pretty much need to
add a secondary speaker. In fact, Amazon encourages you to do so. But surprisingly, the Eufy
Genie holds its own by itself. Now I totally understand,
it is really hard to truly give you an idea of how something sounds through video,
but for those curious, here is a quick example. (upbeat music) - [Alexa] Shuffling songs by grammatic. (upbeat music) Now as cool as the
improved sound quality is, none of that would matter
if the core function of the Amazon Alexa in this did not work. Fortunately, it worked flawlessly. - [Alexa] When is a door not a door? When it's ajar. The top search result for Sony A6500 is Sony Alpha A6500 digital camera with 2.9 inch LCD, body only. It's $1,527.32 total, including tax. Would you like to buy it? - So yeah. If you're looking
to add a little Alexa into your life, I would
definitely check this out. Immediately off the bat, it's
gonna save you some cash, and potentially even
more because the speaker is so good by itself,
you're not gonna need to add anything externally. So, next up is the Wemo Mini Smart Plug, which is also budget
friendly, and currently on sale for 35 bucks. (mumbles) the idea behind
this is super simple. It's gonna give you smart functionality to everyday things that aren't so smart. So, for example, maybe you have a fan, or a portable AC, and
I know you're trying to save that cash; you don't want
them running the entire day. But with the Wemo Mini Smart
Plug you could potentially set them on a schedule to turn off and on at specific points of the day. Or maybe you know you're
gonna be home in an hour. You can turn it on from your phone. Now for me specifically, this works great with something like a salt
lamp, where the on/off switch is not the easiest to reach place. Again, you do have the
ability to set it on a timer. So if I wanted a salt lamp to turn on every day at night, I
could, or I can just control it from my phone without
reaching behind the shelf. On top of that, it works with Nest, it works with Amazon
Alexa, so if you scooped up that Eufy Genie, that
would be a killer combo. This may not be the most
exciting piece of tech, but it's practical, it works fantastic, and I think it would be
really useful in a dorm room. So next up is a pretty
unique USB charging hub from Nomad, and I'll
be honest, this is not the most budget friendly. If you're just looking for
a no bells and whistles, super effective, powerful
USB charging brick, I will post a couple options down below, but this in particular,
I was really drawn to it because of its looks. It is this beautiful, circular hub that would fit great in
any kind of minimal setup. The way the ports are designed into this are meant to keep everything really clean, which I like. This here is the three port version, but there is also a five port
version for 10 buck more. I think that is definitely
the better value. Small things like seeing
the LED lights on the front of the device, I particularly appreciate, and I fully realize here you are paying 100% for the form, for
the looks, and there's not necessarily anything
wrong with that; maybe you have a style, or a setup in mind. If that fits this is gonna be perfect, but again, realize that
there are definitely cheaper options out there. But I will list this and
those options, again, down below. Last but not least is the LIFX A19 Multicolor LED light bulb, and you know, I love me some Philips hue just as much as the next person, but as
far as back to school goes, I think this is a fantastic option. Yes, there totally are cheaper
multicolor LED light bulbs out there that will give
you a similar experience, but in terms of quality, the brightness, the vividness of the colors,
LIFX is worth the cash. Now on top of the actual light quality, the app that you use to control everything is really, really good. It is stupid simple use. Again the biggest thing
here is the ability to kinda buy and upgrade
at your discretion. Maybe you just need one
light bulb and you're totally happy with that,
that is all you need to buy. That, of course, may change one day; maybe you wanna add a second, a
third, a fourth, a fifth, you can do that and you're
not tied down to a system. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. Hopefully enjoyed the video. If you did make sure you
guys drop a like down below. If you need more back
to school awesomeness, make sure you check out this video here. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. 
- [Recorded Voice In Distance]
So since I'm already-- - Getting a sneak peak at
that hot Austin Evans video before it goes live. Yo guys, Jonathan here. This is an abnormally long microphone. More importantly though, this
is the brand new Galaxy S8. But before you pick one up,
here are 10 things to know. (techno music) So first up, and maybe most importantly, the Galaxy S8 should not explode. - [Bart Simpson] April F-- (explosion) - Now, yeah, I get it. Sounds funny, it's easy to
joke about, but this is a huge deal and Samsung cannot afford
to have a repeat situation after the whole Note 7 fiasco. During the announcement,
Samsung did not shy away from the whole battery deal. They, in fact, embraced it
and announced moving forward they now have an eight-point
battery inspection in place, which again, people are
gonna joke and laugh at it, but I've gotta tip my hat to Samsung for handling it so well. Now the second thing to
know is there is not only just the Galaxy S8, there is also a Galaxy S8 Plus. Now, surprisingly, the Galaxy
S8 and S8 Plus are more similar than you might expect,
and there really are only two differences between them, the first of which is the screen size. The Galaxy S8 is rockin'
a 5.8-inch display, while the Galaxy S8 Plus is
rockin' a 6.2-inch display. They're both rockin' four gigs of RAM, 64 gigabytes of internal storage. Both have micro SD card expandability, and really, the only other
difference between the two is the battery capacity. The Galaxy S8 features
3,000 milliamp hours while the Galaxy S8 Plus is
gonna get you slightly more, at 3500. Now where it gets interesting
though, is that despite having the difference in screen
size, both of these share the exact same resolution, coming in at 2960 by 1440. So that actually leads
me to point number three, which is the fact that
these screens are freaking beautiful. If you're out there wondering
what the heck kind of resolution is 2960 by 1440, it's actually very similar
to what we saw on the LG G6. Samsung just decided to change it up ever so slightly. So with the G6, they
introduced an extra-long 18 by nine display, and for
you mathematicians out there, yes I know it is two by one. With the Galaxy S8 and S8
Plus, however, this is slightly longer at eight and a half by
nine, so Samsung is screwing up math for everybody. So the idea behind the extra
tall display is that it's gonna give you more screen real estate and more room for activities when you're playing around
with apps and multitasking. As far as consuming media and
watching video, it is still a little bit weird, considering
the fact that most of it out there is geared for 16 by
nine, but honestly I really like what Samsung and LG are
doing with the taller displays. What you also may have noticed
is the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus look very similar to what
we've seen in the past, on something like the Galaxy S7 Edge. Samsung is dubbing this
the infinity display. Essentially what that
fancy-pants Buzz Lightyear naming means is that the display
is now edge to edge, effectively getting rid of
the pixels and my goodness, it looks good. Now next up at number four is something that may freak people out Because of that infinity, endless display, there is no physical home button. So we've seen Apple implement this with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,
and if you've used those you kinda have an idea of how
it works and how it feels, but if this is new to you,
it is kinda weird at first. For me, personally, I don't
mind it at all since it's something I'm used to, but I
know a lot of people out there really love their physical
home button, so let me know what you guys think with
a comment down below. Now one thing I've noticed
is that the infinite display has almost kinda had this
butterfly effect on everything. Because of the display, there
is no physical home button, and because there is no
physical home button, there is now no longer
a finger print reader on the front of the phone. Now if you're freaking out
wondering did they remove the fingerprint reader? Nope. They just moved it to a stupid,
awkward place on the back. There are a ton of things
that I really like about the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, but the
location of the fingerprint reader simply doesn't make sense. For reasons I have no idea why,
it is placed off to the side next to the camera, which makes
it kinda awkward to access. This may definitely change after using it for an extended period of time,
but right now I kept wanting to press the camera and
nobody wants fingerprints on their camera. Now next up at number five,
like most Samsung phones, the camera on this thing
looks like it's going to be awesome. As far as the rear shooter
goes, this is rockin' a 12-megapixel sensor, F1.7 with OIS. Now I will say, I was only
able to view the photos back on the phone itself and
not look at 'em on a computer, but initial impressions
so far is that the camera is really sharp. (intense musical tones) As far as the front camera
goes, the Galaxy S8 features a pretty impressive eight
megapixel sensor up front. It's got a nice, wide lens and,
again, like the rear-facing camera, initial impressions are solid. And just in case you've
ever thought to yourself, man, I wish my phone had some
slightly weird, Snapchat-like filters built in, now with
the Galaxy S8, you got it. So next up at number
six is the iris scanner, which is gonna scan your
eyes to unlock your phone. So this was actually introduced
with the Galaxy Note 7. We, of course, know what
happened there, but it is brand new to the Galaxy S line. Now as far as the iris scanner
goes, that always wasn't the quickest option to unlock
your phone, but in addition to that, Samsung has now
rolled out Face Unlock, which is much, much faster. I got a chance to check
that out for myself and it was pretty much instantaneous. You gotta really pay
attention when you're watching the video but if you're
looking for a really speedy, quick way to access your
phone, Face Unlock works well. So next up at number seven,
joining me right now is Austin "Always Wears a Small" - Very true.
- Evans. Secret to gains. - Yep.
- Wear a size down. Actually, number seven, the
Galaxy S8, surprisingly, features a headphone jack. - That makes it a bad phone then. - That's not true. - I thought all good phones
had to have no headphone jack. Isn't that
- Oh my god. - Didn't they read the 2017 - Tim Cook has brainwashed Austin Evans
- 2017 you can't have a headphone jack in 2017. - Tim Cook has brainwashed
- That's not how it works! - Tim Cook has brainwashed
Austin Evans, I've got a cramp! Ah! Got a cramp! Ken, what'd you do? Damn witchcraft. Back to business. In addition to the headphone
jack there is also now a USB-C on the Galaxy S8, just
like we saw on the Note 7. Personally, I am a huge fan
of USB-C and I wish everything had it so it could be
one, simple, beautiful. Form factor. Technology. Advancement. - [Man, Off Camera] Yeah, all of those. - Next up at number eight,
after that disaster, no surprise here, but the
Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus feature wireless charging. Now I know someone out there right now is rapidly typing through their keyboard wireless charging's
stupid, no one uses it. While that may be true, the
one plus that I can see to this is that the wireless charging
docks that go alongside the Galaxy S8 look really,
really nice and I would love to see that on a desk. Next up at number nine,
just like wireless charging, no surprise here, the Galaxy S8 is IP68 water and dust resistant. It is not groundbreaking, it
is not new, but if you want to use your shiny new
Galaxy S8 in the bathtub, in the shower, you can do it. Last up at number 10,
Samsung is taking shots at Google Assist and trying to take over with their new personal assistant, Bixby, which makes me think of Bubsy Bobcat. Honestly, it was kinda
hard to get a true feel of how that works. I'm gonna hold back until
I actually get the device in house and use it myself for a bit, but just after seeing initial
reactions, the general consensus seems to be that
most people would not prefer this over Google Assistant. Aside from that, if you
enjoyed the video, make sure to drop a like down below. Hit that share button maybe,
if you feel like being extra awesome, and if
you haven't subscribed, make sure you do so because
I'll probably be giving away a brand-new Galaxy S8 soon. There actually is a chance
to win a brand-new red iPhone right now, which you can check out here. This is Jonathan, and
I'll catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here. For Black Friday, I covered
10 deals that didn't suck, but for Cyber Monday
we are stepping it up. So here are 20 deals you may have missed. First up is the 500 gigabyte XBox One S Battlefield 1 Bundle, which is on sale for a
crazy cheap $212 bucks. Now, most of these deals are going to continue on through Cyber Monday week, but I have a feeling this one is gonna expire pretty quickly, so
if you're looking at this, you may want to jump on it quickly. So, I actually impulsively
bought one of these bundles because I thought it would be cool to give away to you guys, so for a chance to win, go
to hit that subscribe button, maybe drop a like if you are
feeling like being awesome. Now, if you're someone out there who needs more gigabytes
because 500 just isn't enough, there's also the one
terabyte Battlefield Edition, which is on sale for $254 bucks, not much more than the
500 gigabyte bundle. The pro, or maybe the con to this deal, is that it's a completely
different looking console. I personally like the looks
of the white Xbox One S, but if you dig the Battlefield one, then it is a fantastic deal. On the flipside, maybe
you're not into Xbox, maybe PS4 is your thing. There is also a PS4 Slim Uncharted Bundle for $212 bucks. From there, the gaming
deals don't stop, though, there are so many, in fact, I'm gonna pass it off to
Ralphy C to finish these up. - PS4 Pro, $399, with Infinite Warfare Legacy Edition only today! Black Friday, Black Monday. Cyber Monday? Cyber Friday. - [Jonathon] That's not on my list. - Do you like World War One soldiers? Do you like war? Battlefield 1 digital code is $44 bucks, so you're saving at least $20 bucks that you can spend on any little brother, for maybe Mario Kart or something. Mario Kart's not on sale. Now, continuing on the 50 train, you can buy Gears of War 4 for only $35 dollars a digital code, so you can enjoy all the blood, all the gore, all the chainsaws, all kinds of blood! Now, next we got $20 dollars
off an Xbox One controller for little Timmy, so
that you can't give him the crappy one that's
back there, or something, where is it? - [Jonathon] What would
you do with $20 bucks? - $20 bucks, I'd go to Speed Zone, man! (laughs) Speed Zone... Have you been to Slick Tracks, man? That track sucks! You slippin' and sliding everywhere. - [Jonathon] Get out. - (laughs) - So, next up is one
of the cheapest prices I've seen on a monitor, the 21 1/2 inch 1920 by 1080 silver
beauty from HP, which is $59.99. That is so cheap, you can rock some double monitor action for a buck 20, or go big with three displays, Taran style for under $200 bucks, man! Following that is the seven
inch Amazon Fire Tablet, which is on sale for $33 bucks. You are not gonna get much
cheaper than $33 bucks unless you go the Digiland route. No disrespect, Digiland, to you and your superior tablets, but this is a pretty sweet deal. So with the year coming to an end, and 2017 quickly approaching, if you are still on a mechanical drive, it is time to upgrade. Luckily for you, though, the Samsung Evo 500 gigabyte SSD is on sale for $129.99, which is crazy to think how
much prices have dropped in just a few years. 500 gigabyte SSDs used to be
four or five hundred bucks a couple years ago. So the fact that they are this cheap and accessible now is awesome, and trust me, if you have yet to upgrade, this is one of the best things
you can do to your computer. Following that, got one
more monitor deal for you. The Dell SE2416HX, which
has a super long name with a super small price. This is a 23 inch monitor, which is currently on sale for $99 bucks. Personally, I've always
been a fan of Dell monitors. So, maybe if you're looking to upgrade to something bigger, or
maybe to add it to a laptop, this is a really good choice to look at. Next is a 200 gigabyte
microSD card from SanDisk, which is on sale for
$49 bucks, perfect for anyone looking to add some
storage to their phone. After that is a 20,000 milliamp
power external battery, which is a crazy cheap $21 bucks. And this time around, for Cyber Monday, we got a little Microsoft love with the Microsoft Surface Book, coming in at $250 bucks off. Next up, we have some pretty
sweet headphone deals. The Sony Extra Bass XB950s
are on sale for $88 bucks, which is a steal. On the higher end of the spectrum, the Sony MDR1000X, to which are some of the best
headphones I've ever used are $50 bucks off right now. Alternatively, the JBL Everest 700s are $100 bucks off right now,
which bring them down to $100. I am personally a little
bit of a Sony fanboy when it comes to headphones, but the JBLs are really excellent as well. Jumpin' over to some MacBook love, there is $200 bucks off the
Space Gray 12 inch MacBook, details on the configuration
are linked down below. Also, just like we saw for Black Friday, the $100 dollar discount
on the 13 inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is back. These, much like the Xbox deals, I think are gonna go quickly, so if you're looking at
them, jump on them quickly. Jumping down the list,
there is an unlocked Moto Z for $499.99, and I know for
a fact that deal ends today. Anyone looking for an
inexpensive USB microphone, the Blue Snowball Ice is
on sale for $39 bucks. And lastly, for those asking about the circle LED light behind me, that is currently in stock and on sale for $35 bucks right now. Again, these prices may change, they may sell out, they may fluctuate, so don't yell at me if that happens. Links to everything we talked about, including some bonus
deals, are down below. Hopefully you guys enjoyed the video. If you did, you are
feeling like being awesome, and you want to win that Xbox One S, make sure to smash that like button. And lastly, before I hop outta here, huge shoutout to BrainTree Payments for sponsoring today's video and making awesome giveaways

- Yo guys, Jonathan here. We're kicking off 2017
with a fresh episode of the Best Tech Under 100 Bucks, and first up is a revisit of sorts, the Logitech MX Master. Now the MX Master isn't new by any means but I was browsing Amazon,
and said "Holy crap, "there are two brand new
colors; navy and stone." So with there being new colors of course, I immediately purchased them, and after getting them in and
comparing them side-by-side, I would definitely say stone
is my favorite out of the two, simply because you don't
normally see mice this color. Now recently Dream Desk
4, that's what actually got me to switch back to the MX Master because my initial
experience with this mouse, right when it came out was really bad; the connection issues, the
headache kinda outweighed the usefulness of it. But this time around
those problems were gone and it's been nothing but a
really pleasant experience. And what I love specifically
about this mouse is the side-to-side actions
so in Final Cut Pro, for example, be able to
navigate through the timeline left-to-right and right-to-left
is immensely helpful. You combine that with the fact
that it's super-customizable, really comfortable, and
that is why it is currently my favorite mouse out there right now. And the fact that there are two new colors makes it even better. Now recently I got an awesome opportunity to actually shoot some
commercials for Philips and thanks to that,
they were awesome enough to sponsor this video
and with that, next up is the Philips Hue Go. What these are essentially
are portable Philips Hue that you can place pretty
much anywhere you want. If you haven't noticed
yet, that is actually what is giving me that
splash of color back here and what's especially nice about these is the fact that they're battery powered and rechargeable, which means
you're not tied to an outlet. So you can move them, you
can take them outside, you really have a lot of flexibility. Just like any of the Philips Hue stuff, you have instant control
over this through the color, through the brightness, if I wanna dim it, brighten it back up, or
maybe change the color I am doing that on the fly,
little bit of red, pink, maybe a little bit of orange
and I think we're gonna go back to blue. What's also kinda cool is
these work standalone as well so if I have Ralphy
grab one of the Hue Gos, he can actually navigate
and change the colors by clicking through them. That's gonna shuffle through
some pre-selected scenes, brightness and colors. You do, of course, get the
most control through the app but if you're outside,
or if you don't have your phone near you, this
is a cool way to switch it up and mix things up. So if you've recently got
into the Philips Hue game, you know it's extremely addicting and these are no different. The portability, the
flexibility is awesome. And I apologize in advance to your wallet because these are the next
things you're gonna wanna buy. And next I'm gonna change things up a bit. Normally when you watch
a Best Tech Under 100, Under 50 Bucks, you only
see the tech that makes the cut but what actually
happens is I'll go down these deep Amazon rabbit
holes and order 10, 15, 20 pieces of tech under
that certain price point and actually test them out
to see which ones are worthy. Recently you guys have
seen the circle LED lamp in a ton of my videos. I even went as far as putting it in the Tech Under 50 Hall of Fame. So when I saw they had a
standing tall lamp version of this, I was super excited. Now as much as I love this guy behind me, it was kind of the opposite experience with the standing version
because for 90 bucks the build quality is kind of bad. I really, really wanted to like this thing but I just cannot justify it for the price so if you're looking
for a circle LED light, stick to the original right there. Now jumping back to the tech
that actually made the cut, next up is the Google Chromecast Ultra. And I'm sure by now everyone
knows what a Chromecast is. This does everything
that did but that Ultra gets you 4K and HDR. Now, obviously, if you don't have a 4K TV do not buy this because
it's not gonna magically make your 720p TV output 4K. If you do have one, however,
this is a really great, relatively inexpensive
option to enjoy 4K content. Now, yes I know, most 4K TVs out there do have some sort of smart capabilities but the convenience with this is the fact that you have control with your phone, whether you're watching YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, there is a ton of
apps that support this now. So with that, if you're looking
to step up your pixel game, the Google Chromecast Ultra
is a fantastic choice. Now recently in the latest episode of the Best Tech Under 50, I showcased the TP Link Smart Outlet
which worked really well with the Amazon Echo and
I got a ton of questions asking "Does it work with Apple HomeKit?" The short answer is no, it doesn't. So with that I thought I
would showcase one that does, this is the iHome Smartplug. So even though this is the
Best Tech Under 100 Bucks, this is actually around 50
and personally I bought mine at Best Buy but if you
pick yours up on Amazon, it actually comes with
a free wireless remote that you can use in addition to your voice and to your phone. Not sure exactly how useful
that is to most people out there but something free is something free. And again, really the
main purpose with this is to have control over something plugged into your outlet that you
control with your phone, or in this case with
your voice through Siri. Hey Siri. (Siri bleeps) Turn the living room off. (Siri bleeps) - OK, they are off. - The set up was simple, it was quick, and more importantly, this
is an extremely versatile smart plug because on top of
working with Apple HomeKit, it also works with Amazon
Alexa and Samsung SmartThings. Last up is the HooToo Shuttle
which is a USB Type-C hub that works really well
with the new MacBook Pros and is personally what I am using. This specific one here
is space grey but it also comes in silver and rose
gold so, in addition to the 15 inch MacBook
Pros that just came out, it also works really well
with the 12 inch models. In addition to three USB-A
ports, you're also getting an HDMI, an SD card slot, and
on top of that there's also a USB-C port that supports charging. Really, for me though,
I only truly use this for an SD card reader because
luckily, for the most part, all my peripherals I've been
able to find USB-C cables. But just in case I'm ever in a pinch, having those extra ports and even HDMI is a super nice touch. I've had it pretty much ever
since the new MacBook Pros came out so so far it's been
reliable, it hasn't gone out. And overall if you're
looking for a well-built, good looking USB-C hub that's
gonna give you SD card slot, USB-A, and HDMI, you can not go wrong with the HooToo Shuttle. Aside from that hopefully
you've enjoyed the video. If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to smash that like button. Links to everything I
talked about are down below. And yes, my eye is still
a little jacked up, if you have no idea why you can check out that video here or down below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here and if Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson decided to become best
friends with the Chromebook, here is what would happen. This is the brand new
Samsung Chromebook Pro, Pro being the keyword, and that raises the question of, "Is this the most
powerful Chromebook ever?" Before I hop in though,
huge shoutout to Samsung for not only sending this my way early but for also sponsoring this video. Right out of the box, without a doubt, this thing screams premium. Normally, great build
quality in Chromebooks are not two things you would throw together
in the same sentence but with this, it is a
completely different story. This is a Chromebook
with a full metal design that not only looks great
but it feels great as well. This Chromebook Pro is
rocking a 12.3-inch display with a resolution of 2400 by 1600, that is a 3:2 
aspect ratio, for anyone curious. Honestly, one of the
biggest surprises for me is how nice this display is. It is miles better than any
Chromebook I've used prior. You get two USB-C ports, so you can get on that USB-C life, and what's cool with these is they're actually dual function, so you can charge through either port or connect something like
an external USB-C SSD and extend that storage. If external SSDs aren't your
thing however, do not worry because there's also a Micro SD card slot. You also get a 720p front-facing webcam, which is something strangely not the current 12-inch
MacBook does not have, and this is gonna ensure that
you don't look like a potato to grandma on those Skype calls. Now as far as what is
powering this Chromebook Pro, inside, you get an Intel Core m3 processor clocked at 2.2 gigahertz and four gigabytes of RAM. Now speaking of that m3 processor, if you're curious, that is
actually the biggest difference between the new Chromebook
Pro and Chromebook Plus, and what that should do
with that extra power is to allow us to
multitask super smoothly. Right now I got some
Google Doc action open, and shoutout to the MKBHD Dream Desk, and I'm gonna instantly hop
back and forth between apps. We got Adobe Draw open, and just for reference,
I did not draw that. You're gonna see how terrible
my skills are momentarily. And beyond multitasking,
as we hop over to a game, that is actually one of the coolest things about this Chromebook Pro. You're not gonna just play games
like you would on Facebook. These are actually pretty intensive games, full-on Android apps. So here we have Asphalt 8, and disclaimer, I am
not sure what is worse, my gaming or drawing abilities,
but we'll see both shortly. Initially, upon first impressions, I gotta say, thing that stands
out most to me with this is it doesn't feel like I'm
playing on a Chromebook, everything was responsive. I move the keys, the car reacts. There's no lag, the
graphics look fantastic, and in terms of being able
to multitask and game, so far it definitely passes that test. Now if you're wondering yourself, "Maybe I don't wanna play
with keys, what do I do then?" That is where the
two-in-one comes into play. So instantaneously, I'm gonna
go from using my keyboard and this is actually much easier. I kind of realize I
suck big time with keys and maybe now I have a
chance to win this race. But you can see how seamless that was. I just popped it shut and here I am. Now even though at its core, this is a Chromebook through and through, it does have a few
surprises up its sleeve. For one, if you hadn't caught it yet, this is actually a two-in-one,
and what that means, you can instantly switch
between laptop and tablet mode and by itself, yeah, that is super cool but it's really when you combine it with these next two features
that takes it to another level. First off, if you look closely, to the naked eye, that
might look like a button, but if you press it, out comes a stylus. Immediately when popping the stylus out, I am greeted with some stylus tools, so I have the option
to capture the region, capture the screen, start a new note, put in laser pointer mode
or magnifying glass mode. For some unknown reason though, I'm feeling like I'm gonna
go into Advanced mode and maybe hop into Adobe Draw. Again, I wish I could take credit for that amazing Spider-Man drawing but that is not me, so
we will see what happens. Do I know to draw anything? That is not Mickey Mouse. This is not Mickey Mouse, by the way. I am stating this clearly. It is not Mickey Mouse. It actually kind of
looks like Mickey Mouse. Whoa, maybe not. I think where I'm gonna run
into problems is the body, so I'm gonna end it with
a classic stick figure, and voila. So while my artistic
abilities may not be the best, I think what's more important is the stylus actually feels
really good, it's responsive. And if you actually can draw, unlike me, you can do some seriously
cool stuff with this. Now as far as apps, the way
this is able to run those is you actually get access to everything in the Google Play Store. So with that, you can run
a full-on Android app, simple things like
Slack, Skype, Instagram, things you would normally
do on your phone, but on top of that, as you saw earlier, you now have access to
full-on Android mobile gaming and that's something you could not do with prior Chromebooks in the past. So all in all, when you combine that power with that portability
and that flexibility, all those together kind of
make the perfect combination for a fantastic multipurpose device, whether you got into laptop mode and you're getting work
done out of the coffee shop, or at the very least, pretending to, or you're kicking back on the couch playing games in tablet
mode, this has you covered. With this, you're getting everything you've come to know and
love with Chromebooks, free updates, fantastic battery life, but more importantly, and
especially with the Pro, more power than ever. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. Hope you enjoyed the video. If you did and you are
feeling being awesome, make sure to smash that Like button. If you're interested in
this checking this out, I will have a link down below. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Jonathan here, today we're
going to take a look at some of the best home
tech thus far of 2017. So first up is the Philips Sonicare
Flexcare Platinum Connected. A huge shout out to Philips
for not only sending this out, but also in the dark
days of adpocolypse for also sponsoring this episode. Now yes, this is a
toothbrush on a tech channel, but that is because there
is a crazy amount of tech packed inside this guy, starting with the fact
that it will connect via bluetooth to your smart phone. So what's cool with that
bluetooth connectivity is the fact that it's not
just going to tell you to brush your teeth for
"X" amount of minutes. There is a smart sensor built
within this that's going to know how hard you
brushed, where you brush, and at the end of it when
it's all said and done which spots you hit correctly
and which ones you didn't. So that combined with the
fact that it is guiding you through your mouth section
by section is kind of cool. I'm not going to lie,
there are times when you wake up in the morning
and you're zoned out, you're half-asleep, and
maybe you brush the right side of your mouth way
more than you need to and neglect that left side,
but with this not no more. Now for those who've
caught more recent videos, you know strokes per minute
is kind of a big deal. This guy is dishing out
31,000 strokes a minute, and to break that down
that's 516 strokes a second and to visualize that, "one, two, three," that is 1,550 strokes that just happened. So you combine that kind
of stroke power with your adaptive clean brush head, which is soft, flexible, and
just kind of hugs your teeth, then you're going to have some
squeaky clean pearly whites. So next up is the Como Audio
Solo wireless bluetooth, and specifically I'm taking a look at the one in walnut black. So if you love wood and you love tech, you are going to love this thing. Aesthetically, it is beautiful and if there were one word
I would use to describe this it would be "classy." Price-wise it is a little more than your average bluetooth speaker, but that is because it is more than your average bluetooth speaker. For starters, build-quality-wise,
it is using real wood and not some cheap laminate, and when I say it is more
than just a bluetooth speaker, what I mean by that is beyond
the bluetooth connectivity, there is built in radio,
both FM and internet flavors, Wi-Fi, and then what stood out to me the most is built-in Spotify connect integration. Now, specifically for
me, why I really like the Spotify connect
feature is you're actually getting better sound quality, that's because you are
pulling music directly from the device as opposed to
connecting through bluetooth. Then two, once you're
setup and ready to go, you can then use this stand-alone without needing to use your phone. As far as sound-quality goes, this thing packs way, way more sound than you would ever expect
for a box this size. It is clear, it is punchy,
there is plenty of volume, on the other hand though it's not going to blow your socks off low-end wise, so if that is something you're in to you may potentially
want to look elsewhere, but if you're looking for something clear, that's going to fill a room, is unique and packed full of features, this is your guy. Following that, maybe one of the coolest home tech gadgets of all time,
especially for under $30, this is the Sideclick, and specifically I'm taking a
look at the one for Apple TV, but if Apple is not your thing, there's also one available
for the Fire TV and ROKU. So, with the Sideclick, first
and foremost what it's going to do essentially is
house the Apple TV remote. What that's going to do is add some size, add some bulk, and in
turn hopefully reduce your chances of losing this thing. Now in my case, the way I have
it setup is the power button is going to power on and power off the TV. The plus minus will then control
the volume on the soundbar. The up and down arrows will
control the channels on the TV. The source button will
control the source of the TV. Then as far as A&amp;B goes, right now I have an A to power on the TV, that is really only because I
don't have a secondary device, but in theory you could have a Blu-ray player or a DVD player. Then lastly I have B
powering on the soundbar. Now for me, the coolest
thing about this guy aside from the price, was
how easy it was to set it up. It seriously took less than 5 minutes, that's because it
connects through infrared, as opposed to entering in stupid codes. Now the instance where you're
maybe also using a cablebox, this will definitely improve things, but not be the ideal solution, but on the flip side if
you're someone who watches TV, consumes their media through an apple TV, a ROKU, or a Fire TV, this might be just the
answer you were looking for. So next up is the Nuimo
smart home controller, which looks like it is
straight out of the future. So far as scale goes,
this right here is it. It is a super compact,
really sleek-looking device, that also comes in white. What it's going to do is
give you control over various tech products in your home,
all through a single source. Now as far as what this will control, right now you have
Apple music, Googlecast, Lifx light bulbs,
Philips Hue light bulbs, Ronfel, and then Sonos speakers. Once you're set up and connected,
it is super simple to switch between which device you want to control, simply swipe up or down,
then an icon will pop up on which device is
currently being controlled. In this case, here with Philips Hue, you can see the lightbulb icon pop up, and as far as control goes,
I can do something as simple as powering the light off or on, or something more complex
light changing the color blue. Now hopping over to Apple
music if I want to play a song, simply press it, (upbeat music) volume, go to next song, (upbeat music) So you can see it works really well, it's pretty instantaneous, and it's going to give you
that next level control instead of having to reach out for your phone or your tablet. Now again the ideal location
for this is going to be at the wall or a table or a desk, not to be used free-handedly. But the good news is
everything you need to do that is going to come in the box. Now if I had any complaints
would be the fact that you do need an active
bluetooth connection to use this whether it's
your phone or your tablet, it will not work stand-alone. Beyond that I would definitely
love to see more app support, especially Spotify, but
it's actually nice if you use Sonos, if you use Apple music, if you use Lifx or Philips Hue. This is a really cool home-tech device. So next up this would be
perfect for the best tech, and if you guys are excited
for a new episode of that, make sure you drop a "like" down below. This is the Avantree
bluetooth transmitter, which is going to allow you to use bluetooth headphones with your TV. So what this tiny compact
gadget does is connect to the audio of your TV and then
creates a bluetooth connection that you can then connect up to two different bluetooth headphones. Now a couple notes, if you
pick this up and you set it up and you notice a little bit of
lag or a little bit latency, that's more than likely
because your headphones do not support a low-latency mode, and if that's the case they do make a complimentary pair of
headphones that is designed specifically for this use. On the contrary, though
if you do want to use the low-latency pair of
headphones, you can only stream audio to one pair of
headphones and not two, so if you do want to stream
audio to two separate sources, you will have to
sacrifice the low-latency. You can power this through
the USB port on your TV, but what's cool with this is
there's a built-in battery that could give you around
6 hours of battery life. That also makes this
perfect to take on the go. So if you're someone who lives with others and maybe you watch things
way too late or way too early, if you're looking for a
solution to continue to do that without disturbing others,
this is a fantastic option, and again it is only $39. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. If you haven't yet, make
sure you check out this video here where Philips partnered with
TED to showcase how cool technology like the Sonicare
Flexcare Platinum Connected can help improve lives. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and with holidays rapidly
approaching I thought it would be a perfect time for a
holiday tech gift guide. This time though for
maybe the first time ever, I wanted to get these out
early so you had plenty of time to pick these up. And for this video we're looking at some great options under 25 bucks. So first up is the infamous Mighty Mug, the mug that will not fall
over, which you more than likely saw from my good buddy
Lew over at unbox therapy where that video went crazy this year. Now a huge shout out to Mighty
Mug for sending these out and not only sponsoring this gift guide, but also a give away
because if you couldn't tell I do not need this many mugs. For a chance to win go to
make sure you subscribe, and maybe throw in
notifications if you haven't yet because there are plenty of
holiday giveaways coming up. So if you guys are down with that, and you are ready to
win some holiday tech, let me know by dropping a like down below. Now the game changer with Mighty Mug, is it's smart-grip
technology which creates a 360 degree air lock at its base, which in turn prevents it
from being knocked over. What's crazy though is when
you go to lift the Mighty Mug, that air lock releases automatically and allows you to pick it up
like you would any normal cup. I'm not sure what kind
of wizardry or magic this is that makes it work, but it does. So if you're someone, or you know someone who
likes to bring drinks near electronics, whether it's
your desktop or your laptop, and are prone to accidents,
especially with sticky stuff, then this might be the perfect option. They're BPA free, there are
a ton of styles and colors, and for TLD fans who scoop one of these up within the next 24 hours,
use TLD20 at checkout, which is gonna get you 20% off and ensure you get these
in time for the holidays. So next up is a really
sleek USB-C charge dock from Simpeak, which I've been
looking for for a while now. I've seen a ton of great
options for iPhones, but never really anything similar for Android until I found this guy. It's aluminum so the build
quality is top notch, but what I really like
about it is how simplistic and minimal it is, which
makes it a great option for your desk that looks really clean. What's cool with this though
is that is supports USB 3.1, and on top of those speedy transfer speeds it also supports fast charging. So that combined with
the fact that looks good, it supports pretty much every
single USB-C device out there including the Google Pixel,
and the fact that it's under twenty bucks right
now makes this a no-brainer. Now next, you guys know I
love pretty much anything that has to do with lighting,
especially if it's colored so when I found this Aukey table lamp, I was instantly hooked. It's touched activated
which is really cool and not only makes you feel
like you're in the future, but it's also really
handy so you don't have to find a switch in the dark. And then my favorite with
this is it's color mode, which will cycle to
256 color combinations. By default it's going to
continuously cycle through those colors, but if you see one you like and you want to stop it there
you can do that as well. Whether you're using this for your desk, or as a night light next to your bed, this works great in a ton
of different applications. It's clean, it's simple, it's easy to use. And more importantly they're
inexpensive enough to where you can grab a couple and set up a really cool looking environment. Now next is the Jackery
Jewel iPhone lightning cable, which is under 20 bucks and
has a trick up it's sleeve. It's MFI certified and works just like any normal lightning
cable, so you can charge, you can transfer data, unless trying to do Macbook Pro. But the secret with this is there's an emergency power bank inside. Now I will emphasize
this is meant to be used in emergencies, and not
as a normal power bank. The charge is relatively small at 450mAh, but the idea with this is to use it when everything else has failed. It makes sense because whether you're charging your phone up or
you're transferring data, this is gonna be charging
in the background. And then for those times
where you're stuck without a charge, maybe your back up
battery died, this will come in to get you just enough juice
to power back up your phone. It's not the sleekest
or the prettiest design, and the actual capsule can
feel a little bit bulky, but it essentially ensures
you have a back up emergency option, so in that case it
definitely works as advertised. The other compelling feature with this is its price, which is actually cheaper than a standard apple lighting cable. There are of course cheaper
third party options, but for a couple bucks more
the fact that you can squeeze in a back up battery is kinda cool. Now next is the Steklo X-Stand, which is a really nice
lightweight laptop stand that's gonna work for both
Mac and Windows based laptops. With this, it is relatively
low profile so you're not gonna get a ton of lift with your laptop, but rather, the idea behind
this stand is to get it up just enough to help with air flow. What's also nice with
this is the fact that it's made out of aluminum and not plastic, so it doesn't feel cheap. And it's also really light weight and breaks down really small, which makes this ideal for
a traveling laptop stand. Now this will work with
pretty much every brand of laptop between 12 and 17 inches including the 12 inch Macbook. It will not work with
anything smaller than that, so any 11 inch notebooks, especially the 11 inch
Macbook Air, do not buy this. But aside from that, the build
quality, the portability, and the fact that it works
with a really wide array of laptops makes this a really
great option for the holidays. Aside from that thank you guys
very much for watching this, stay tuned for more holiday tech gift guides coming up really soon. On the flip side if you
want to see some of Amazon's weirdest tech go ahead and click here or check out the link below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (upbeat music) 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here. The holidays are here. That means it is time to
kick off the gift guides. This one's centered around the iPhone 10, but most of these will
work with the iPhone eight, and eight plus, as well. So if you're looking for some
cool tech to compliment those, this is the video to check out. So if you're been looking
for a wireless charger, but don't want to spend
$60, $70, or even $80, this one stood out for a
couple different reasons. One, it's relatively inexpensive, and currently priced under $35. Two, it's made out of
this cloth like material, so not only is it gonna be the smooth, soft, pillow like mat, where you can place your
phone at and charge it, aesthetically, it's gonna stand out from the billion other wireless
chargers out there. So that silver back, paired
with that blue cloth material, is a beautiful contrast,
and on top of that, the flat USB cable attached to it, makes cable management super easy. Now, one thing to keep in mind is you will need to buy the power
brick to go along side this. So depending on your device, I will link the best possible
combination down below. With that said though,
this is not limited to just the iPhone 10, the eight, or eight plus. This will work with any smartphone that supports the wireless chi standard. Next, speaking of wireless charging, if you want truly wireless charging, the only way to do that is a battery bank. And this guy from Noeson... This guy will do the trick. This is packing 9000 mAh of juice inside. I'm not sure how practical or
how necessary it is to have a wireless charging battery bank. But if you've ever been to
one of those coffee shops that has wireless charging in their desks, it's usually a bunch of
crap 'cause you gotta insert some weird circular
dongel, download an app, and no one's got time for that. But with this, you can bring wireless
charging with you, anywhere. So next up, one of the best
iPhone 10 related gifts, given the lack of headphone jack, is gonna be a pair of wireless headphones. First up, these are from JBL, the E45BT. They're a little more budget friendly. They're on ear, so you're
not gonna get as much covered as you will with a pair
of over ear headphones, but they still pack a ton of sound. What I dig about these is one, you get that stealthy, triple black look, so you're not gonna
draw too much attention. And two, they break down
and fold up very nicely, so they're gonna be awesome for traveling. Now with the top band, it's
made out of this cloth material, and you got some padding
towards the bottom. So it's gonna help with those
longer listening sessions. And on top of that,
what I like about it is you have the inline controls and a super accessible
power button right here. From there, a nice small thing is having the left and right ear
cups clearly labeled. I know it's silly, but
sometimes that is very helpful. And if you want a simple
pair of headphones that aren't gonna cost over $100, I would definitely check these out. From there speaking of
over ear headphones, if you're looking for a
step up over those JBL's, these from Focal, the freedom wireless, might be one of the best sounding pairs of wireless headphones,
I've ever listened to. Just like the JBL's, these also
share a stealthy black look. You do have a splash of red, a little bit of gold with the text, and you have a glossy
finish around the ears. The absolute biggest, and
most compelling selling point with these though, is
gonna be the audio quality. Focal makes some crazy, and I mean crazy, high end audio gear. So the fact that you have
that kind of technology inside a pair of wireless
headphones is beautiful. Now these aren't used in
active noise cancellation to preserve audio quality, but there's definitely some
sort of witchcraft going on because when you throw these on your head, it is nearly impossible to hear
what's going on around you. I've taken them on airplane trips, they work excellent for that. I've taken them to the gym, they've been tossed around, beat up, they've dealt with a little bit of sweat. But no matter what I've thrown
at them, they have held up. The absolute biggest selling
point with these though, is going to be audio quality. Focal does some crazy stuff,
and this is no different. So if you want, kind of
the best of the best, definitely scoop these up. So next up, I've actually had
pretty decent battery life with my iPhone 10, but if
you find yourself needing just a little bit more
at the end of the day, this is the case you gotta check out. It is priced extremely well, $39. But on top of that, it is
packing a ton of power, 6000mAh. What's really nice with this is you have a lightning
connector towards the bottom to charge your phone and
the case at the same time, so you don't need to carry a second cable. The absolute only
complaint I have with this, if you look closely, there's
actually no lip protection. So if you set this phone
down, it is exposed as hell. So just be careful if you pick this up. It is not gonna give you the
best front facing protection. Aside from that aesthetically, you know, it's a very basic phone case. But it's gonna do what
it says it's gonna do. Extend the battery life of your iPhone 10. Now big thanks to 23andMe for
sponsoring today's gift guide. And for those curious, the name 23andMe comes from the fact the human DNA is organized
into 23 different chromosomes. So with the holidays
around, If you wanna dive a little deeper into your chromosomes to learn about your family, your ancestry, you can see how your DNA
not only affects your looks, your taste preferences,
and even how you sleep. Again, 23andMe is running
a special discount for the holidays, so if
you want to scoop up a kit, find out where you're from,
and support the channel, head over to 23andme.com/jonathanmorrison, Which is linked below. So last up, we're
talking about headphones, but maybe you wanna listen
to your music out loud. And that is where a good Bluetooth
speaker comes in to play. This is the Bose SoundLink Micro. And even though it's small, it's compact, there's some serious power inside. On the back, you have this nice, little detachable strap right there, so if you wanna lock it down
to your pants, your backpack, Rich, you can do that as well. It's rugged, it's durable. Got a little dust but it
looks like we're good. I probably should've done the
sound test before we do that, but I guess we'll get to that now. So clearly, it is Rich approved. Big shout out to Emancipator,
he just dropped a new album, which is amazing, definitely check it out. Also, what I really like
with this is the fact that they're linked together. So you can control it via your iPhone, it's gonna affect the
speaker, and vise versa. Power that up. So anytime you have that
kind of convenience, it is always welcome. And on top of that, it
looks great, it's rugged, it's water resistant, it's got
a pretty solid battery life. And the most important thing
is that it sounds good. So aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed this gift guide. Definitely let me know what your favorite piece of tech was,
featured in this video. And if you haven't yet, definitely subscribe for
more gift guides yet to come. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Hey, guys, Jonathan here. It is 2017 and this is the
cheapest iPad you can get and this is the most expensive. Specifically, what's
sparked this comparison is Apple's brand new iPad
which is simply dubbed iPad. It effectively replaces the iPad Air 2 and starts out at 329 bucks. That's gonna get you 32 gigs of storage, a 9.7 inch display, and conversely, if you wanted to max this sucker out, you could configure it up
to 128 gigabytes of storage and that's gonna run you
1,836 George Washingtons and, yes, I am talking about quarters. On the other end of the spectrum, the most expensive iPad
you could buy right now is the 12.9 inch iPad Pro
which is gonna run you 1,129 bucks and cue the
I could build a custom water-cooled, overclocked,
SLI-ed or potentially crossfired, if you like red over green, custom sleeve, RGB-would-look-tight-with-a-curved-LED
gaming PC comment, let's go. With that expensive-ass iPad, that's gonna get you 256
gigabytes of storage, that sweet, sweet celery
data and, of course, the ridiculously large 12.9 inch display. Seriously, every time I
forget the 12.9 inch iPad Pro exists, I pick it up
again and I am blown away with how over-sized and
bonkers this thing is. Reversing things, if
you wanted to strip down the 12.9 inch iPad Pro,
that's gonna start out at 799 bucks and if you want to opt for the 9.7 inch model
that's gonna save you an additional 200 bucks. So, with the entry-level
iPad and the iPad pro, there are some pretty
substantial difference. First and foremost with the iPad Pro and specifically the 12.9 iPad Pro, you are getting a much higher resolution of 2732 x 2048. Whereas the 9.7 inch iPad
Pro and entry-level iPad both have a resolution of 2048 x 1536. One really important point worth mention is even though the 9.7 inch iPad Pro and the entry-level iPad share
the exact same resolution, the actual display quality
is far from the same. The iPad Pro is much nicer. There's better colors,
better viewing angles, and the biggest thing
that stands out to me with the entry-level iPad
is how thick that glass on the display is and not in the good way. If you've never used an iPad, you may not notice it's
there but if you're coming from an iPad Air 2 or iPad
Pro, it is super noticeable. The best way I could describe it, it almost feels like the
entry-level iPad screen is sunken in, where, if
you're looking at the iPad Pro or even iPad Air 2, for example, the display is right there
smack in front of you. Now, performance-wise, inside
the iPad is Apple's A9 chip. Whereas, with the iPad
Pro both the 9.7 inch and 12.9 inch models, that
features Apple's A9X chip. But, surprisingly, there
really wasn't that big of a gap between the two. They perform pretty similarly
and that kind of tells me the iPad Pro is in dire need
of an upgrade, Tim Cook. Next, another big
difference between the two is the Apple Pencil. Specifically, what I mean is just support to use the damn thing. I know a lot of people poke
fun of the Apple Pencil but, jokes aside, it is really useful. If that was something that enticed you and kind of pushed you
towards wanting and iPad, it will not work on the entry-level iPad. You're gonna have to step up to iPad Pro. A huge difference between
the two is stereo speakers. And being exact, there are
two sets of stereo speakers on the iPad Pro, one on the
top and then one on the bottom. Whereas, with the iPad
non-Pro there is a single set of stereo speakers towards the bottom. As far as how that affects sound quality, I have the single stereo
speaker iPad on the left and the dual stereo speaker
iPad Pro on the right. We're gonna start out with the iPad ("Native Son Prequel" by Gramatik) Pausing it for a second,
I hear a much bigger and fuller sound here on the iPad Pro. Where I think it's gonna make
and even bigger difference, though, is when you flip
things into landscape mode. Especially when you're
holding it like this watching a movie. So, let's go ahead and flip it this way. The one thing you should notice is whether I move the
microphone to the right or the left hand side, you're
gonna get a pretty consistent sound across the board
because of the dual sets of stereo speakers. Whereas, with this iPad, it's
gonna be kind of noticeable in one side spot over the other. ("Native Son Prequel" by Gramatik) It's not so much... Damn, dude, what'd they do to your hair? - They helped me out, man. They gave me the Jon fade. - You got that damn Dick and Jane cut. It's not that the speakers
on this iPad sound bad, it's just that these
speakers sound really good. As far as tablet speakers go, the iPad Pro is pretty much the best
in the game right now and you can see why. Next, another feature that is missing on the non-Pro iPad is
the smart connector, which really isn't that big of a deal. Right now, it really comes down to adding a smart keyboard to your
iPad with the iPad Pro. Logitech did recently
just release a pretty cool base for it that will charge your iPad Pro through the smart connector. What that allows you
to do is, essentially, connect it magnetically
and not fuss around with sticking in a lightning port. As far as similarities go,
both have a headphone jack which is a little interesting to me because the new iPad was
released after the iPhone 7 and that leaves the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as the only Apple products
without a headphone jack. It's kind of interesting to see that Apple does not seem to apply that
approach to the iPad line. Both feature Bluetooth 4.2. Both feature touch ID and I thought that was cool because if you
wanted a fingerprint reader on your iPad, but could only
go for the cheaper option, you still have it there. But where things get a little strange and a little weird is
both of these feature pretty much the exact
same camera hardware. There is a pretty
substantial price difference between the two but both
share the exact same eight megapickle rear shooter that's gonna shoot 1080p
video, 30 frames a second, or 720p video up to 120 frames a second. As far the front-facing cameras go, you get a measly 1.2 megapickles on both the 12.9 inch iPad Pro
and the entry-level iPad. But, in classic
scratch-your-head Apple fashion, the 9.7 inch iPad Pro
features a much better camera than both of these. With the 9.7 inch iPad Pro, you are getting a 12
megapickle rear shooter, 4K video, 1080p video up
to 60 frames per second, and 720p slow motion video
up to 240 frames a second. We know the camera hardware
should be pretty much the same, but I want to put it to the test and see exactly if that is the case. We're gonna start out
with the 329 dollar iPad. Ralphy is here. Damn, that crop, though. Initially, so far that's not looking too hot. - So you get my cut? - [Jon] I mean, the video's not bad. Ralphy's hair, though. (laughing) Man, you look like a baby rat, dude. - Hey, man, you ever seen baby rat? - Yeah, I'm looking at one. Flipping things around. I'm sure I look ridiculous
out here in public. Go ahead and take a still. Rich, give me your best smile, buddy. Rich, give me a smile, man. Normally, I look like
a crazy person out here on the street taking
pictures of tech and stuff. I'm gonna look even crazier
taking pictures with a iPad. Bam! iPad down, iPad Pro up next. This thing is ridiculous. Launch the iPad. I will say, it is a sweet viewfinder. I'm not sure if it's the
display or what it is, but, Ralphy looks a little better here. - [Ralphie] The color's better, man. - Color looks better, the cut
don't look better, though. Flipping things. My face is so big. Video time. It's so nuts, man. Oh, man this crop is nuts. Yeah, I'm not sure if it's the display that makes me think it looks better or the actual video
quality on here is better. You guys let me know with
a comment down below. Back to the photo in the street mode. Car is coming, too, I'm 'bout to die. (suspenseful music) - [Ralphy] Jon, no! (happy music) Rich, give me that sweet slo-mo. (laughing) Hold on, man, we need
one for the iPad Pro. - Yes. - Actually, upon second look, with things gettin' a little darker and not so bright on the screen. I'm pretty sure the cameras on both the iPad entry-level
model and the iPad Pro, at least the 12.9 inch
model are pretty close. You guys let me know
with a comment down below on what you think. So, after that disaster, I'm not sure how much
camera specs matter to you with and iPad but if they
do, the 9.7 inch iPad Pro is a much better buy. Really, what it comes down
to is the 9.7 inch iPad Pro was released after the 12.9 inch model. That debuted all the way
back in November of 2015. Then came out the 9.7 inch
model in March of 2016. Fast forward just a
little over a year later and here we are with the new iPad. Also, a strange fact, is
you are a rose gold fan, you can only get that color
on the 9.7 inch iPad Pro. It is not available on the 12.9 inch model or the new iPad that was just released, which is kinda weird. So, what this video taught
me is that the 12.9 inch iPad Pro is kind of seriously outdated. If you can, I would hold
off until they updated it. If you absolutely needed
to have an iPad Pro and needed that Pencil support, the 9.7 inch model is much a better value. Conversely, if you
needed to save some cash, the entry-level iPad
actually is pretty good. The display isn't the best in the world. But, overall, as an entire package, for 329 bucks, it is really solid. Lastly, shout out to Mr. JayzTwoCent for trusting me enough to run camera on his crazy Terry Crews gaming PC build. I may have screwed things up. Definitely check that video
out for yourself here. Tell him Jon sent you. It got me thinking, a Terry
Crews dream desk would be kind of amazing. Drop a like if you agree and hit me and Terry up on Twitter if that's something you want to see. (beep) Red over green. Ooh, I'm gonna (bleep) bring
out the damn wolves, man. Sons of ramarchy. (laughing) Nah, you look like a damn baby rat. Look at that scalp (laughing). - (Yells) Jon, it's ripe, dude! 
- So Apple just unveiled
their brand new Siri-enabled speaker aka HomePod but
during the announcement, I couldn't help but think to myself, "Didn't they already do this?" (upbeat music) This is Apple's first home
audio device, the iPod Hi-Fi. Announced in 2006 by Steve Jobs, the Hi-Fi was a speaker system with
a built-in dock designed for iPods using what was then
the cutting edge technology of its time, 30-pin. Now looks-wise, this was built to match Apple's design aesthetic which back then was mostly gloss-white. Now because the Hi-Fi
was designed for iPods, it came with every adapter
you would need to connect but on the back, there
was also a aux input so just in case you want to be a rebel, you could also connect you Zune. (menacing music) What kind of made the iPod
Hi-Fi unique though, was yes, you could plug it into a wall to power it up just like the HomePod, but... Unlike the HomePod, the iPod
Hi-Fi had built-in handles and the reason why it had
these, you could actually also power this through D batteries, so Apple at the time must've
had some crazy vision of people rocking this outside in public. (hip-hop beat) (record scratching) Now, when comparing the
iPod Hi-Fi against the now current HomePod,
things get a little crazy. First, the announcements
were scary-similar. They stressed audio quality - A ported base reflex design
so you can see the ports coming right out the front. We get great base out of this
thing and it doesn't distort when you crank it up. - That's automatic base
equilization in dynamic software modeling so as we turn the volume up, it's free from distortion. - And in classic Apple
fashion, how current products aren't meeting people's needs. - But the problem with
these products is that none of them really offer
home stereo quality. - Others have worked
to make smart speakers that you can talk to but
they don't sound so great when you listen music. - Where it gets super crazy
though, and I kid you not, the iPod Hi-Fi was released
at the exact same price as the current HomePod: $349. - Really more in the iPod
economy space at $349. - The HomePod is gonna be priced for $349. - So, it's pretty clear the
iPod Hi-Fi and the HomePod have a ton in common and
that got me thinking: could I turn the original
iPod Hi-Fi into a HomePod? Now, fair warning, this
is in no way practical and anyone in their right
mind should not try this but for science, let's do it. So, clearly hooking up
something like an Echo Dot to an external speaker is the simplest and most practical way to do things but we are not looking for practical. So, the goal here is to get Siri working through the iPod Hi-Fi and
the first thing I tried was this very cheap, inexpensive
Bluetooth 30-pin adapter. I thought it would look cool,
I thought it would match this and kind of keep that 30-pin vibes going. The problem is though,
which you will see shortly after I connect and listen to this beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful sound. (beep) That's quality. Music will play through the iPod Hi-Fi but if you notice, "Hey
Siri, tell me a joke." (phone beeping) - Jonathon, get serious. (chuckling) (deep inhale and sigh) So, the problem was not
the joke, it was the fact that the audio came through
the phone and not the speaker but I have one more back up plan: the Mpow right-angle adapter. I think that aux connector here is gonna help bring this home...pod. (bleep) (laugh and sigh) Oh well, we'll keep that. So, out is this 30-pin disaster... (clattering to the ground) ...in is the Mpow. Hey Siri, tell me another joke. (phone beeping) - I can't. I always forget the punch line. - It works! It's kind of loud, whoops. (popping sound) Is it supposed to pop? Hey Siri, tell me another joke. (phone beeping) - Jonathon, I don't really know
any good jokes, none in fact - So, it kind of sounds like
this, punch me in the stomach, but sounds definitely came through this. It's not the smoothest or
the easiest way but we got Hey Siri working through the iPod Hi-Fi. Now, it is time for the music test. Hey Siri, play Everyday Bro. I'm kidding! - No! (loud bang) Ahh! - Siri jokes are one thing
but music is another. Hey Siri, play Whitney Myer "I'm the One". ♫ Yeah you're looking at the
truth, the money never lie no ♫ I'm the one yeah, I'm the one - Volume works ♫ Early mornin in the dawn,
know you wanna ride now ♫ I'm the one yeah - Oh it gets loud ♫ I'm the one yeah, I'm the one yeah! ♫ And you're sick of all
those other imitators ♫ Don't let the only
real one intimidate ya ♫ See you watchin,
don't run outta time now ♫ I'm the one yeah, I'm the one yeah! ♫ Shorty's like a melody in
my head that I can't keep out ♫ Got me singing like,
na-na-na-na everyday, ♫ It's like my iPod's
stuck on replay, replay ♫ Got me singing like - That's really, really, really,
really, really, really loud So, that was about 60% volume. Honestly, I'm a little
scared to turn this to a 100. It might blow my ears right off. It was way, way louder
than I thought it would be and it also sounded better
than I assumed it would be, especially for a product that
was announced way back in 2006 and quickly discontinued in
2007 so is this practical? Absolutely not but what do I know. Maybe you happen to have one
of these iPod Hi-Fis laying around your homes, I am
looking at you, DetroitBORG. Now, all you gotta do is add
a very simple, inexpensive Bluetooth adapter and you
can turn your iPod Hi-Fi into a HomePod...kinda. - Yeah I did that (laughing) 
- Yo, guys. Jonathan here, and welcome to
the $1,500 smart room upgrade, where the idea is to hit a certain budget and find not only tech, but other elements where there's design,
accessories, furniture, and blend those together to create the best possible room setup. Plus, with each of these
episodes, I want to give one of you a chance to make
some upgrades yourselves. And if you're down with that, make sure you drop a like down below. Now, whether it's a
smart room, smart home, smart apartment, the coolest
tech on the plant means nothing if your wifi is bottlenecking you. So kicking off the episode
is a Linksys Velop. And huge shoutout to Amazon
for sending this out and sponsoring this setup. So the Velop is the
super attractive router that blends performance with aesthetic. And if your household is
packed full of electronics with people fighting over wifi, this could save your family. Now in this case, since
we are in a single room, one of these is gonna work perfectly. But in the instance where
you have a larger apartment, or maybe home, you can
actually get this in a pack of up to three and spread them out evenly, so you can get the fastest possible wifi across your home. Now the instance where you
are using more than one of these, what's awesome is they work in a mesh wifi configuration. What that means, is whether
it's one, two, or three, they're gonna perform and
function as a singular network. That way you're not worrying
about Velop one, Velop two, Velop three, multiple
passwords, losing your mind. It's one, and that keeps things simple. Now one of these is gonna
give you 2,000 square feet of coverage. That's an easy way to figure out how many of these you would need to
cover your room or house. You double that and it's
gonna give you 4,000, and if you triple them, you're getting a whopping
6,000 square feet of coverage. Now, design-wise, this thing
is surprisingly compact, compared to other options out there. What's cool is, the antenna is actually
placed towards the top, which is gonna give you better coverage, and it does a fantastic
job at minimizing cables, which is gonna prevent you
from having that rats' nest. So overall, it looks
great, it performs great, there's a really cool companion app to give you more flexibility and control. And if you're looking for a wifi upgrade, this might be your guy, or girl, depending on how you look at an inanimate object. So next up, this is definitely
one of the more outside of the box ideas I've
tried to put together. The intent her was a
kick back and relax spot. So what I have behind me
is a pair of Hektar lamps from IKEA, which definitely have that life-size Pixar action. But what makes the setup
unique, is inside the lamps, I threw a Sengled Pulse LED kit, which actually have speakers
inside the light bulbs. Now what's awesome is these lights and speakers
will actually sync together, and play music back in stereo, which creates this really
cool immersive setup. So what I'm gonna do, is
actually hop into Spotify, and play some music through these guys. Shout out to Ed Sheeran for
dropping some great music. (soulful music) So it is definitely a mind trip hearing light bulbs fire
music down at you in stereo, but it's a really cool way to chill out and kind of get lost in your own world. I will say though, if you consider yourelf to be an audiophile or are used to really high-end systems, you're probably not going to like this, But if you're looking for
something different, unique, this setup is really cool. So next up is for anyone
looking to add some extra pixels in their life. Behind me is the LG43UH6100,
which is a 43-inch 4K TV for just about 500 bucks. Now what's awesome is this
is using an IPS panel. So you're getting great
colors, great viewing angles, and in terms of entry-level price 4K TVs, this is definitely one of the
better options out right now. What I particularly
like about this though, is LG's Web OS interface, which
is one of the simplest ways to navigate through a TV. Some of them out there make
you want to smash your face with the remote, but this is simple. There's built-in Netflix,
built-in Hulu, built-in YouTube, so you can watch videos
like this in crispy 4K, without buying anything externally. The picture quality
combined with the colors, the price, and the
interface, make this a really enticing upgrade, if you're looking to ditch your potato TV. Now below that is the
Amazon basics TV sound bar, which is one of the
best inexpensive options to upgrade your sound. While TV speakers are
getting better and better, I always personally like
to use either a sound bar or a dedicated speakers while watching, because it really enhances
the overall experience. So this guy is 31 inches
in length and optimized to be used with TVs 42 inches or less. In this case, we are using a 43-inch TV because thug life. So if you're one of those people out there who follows the rules and
instructions down to the T, this might not be the setup for you, but you can see, side-by-side, they actually pair really well together. On top of being a sound bar for your TV, there's also built-in Bluetooth, and that's cool, because you
can also connect your phone, or your tablet, and
stream music from there. So with other very similar
sound bars out there, priced upwards of 100 to
200 bucks, this thing, for 70 bucks, is a steal. Now, what I have the TV
and sound bar housed on, is the IKEA Gettorp. Not sure if I'm
pronouncing that correctly, but this is a really
great looking TV stand that is priced around 100 bucks. What I like about this is
how it blends both aluminum and glass. It's clean, and kind
of just screams classy. So last up is the Amazon Tap. You guys have seen me cover the Echo, the Echo Dot, and this brings
you Alexa functionality but in a portable Bluetooth package. Now it's a little different in the sense that you're gonna verbally
say out loud the name, I'm not gonna say it
to trigger your device. You actually press the
microphone button here, (speaker dings) "Add a giant gummy bear to my cart." (speaker dings) "Okay, I've added giant gummy bear. Visit your cart to check out." On top of that beyond
the Alexa functionality, this is actually a really
solid Bluetooth speaker. (rock music) It's got great sound quality. It gets really loud, and if you haven't yet
added a Bluetooth speaker and Alexa into your life,
this is a great one-two punch. Now as far as those smart
room upgrades for your guys, I'm giving away four
$250 Amazon gift cards. And you guys can check out the details on how to win down below. Aside from that, hopefully
you enjoyed the video. If you did and you're not subscribed yet, maybe hit that button here,
and if you love setup videos, you're going to love this desk setup. This Jonathan, and I will
catch you guys later. 
- Yo, guys, Jonathan here, and if you guys make videos, and more specifically YouTube videos, you should probably watch this. One of the questions I get
on a super frequent basis is what is your audio setup? What microphone do you use,
what recorder do you use, and honestly, for the past
year, year-and-a-half, I have been super reluctant
to answer that question. And that is because the recorder I use is 3,328 bucks. This is the Sound Devices 633 Recorder, which is an incredible piece of hardware. And if you've never
heard of Sound Devices, they're pretty much the industry standard as far as audio, and film and tv. They've used Sound Devices in La La Land, Breaking Bad, Game of
Thrones, Austin Evans, and this is what I've
used to record pretty much every one of my videos for
the past year-and-a-half. Now a couple of disclaimers. The MixPre-3 and MixPre-6
are in no way, shape, or form intended to replace something like a 633, and by all means, if you can
pick something like a 633 up, it is an amazing piece of hardware, world class pre-amps and there is a reason why they use it on high-end productions. For me, it's been worth
every single penny, but at the end of the day, not everyone can afford to
drop three grand on a recorder. And that is where the MixPre-3
and MixPre-6 come into play. Also because the internet Sound Devices did not pay me for this video, in fact, I actually bought
this with my own money, they were, however, kind enough to give me an exclusive first look
at pre-production models of MixPre-3 and MixPre-6. But I just wanted to clarify
they're not paying me. I just really, really like their stuff. So the audio you're hearing right now is being recorded into the MixPre-3 that's going to an SD card, then I'm syncing the audio
to the video externally within Final Cut Pro 10. Now if you're brand new to external audio, I totally understand. Syncing audio might sound super scary, but I promise you, it is actually much easier
than you might expect. For me, because I use Final Cut Pro 10, it is literally as simple
as selecting the audio file, selecting the video file,
selecting synchronize, and bam, it automatically
stitches them together. Now for reference, this is
what terrible scratch audio on the camera sounds like and I am sorry for what
I am doing to your ears, but if we jump back to the external audio, you can see exactly how
important great quality audio is. Now as far as the microphone
I'm using right now, this is the Sennheiser 416, which is a little pricey
at around 1,000 bucks, but again, like the 633,
it is industry standard. If you can afford it,
it is worth every penny. On the other hand, if you need
something more affordable, Sennheiser has their MKE 600 microphone, which is only around 330 bucks. And if you pair that with the MixPre-3, that is arguably the
best possible audio setup you can get on YouTube
for under 1,000 bucks. Now as far as the difference
between the MixPre-3 and MixPre-6, in a nut shell, one is gonna get you more inputs and more tracks to record to. The MixPre-3 is a three
input, five track recorder, whereas the MixPre-6 is a six
input, eight track recorder. And for the complete differences
and all those juicy specs, I will post a link down below. Now for me, I tend to
gravitate towards the MixPre-3, simply because of how
small and compact it is. When you're traveling,
especially with gear, space and weight adds up very quickly. So anything I can save is welcome. And I am super stoked to be
able to take this on the road and capture high-quality audio. Now a few things that I
really like about these, is one, they include
one-quarter, 20-threading, so you can mount these
directly to your camera or to your tripod. Two, you have a ton of flexibility in terms of powering these guys. You can power them through AA batteries, Sony L-series batteries, or the thing I wanna give Sound Devices a giant high-five for, is the inclusion of USB-C. Not only can you power
these through USB-C, you can transfer files
directly off the device all without ever pulling the SD card slot, which is super handy, especially
if you use the new MacBook Pro, cuz you don't need a dongle or an adapter. And on top of all that, this also doubles as a super
high-quality USB interface, which makes this great
not only for YouTubers, but podcasters and musicians. Now another really cool feature with these is the flexibility you have to run these either in basic mode or advanced mode. So if you're familiar with audio, you wanna tweak and customize
to your heart's content, you can do that. But at the same time, maybe you just want something simple where you don't have to think about it, you just want to plug in your microphone and get great audio. You can also do that, too. Keeping the list of
awesome things rolling, there is also Bluetooth connectivity with the MixPre-3 and the MixPre-6. And what that means is not
only can you monitor your audio through your phone or your tablet, you can adjust gain,
hit record, start, stop. It is awesome. Now if you don't wanna use
your phone or your tablet, the devices themselves are controlled through a super clean,
intuitive, touch interface, which adds pretty much
everything I could possibly want in a recorder. Honestly, I think the only thing I could possible complain about
is the fact that you have to remove the batteries to
access the SD card slot, but again, like I said, you can theoretically transfer
those files through USB-C, which would make this a non-factor. At the end of the day though, the video, or rather, the
audio, should speak for itself. And if you guys think it sounds good, make sure you drop a like down below. And if you're a YouTuber out there, who is constantly striving
for the best possible quality, you can quote me, this is the best recorder
for the money period. 
- Hey you guys, Jonathan here, and I am really really excited for what is inside this box. The Nike hyperadapt 1.0 blends tech with shoes. Got a little of that
Back to the Future action going on with something you could actually wear and I gotta say, this may be one of the biggest boxes I've ever opened. So, undoubtedly, I would assume we got some box-ception going on. Within this brown box is
probably a cooler box. So wrap pop! Oooh. Ever had just like a box pop like Dr. Fuji impactful impaction. Back to its flap one. Flap two. Man, this is the real deal - [Man] Aaaaugh! - I have never seen a shoebox this big. That is a fact. And I'm willing to bet, popping this open is gonna be mighty sweet. Holy crap! - You are creepy as sh - So here is the box. We're gonna slide it open. Is it a pop or a slide? - Whoo. Dang that's clean. Something good is on the
other side of this box. And we're about to experience it. Holy moly! So these are actually the white on white, which are clean! Oh, that smells like fresh shoes. The good news with these, though is unlike with Nike
Mags where you could not purchase them, you only could obtain them through a raffle, these you
can actually pick up and buy. The bad news is they're extremely limited and they're also a
little on the pricey side clocking in at just over 700 bucks. Now with that, I am very fortunate and thankful to get to
check these out early but with the holidays
and everything going on I thought it would be a cooler idea to give my pair away to you guys. I wouldn't smash that light button if you were excited for that. Taking a look at everything else that's inside the box,
it is pretty simple. We have the second shoe,
this being the right. This being the left. Smells like you just
walked into Foot Locker. - Okay, I'm going to the
mall and going upstairs probably on the second floor. Yeah! - The other immediate
thing that stands out to me with these is how light they are because it's not something you may normally expect from picking these up. You might think because
they're self-lacing shoes there's a lot of heavy tech inside, but they're actually really light. The other really interesting thing that stands out is the laces. They got this really
soft mesh thing going on but they disappear into the shoe, so you are not gonna see no bunny ears. Also, that light is freaking awesome. So with this that's actually gonna be your battery indicator. What I really like about these though is the button placement because at first glance, you would have no idea they're there. There are two diamonds that kinda blend into the design but
those actually control how you tighten them
and how you loosen them. So up top right here on this diamond (whining) it's gonna tighten things
up and the one below that (whining) loosens everything. Obviously, the effect is gonna be more drastic on your shoes so with that I think it is time to try them on. Now, normally if I said I was gonna hop up on this table
and try these shoes on, that might sound like a strange and potentially bad idea, but if you flash back to last year, totally normal. Ho, man these are comfortable. (whining) damn, these are way cooler
than the $20 LED shoes. Now because there is
tech inside these shoes, you will need to charge them, but Nike includes a pretty slick USB charging solution that
attaches magnetically. For a full charge it should take around two hours, but the good news is that charge will easily last you two week and probably more. On top of that, that sweet LED light that we were looking at earlier will also let you know
how your battery is doing, so right now that it's in blue, things are nice and healthy, but if the battery were to drop it would then change to yellow and finally, red. Like I mentioned, these
are extremely comfortable, which you would hope for for the price, but I think the more important thing is they feel like normal shoes and nothing is getting in the way. Like the hyperadapt name implies, the idea with this is to be able to change things and to adapt on the fly. So maybe you're running
and you wanted your shoes just a little bit tighter for
that extra bit of support. Instead of untying your shoes and relacing them, you can now do that with a press of a button. (grunts) Ahhh. So, I totally understand that these are not your everyday pair of shoes. The average person is not gonna go drop 700 bucks, but I'm almost looking at these as a glimpse into the future. The immediate thing that went into my mind is how awesome these
would be at the airport. The worst pair of shoes you could bring to the airport are a pair
of old school chucks. Holy crap, those take forever to take off. But on the serious side, you almost have to look at these as a 1.0, the completely new product, which they are to an extent, the hyperadapt 1.0's. Getting nerdy for a second, things like solid stage arrived a couple years ago cost just as much as these shoes and then some. Fast forward to a couple years later. Prices have dropped hundreds
and hundreds of dollars. We can pick them up on the cheap. So, hopefully in a couple of years, these become more of the norm and less of a rarity and I know
the initial reaction might be I don't need self-lacing shoes. Those are for lazy people. But like I talked about before, for a second let's just try and enjoy and appreciate cool technology. These may not be the norm now, and you may not need
them, but on the flip side of that, maybe someone has arthritis in their hands, and tying
their shoes is an obstacle. In a couple of years when these come down, and they're the normal prices, that's gonna help alleviate that. Now, aside from that, hopefully, you guys enjoyed the video. Like I said, I'm giving my pair away and the bonus is, I am not
making you wait for that. I'm actually teaming up with Marques, AKA MKBHD, where he is
also giving away his pair. Ties to keg, we are turning
these into tech packages where you get the shoes,
our favorite backpack, a smart phone of choice and a monster external battery bank. For a chance to enter, all you gotta do is be subscribed here on TLD, so make sure to do that if you haven't yet, and for the second chance at the second pair of hyperadapts and those phones, head over to Marques' channel and video which is linked here. I have enjoyed my really
short time with the adapt. They are awesome, but I
thought it would be cool to give 'em away to you guys. Thank you for the support. I love you and I will
catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here
coming at you from London. Shout out to Nick Crompton. The reason I'm here, is I got a chance to check out the brand new Nokia, or should I say, Nah-kia 8. Huge shout out to Nokia Mobile for sponsoring my trip out here. It's been pretty incredible. Got a chance to check
out the YouTube space here in London, which is amazing. Overall, it's just been
a really cool experience. With that trip to London comes an unboxing of the brand new Nokia 8. This is polished copper. It's pretty, it's shiny, and apparently it was constructed from a
single piece of aluminium. As far as what else comes in the box, we have the power brick
this time of the UK flavor. Headphones, which does of course, mean there is a headphone jack. And last, but not least,
the USBC charging cable. I don't know about you,
but I love me some USBC. For those who are watching
right now and thinking, "Man, that looks pretty cool. "I kind of want one." I've actually teamed up with Nokia Mobile to give one of these away to you. Details on how you can win are down below. Thumbs up are not required,
but they are much appreciated. With Nokia 8, I wanted to break it down into five things that you
should know before buying. It is available for pre-order now, but just in case you
wanna learn a little more, sit back, relax, and we will talk it out. The first think I wanna talk about is that this phone is unassumingly powerful. On the outside, yeah,
it is a pretty phone. But on the inside it's packing
a Snapdragon 835 processor. Something unique with
Nokia 8, is on the inside there is a copper heat pipe
running through the phone. You'd probably never guess
that just by looking at it, but they are paying homage
to the PC Master Race, bringing more efficient
cooling to a smartphone. That in turn should hopefully
prevent bottle-necking and overall, give you that
buttery smooth performance. You have a 5.3 QHD display,
and in terms of resolution, that is 2560 by 1440 and
that's nothing special, but what's kinda crazy is this is a ridiculously bright screen. I guarantee you, if you were
inside, you will probably never need to have your screen
that bright on the Nokia 8. If you go outside a lot,
maybe you're in the sun and have a hard time seeing your screen, this might be a pretty
cool option to pick up. Next up at number two, is there are 13 megapixel
cameras everywhere. Everywhere. What I mean by that is
you of course you have your dual 13 megapixel sensors
on the back of the phone, but there's also a 13 megapixel camera on the front of the phone. The reason for that is
Nokia's dual-sight technology, which essentially allows
you to use both the front and rear-facing camera simultaneously. But because they both have
that sweet megapixel 13 sensor, you are not sacrificing any quality. This will work whether you're
taking a photo or a video. So, this is testing out
the dual-sight camera. I just found a cat. Hey, little buddy. (whistles) Come here, cat. Hey! Come here! There he goes. The next thing I'm gonna talk about most likely will excite you. Not only is Nokia 8 running
Android 7.1.1 Nougat, it is pretty much a pure
stock Android experience. From what I've heard, Nokia is promising lightning fast updates and I
might get in trouble for this 'cause I'm not sure if it's confirmed, but I'm pretty sure I heard this is one of the fastest ways you
can get to Android O. Next up at number four, with the Nokia 8, you're gonna be able to capture some really, really good audio. Packed inside this guy is
Nokia's Ozo audio technology, which is crazy expensive and
probably way too complicated to explain thoroughly here. In a nutshell, there are three microphones that capture 360 degree audio. I'm gonna try to test
out a couple of things. One, the Ozo 360 degree audio. Of course, you're not gonna
be able to hear it back the same way I would
through the phone itself, but to simulate that, I'm
gonna walk around the phone. As of now, I am directly
in front of the phone. I'm gonna circle back. I'm also curious to see how
it does with the environment. There's a plane above me. The wind is pretty loud. You should here some footsteps. Let me know what you
think of the video quality and audio quality with
a comment down below. On top of the 360 degree
audio, you're also of course getting high-quality capture. If you're someone who's taking your phone to a concert or to an event,
you got home and realized, "That sounds like either it was exploding "or taken under water," this is a really cool option to check out. Last but not least, the
Nokia 8 has pretty much every possible port you could ask for. You of course have USBC,
which again I love. That in turn give you Quick Charge 3.0 For those curious, packed inside this is a 3090 million amp hour battery. From there, again, you
have a headphone jack, so for those that hold their
wired headphones near and dear, this has you covered. You have micro SD card expansion. Again, from the get-go,
you have pretty solid storage capacities out of the box. If you need that extra storage, this has you covered as well. Overall, while Nokia 8
might not have the craziest in it's bezels or an extra tall display, there are a lot of things
to like about this phone. It is a beautiful phone and one thing that I really appreciate
is the lack of camera hump. Those dual cameras pretty
much sit there flush and it is very, very pleasing to look at. Looking pretty is one thing,
but inside those cameras there's Zeiss optics, and
for those that know Zeiss as far as cameras go, you
know that it's quality. Again, Nokia is not claiming
to have the craziest or most futuristic design out there, but across the board, it
is a damn solid phone. Aside from that, hopefully
you guys enjoyed the video. If you did, I would love to
hear what your favorite thing about the Nokia 8 is. Huge shout out to Nokia Mobile again for sponsoring my trip out here to London to check out the phone. It has been incredible. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (techno music) 
- Face ID, (beep) this mighty (beep). Once you had a plastic surgery, you won't be able to unlock
this mother (beep) I (beep) X. - What? - Yo guys, Jonathan here,
with a couple familiar faces, Dave2D, not sure if you
need an introduction. - I mean, depends who you ask. - The set might look familiar,
I'm out in Canada right now. - Toronto, specifically Toronto. - It's cold, but today, is kinda related to iPhone X,
but also related to Pixel 2. There's been a lot of,
kinda crazy feedback, with those two phones. So we're gonna do something
interesting, something fun. We're gonna read some comments off of all three of our videos, centered around the Pixel
2, and the iPhone X. Dave-- - Let me ask you something, are they mean, like, mean in the way that
they're being mean to us, or mean in the way that they're
talking about the devices? - They're a little--
- Little bit of both. - Little bit of both.
- Okay. - I'm gonna kick it off with Dave. - This video, sucks. The Pixel 2 XL screen
burns in matter of weeks, - Oh, yeah. I heard about that. - And you say that it is a
common thing with OLED displays. My Samsung S5 display-- - That's right.
- Burned after two years, that is okay, but not a few weeks. - Dave, Dave!
- Why does the video suck? Alright, not every single OLED
panel exhibits this burn-in, but such a big portion of them exhibit it, and people don't even recognize that their phones are burning in. I bet if you looked at
the majority of phones, they'd have it. Of the older phones. - You're already looking at
me, what do you want me-- - I'm looking at you for, you guys should be nodding in approval. - I don't know, I mean, listen, a lot of people have been all over the screen on that device. People are going heavy at that screen. At least on social media, my Twitter, someone's got problems with
that screen every five minutes. - (laughs) It's still a piece of (beep), crappy, ugly, (laughs), crappy, ugly looking fatty iPhone. (Jonathan and Dave laughing) - It's like, picture the person, writing this.
- It's a fatty iPhone. It's a fatty iPhone.
- What is this guy-- It's still a piece of (beep), crappy, ugly looking
fatty iPhone (laughs), put it into the sky
and you'll see yourself how ugly the camera is. With love, Pixel 2. - Man, it's weird. You kinda sound like Kermit the Frog, fair, every time I hear him, I'm
going to think about that. Every time he hears
Kermit the Frog, or me? - You sell out piece of
(beep), it's a (beep) phone. How much is Google paying you? (Jonathan laughing) - (beep) neck beard. (Dave laughing loudly) This comes from Guts. - That's all it is?
- Yeah. - From YouTube user, Guts. - I mean, he had, like, he
was grammatically correct. He got a capital F and a period. - Which, you know what, that adds to it and I'm giving him points for that. - Yeah. - I'm giving him points for accuracy. The funny thing is, with an insult, punctuation being correct,
I feel is important. - For sure.
- It adds a layer of aggressiveness to it, when you see the period on only two words, it's like, whoa, dude is mad. - That's right, it's very--
- You know what I mean? - 'Cause it was like a (finger thudding). - Yeah.
- Yeah! Like the mic drop. - Two words and a period.
- It's the period. (all laughing) - Holy (beep), are you using eyeliner? - Gay! - But like look at the punctuation here.
- Right? - Two exclamation points.
- She's intense. All caps on (beep), no cap on holy, three question marks on eyeliner, triple A, triple Y. - I've gotten that question a lot. - Do you use eyeliner? - I don't. - You have beautiful eyes.
- I have really, long eyelashes. - What do you eyelashes
have to do with eyeliner? - I think--
- They're not the same thing. - No, but, his long
eyelashes give the perception of like, darker-- - Of eyeliner? Oh, okay. I never thought that, but alright. - These cucks, Marques included, always defending Google no matter how bad and how expensive the product is. If this was Samsung,
they'd all be bashing it. Google paying these
YouTube influencers, cucks, lots of money to say their--
- Again, again, with the large terminology. - Their (beep) products are good. Poor form. - What's a cuck? - A cuck? You know what a cuck is. - Yeah, alright, sorry.
- Do we need to go deep? - Well I don't think we can clarify that, while keeping this ad-friendly. - I got demonetized today already. - Okay, alright, never-- - We're cucks!
- Goodbye monetization. - (laughs) how the (beep) did you afford the new iPhone you dip (beep). It was all the money
we got paid by Google. - Obviously.
- Use the Google money, to buy the iPhone. - Correct. - Absolutely.
- Fair. You can get a fur suit for less
than this phone holy (beep). - A what? - A fur suit. Is that like, are we talking,
is it what I think it is? Like, you wear a fur suit? - [Jonathan] Fursuiting.com - Yeah, it's that whole genre, I know nothing about it. - Wait, these things cost $1000? - Those look expensive. - Well, I would think so. - This guy's typical Android user, ugly, (beep) destitute-- - Oh, geez! - Dead loss. - I don't think we can include that one. - That one's pretty good! - iPhone X (laughs). - No, no, read that correctly. - No! iPhone X-tremely (beep). - [Dave And Lewis]
iPhone X-tremely (beep). - Well played. - Yeah, that one's not bad, I see what he's doing there. But you know what, he messed it up by capitalizing the I.
- He should put the dash. - Kudos to you, for clickbaiting morons,
(Dave laughing loudly) to advertise your stupid charger, nothing about iPhone X here, you (beep)-ing four eye (beep). So, like, how does it lead to this end
part of the sentence here? - It's a multi-layer burn, man. - It escalates rapidly! It's like okay, yeah,
clickbaiting, okay, the charger, but then it's like, well
obviously, we're gonna add the last piece on there.
- You gotta finish strong. - I like that your glasses
had some play in it. - They, you know, well you can tell, I've
made the adjustments. - You are without a doubt, the most biased tech YouTuber, on YouTube I've seen so far. - I thought that was me, for sure.
- You suck, dude. L-O-L, this is the first and last time, I will ever watch one of your videos. I mean, the only time--
- So intense. - You hear people say what
you're saying in this video, is when iSheep try to defend Apple. In my opinion, by making
a video like this, you're actually making an Android platform look worse than it is. Don't make excuses for
defective products, bro. If you wanna keep it, keep it! But don't try to lie to yourself, and everyone else along the way. - Whoa, heavy. - Don't forget the LOL. - The L-O-L, yeah. - At the end, 'cause
it's really lighthearted. - It's like JK.
- Of course. - 'Cause if it's actually lighthearted--
- JK, it's okay, I'm just, I'm just taking a little jab here. - Well, that is kinda-- (Dave laughing) - MKBHD just sucked Google's (beep). - On your video?
- On my channel, yeah. (beep) review, totally disagree,
(beep) phone for 800 bucks. These are terrible. - I know. - Red Ace, that's classy, dude. Trying putting your (beep)
I'm front of the camera to see if it can recognize an (beep). (upbeat jazz music) - As a face? (Dave and Jonathan laughing) Is that what he's going for? - A very puckered face, maybe. - You know what you see, when you see a comment like that, you can sense the speed at
which he wrote it, right? - 'Cause it was edited.
- Trying, putting-- - No, but he still edited it. - Oh, man. - That's the weird part. - Wow. - That's my favorite part, trying putting your ass
I'm front of the camera. - And he edited it. Wow. - Like what was the first draft? - Yeah, right. Stupid video, point less information. Point less. Which, I mean, he's allowed to have that opinion. - He's allowed to point less. - Yeah, it's one point less. Love your videos, all
caps, hate your titles. (Dave laughing loudly) If I wasn't already a fan, I would completely avoid this channel, due to this horrible clickbait title. 35 thumbs up. - Dang. - You're baitin'. - Can I just like, say something here?
- Yeah, please. - Is that, am I, do I have the stage here for a minute? - It's your home. - It's kind of an odd
thing to click on a video, and then claim that you were baited, that it was clickbait, because ultimately if you, if your you know, system for
evaluating clickbait was valid, then you would avoid the clickbait before you were baited, because you were so great
at sensing clickbait. - Lou's going deep here. - Well I'm just saying, who's guilty here? The fishermen or the fish? - The fisherman if he's
putting bait on his hooks. - Yeah but the fish is
the one who takes it. - I don't think that makes him guilty. - Of course it does. (Lewis laughing loudly) Perfect, misspelled bait, click, oh. - Ci-click.
- Click. - C-K-L-I-C-K, click bait you trash. - Trash.
- Trash! - Now here's the other thing, where I'll kinda be on
your side with this, if enough people call it clickbait, it is clickbait, you know? But ultimately the decision's up to them whether or not they felt they
got value out of the video. - (beep) so called tech viewers, keep making excuses for this 800 plus Dollars phone.
- I'm just, I'm confused as to why tech
products make people so angry. - It's because it's expensive. - Yeah, but the thing is, this is supposed to be, an exciting, compelling realm, these are
supposed to be enthusiasts, but they want you to be
as angry as they are. You know what I mean? That's the only way to satisfy them. - That's right, they're not too--
- Thing is, maybe you weren't that angry that day. - They weren't that angry? - No, you! - I wasn't angry at all. - Ever! You like like, you meant
to say you look like, you look like if Keemstar
and Scarce had a child. That's not bad. Actually, I kind of like this comment. It's just kinda, it's very observant. Worst video of the year, wasted five minutes
that I cannot get back. Do you know what I love
about that comment? With the time I spent
that I cannot get back, is the funny thing is, what about the time you
spent to write the comment to talk about the time you
spent that you couldn't get, like wouldn't you evacuate the
scene as quickly as possible, if you were counting time? - Unsubbed, because you're just like that ugly phone reviewer who
kissed Google's (beep) seller. Who's the guy?
- Who's the ugly phone reviewer? - I assume all of us, anyone. - That's true. Who the (beep) cares about unboxing, it's the same (beep) all the time. So when is the drop test? - Oh! As if that's-- - You know how much hate I
would get for drop tests? - You guys would rather
see him break a phone, rather than open and share the experience?
- Well, don't say you guys, this is is one individual. - That's true. - It's over, that was fun. That was actually, why is that fun? It's like, cool, YouTube,
it's a fun place, check it out sometime. - Thank you, guys, for watching. This was kinda fun! If this is something you guys wanna see, let me know by dropping a like down below, and maybe, who else
should we do this with? Drop a comment down below. - Oh yeah, let us know. - Unbox Therapy, Dave2D, links below. Check out us unboxing, it's actually kind of amazing. Kinda cool, I got to see that go down. It was something else. - You were in it. - That's true. - Yeah, man. - And thanks for coming up here, man. - Canada. - Yeah. - The place of dreams. (beep) You into that, Lou? - I mean... - Look at that one. - That's a costume? - I think it looked
cool for like a second, but if they're-- - No, but like-- - Wait, why, what? - You would spend a thousand bucks on it? - On a fur suit? - Well, I think for them it's a real... There's a lot of enthusiasm. They go to an event, they meet
other people in their suits, it's a whole ecosystem there. 
- The new Galaxy S9
confirmed in massive leak that will disappoint America. (Ominous music) Jonathan here. That is a title of a headline. I am not even kidding. As many of you know, the Galaxy S9 is getting closer and closer. And with that we are starting to see more and more leaks. But, what has been more interesting or at the very least
more entertaining for me, is not the leaks themselves, but the headlines surrounding them. With that I picked a few of my favorites. The first of which has gotta be Samsung disappointing America. Can you imagine Samsung up at the keynote, doing their thing, This is
the brand new Galaxy S9. And America's like, nah, I'm good. Or, could you imagine Donald Trump on some Twitter rant about the Galaxy S9. I could picture that Tweet in all caps. (Distorted voice) Disappointed
at SamsungMobileUS. Wish it were fake news,
but the rumors were true. America is disappointed. So that has me curious, what exactly about the Galaxy S9 is going to disappoint America specifically? And as we jump into the article, not but two words in, we
are smacked in the face with a typo. "One more...." Once more, the world turns
to the FCC certification team to find out about an
unreleased smartphone. Today it's the US variant of Samsung's upcoming Android flagships, the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus models. The listing confirms the differences seen in previous Galaxy machines will continue with the S9 family. So one paragraph in and
not the slightest hint or clue at what might disappoint America. You would think maybe the second or third paragraph would tell us. And nope, it essentially
goes on to tell us that the International Galaxy S9 will feature an Exynos processor, while the US version, will feature a Snapdragon processor. In this case, the Snapdragon 845. Where the juicy hook comes in though, is that fourth paragraph: "What the FCC doesn't
tell us in this release is any more details over the rear camera. The assumption is that the S9 is getting a single lens and the S9 Plus a dual-lens camera. Neither can it answer the question over the availability
or the otherwise of the leaked Super Slow Mo video which offers 4K Video at 120 frames per second. That is currently reliant on the code inside the Exynos 9 Series 9810 chipset- will the US chipset be able to offer the same feature?" And that essentially
is the entire article. And one: I don't think
super slow motion video or lack thereof is going to single handedly disappoint America, and two: like five more minutes of research would have showed you that the Snapdragon 845 will actually support slow motion video at 720p, up to 480 frames per second, which is amazing! (upbeat synth music) So here's the aftermath of the egg shown off 480 fps. Shout out to Rich for that very accurate throw. Only one egg was harmed in
the making of this video. - I'm sorry. (chuckles) I'm sorry. - So next article. First off, little bit of lazy title: "Samsung Leak Delivers Galaxy S9 Bad News" Second off, there's so much negativity. They're banking off that guy whose excited for the Galaxy S9 to see that headline, and then click through to see why he's gonna hate his
life over a smartphone. "There's more because,
well, there's always more. On Sunday almost every Galaxy S9 feature was leaked and it left us with only two pieces of missing information: the battery size, and the release date." The second paragraph is kind of amazing because it essentially says, the good news out of the situation is you're not gonna have to wait long to be disappointed. But from there, in a
nutshell, it goes onto say that pretty much we've known for a while that the Galaxy S9 is
going to be underwhelming. And the final punch to
the face of disappointment is battery capacity. The Galaxy S9, based off those leaks is slated to have a 3000
milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S9
Plus, slightly higher at 35 hundred, but neither of those are really disappointing. Yeah, I'm sure like most of you out there, I also would have loved
to see a higher number. Maybe 35 hundred on the Galaxy S9, 4000 on the S9 Plus, but again, one big thing to remember is with that Snapdragon 845, that's supposed to be up to 30% more efficient. Which in turn, will lead
to better battery life. So really, I just wanted to focus on positivity as opposed to negativity. Especially in tech. For whatever reason, the media is programmed to feed and pray off scaring people about tech. But there's a lot to
look forward to still, even with the Galaxy S9. So what has me excited for the Galaxy S9, aside from the Snapdragon
845 performance improvements non-disappointing slow motion, has gotta be one: stereo speakers. These are allegedly going
to be tuned by a KG. And really, that's a marketing term, but nonetheless, having stereo speakers on a smartphone is a beautiful thing. And I'm excited to get
that on the Galaxy S9, especially with the fact that they have such a beautiful display,
with basically no bezels. Two: it looks like they fixed the award location of the fingerprint reader on the Galaxy S9. On the Galaxy S8, it was in this slightly award place where you never really felt comfortable with, and in turn made you not want to use it. But the Galaxy S9 allegedly, its in a much nicer location underneath the camera lens. So for me, that's actually a big deal. So based off that leak, that kind of confirms that Samsung is still opting to go with the fingerprint reader as their main form of security. Yet, you will be able to unlock your phone with your face. But its not going to be full fledged like Apple's gone with Face ID. Now I've talked about it before, what would be amazing to
get a fingerprint reader built into the screen. Especially with how
beautiful the Galaxy S8 was, and potentially the Galaxy S9 will be, we in fact actually saw that technology at CES this year. Vivo had a smartphone with the fingerprint reader built into the display. It looked amazing, but unfortunately it seemed to be not quite ready for prime time yet. It was a little slow, a little gimmicky. So I would not expect
that on the Galaxy S9 or S9 Plus. Now what also has me
excited for the Galaxy S9 is the alleged variable aperture, which will switch automatically from F2.4 to F1.5. So what that does is, when
you're switching to F1.5, that lets more light into the lens. So its gonna help with low light photos. And also, its going to get you that beautiful blurred out background. Now this is not an apples
to apples comparison. Yes, a smartphone sensor is much different than something like this camera you're looking at here,
but here's a shot at F2.4. I purposely underexposed
it, and then moving that to F1.4, you can see how much more light we have. So its cool that tech is
that its going to be built into the single lens of the Galaxy S9. Now the Galaxy S9 Plus, that will allegedly have two lenses. That kind of gets confusing in terms of why I think the S Plus
and the Notes series is a little bit weird. But that is a different discussion for a different day. Either way though you can see there is a lot to look forward
to with the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Maybe if you're an S8 or S8 Plus, not so much. But I am excited to check this out. If you guys see any more ridiculous tech headline articles out there, let me with a comment down below. Hopefully enjoyed this video. If you did and you are feeling like being awesome, make sure to go Disappointed in America
on that like button. This is Jonathan. I will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and today we're taking a
look at what's in my bag. Now it may be curly, but I think sometimes being into tech leads us down the path
of bags and backpacks that are maybe too tech heavy. Sometimes it's nice just
to forget about the bags that have the built in battery, the eight million compartments,
the 30 print connector, and focus on one that actually looks good. What I'm rocking right now is the Heritage by
Herschel Supply Company, I believe this is the
raven crosshatch color. It's got a really nice blend
of both gray and black, which, if you haven't noticed yet, is something I am really drawn to. I think the color combos of
this bag work really well with something like the
LunarEpic Flyknit Oreos to free runs, or in my case, huge shoutout
to Mr. Daniel Popovic for eyeing those Kobe 11
Oreos in the last video. But really, more than anything, there's something about this bag that kind of just turns heads. The one thing you may
notice with this backpack, is because it's not super tech focused, you kind of got to bring
some of those elements back. There is a laptop sleeve in here, but you notice there's
not a lot of padding, so what I did I actually
bring an in case sleeve to my MacBook Pro just to
add a layer of protection. This, just like the backpack, is also rocking that gray and black theme, so by now, you should start to see a trend developing with me. Inside this guy is none
other than the 2016 space gray MacBook Pro. This is the top specced MacBook Pro, which might seem a little insane, but for me, what was a big deal is actually having two
terabytes of storage internally, because that allows me to do
most of my projects and editing all from within the MacBook Pro. Now, the other day I got
a question on Twitter asking if I were tired of my Mac Pro, for this MacBook Pro, and funny enough, I haven't actually used the
Mac Pro in over a year now, so to answer that question, yes, I have been exclusively
editing all of my videos off this MacBook Pro. What's awesome with this is when I'm at home or at the office, I've been docking this into
LG's UltraFine 5K display so I could take advantage
of a larger screen, keyboard, mouse, dedicated speakers, and then conversely, when
I'm ready to pack up and go or I'm out traveling, being able to take that MacBook Pro and having that kind of
continuity off a single machine is kind of awesome. Next, continuing along with the theme of bringing some tech
elements back to the backpack, this traveling case from
Amazon Basics is super useful if you've got those smaller tech items that float around freely and run around wreaking havoc in your backpack. Plus it's going to add
a layer of protection just in case you drop it. Within this guy, first up, is the Kingston MobileLite Wireless Pro, and a huge shoutout to Kingston for not only sending this out, but also sponsoring this video. This guy essentially is
the Russell Westbrook of tech accessories, in the sense that it is a
multi talented triple threat. First off, it is a 6,700
milliamp hour external battery, second, there are 64
GB of storage built in that you can use to access
wirelessly or back up to. Lastly, there's an SD
card slot and USB port that you can use to not only
expand the storage of this, but also transfer files
from things like a DSLR to your smartphone wirelessly. Beyond that, we can also access files either internally or off an SD card which we're going to do in this case, so I can hop into the pictures
and scroll through them just like I normally
would in my camera roll. These are from the SD card
and not from the phone. More than anything, it
is a really nice way to access files, whether you want to load it up
with music, movies, pictures, or alternatively, a really
nice way to back things up. I can see it being really helpful if you're out in the field recording with something like a Zoom H5. Maybe you don't have access to a computer. This is a really convenient way to instantly back something up. Next is the Hootoo
Shuttle USB dongle dock, whatever you want to call it, this is what I use
alongside of my MacBook Pro. This gives me three USB 3 ports, and the USB-A flavor, an SD card slot, HDMI right here, and then
a USB-C pass through, which is actually more
useful if you're using a 12 inch MacBook. Next is nothing super exciting, I've got the charger
to my MacBook Pro USB-C along with the cable, and a
lighting cable from Anchor here. If you haven't checked these out, these are actually some of my favorite. They're super durable, super sturdy. If you've had problems with
your lightning cable breaking, this might be a great solution for you. Lastly, inside the case,
these are probably a rarity in terms of what you'd see
as far as headphones go. These are the UM 10 pros from Westone. They're actually in ear monitors. Surprisingly, they have become my go to in ear headphones for editing on the road. They're a little intimidating at first, simply because of how you
have to put them in your ears. Normally, with ear buds,
you'd just pop them in. But with these, you've kind of got to wrap them around your
ear, almost to the point where they feel like they're upside down, but once you lock them in,
they're not going anywhere, and the sound isolation you
get from these is crazy. Where I find these especially useful is when I'm editing on a plane, battling the outside noise
of the engine and people usually doesn't work out so
well with most headphones, but with these, I'm able to
focus on what I need to hear. The downside with these, though, is because they work so well, if they're in your ears, then you have music playing when someone's trying to talk to you, you are not going to be able to hear them. Now, the one thing that
has remained consistent from my last what's in my bag video are these Sony HearOn wireless headphones, which I'm including for a
couple of different reasons. One, these are legitimately
my favorite pair of wireless over your head phones. I would even go as far as to say I would take these all day over the Bose QC 35s. Too, since my last video, these headphones have
dropped about $100 in price, so if you're on the fence
about picking these up, I initially thought they
were worth every penny, but now with the price
drop, it is a no-brainer. Lastly, rounding out my
bag is, surprise, surprise, Apple AirPods. Now, yes, those Sonys
that I just talked about are still my favorite headphones, but the convenience, the simplicity and how well AirPods work have seriously cut into
how much I use them. By no means are the
AirPods audiophile quality, but they don't sound bad, and I find myself using
them more and more often. For me, it really just comes
down to the simplicity, I pull them out of the
case, I don't have to worry about turning them on or connecting them. As you saw in my one month later video, small things like taking
them out of your ear to pause a song or putting
them back in to play a song is really nice, and since that last video, Apple actually rolled out Find My AirPod, which I something I thought
would be really useful. That's all I really got to say. I like Apple AirPods, if you're going to hate on them, you're going to hate on them. Obviously, they have not replaced all of my headphones, which you clearly saw, but at the end of the day, they are just a really cool piece of tech. Aside from that, hopefully
you enjoyed a look at what's inside my bag. If you guys dug this video, make sure to smash that Like button, links to everything we talked
about including the backpack are down below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. - Shoutout to all the pear 
- [Google] What do you get when you put a vest on an alligator? - [Jonathan] Yo guys, Jonathan here, and I'm gearing up for a
long overdue office tour, but in doing so, one of the things I've
wanted to do forever is completely automate the lighting. So with that, I thought
I'd give you sneak peek of setting that up with Google Home. If you haven't checked
out Google Home yet, it has quickly become one
of the coolest pieces of smart home tech out right now. Whether you want to set a timer: - [Google] Alright 10 minutes and here we go. - [Jonathan] Play a song on Spotify: - [Google] Playing Marian Hill on Spotify. (Marian Hill music) - [Jonathan] Know the weather. - [Google] It'll be partly cloudy with a forecasted high
of 57 and a low of 49. There is currently a flash
flood watch in effect. - [Jonathan] Or even
ask it a question like how many ounces in a liter? - [Google] One liter equals
33.814 US fluid ounces. - [Jonathan] What it also
works crazy well with is controlling lighting, and
specifically Philips Hue. - [Google] Sure, turning eight lights on. - [Jonathan] Now huge shout
out to Philips for not only sponsoring this video, but
also a really awesome giveaway, where we're teaming up to
give you guys a chance to win one of three smart home starter packs, which includes a Philips Hue
white and color starter kit and Google Home. Now admittedly, setting up
tech isn't always the easiest, but pairing Google Home with
Hue is one of the quickest, simplest experiences I've ever had. In the home control section
of the Google Home app, hit the plus symbol in the
bottom right hand corner, select Philips Hue hit pair, and then press the
button on your Hue bridge. Once your bridge is
discovered, you can then assign individual lights to rooms,
and also set nicknames, but beyond that, you are ready to go. What sticks out to me
though, is how responsive and how instant Google Home
reacts to changing the lights. OK Google, turn off all the lights. - [Google] Okay, turning eight lights off. - [Jonathan] Okay Google,
turn the white lamp on. - [Google] Okay, turning
the white lamp on. - [Jonathan] Okay Google,
change the black lamp to blue. - [Google] Okay, changing
the black lamp to blue. - [Jonathan] Okay Google,
turn the Hue Go one blue. - [Google] You got it.
Changing Hue Go one to blue. - [Jonathan] Okay Google,
turn all the lights orange. - [Google] Sure, changing
eight lights to orange. - [Jonathan] Okay Google,
dim the lights to 25%. - [Google] Sure, settings
eight lights brightess to 25%. - [Jonathan] So if you
already have a Google Home and Philips Hue, you can
see exactly how simple it is to get them to work together. Whether you want to control
all lights, individual lights, change colors, dim, brighten. It all works insanely well. Now as far as the office tour, that is coming very very soon. So definitely stay tuned and
drop a like if you're excited. For a chance to win one
of those three smart home starter packs, all those
details are down below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. - [Google] If you want to open a store, I recommend selling stoves. You'll immediately offer
a range of hot products. (dance music) - Damn, Evans! (laughter) Alexa stop. For the love of god, stop. - [Evans] You're gonna break something. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and the Nintendo Switch
has officially arrived. But before you go run out
and scoop one of these up, here are ten things to know. So for starters, we're gonna
kick this off with a weird one. Because the cartridge is so small, about the size of an SD card, Nintendo actually Heisenberged
a way to prevent kids from ingesting this. Now from what I've heard,
Nintendo applied a layer of Denatonium Benzoate on the cartridge, and that's apparently one
of the most bitter tasting chemical compounds on
the face of this earth, that way if a kid sticks it in his mouth, he's gonna spit that out. In the name of science
though, I think it's only fair if I test this out myself. The question is though, do
I lick it or do I completely stick this in my mouth? That is the obvious answer. (speaking gibberish) That's nasty. No kids eating this for sure. I don't know if that was
the best idea doing this as the first fact. Ugh, I don't even know
what it tastes like. My mind's going, did I lick a sharpie? (lips smacking) What is that? (coughing) I need some water. Taste update, I'm getting
a waft of nail polish, and hats off to Nintendo
for being true, I guess, because I don't think
there's a kid on the face of this earth, or adult for that matter, that's gonna enjoy the taste of that. So next up on number two is
the fact that game availability really isn't that great at launch. You just got your Switch,
you're excited to play, and then you realize the
only truly major title available at launch is The Legend
of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There are smaller indie titles
which are also available on the PS4 and Xbox One, but
as far as Switch exclusive, you really only have a couple of options. One of them being 1-2-Switch, which essentially is a
group of party games. Currently as far as major releases go, you will need to practice some patience. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is slated for April, Splatoon 2 in the summer, NBA 2K in September, but if you're looking forward
to Super Mario Odyssey, you're gonna have to be extra patient because that is not comin'
out until the holidays. So next up at number three,
jumpin' in to some positivity. The system is super adaptable
for day to day life, but I think, by far, one
of the coolest features about the Switch is how
easy it is to switch between all the different ways you can play. You can play around the
house then hop on the couch, pants being optional. You can even maybe go
outside and get some sun, although I'd say pants are
probably mandatory on that one. And then when you're
ready for that TV action, just pop it on the dock and magic. Now it's not actually magic,
but what happens when you place the system in to the
dock is that it automatically ups the system's clock
speed which it to output it in 1080p. The Switch also features a
built in kickstand just in case you wanna dock it on to
a desk or hard surface. And I emphasize hard surface
because the kickstand really isn't that great, so if you place it on a soft
surface, it is guaranteed to fall over. There are of course other accessories that do a much better job at this, so if you like the idea
that is probably the route you want to go. Then next up at number four,
speaking of accessories, the pricing is insane. So out of the box, the Switch comes with two Joy-Con controllers, those are those little detachable handles, one controller grip, which
allows you to combine two of them to make a more traditional controller, and then lastly, some
wrist strap attachments, that way you don't
accidentally throw a Joy-Con out your window. Now this is totally adequate
for the single player games and some of the simpler two player games, but if you want any more of that, you are going to need to pony up. Each Joy-Con is 50 bucks. You can however get them
in a double pack for $80, but you will need to
tack on an extra 15 bucks for the controller grip. There's also a Pro controller
option for 70 bucks. So you can see, if you were
buying this for just yourself, it really isn't that big of a deal, but if you got a giant household or a double D 50 amount of kids, this is gonna do some serious
damage to your wallet. So next up at number
five, if we threw pricing out the window for a second,
with those accessories, there are so many ways
to control the games. The simplest option you
have is by holding a pair of Joy-Cons. One in each hand where
you just relax your arms and use them independently. This is surprisingly comfortable
and personally my favorite way to play. If, however, you want
something closer to a more traditional controller,
you can attach the Joy-Cons to a comfort grip but
you're gonna be disappointed because honestly, it feels worse. The grip handles themselves are super tiny and not particularly well
shaped to the human hand, plus, once you're used to
using the Joy-Cons separately it kinda feels like
you're taking a step back. If however you absolutely
need that controller feel, you're much off spending the extra money and getting the Switch Pro controller. So next up on number
six, talkin' a little bit about gameplay. In terms of portable mode, surprisingly, it looks really good. In terms of specs, the
Switch's built in screen is a 6.2 inch capacitive multi-touch panel with a resolution of 720p. Now I guarantee people are gonna hear 720p and lose their minds. Where's 1080? Where's 4K? What is this caveman crap? But the thing is, the screen is so small, in terms of scale for its size, it actually looks incredible. For comparison, the PS
Vita is capped at 544p. Could you imagine inviting
someone over and ask if they wanted to watch
a movie on your 544p TV? That ain't quad HD, that's quarter HD. Specs and resolution aside though, the backlight is great,
the colors are even better, and I'd even go as far as
saying the Switch is at its best when used in handheld mode. Now next up on number seven,
as great as the graphics are, battery life is actually
kind of a concern. The Switch's battery
life is expected to be somewhere between three and six hours and you can actually expect
closer to that three hour range if you're playing more demanding
games like Legend of Zelda. Alternatively, you could remedy
this by plugging yourself into a wall outlet, but if you plan on being on the go consistently,
that battery bank you got to chug through those Pokemon Go session isn't gonna hack it here. You're gonna need something
way more powerful. With that said though, if you
are gonna be that guy or girl on the go, I'll post some
of the biggest, baddest power options down below. Now next up on number eight, if you are worried about
battery life, one bright note with the Switch is auto sleep. Now with previous Nintendo systems, those would continue to
run until the battery was completely drained. So in the instance where
your system's saying hey, plug me in, I'm about to
die, and you ignored it, you're gonna lose all of your progress. The Switch however features
an emergency sleep mode, that way just in the case the battery gets to a critical point,
it's gonna automatically put itself to sleep, in turn
preventing itself from dying and you losing your data. So next up at number nine,
one really important thing to consider is the fact
that the built in storage on the Switch really isn't that much. So for example, Legend
of Zelda is 13 gigs, so if you were to download that, instantly half of your storage is gone. Now while the Switch doesn't
support USB thumb drives or USB hard drives, it does
feature an SDXC card slot located beneath the kickstand, but again, diving back to the fact that
the accessories are expensive and they add up, this is
gonna be one more thing you're gonna have to buy. Now last up at number
10, one thing to consider is the fact that online
support really fully hasn't arrived yet. Currently the only thing you can do online is browse and buy from
the eShop or add a friend using Nintendo's painfully
outdated friend code system. Now Nintendo has promised more
online features in the future specifically with their companion app, but that is still a little ways away, so as of right now, we're
kind of in the dark with that. The good news is though
because you're essentially a guinea pig right now,
everything is free. But as features roll out and
it becomes a little more robust you can definitely expect to pay a fee. P.S., as a bonus fact, for
some reason the Switch charges a MacBook. Seriously. Aside from that, hopefully
you guys enjoyed the video. If you did and you appreciate
me licking cartridges, make sure you drop a like, and about that giveaway, you
can find out more details here or down below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. I'm gonna actually--
- You're actually gonna do it. - I'm gonna stick it in my mouth. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's my game. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here. 18-cores and iMac are probably two things you would never expect to
say in the same sentence, but with the iMac Pro that is a thing. This is the fastest iMac Pro you can buy. 18-core AMD Vega 64 graphics, 128 gigabits of ram, and a four terabyte SSD. (upbeat music) so I've got a chance to
spend the last couple of days with this monster of an iMac, and I really wanted to
focus on performance. For reference I'll be showcasing it against a 10-core Vega 64 iMac Pro, as well as a 8-core Vega 56 model. So jumping into the
obligatory Geekbench 4 score because honesty it's just kinda fun to see where these 18-core stacked up. This did no disappoint
with a multicore score of over 48,000. Now what was a little surprising but also positive is you don't lose that much in terms of the
singlecore score compared to the 10-core model
especially considering that the base clock on
this is 2.3 gigahertz. Also what was kinda interesting for me, this was the first time I've got a chance to stack up the one terabyte, two terabyte, and four terabyte
as it's reconfigurations. The bad news is the four
terabyte really isn't much faster than the two
terabyte or one terabyte for the matter, but on the flip side of that the good news is no
matter which route you go, you're gunna get pretty much the same performance across the board. Now as far as how that power
translates into performance, the first thing I did
was take 8K raw footage. It was about 100 gigabytes
or just over 26 minutes of footage and trans-coded
that into 8K ProRes. To do this I used REDCINE-X program which really puts those cores to work. Like it was maxing them out. With the 18-core
especially when you factor in multiple threads, seeing 36 insistence's running at the same time is kind
of a beautiful thing. As far as what those
cores translate it to, the 18-core iMac pro took
a little over 39 minutes, the 10-core was 46 minutes, and 8-core iMac pro did the job in just about 51 minutes. Now your initial reaction might be five, six minutes that's not that big of a deal, but where it counts is when you do that multiple times per day, multiply that everyday for a week, for a year, that's where that
really makes a difference. So next up is Cinema 4D. This is a custom scene that was tweaked by my buddy Matt Workman. But essentially it is only using the CPU to render out the scene
so it's a great way to showcase the performance
between the processors. The 18-core rendered everything
out in four minutes flat. The 10-core was four
minutes and 48 seconds. While the 8-core finished
everything up in six minutes and four seconds. Again, much like the Red Raw
transcoding these numbers and this time save on a small
scale might not seem like the biggest deal, but over
time, it definitely adds up. From there jumping over
to Final Cut Pro 10. Red Raw, the iMac Pro, and
final cut pro have been amazing. To give you a little run down on this project I have 8K Red Raw footage at a 12 compression. This was shot in Reds IPP2 logs have a lot of applied a few layers
of color correction and then I back he rendering off to really put iMac Pro's to work. So the raw time line
which is unrendered is about three minutes and taking that next importing it
into a ProRes 422 file the 18-core iMac pro did that in five minutes and 51 seconds, the 10-core six minutes and 34 seconds, and the 8-core seven
minutes and 22 seconds. Even though the 10-core iMac Pro still has the fastest single two
out of turbo clock speed. In this case you can see
in terms of final cut, the extra cores do
actually make a difference. In my continuing search of programs that really take advantage
of the processing power, Screenflow 7 actually
takes really big advantage of all those cores with the iMac Pro. What I did was take a 5K screen recording, had a three minute
project and then exported that into 4K H.264 footage. The 18-core iMac pro did that
in one minute 48 seconds. The 10-core two minutes and 24 seconds, and lastly the 8-core iMac Pro,
two minutes and 46 seconds. Now I did mess a little bit
with Adobe Media Encoder. Took A6500 footage is about
ten minutes of 4K video. I tried to transcode that into 422 ProRes. The 18-core did that in
six minutes 54 seconds, the 8-core was eight
minutes and 36 seconds, but for some reason, the 10-core was actually
slower than the 8-core at ten minutes and eight seconds. But from what I could tell, Adobe Media Encoder really
wasn't taking advantage of all that hardware. I'm going to do a little more research and a little more
investigating but I did want to share those preliminary
Adobe results first. Now plot twist those
motion graphics benchmarks featured throughout this
video were created in After Effects so naturally I
thought it would make sense to render then out on these iMac Pros. So for total of six independent renders the 18-core iMac Pro
finished everything up in ten minutes and 36 seconds. The 10-core was actually the fastest here at nine minutes and 43 seconds, and then the 8-core iMac Pro
did the job in 12 minutes and 19 seconds. So these numbers kinda tell
me a couple different things. One, the clock speed on
the 10-core iMac Pro here in this case definitely makes a difference and two based off those comparisons against Adobe Media Encoder, Adobe is clearly not taking full advantage of the hardware on these iMac Pros. Honestly I still think
the 10-core iMac Pro is the best value in terms of bang for your buck with performance. But, if you need that
sheer processing power, those 18-cores really come in handy. Now if you line the eight, the ten and 18-core in my case the only one I haven't checked
out yet is the 14-core. In terms of price and what you gain performance
wise it's a pretty even jump. So if you transcode a ton
on a day to day basis, or potentially use really
CPU intensive programs like Cinema 4D, that's maybe where those
extra cores come into play. But if your asking me, I still think again the best bang for your buck is the 10-core iMac Pro. But nonetheless the 18-core iMac Pro is a super solid performer, it is very, very powerful. Hopefully you enjoyed this video, if you did and you're
feeling like being awesome make sure you guys smash that like button. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and if you're a fan of
the Best Tech Under 50, get excited because today it is back and it is better than ever. I've teamed up with
ColorWare not only showcase my favorite skin of the month, but also to give one of you guys a chance to win everything
featured in today's video, so if that sounds good, you're excited, make sure you drop a like down below. And definitely feel free to subscribe and turn on notifications
if you haven't yet so you don't miss
future videos like this. So this month's skin from
ColorWare is dubbed Tracer. This is brand new, it is
stealthy, it is futuristic, it is unique to say the least. Here I have it on the Pixel
XL, which looks super clean. And if you own a Pixel and you haven't been a
fan of that glass panel, this is actually a
fantastic way to cover it up and give it a super unique look. Now maybe you don't own a Pixel, maybe you're on team Galaxy S8, maybe you're on team
iPhone 7, it doesn't matter because this is available
for those as well, which I will link to down below. So first up for those
who caught my Galaxy S8 desk set up video, I featured that bright orange keyboard right there behind me, and the reaction was either
holy crap that is amazing, where can I get that
bright, bold, beautiful, orange rectangle of squares or stop it man, it's like
I'm looking into the sun get it out of my face. So with that said, for those
you aren't a fan of Sunny D, that's where this guy comes in. The Anker ultra compact Bluetooth keyboard which is budget friendly and
comes in at just 20 bucks. Now before we continue, I'm
not afraid to address it. It is no secret where they took their
design inspiration from, this looks and feels like
a cheap Apple keyboard. It's almost like Johnny Ive took a vacation and Phil Schiller, filled in. Now while this may look
like an Apple keyboard, the good news is that's
it's not limited to Mac. It's gonna work on iOS, Android and for those who bleed
green, red, blue or red again in any of those combinations,
it's also gonna work on the PC master race
side of things as well. So all that is fantastic, but if there were any down
sides with this keyboard, I would say it comes
down to build quality. The plastic does leave
a little to be desired. It's not gonna break by typing on it but you definitely don't want
to slam this thing around. Pass that though, it is super lightweight which makes it a great
option for traveling, aesthetically it is clean as hell. You also get stellar battery
life at around six months and if you've been looking
for a great, inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard that is under 25 bucks, this is a solid pick up. So next up, at number three,
is this little guy right here. And if you own an Apple watch, it is one of the coolest
gadgets that I've come across. What it is, is this tiny
compact portable battery bank, but what's awesome is, there's
a built in Apple watch dock smashed inside this guy, so
say it's the end of the day, maybe you forgot to charge
your Apple watch last night but you need just a little bit
more juice to get you through this is all you need. Also I gotta give this
thing some brownie points for the built-in key chain,
which allows you to pay homage to the great
Dwayne The Rock Johnson, (magical sound) now this is gonna work with
both series one and two and what I thought was a really nice touch was the built-in LED battery
indicator so that way at any given point of the day, you know how much charge you have left. Now if there were any down sides, I would say it's a fact that
this does require Micro USB-C, if it did have Lightning, that would've taken it over the top and made this absolutely
perfect but for the price it is not a terrible thing to deal with. It's relatively inexpensive,
it works as advertised and if you're someone
who's ever had a problem with not charging their Apple Watch, this could come in super clutch. So next up, speaking of Apple watches and tiny, small objects,
this is the Elago W3 Stand, which is amazing for anyone
into that classic Apple design. What it does essentially
is turn your Apple watch into this super tiny,
compact original Macintosh. It looks awesome. It is not new by any means, but the reason I'm featuring it today is that even though this
is the best tech under 50, right now this is on sale for 10 bucks. How long is that gonna
last, I have no idea, so if you want one, make
sure you jump on it. But at the very least, it is a super fun piece of tech to have. Now if I were to describe this,
the words that come to mind would be hefty, thick, beefy even. Not gonna say you could
knock someone out with this, but you probably could and
it's gonna do all of that without scratching your Apple watch. (bell tolls) Now aside from looking cool
and also being a potentially great object to chuck at
someone, there actually is some function with this. It will work in nightstand
mode with your Apple watch so you could have this
really cool, vintage set up to charge your watch at night, and for 10 bucks it is a no brainer. So next up at number two are
the Photive HF1 Headphones. And I get it, you've
probably seen your fair share of wireless Bluetooth headphones
on budget tech episodes, but the thing is, these don't
look like they're 50 bucks and more importantly they don't
sound like they're 50 bucks. So right off the bat, build
quality with these things are fantastic. They are made with lots and lots of metal. They look great, they feel
great and more importantly they do all of this while
still being lightweight. Now one of the more impressive features with these headphones is
the fact that you can expect around 12 hours of battery life. You combine that with
the fact that they are really lightweight like I mentioned, and that makes these a super solid choice for a pair of traveling headphones. Now on the website, they
definitely hype these up a bit. They claim they feature a
tasteful zinc alloy matte accent, which is fancy talk for a
pretty cool matte finish. Now as far as sound quality
goes, they sound really good. Not amazing, I definitely
wouldn't take them over a pair of Sony's at
say that $100 price point. I think the biggest thing
lacking for them is the bass. Most people might feel it
needs a little bit more but, if you can only spend 50
bucks for a pair of headphones and you need them to be wireless, I would seriously check these out. So last up, once more I'm
gonna hit you with a little bit of that nostalgia. This is the 8bitdo SNES30, which is this really cool
little Bluetooth controller that looks just like the original
Super Nintendo controller. So this connects wirelessly via Bluetooth, but just in case you're right
smack in the middle of a game and your battery starts to die, you can still use this connected
to a USB cable as well. Now just like that sweet Ankar keyboard I took a look at earlier,
this also works on Mac, Windows, iOS and Android,
but more importantly and the reason I'm featuring it today is that it now works
with the Nintendo Switch. So with the Switch it
makes for a really great retro, throwback companion. You get these really
awesome tactile buttons. Now on one side, if you're playing more complex games like Zelda, you probably want to check out their more expensive pro model, which is still under 50
bucks, but on the other hand if you're doing simple
games like Mario Cart, this is gonna work perfectly. Now speaking of the Switch,
this amazing, custom, Zelda theme Switch, yes
this one right here, I am also giving away
along with a chance to win everything featured in this video. Details on that are down below. This is Jonathan and I'll
catch you guys later. 
- Damn this is a sweet shirt. Joycon Boyz. Yo guys, Jonathan here. Literally just got back
from New York to LA where I had a chance to go hands-on with the brand-new Galaxy S8. During the plane ride back while I probably should
have been sleeping, I spent a majority of the time reading comments from you guys. And there were some
pretty interesting things that Samsung really didn't talk about. Now to quickly answer this question Yes, in fact I will be giving
away a Galaxy S8 very soon. So if you have not subscribed make sure you do that
and turn notifications on so you do not miss when that happens. Plus you'll know right
away when a new video drops and I'm usually down
in the comments section for the first hour so
definitely drop a line and say what's up. Now before I jump into the juiciness, I wanna preface this video by stating: I am a fan of the Galaxy
S8. I'm excited for it. It is a beautiful device,
but there were definitely some question marks
after yesterday's event. Firstly and rightfully so, there is a ton of hype
around Samsung's big, beautiful edge-to-edge Infinity Display. Which packs a pretty impressive
2960x1440 resolution, but if you check out the website
and look at the fine print things get a little interesting. The Galaxy S8 is advertised
as a 5.8" quad HD display which designates 1440p. Same goes for its older
brother, the Galaxy S8+. But then come the asterisks. Infinity Display: a
bezel-less, full-frontal Damn, Samsung getting PG13 except you're not getting
a full-frontal in PG13 so it's actually rated
R edge-to-edge display. Where it gets juicy though
is the next asterisk. Default resolution is Full
HD+ and can be changed to Quad HD in Settings. So what this means without
all the fancy-pants tech talk is even though Samsung is clearly marketing this as a 1440p phone, out of the box it is set to 1080p. Now before anyone out there freaks out and runs to grab a pitchfork, I personally do not think
this is a huge deal. I thought I was in Canada for a second. A wild Linus showed up. - Hello everybody. I have no idea what video this is. I'm gonna assume it's about
like Apple sh*t or something. - It's actually Samsung. - Oh. Okay. Well that's cool too. - I'll see you in a little bit, man. Have fun with your thermal
paste and overclocking. I will. Love you. Yeah it's a little weird with Samsung clearly marketing one thing
and then delivering another. Especially in fine print, but at the end of the day if
you want those extra pixels and that extra screen real-estate, it is something that you can
quickly change in Settings. I assume the sole reason
Samsung is doing this is simply to manage
efficiency in terms of power. Plus for all we know it could be part of their eight
point battery inspection to keep those batteries cool. Now next what I wanna talk
about if I'm being honest is something that blew right past me in my limited amount of
time with the device. That is regarding the camera. Specifically, the rear shooter. We all know the front-facing
camera got a solid upgrade up to eight megapixels
better in low light. So that part is cool. But if you look closely, the rear camera is pretty much
the same as the Galaxy S7. Honestly why I think it blew past me is when I saw 12 megapixels
I kinda just assumed cool they're keeping
the megapixels the same, but they're gonna widen up the aperture. They're gonna make the pixels bigger. Insert fancy marketing term here or here. But in actuality it is
pretty much the same. Now again, I don't necessarily think that this is a deal breaker. Maybe if anything it is
one less reason to upgrade from the Galaxy S7 to the S8. But it is slightly weird that there is no advancement whatsoever
in terms of the rear camera. On top of that I'm also pretty surprised that Samsung did not opt
to go for two cameras. Maybe on the Galaxy S8 I could see that, but it's super surprising not to see that on the Galaxy S8+. If you caught my hands-on yesterday, there really are only two
differences between the two. The Galaxy S8 is a 5.8" display. Whereas the Galaxy S8+ is a 6.2" display. But both share the exact same resolution. The difference however lies
in the battery department. The Galaxy S8 features
3,000 milliamp hours, but the Galaxy S8+ is
slightly larger at 3,500. So you can clearly see there really isn't that big of a gap between the two. And maybe if Samsung would have at least opted for a dual camera in the S8+, that would have made sense. Now lastly, something that personally I still do not have clarity on. I've read conflicting reports of some say yes, some say no. And that is whether or not the Galaxy S8 features stereo speakers. I kinda just assumed no
because Samsung did not talk about it at yesterday's event. If it were a new feature, you would think they
would wanna brag about it but they did not say a word. Still though, I've read
some articles that say yes it does have stereo speakers and some that say no it clearly does not. So if you guys have any insight, definitely let me know as well. Now flipping the switch and talking about some things that you may have missed but
on the positive side. The Galaxy S8 is actually the first phone to feature Bluetooth 5.0. What's cool about Bluetooth
5.0 is you can actually output to two separate Bluetooth devices and control them individually. So if you wanted to go
to a pair of headphones, to a Bluetooth speaker, or two headphones, You can do that. And I guarantee someone out
there is gonna be unimpressed. Why do I need to output
two Bluetooth devices? And come on man, it is cool. Maybe you're on an airplane,
you're watching a movie. And you want to stream audio to two separate Bluetooth headphones. Maybe one person likes
to listen to things loud and the other has super sensitive ears and needs to keep things down. Did you ever think about that? Lastly, and just to clarify. Samsung did mention this yesterday. I just happened not to
talk about it in my video and thought it was worth mentioning still. With each Galaxy S8 and S8+, Samsung is including a
$100 pair of AKG headphones which I thought was awesome. Aside from that, hopefully
you enjoyed the video. Maybe you found it helpful. Go ahead and hit that share button. And if you could not get enough
of the Galaxy S8 goodness, make sure you check out that video here. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- So, today, I'm taking a look at some of the best tech under $500 bucks. That includes this
beautiful monitor behind me and even a look into
the world of music tech. Now, huge shout out to
today's sponsor, Beautyrest, who asked me to showcase
their sleep tracker monitor. And like I talked about
in my 4k setup video, I want to shake things up when
it comes to sponsored videos. So, anytime a brand wants to sponsor video and ask me to showcase their product, I want to use that as a chance
to give back to you guys and make sure that you have
a chance to win that product. So if you want a chance to win
a Beautyrest sleep tracker, or an amazon equivalent gift card, details are down below. So this is the Beautyrest sleep tracker, which is Alexa-enabled, and allows you to turn
any bed into a smart bed. How it works is out of the
box you get two sensors. So in this case, I have it
set up to track two people. But if you're riding solo, you'd simply place one in the middle. From there, then feed
information into the brain, which is located underneath your bed. This does the tracking, the processing, and ultimately allows you not to have to wear a tracker to bed. This works hand-in-hand
with the sleep tracker app, which allows you to set bedtime
goals when you wanna wake. And what's awesome is, because the sensor are
integrated into the bed, it can track your heart
rate, your body movement, and ultimately give you the most accurate information possible. Beyond that, because there
is a dedicated processor, it is constantly adapting and
getting smarter over time. In my case, if I can get
six to six and a half hours of sleep every night, that would be ideal. If you need less or you need more, let me know with a comment down below. But if you've been looking
for a sleep tracker whether it's an upgrade from an app or you just hate wearing things to bed, this is a super cool piece of tech. From there, we are jumping
straight into that monitor. This is the ASUS MX299Q
and if you've been looking for an ultra wide monitor
but don't want to drop a ton of cash, this guy
is hair over $350 bucks. Right off the bat what I love about this monitor is how it looks. And in this case, I think the contrast of the silver and white looks amazing but ultimately I think it
would awesome on any desk. I think the circular base gives off this really cool futuristic look. You have a ton of inputs:
display port, HDMI, sadly no USBC but for the
price, I can live with that. This is 21x9 aspect ratio which gives you a resolution of 2560x1080p. No 1440p but ultimately
that is what allows it to sit under $400 price point. And if you don't need those many pixels, that's gonna put some cash
back into your pocket. Quality wise, this monitor
looks awesome, and personally, I am a single non ultra
wide monitor kind of guy but I can totally see the appeal. One, it looks awesome and two, if you need that extra screen real estate, it almost mimics a dual monitor setup but while keeping things nice and tidy. Beyond that there is a pretty nice set of speakers built into this monitor. They're not gonna blow your mind but if you don't need anything loud or you're looking to
upgrade your speakers later, they will definitely do the job. In this case, I have it
hooked up to a MacBook Pro but I think it has me inspired
for a Windows based setup. I have a challenge to get everything including the monitor, the computer, the desk for under $1,000 bucks. If that's something you want to see, let me know by dropping a like down below. Overall, this is a really
good looking monitor both on the video quality
spectrum and the aesthetic. And if you've been looking
for an ultra wide 21x9 monitor but didn't want to spend over $500 bucks, this might be your go to option. Next, we're taking a look at a backpack and I've looked at backpacks ranging from $35 bucks all the way up to $1,300. This is no where the cheapest
nor the most expensive, but it is for sure unique. This is the S series travel
camera backpack from Vinta. And I think when most people
see the price at $240 bucks, they might react and say, "Holy crap, "that is kind of expensive,"
but when you sit back and break down the
purpose of this backpack, it's not that crazy. For starters, this is a camera backpack. So, it's purpose is to potentially carry thousands upon thousands
of dollars of gear. And I think what I like
most about this backpack, is that it doesn't look
like a camera backpack. So, no ones going to know that you have tons of gear inside. It is surprisingly compact
which is awesome for traveling. Because if you can minimize a big, bulky backpack on your
back, that is awesome. From there it's the small things like having magnetic straps that really make the backpack an enjoyable experience. And I know, that might kind of sound silly but it's the attention to detail that really takes things over the top. And even though this is a
relatively compact backpack, there is a ton of room inside. So, on top of all your camera gear, there's also room for a laptop. So, in this case I have
A6500 and some lenses, a 15 inch MacBook Pro,
and there is still room for the charger, hard drives, headphones, and overall this is a
really well though out and well executed camera backpack that doesn't actually look
like a camera backpack that still looks really good. Next from there, this
is the One from Apogee which is a beautiful interface that allows you to either
record an instrument like guitar or bass or a
microphone into your Mac. So, this connects via USB to your Mac and on top of being a fantastic
interface it also doubles as a really high quality
dac and headphone amp. One thing that drives me
crazy with audio interfaces, in particular, is when they
don't talk to your computer and don't allow you to control your system's volume through the hardware. In this case, the Apogee
One works perfectly. So, how it works is when you want to plug in an instrument
or plug in a microphone, there's a break out cable
which connects to the Apogee. This is cool because
when you're not using it, you can keep it tucked away
which keeps things clean. And then next from here,
we're gonna go ahead and plug in a microphone. Now, this microphone is
actually the final piece of tech of the best tech under $500 bucks. I'm just gonna use it hand
in hand with the Apogee One. This is the Spirit from Aston microphones which looks great but sounds even better. Now rather than give you a demo of me talking with the microphone, I thought it'd be cool let you hear how it sounds with different voices. So, this is the Spirit microphone, going into the Apogee
One, into a MacBook Pro.. - Man, sometimes the attention
from fame is so annoying. - Then why is your shirt off? - Austin Evans, oh my
God, my favorite YouTuber. - You're so much more ripped in person. Wow Evans, we love you. Selfie. - Oh my God, that was so
beautiful, you have fans. - Yeah, if I were you, I'd be flattered. - Ehhh. - You wanna stop right
there for a few seconds? - Sure. (slap) - You're a goddamn
internet celebrity, Evans. I know you track Social Blade everyday. Reap the benefits,
Evans, reap the benefits. - You know, 2 million subscribers
isn't that bad, Evans. - All they want are PC builds. I'm tired of the attention. - Maybe you should do
the PC builds shirtless with your big, meaty claws. - Yeah, Evans, use them big, meaty claws. - I can't do it anymore, (gun shots) just get out of here. - Alright, we acted like fans, pay up. - Alright, fine, thanks for the attention. - This is $100, you said $200 bucks. - Yeah, being your fans ain't cheap. - Two words, ad pocalypse (guns shots). - So, you can see this
microphone does an amazing job on voiceover but if you're a musician, here's how it sounds on
acoustic guitar and vocals. ♫ And it keeps cursing my name ♫ No matter what I do ♫ I'm no good without you ♫ And I can't get enough ♫ Must be love on the brain ♫ Then you keep ♫ So, all in all, a really
impressive microphone and honestly I think it can compete with microphones twice its price. Whether it's a voiceover,
an instrument, or vocals it all handles it really well. And in this case I think the
Spirit microphone plus the Apogee One is a killer audio
combo under $1,000 bucks. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. If you want to check out that full cover using that microphone,
check out the video here. Or if you want to check
out some more Lego stop motion awesomeness you can
check out Bill, Play, Repeat. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. ♫ And you got me ♫ 
- Yo, guys, Jonathan here, and today, we are talkin' AirPods. They're hard to find, easy to
hate, but at the very least, they have stirred up some mixed emotions. The initial reaction when you see AirPods for the first time is, "Holy (beeps). "They cut the cables off,
slapped 'em in a floss container, "and they're chargin'
160 bucks for these?" But still, there's
somethin' about AirPods, where even though there's
that voice inside your head tellin' you you probably
shouldn't buy these, you still kinda want to. Now by no means are AirPods cheap, but on the other end of the spectrum, if we're to stack 'em up against other truly wireless
earbuds, it's not that crazy. Samsung's Gear IconX are 169. Bragi, The Dash, are 249, and even somethin' like the
Rowkin Bit Charge are 129. So when you break it down like that, the price becomes somethin'
you may potentially be able to justify, but the
one thing I haven't been able to get past yet are the looks. This is how you think you
look while wearin' AirPods, and this is how you actually look. Are they the ugliest piece
of tech out there right now? Definitely not, but I'm
not sure we could have a serious conversation with
these in my ear right now. Conversely, since you are
obviously not paying for looks, what you are paying for
is the tech inside these, which is some of the
best out there right now. For starters, the set-up
process, even for the first time, is one of the simplest and
easiest things you'll ever do when it comes to tech. No joke, from the second you unbox these, you place into your phone,
you pop open the cap, press connect, and that is literally it. I don't care if you love
Apple or you hate them, this is how pairing should
be, whether it's AirPods, other Bluetooth headphones,
gaming headsets, controllers. If everything paired this way, the tech world would be a better place. What's also nice is you only have to pair the AirPods one time, and you're not gonna have
to screw around with pairing each earbud individually. On top of that for me, hands down, the coolest feature with AirPods is the ability to play and pause a song simply by takin' an AirPod outta your ear. So say you're listenin' to music, some guy walks up to you and says, "Excuse me, sir, are those
toothbrushes in your ear?" And you go, "Huh, what?" That's gonna automatically pause the song, and once you tell him, "No,
sir, these are AirPods," and pop it back in your ear, it will automatically
resume where you left off. Now what kinda surprised me with this is the fact that it's not
limited to just Apple music. It's also gonna work with
Spotify and even YouTube as well. So because of that, I think
the most compelling thing about AirPods is convenience. You're not thinkin' about turnin' them on, or conversely, when you're
done listenin' to music, you're not asking yourself, "Did I turn them off?" You just pop 'em back in the case, and you kinda forget about it. Now on the flip side of that, if you forget to put
these back in your case, because there are absolutely no wires, there is a very serious chance you're gonna lose one a these. Now speakin' of the case,
that is actually how you charge the AirPods, and I'm not gonna lie. Apple in the past has made some
pretty questionable decision as far as charting things goes, but this actually works really well. As far as the AirPods themselves, those should last around
four to five hours, but if you do run out of
juice, pop 'em in the case, and 15 minutes will get
you three more hours of listening time. So I think it's safe to say I
am genuinely a fan of the tech inside AirPods but by no
means are these perfect. For starters, by themselves
without using your phone, Siri is actually the only
way to control volume. That's all good and
well when you're at home and no one is there to judge you, but if you're out in public, especially when they can't
see the AirPods in your ears, and you say, "Volume up," that's a little weird. So by default, you can access Siri by double-tappin' on the
AirPods, and jokes aside, it can be really useful
havin' quick access like that for questions or navigation. But how awesome could it have been if there were some touch-sensitive
controls in the AirPods where you swiped up or
down to control the volume? On top of that, for 160 bucks, and how much Apple
brags about the iPhone 7 bein' water resistant, I
kinda woulda liked to see AirPods be water-resistant as well. I have actually tested
these not only in the gym but the sauna as well, which
is both wet and extremely hot, and so far, they have yet to die. So that in itself is a good thing, but it would have been reassuring to know they were geared to be water-resistant, because that way if
somethin' did happen to them, they would probably fix them. In this case, if I walked
into the Apple store, Mr. Apple genius is gonna say, "Sorry, bro, you brought
these in the sauna." Now playing devil's advocate for a second, it is not secret that
Apple products work well with other Apple products, whether it's iMessage on
an iPhone to a MacBook, or in this case, the
secret to the ultimate AirPods experience is the Apple Watch. With this, you alleviate the problem of A, needing to have your phone out, and B, soundin' like a crazy person in public. Through the watch, you
have control over both next and previous songs,
but more importantly, it potentially may be even more satisfying is controlling volume
with a Digital Crown. And let me be clear: by
no means am I justifing the lack of controls on AirPods or am I saying that you should go run out and buy an Apple Watch just
to control your earbud, but if you do have one already, I'm not gonna lie. It is really cool. Now beyond all the tech, and
even before sound quality, the one thing you gotta ask yourself before you think about buying these is, "Do they even fit in my ears?" The good news is, is because
they are exactly the same as EarPods, if those fit, you're in luck, but the bad news is if those didn't fit, it is not getting any better here. To me personally, AirPods
have always fit really well in my ears, so with AirPods,
it was no different. They just hop right in
and don't seem to fall off no matter what I do. (upbeat guitar music) But on the flip side,
there are people I know where EarPods or AirPods won't
stay in to save their lives. (upbeat guitar music) So once you get past the
question of whether or not they actually fit in your ears, the other question is how do they sound, which is in turn evolve to, do they sound any better than EarPods? The short answer, unfortunately,
is no, they don't, and believe me, part of
you really wants them to, or at the very least, maybe
just a little bit louder. But the fact of the matter is, they sound exactly the same as EarPods. So with that, you kinda gotta take that with a grain a salt. If you liked, or maybe
even didn't mind EarPods, you're gonna like AirPods, but on the flip side, if you hated those, you are not gonna like these. So at the end of the day, if
you own an Android device, don't buy these. If you see yourself as an
AudioFile, don't buy these. If EarPods did not fit in
your ears, don't buy these. But on the flip side, if
you're in the Apple ecosystem, and the tech outways everything else, I would pick these up. 
- [Lois] Peter, we're gonna be
late for my cousin's wedding. Aren't you dressed yet? - [Peter] Oh crap. Well, one of us is gonna have to change. - Some things are just facts. It is a terrible time to be a Bulls fan, England is a beautiful city, and I am an iPhone user. And I realize I am probably
putting a giant target on my back by saying that, but honestly, I'm kinda tired of having
to be politically correct, especially when it comes to smartphones. You use what you use. You like what you like. For me, that happens to be an iPhone, but because of that, I feel
like it's kinda given me the chance to sit back and
watch the OnePlus 5 launch from a different perspective. There was so much hype
going into the launch, maybe too much for their own good, and once the phone dropped,
it got crapped all over, and maybe some of that was unwarranted. So what I wanna do is kinda break down the five biggest complaints
I've seen surrounding the OnePlus 5 and also
hopefully, shed some light on those complaints, as well. And hands down, the number
one comment I've seen is that it looks very, very
similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. So being an iPhone user and specifically, an iPhone 7 Plus user, yes, there are no doubt
similarities between these two, and honestly, I wouldn't be
surprised if someone mistake the OnePlus 5 for an
iPhone 7 Plus in the wild, but surprisingly, I
actually prefer the feel of the OnePlus 5 in my hand
over the iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 Plus has always
felt a little slippery and a little bulky. If you wear it in shorts, forget about it. And with the OnePlus 5
being lighter and thinner, I actually think it is a better
in-hand experience overall. So next up on number two,
one of the biggest complaints I've seen is that the
OnePlus 5 camera sucks. And honestly, it's not so
much that the camera sucks. It's more so that it's just not better than the best out right now. I think OnePlus really needed
to hit a home run with this, and had they done that, I don't think they would've been beaten up as badly as they have been. The Google Pixel is a great example. It is a flagship phone at a flagship price that is clearly missing a
ton of high-end features, but because of the pure android experience and because the camera was so good, it was pretty well received. As far as dual cameras
on the OnePlus 5 go, I think portrait mode works well. It's not better than the iPhone 7 Plus, but I think really the
bigger complaint I've seen is the fact that they wish
OnePlus 5 would've went with a wide angle lens
instead of a telephoto lens as the second option. Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus user where I'm kind of in the same boat with that second lens
being a telephoto option, I tend to agree, LG kinda nailed it with
their dual camera system. The wide angle is much, much more useful. So with that, I kinda wish OnePlus would've gone that route, as well. Now jumping from pictures to video, one of the things I noticed right away was the lack of OIS, and yes, there a software version of that, but it is nowhere near
as good as the real deal, and I think using an
iPhone 7 Plus for so long, that has gotta be one
of my favorite features, how well that video stabilization works. So from a camera package as a whole, I can kind see why OnePlus
got a little beat up for that. Next up on number three, the
biggest complaint I've seen is that it is only a 1080p display. Where, OnePlus, is my 1440p display, and where is my super
tall 18:9 aspect ratio? So yeah, I totally see that point, but I also don't see it as
the biggest deal in the world. Yes, the Galaxy S8 does a 1440p display, but it also shifts in a
1080p mode out of the box for better performance. The iPhone 7 Plus has a 1080p display, which I think looks fantastic, and yeah, you do lose out on that extra
tall 18:9 aspect ratio screen like on the LG G6 or technically, the 18 1/2:9 aspect
ration in the Galaxy S8, but those phones cost considerably
more than the OnePlus 5. Now next up on number five,
one of the biggest complaints I've seen is that the OnePlus
5 has no water resistance, and again, kinda jumping
back to the camera, if they had done a better job with that, I don't think the water
resistance would've been as big of a deal. Again, like I mentioned, the Google Pixel was not water resistant, but
because the camera was so good, because the experience was so good, it kinda got a pass for that. Could they have included water resistance with the OnePlus 5? Absolutely, but that
kinda ties into the fifth and final complaint I've
seen about this phone, and that is the fact that it
is simply too expensive now. Now, from that standpoint,
that is where I kinda disagree with everything. The OnePlus 5 starts at $479. You compare that to the iPhone 7 Plus, the Galaxy S8 Plus, the Google Pixel, those are all $700 plus. The iPhone 7 Plus, which is $770, only has 32 gigabytes of storage. Same thing with the Google Pixel XL. We can talk specs and benchmarks
or cheating benchmarks all day, but at the end of
it, what really matters, I think the best thing about
the OnePlus 5 is OxygenOS. It is clean. It is very similar to a
pure Google experience but also very useful at the same time. You have USBC, super fast
storage inside the phone, and hand down, one of the coolest features with the OnePlus 5 is their
Dash Charge technology, which is lightening quick. The unfortunate thing with
OnePlus is I kinda look at them as that person in a relationship who tried so, so hard at the beginning to go above and beyond, meet
these crazy expectations, but over the long term, just
couldn't simply keep that up. The problem though is that
second person in the relationship or I this case, the consumer
and the tech audience becomes a little bit jaded and maybe a little less
appreciative of the efforts now. Ultimately, the way I
look at the OnePlus 5 is kinda like a la carte cable. If there are channels and
features you don't want, you leave them off and
ultimately save money. In this case, if you don't
need water resistance, if you don't need a 1440p display, if you don't need an extra
tall 18:9 aspect ratio, then maybe you wanna
consider the OnePlus 5. On the other hand, maybe
you want those features, maybe you really want that better camera. Then I would step up to
the Galaxy S8, the LG G6, the iPhone 7 Plus, but maybe
those features aren't worth it to you and you wanna save $300, the OnePlus 5 is not bad at all. 
So after a couple days with this phone the biggest thing that I get out of the way is the fact that the S9 lineup As a whole is by no means a major overhaul compared to the S8 but more so a refinement. I will say that as far as what comes inside the box It's a little bit of a golfclap to Samsung because there is a ton of stuff packed inside outside of the QuickStart guide which I'm not sure how many people out there still used, you get a fast charge power brick, a usb c to usb a cable, a usb a to usb c adapter, a pair of AKG headphones and a SIM card tool. Now the AKG headphones they sound good They're not amazing But the bigger statement here from Samsung is that they've held their ground and in a year where headphone jacks are few and far between That is here on the Galaxy S9 And I know that is a huge deal to a lot of people out there. The biggest cosmetic difference you'll probably notice with the S9 and S9+ is the fingerprint reader, which is now right smack under the camera no longer awkwardly to the right where you have to move your finger around and guess this here of course is midnight black or is it black camo from dbrand and I'm not gonna tell you some silly reason that you need this because your phone is slippery you're gonna want it because it looks awesome. (link below) Now the one thing that I think is gonna get Overlooked with the S9 and S9+ has got to be the display, still features that same super tall 18 and 1/2 on an infinity display. But after using the Pixel 2 XL and the iPhone 10 coming back to this you forget how freaking good it is. In this case with the Galaxy S9+ It is a 6.2 inch display with a 2960 by 1440 resolution The Galaxy S9 is gonna be slightly smaller at 5.8 inches But it's gonna retain the same resolution The S9+ in a way is almost gonna give you Note 8 like features without the S-pen if that makes sense you have dual cameras a main, wide-angle lens It's gonna feature the dual aperture that is shared across the regular Galaxy S9 and then the secondary lens it's gonna give you two times zoom Honestly one of the biggest things you've probably heard surrounding the Galaxy S9 it's going to be that variable aperture camera That's where it'll adapt and lower lighting conditions and switch from F 2.4 down to F 1.5 a lot of people out there love it. But at the same time some people say it's a little bit of a gimmick which isn't entirely crazy. Yes, it is super fun to look at especially when you're in promo when you can switch back and forth. In fact here is a super close-up slow-mo shot at 200 FPS Strangely satisfying right what does that actually translate to? So to give an example of how much extra light is being light and what I did was lock everything off in Pro Mode this shot here is at F, 1.5. And with the exact same settings - changed into F 2.4 You can see how much darker the image is Conversely what I did was change shutter speed automatic that way It would compensate and keep the exposure around the same with the F 1.5 compared to 2.4 You can see there's a little bit more of that blurred out shallow depth-of-field It's not a ton, but it is definitely there from there in a more extreme low-light situation to paint the picture here It's about 6:15 p.m.. Well after sunset. You can see pretty much The only thing lighting my face is the phone itself to kind of replicate the same idea I locked everything off took one shot at F 2.4 Where you can see that kind of matches how everything looked outside, but then bumping that up to F 1.5? You can see there's a huge difference in light the one downside it will say though Especially as we look closer at this picture is the entire image as a whole is a little bit soft compared to F 2.4 So it's kind of trade-off you get more light, but at the same time the image isn't as sharp so this is a mind-blowing game-changing revolutionary feature, I would say definitely know But at the same time it doesn't mean we should take away from the overall performance of the s-plane camera Which is really good low-light performance is fantastic and of course when you're shooting during the day you're gonna get some Amazing photos you have greater dynamic range It's super sharp the colors are beautiful And I will say as a whole the camera app is much more intuitive and easier to use With previous Galaxy camera UI is a little clunky a little hard to navigate But with this you simply swipe over from set into setting which is way easier to use so the camera is fantastic But that other feature you most likely heard about as well It's got to be that 960 fps slow-motion video that I sent that one guy out there a comment yes I realized this feature is not brand new or exclusive to the galaxy s 9 and it was on Sony phones last year But at the same time it doesn't make it any less awesome that it's here There are actually two ways to operate this you can manually trigger it which is gonna give you a very short burst of recording or You can set it to automatic where it's gonna look for that action and then record that and then automatically put that in slow motion I will say though with slow motion as a whole especially when you're dealing with the sensor size on a camera you need a ton Of light to really make it look good in this case me and which were outside getting closer to sunset so we didn't have the most light in the world and you can see the results with the footage are a little bit grainy, but still pretty damn cool nonetheless From now the other thing if the camera subsequently leads to is going to be a are Emoji which I have a ton of mixed feelings on it essentially scans your face and turns you into this 3d Trackable bitmoji looking creation this kind of looks like me which is a little bit creepy I'm not sure how many people will actually dig that I think more so What people will end up use and it's going to be the gif feature where it turns you into? A moving gif which is actually kind of cool? I will say though Samsung's choice of animals are a little bit weird we have this rabbit looking thing We have this blue creature, which I'm kind of thinking is maybe a dog, so they are emoji now from there These are nubs of difference with the s 9 + s 9 + are going to be stereo speakers and as far as what that translates to over the s 8 Here is a comparison of the s 9 + with stereo speakers and the single speaker on the S 8 I will say it's not mind-blowing or again a reason why you need to go sell your Galaxy s8 to upgrade just for this feature alone But there's definitely different. I'd say the biggest thing I notice is probably gonna be the fullness Especially when you're consuming media you have sound firing both ways and that kind of translates into a fuller more Immersive audio experience as opposed to a noticeable louder experience If that makes sense either way though if you've never used stereo speakers on a smartphone it is awesome So there's my impressions on the galaxy s 9 plus after a couple days Hopefully enjoyed the video if you did and you are feeling like being awesome make sure you guys smash that like button Definitely I spend some more time with us for the full more in-depth review So there's anything you want see covered or you have questions drop me a line down below This is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here. Have you ever been in a situation where you knew there was
something you shouldn't buy, like, really shouldn't buy, but
you still wanted to anyways? That is this, the $200 wireless charger that you don't need, but still kinda want. So, this was in my Amazon
cart for a long time. I went back and forth, "Should
I buy this, should I not?" It looked interesting, one, aesthetically, it was really unique, not really like any other
wireless chargers out there, and two, there's a 22,000
milliamp-hour battery inside, so in theory, once this is charged up, it us truly wireless where you
can place anywhere you want. I think what finally won me over is, on the Amazon page, the first
bullet point you see is, "Scandinavian Design,"
I'm thinking to myself, "Well, Scandinavia
brought us Swedish Fish, "Ikea, PewDiePie." That is a really impressive list. I then go down this weird rabbit hole and find the five greatest
Scandinavian inventions, the first of which being
the heart rate monitor, which is kind of a big deal. Two is the speaker, are you kidding me? You are more than likely using a speaker to listen to this video right now. They also invented the
three-point seat belt, that's kind of a huge deal. - The best cheese cutter in the galaxy. - The Tripp Trapp chair, I'm not exactly sure what that is, but four out of those
five were clearly enough to get me to buy the wireless charger. Now, going into this, I wanted to be as objective as possible. Without a doubt, the number one reason why you wouldn't buy this is the price. 200 bucks is a lot of money. On the low end of the spectrum, I've covered a dual-wireless
charger that is 25 bucks. Two phones, it's not flashy,
it's not truly wireless, so you have to be plugged into a wall, but it does the job and you can buy eight of those for this price. Now, aside from aesthetic
and its unique look, the reason I can get
behind this is the fact that I think it's really geared to kind of stay in one spot. What I mean by that is, picture this. You have someone over, they need to charge because that always happens. You be the nice guy or girl, you offer them a battery bank or even a smaller wireless
charger like this. The problem with that is that it's small and kinda screams, "Take me, move me, "and put me in a place you're
not gonna find me after." With this, yeah, it is truly wireless so you have that freedom of flexibility to put it anywhere you want,
but I think for the most part, the idea is to put it in an entrance way, in your kitchen, and it's big
enough to where someone's not gonna put it in their pocket or accidentally walk off with it. What's also cool with this
is that it's kinda stealthy, and at first glance, I don't
think anyone would know or guess that this is a piece of tech. It looks like somewhere
where you place your keys or kitchen items, and
then all of a sudden, bam, you got a secret,
hidden, wireless charger. Now, to turn this on, the power button is located on the bottom, and the initial reaction might be, "Why the heck would I wanna flip "this upside-down every time I use it?", but the way it works is,
once you set your phone down, you actually push down, that
engages the power button, and then turns everything
on, which is kind of smart. The one weird thing I'll say, though, is these LED lights are
supposed to indicate the amount of power or charge left inside. I'm not sure if I got a faulty unit, or it was just kind of a weird design, but it's not super clear or easy to read. Mine kinda looks like there's this film or plastic that doesn't wanna come off, and maybe that's the case. At certain angles, it
also looks like maybe those LEDs bounce off a
table or reflective surface, but overall, I would've liked
to have seen something clear and maybe at the top of the unit. This one here is called Deep Sea, which it looks really nice,
especially when you get that right angle of light
that bounces off of it, but on top of that, it
also comes in Walnut, Sunburst, and Maple as well. The one thing I wouldn't
expect with this, though, are fast charging times. I think for the most part, that's kind of expected
with wireless chargers. If you need that fast, quick charge, hands-down, plugged in is the way to go. With an iPhone 10 in about 40 minutes, I went from about 15% up to 35% battery. It's not a huge jump, but again, I think the thing to remember is that this isn't gonna be your main form of charging in your house,
more so just a cool bonus, like, somewhere in your kitchen. Now, again, this is intended to charge two phones simultaneously. Here's an iPhone X
next to a Galaxy Note 8. It works, but I could see if you had two large phones next to each other, it might get a little bit crowded. Overall, it's cool, I
like it, I would use it, but at $200, it's a
little bit of a hard sell. Potentially, if it was
priced closer to 129 bucks or 149 bucks, it would be a
little bit easier to swallow, but at that price, you can definitely get a lot more for your buck. That being said, though,
if you like the looks, if you like the uniqueness of it, if you like the idea of having something that is truly wireless,
the idea with this is, it's supposed to last around a week or two without even charging it, so in that case, it works as advertised. The only problem with it, again, is that it's pricey as hell. Now, I would love to hear your opinion, is it worth the money, or, "Hell no, I would
never pay that much money "for a wireless charger"? If you're on that side of the camp, I'll post some links
to some of my favorites that won't break the bank. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video. If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to go-- - Can you do this? - On that like button. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. (laughing)
Come on. - [Man] You don't know how to sit. 
(soft instrumental music) - [Siri] It's currently clear
and 78 degrees in Los Angeles. Temperatures are heading down from 78 degrees this
afternoon to 57 tonight. - Lights on - [Siri] Lights on. (upbeat instrumental music) - Here guys, Jonathan
here, and this is HomePod. So, I've got a chance to
spend the last of couple days with this, a lot of thoughts,
a lot of impressions. The first of which being, it is way smaller than you might think. Out of the box, there's
not a whole lot goin' on. You get the HomePod itself,
a quick start guide, and a singular Apple sticker. I will say though, sometimes
it's the attention to detail, the small things that
really make a difference. The fabric on the power
cord matches the HomePod, and that's kinda cool. Now setting up the HomePod is one of the nicer
parts of the experience. If you've ever used AirPod,
it's kinda similar to that, where you stick your phone out, a little HomePod icon
pops up, you connect, you're never diving through any menus, you let it do its thing, and shortly thereafter you are good to go. (upbeat instrumental music) Also, first impressions,
the Siri animation towards the top of the
HomePod, which you will see throughout this video,
is really well done. I think it rounds out
the entire experience. Now when that Siri
animation isn't engaged, you can use the top of
HomePod for touch controls. Single tap to play a song, or
single tap to pause a song. Double tap to go next song,
triple tap to go previous song. Press and hold will activate
Siri, and then you do, of course, have your
volume up and volume down. So from there I'm gonna
jump into sound quality, and I know some people
aren't gonna wanna hear this, but the HomePod sounds
really freaking good. (upbeat instrumental music) Now, I'm not gonna say
it's this life changing, breathtaking, magical experience, but when you see the size of HomePod and then you hear the
sound that comes out of it. To me what stands out is, not
only the amount of low end, but the quality of low end
that comes out of HomePod. When you hear how much
bass comes out of a speaker this size, that by itself
is really surprising, but what's more impressive
is no matter how loud you turn this up, and believe
me, it gets really loud. It still doesn't break up or distort. Now design-wise, HomePod as
a speaker is kind of unique. For starters, the woofer,
which is responsible for that low end, you would think would
be placed towards the bottom, but with the HomePod, it is
actually placed towards the top. Then from there, the tweeters,
which normally you would think would be placed towards the top, those are on the bottom. You have a total of six
microphones surrounding HomePod And lastly, Apple's A8 chip, which is doing the processing, it's listening to the
environment, adapting to realtime, and while things may
seem a little unorthodox, whatever they're doin'
seems to be working. Now HomePod was geared to work first and foremost with Apple Music
and it does really well. To give you an idea of
how loud this thing is-- (soft instrumental music)
(voice silenced) Play Porter Robinson. - [Siri] Alright, let's
hear it, Porter Robinson. ♪ Is anyone there ♪ ("Sad Machine" by Porter Robinson) (voice and music silenced) - Turn the volume to 75%. (music gets much louder) (voice and music silenced) Turn the volume to 100% (music gets louder) (voice and music silenced) Turn the volume to 10%. Still, was kinda a good example of how well the microphones
work within a HomePod. One, the music was really loud, and two, I'm actually talkin' away
from HomePod facin' this way and it still picked up
my voice really well. Now initially I was under
the impression that if you use Spotify, you're kinda
out of luck with HomePod. That it was really only
geared for Apple Music, but not only can you AirPlay from Spotify, which I'll do now. You can actually use the voice controls to change everything. So--
(voice silenced) Next track. (soft instrumental music) So you can see, well, you
definitely want to use Apple Music to get the
most out of HomePod. If you do use Spotify, there's
a lot you can do with it. Next, one of the biggest reasons you might be interested
in HomePod is HomeKit. So far, testing out HomePod with HomeKit has worked extremely well. Behind me, I have a couple
of Philips Hue lights, and then a non-Philips
light bulb right there. And what I love about it is the ability to control things
individually or altogether. Now beyond that was
kinda cool is the ability to group things together
and create scenes. So imagine, you walk into
your kitchen, you say, Hey Siri, good morning. It turns on your lights,
opens your blinds, starts your coffee. That is all possible. So to give an example of
what a scene looks like, I've paired these two
Philips lights with this non-smart lamp here that's
goin' through a smart outlet. And I've created the scene
called, put out the fire. (soft music)
(voice silenced) Put out the fire. - [Siri] Put out the fire. You got it. - Conversely, if I wanted
those lights back on. (voice silenced) Turn on the lights. - [Siri] All set. (voice silenced) - Turn on that cool lamp. - [Siri] Done. - For now, you can note
how quick the changes are. (voice silenced) Turn the lights blue. - [Siri] All set. - Now one down side with HomePod,
is that if you're lookin' to buy a pair of these to
combine them into stereo mode, that will not work at large. That will come later
this year with AirPlay 2. It is a free update, but it's
still a little disappointing that it didn't happen at launch,
because that was honestly one of the most enticing
features of HomePod. Now it's also worth mentioning that if you don't have AirPlay 2, you
don't have multi-room control. So, if you wanted to
have different HomePods in different rooms throughout
your house, you gotta wait until AirPlay 2 comes out for
them to talk to each other. When it does come out and
HomePods can talk to each other, you can play the same song
throughout your house, or have independent control
and play something in your kitchen that is completely
different from your living room. But again, if that's something
that you were looking forward to, that is not
available here at launch. Also, I did see some
initial fear that Siri was going to be extremely
limited with HomePod launch, but from what I can
tell, you can send text, you can make calls, create
reminders, create notes. So as far as that goes, the
really big drawback, again, is the lack of AirPlay 2,
which enables stereo mode. Aside from that, those are my initial
impressions on HomePods. It's got a surprisingly
great sound, it's loud, there's a ton of low end,
it works great with HomeKit. There are definitely some really, really important features that
are missing at Pod launch. But overall, if you pick one
up, I think you will dig this. Now if you wanna see this
compared against Google Home next, let me know by smashing that like button. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. (soft instrumental music) 
- Oh, look at that, he's so fine. (singing) So you ran
into my former fiance. - Hello. - (singing) So I saw
him dancing last night. You're not recording it. Don't do that. - [Cameraman] No, I'm not
(beep) - Today's video is sponsored by Anker. They have a holiday giveaway
goin' on with over 1300 prizes. For your chance to win, make sure you guys hit the link below. Here guys. Jonathan here and we are back
with the best tech under 50, just in time for the holidays. Got a special guest, my friend Theresa. - Hi, how are you? - Do you like French bulldogs? - Yes I do. - Do you like bluetooth speakers? - Yes, I do. - Then get excited because we got the
Aerobull French Blue Dog. - [Off Camera] Blue dog? - French Bull Dog bluetooth speaker. Now I think my favorite thing about this has gotta be the window sound. (beep) (static) (bongos) (xylophone) There we go. (chuckles) You ever use Windows XP? - Yes I do, all the time. - [Computer] Confirmed. (heavy rock music) - Can I ask you what song
would you like to hear? - How about Bruno Mars, Uptown? - You're gonna get me demonitized. - I would've never known
that was a speaker. - Quality. ♪ Say my name, you know who I am ♪ - Fabulous. ♪ Hot damn ♪ Wanna make you get up, honey. ♪ Break it down. ♪ And go. (claps) ♪ Girls hit you hallelujah ♪ Ow. ♪ Girls hit you hallelujah ♪ Ow. ♪ Girls hit you -- ♪ I'm gonna get it. ♪ Don't believe me just watch ♪ (clapping) - Youtube.com/tld, Subscribe now. - Tld, they don't know. - Tom Larry David. - Theme park, remember. - So if that doesn't sell you, I'm not sure what else would. If you need some French Bull
Dog bluetooth speaker fun in your life like Theresa, check out the link below. So next up are the Anker SoundBuds Lite, which are wireless headphones that are not only under $50 bucks, right now they are under 30 and are perfect for anyone looking for a pair of active headphones. Now when I say active, I mean people who are looking
to take these on a walk, on a run, working out at the gym, riding a bike. They're lightweight and
they're also water resistant. So if you sweat a lot, you're not gonna have to
worry about wrecking these. Now if you're someone
out there who gets crazy, gets jacked, like Austin has at the gym, has a tendency to knock
off their headphones or their earbuds. This neckband is gonna help ensure they don't fall off your neck. Speaking of the devil. I was talking about
getting jacked at the gym, like this man. He needs some Soundbuds Lite in his life. - Do I? - Yes. - [Cameraman] And give
him some macho beans. - Nope. - [Cameraman] Or some mache beans. - That's a well dressed man right there. Bye Evans. What's a nice little
touch with these though is the ear buds themselves. They have magnetic tips so if you touch them together
like Tim Cook and Bono, they're gonna connect and that's gonna be really useful when you have these
stored away in your bag. Now as far as sound quality, these aren't gonna blow your mind, but again the big thing to remember is these are under $30 bucks. With that said, they sound way better than
you expect for that price. You get a decent amount of low end, the isolation is really solid. But again the big selling
point with these is one, that neckband's gonna
keep these on your head, two, they're water resistant. So not only do you not
worry about sweating, you can take these in the sauna and last but not least, these things are $25 bucks. So they are super affordable. So next up, this USB drive is kind of genius. It almost looks like this
ninja star type thing, but what it is is this Swiss Army knife of USB drives. It has every connector
you could possibly need. So of course you have your
standard USB A connector, but you also have micro USB, USB C and then lightening. But what's cool with that is
that it's also MFI certified. So this is kind of an
awesome way to transfer files between any kind of device, whether it's Windows, Android,
MAC, IOS or even Linux. It's also kind of the perfect tech gift if you're not sure which phone they use or which computer they have because the beautiful thing about this is that it's gonna work with
pretty much whatever they have. Now the one potential down side with this is the speeds on this aren't crazy fast. But again, with a 32 gigabyte capacity, your more likely not to be
transferring giant files back and forth. And more importantly, at the price point $35 bucks, this thing is awesome. So next, with more and more smart phone
supporting wireless charging, the need and want for
wireless charging tech has definitely gone up. This is a dual wireless
charging pad from YOLIKE and it's kind of an awesome deal. It comes in under $30 bucks, which is honestly cheaper than most single charging
pads out there now. Now what's kind of an
added bonus with this is that it comes with a
power adapter in the box. And with most wireless chargers, you have to buy that separately. So with that factored in, that makes that $30 dollar price point really freaking good. So if you have a household
with multiple smartphones that support wireless charging, this is kind of a must have. Plus because you're getting 2 in 1, that's gonna help minimize cables and keep things nice and clean. Whether you throw this on your desk, next to your bed, in the kitchen, it's very simple and very minimal. So it's gonna look good no matter what. And again, for the price, you cannot go wrong. So next up, powerstrips are definitely not the most exciting thing on the planet, but this thing is freaking cool. Now honestly, aside from that crazy French Bull Dog bluetooth speaker, this episode almost could've been called the best tech under $35 bucks because this is also on sale
for just under $32 dollars. See you have four USB ports for charging which is awesome, but those four outlets you get are not only Amazon Echo compatible, they also work with Google Home, which is crazy cool. So why I think it's
kind of an awesome deal is I've seen single smart outlets that cost more than this alone. So why you may potentially
want a smart outlet or outlets in your home is simple. It gives you control over non smart items. Whether it's a lamp
without a smart lightbulb, your Christmas tree, your coffeemaker, this gives you control. Not only with your smartphone, but also with your voice. Speaking of Google Home and Amazon Alexa, I believe you can still
scoop up an Echo Dot and Google Home Mini for
under $50 bucks right now. So we'll link those along with everything I talked about down below. Aside from that, thank you guys so much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed the video. If you did and you feel
like being awesome, make sure to go Dancing
Theresa on that Like button and she was amazing. We gotta hang out again. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (beep) - Hi, how are you? Welcome to this demonstration of this wonderful speaker. Anybody that's a dug, dog lover would really appreciate it. The artistic creation is -- (coughing) wonderful. - I'm sorry, I lost it. (coughing) I screwed you up. I screwed you up. (laughing) (coughing) 
- Today's video is
sponsored by Oculus Rift. Yo, guys. Jonathan here. The holidays are here, and today we are looking at
three awesome tech gifts, all under 500 bucks, and kicking off that
list is the Oculus Rift. So if you've been looking
to jump into the VR world like my boy Ralphy, it is
more affordable than ever, and speaking of that, the Oculus Rift is
currently on sale for 379. Not sure how long that's gonna last, but if you're interested
in scooping one up, I will drop a link down below. Now, inside the box, there is
so much stuff packed inside, everything you could possibly
need apart from the PC itself, from an X-Box controller
to an Oculus remote, down to the double freaking A batteries. Now what's cool with this is you can either play sitting down or standing up. Myself, I prefer the freedom of standing, but the choice is totally up to you. Now the Oculus headset
itself is kind of badass. You have a 2160 by 1200 resolution, so that crazy VR view you're scene
is super sharp, super crisp. And you have a built-in
headset, which kind of puts the cherry on top of that
super immersive experience. What I love about this is the flexibility. So if you're worried about your room size, or if you have enough space, you can take those censors and move them so they can perfectly
complement your set up. (chuckles) Ralphy just tore that guy
apart for those curious. As you could see, those gaming controllers are not only a ton of fun. They are really responsive and kind of just take that gaming
experience to the next level. You will, of course, need a Oculus... You will, of course, need
an Oculus compatible PC, which I'm sure my buddy Austin Evans has built about 500 of those. So I'll drop a couple
links of those down below. And again, remember: this is
currently on sale for 379, so if you wanna scoop one up, make sure you jump on it fast. So, next up, keeping
that gaming theme going, the Nintendo Switch is hands down one of the hottest pieces of tech of 2017 and would make an amazing gift. Now, what I love about the Switch is the flexibility of being able to play either handheld or docking it to a TV. Honestly, most of the time, you're gonna find
yourself playing handheld. But having that option
is a beautiful thing. Now, back when the Switch
initially came out, a potential reason not to
buy one was a lack of games. But now that time has passed, that is completely not the case. You, of course, have game of the year, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2, and of course, Super Mario:
Odyssey, which is amazing. So what's kind of a little awesome bonus is those Joy-Cons will also
double as a second controller, just in case you want
to play with a friend. Speaking of Joy-Cons, they
actually work really well and make for a surprisingly awesome
kick-back gaming experience. But if you need something
a little more traditional, or a little more serious, you can also scoop up a Pro Controller, and I'll link some of the best down below. Now a couple months ago, these were nearly impossible to find. They were sold out everywhere. But since then stock has slowly improved. I think Amazon should have them, but if you wanna find one locally, I've had luck at Best Buy and also Target. Now last up, this camera almost doesn't seem real for the price. The Panasonic FZ80 is
currently on sale for 350 bucks and will shoot 4K video up
to 30 frames per second. So with this, you have
an 18.1 megapixel censor, and a ridiculous 20 to 12
hundred milimeter zoom. Now granted, yes, that is optical zoom, but the fact that you
have that at your disposal for that price is crazy. So if you wanted to pick up a camera to shoot 4K videos,
whether it's for YouTube, or just to shoot for fun, this is a fantastic starting point. Really, the way you
gotta look at this camera is kind of the all-in-one
everything camera, which is a great starting point, but the one potential downside is you're not gonna be able
to upgrade the lens later. But really, for that price point, it shouldn't really be an issue. The touch interface is great. You have built-in WIFI, and it's gonna be a pretty
solid stills camera. And again, yeah, smart phones, they do a great job with
photos and video these days, but the idea here is that it's gonna get you into that
photo and video world. It will get you familiar
with the controls, the interface, and more
importantly, put you in that different frame of mind
when you're shooting video. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed the video. If you did, and you are feeling awesome, make sure you go hi-zen
tosh on that 'like' button. Again, everything featured in this video is linked down below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Today's video is sponsored by Anker. Yo guys, Jonathan here. Maybe you picked up an
iPhone X, maybe you didn't. But if you did, today this
is the video for you because I'm covering some of the
best accessories you can pick up, and I'm kicking it
off with a question I get quite frequently. That is, what is the
best wireless charger. Now there are a ton of
different options out there, but the one I'm recommending,
is the one I've been personally using for the
last couple of weeks. This is the Mophie wireless charging base. It's not fancy, it's not
flashy, but it definitely does the job. What I like about it specifically
is one it's very compact, and two everything is connected,
so you're not going to need to carry multiple parts. So when you combine those
two factors together, in addition to making a
great option for your desk, it's also great for traveling as well. Now on the technical side this will output up to 7.5 watts in terms
of wireless charging. I believe it's actually more
than Apple currently supports on the 8, the 8+ and the X. But it's nice to know when
they kind of kick that open and unlock it you will be
supported with this charger. As far as how it works, there's
not really too much to say. You place the iPhone down
on the charger, it charges, and that's about it. It's been really consistent,
honestly has worked pretty much every single time for me. Next if you've been looking
to pick up a Bluetooth speaker for your iPhone X or just a
Bluetooth speaker in general the UE Wonderboom is one of my favorites. Not going to lie, it kind of
looks like a mini home pod, let me know if you agree. Now this Wonderboom comes
in some fancy pants colors. Cashmere pink, fireball
red, lilac, phantom black, stone gray, and sub-zero blue. You get 10 hours of battery life. Surprisingly really fantastic
sound especially for the size, and not only is it water
proof, not only is it portable, but it's durable too - [Sound Guy] Dude. - That the inadvertent drop test. Now one thing I don't normally
test out with Bluetooth speakers, maybe I should, is the range. Range is very important. So we're going to start that today. (Music playing) Now I'm leaving my iPhone
over there unattended, probably not the smartest thing, but. (music continues) (music stops) (music continues) (music stops) (music continues) So like, that's like the cut off. I have no idea how far
that is technically, maybe. So it's like 108, 110. That's a good eye Rich. So that's the other enticing
thing with the UE Wonderboom is the fact that it is water resistant. Here I am, as you can
tell next to some water. Got it playing right now. And we're going to dip it in. Man that is some nice
refreshing cold arrowhead water. Not really. Either way though, works
well, looks even cooler. Give a little volume test. I mean what else could you ask for, it's portable, looks great,
comes in a few different colors, water resistance. It might be the perfect Bluetooth
speaker for your iPhone X. Now as far as cases go, I
actually enjoy Apple's official iPhone X case. They come in a billion different colors, all of which DetroitBORG has. So if you want to check
all those colors out, make sure you check out his video. But on top of that, they fit
well, they don't add a ton of weight. But the problem with them
is one, they don't add a ton of protection. Two they are expensive as sh- - [Rich] Demonetized. - So with that said if you
don't got a ton of money to spend on a case, this the
Anker Karapax shield case is $7.99. That's one of the cheapest I've seen. Beyond what's cool with
this case is the cutouts. Every single one of them are razor sharp. The dual lenses, the mute
switch, the lightning port, the grills, they are
all very very precise. And I really really like
the buttons on this. The volume up, the volume down. That new and improved bigger,
badder, better side button is super clicky. What's cool with this is
one, it's a two layer case so you're going to get a
little bit of added protection especially for the price. Two, we got some carbon fiber
elements, so if you like that look, it's going to be perfect for you. And three, we're going to
get that lip protection. So I personally like to set
my phone down like that, but I've had a bad habit of
scratching the crap out of my phone. But with this, it's going
to give you both back and front protection. I don't really want to do this, but. It didn't sound good. So there you have it. Didn't matter if I would
have dropped it anyways. But you can actually buy 125
of these cases for the price of an iPhone X. So maybe you want to have a back catalog. Maybe you want to go
through these like crazy. Check out the link below. Next up we are talking
headphones for the iPhone X. And this is the Beats Studio 3. And I know, every time Beats is mentioned, an audiophile out there
has a heart attack. But, these actually are quite alot better than you might think. One, the biggest biggest
attractive thing with this is the W1 chip. So just like the airpods,
and how easy those connect, they improve battery life. This is inside the Beats Studio 3. So this is my first time
pairing these headphones to this iPhone X. Powered them on, this icon pops up. Press connect, we're going
to wait a few seconds, and just like airpods, we are there. I really like the fact that
you instantly see battery life on your headphones in the icon here. So it's just a really seamless experience. So these are red, but the
also come in matte black white, procelain rose,
blue, and shadow gray; not to be confused with space gray. The shadow gray actually has
a nice little gold accent too, so that's kind of nice. Beyond that, what is especially
cool with these is I believe they're the first pair of Beats
by Dre headphones to include adaptive noise cancellation. With that, you're going to
get 22 hours of battery life. But if you want to turn that
off into low power mode, you can actually squeeze
40 hours out of these guys. From there though, if you
happen to wear these out and blow through that battery
life, what's really impressive is 10 minutes of charge
time is going to get you 3 hours of playback. So that is crazy cool. Honestly, I think my only
complaint with these is the fact that for whatever reason,
clearly they are designed to to be used with the
iPhone, they are still using a micro USB port. So while USB-C would have been nice, I also would have settled
for lightning because that way it would have been
one less cable to carry with the iPhone X. The last thing you're probably wondering is how do they sound. Honestly I was surprised with
how the sound quality was. I think Beats have kind
of become over bashed and over criticized as far as audio quality. But if you check out the
reviews I'm not just saying it, there's a lot of people
who really enjoy these. Are they the best? Are they audiophile
quality headphones, no. But they are very impressive, and they work extremely
well with the iPhone X, also 8's and 8+ as well. So last up is actually the smallest product out of the bunch. This is the native union key, actually one of my favorite
tech products of all time. It is compact, and I think
why I like it the most is because it's on your keychain, unless you are prone to
always loosing your keys, you are more than likely
going to have a cable with you especially because people
like to steal these. So how it works is you have
the USB-A version on one side. In this particular case
the lightning connector on the other, but they also
come in micro-USB as well as USB-C. So whatever phone you
have they got you covered. This is a very nice looking navy color. But there's a ton of
different variations as well. From there besides the fact
that again, it's portable, you're always going to have it on you. I love the aesthetic, I
love the build quality, I'll make sure to drop all
the variations all the colors to the different models down below. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video. If you did and you feel
like being awesome make sure to smash that like button,
and if you missed it we are giving away a
brand new X-Box One X. You can check that out
here or again down below. This is Jonathan, and
I'll catch you guys later. I actually really enjoy Apple's
official iPhone X cases. 
- So, we got this. (beep) Yo, guys. John here and
this is the (RED) iPhone 7. It's new. It's shiny. It's different, but
should you pick one up? Now, I'm not gonna lie. I'm kind of excited to check this out. Being a Bulls fan, red has always kinda had a
special place in my heart. If you're someone out there who loves red, this might have your name on it. (lively music) So, here we have the brand new, shiny product (RED) iPhone 7. There is some nice attention to detail with the red Apple logo, the red text, and we're gonna rip this. (lively music) Sounds like a scream for mercy. (lively music) I could throw it at Ralphy, or I could throw it at Evans. (playful music) Anyways, I think I dented my box. Man, look what I did to that. Spin after spin after spin and we got some box damage. Luckily, that's not the phone. Designed by Apple in California ... Ooh! We got something red inside. In partnership with (RED), Apple will contribute a
portion of your iPhone purchase to the Global Fund to support
the HIV and AIDS program, and help deliver an AIDS free generation. So, yeah! It's kind of cool that it's going to such an awesome cause. But, to step things up I
do not just wanna donate a portion of this iPhone
to the (RED) program. So, what I did was donate the entire value to the (RED) program. And, if you wanna do the same yourself or whatever you can afford I
would drop a link down below. Back to the phone though, we're getting some
serious iPod touch vibes. And, I know this is kinda
the controversial thing. There's a lot of people
out there who wanted to see a black front with the red back. And, I think I'm kinda the minority here where I really like the white
front of this red iPhone. It kinda makes me really want
and hope and wish and dream of a blue iPhone. Now, I think what's
tripping me out the most and thanks to Mr. Austin Ekans for hooking up the blue iPod touch. I'm not sure why this
still exists in 2017, but I think the size difference
is what is throwing me off. This guy is four inches, with this one being the 4.7 inch iPhone. And, if you smack that
next to an iPhone 7 Plus we got some major size difference. On a serious note, I actually really dig the finish of this. It's kinda similar to
the matte black iPhone, not the jet black of course. I don't think I would want
a super glossy red iPhone. This actually looks really good. Just after spending a couple
minutes with it though, you can see how it starts
to pick up the fingerprints. So, if you do grab one of this
you're gonna wanna make sure you keep it clean. (lively music) Bringing the matte black
iPhone next to each other, you can see one other subtle difference is the silver Apple logo where we have the black Apple logo here. I just may have flipped
everyone of you off. I'm sorry. Now it is worth mention that we did see the silver
Apple logo on the silver iPhone with the white front. So, it's not exactly new
but it does look really good in contrast with the
red back on this phone. And, I'm kinda tempted to
use this as my daily driver. I hate that word. I'm gonna leave that in. I hate that word. (laughs) So, fun fact, the first ever
product (RED) Apple device was the iPod nano. This is the one with the click wheel which was announced way back in 2006 which funny enough was just months before the
original iPhone was announced. And, here we are ten years
later with a red iPhone 7. Speaking of product (RED) fun facts, did you know there was a
custom one off (RED) Mac Pro designed by Mr. Jony Ive himself which actually auctioned off
to charity for 977,000 bucks. Plus, on top of the various
product (RED) devices in the Apple store, there's
also a dedicated product page which includes a Vespa and essentially the MKBHD edition desk. So, yeah, I can see why
it would be tempting to wanna go run out and
pick one of these up. But, before you do there are
a couple things to consider. Number One. The iPhone
7 is now six months old and unless you've been
living under a rock, it is no secret the iPhone
is updated pretty much on a yearly basis. And, that means we are
about six months away from the next generation iPhone. Number Two. We are literally days away from the announcement of
the Galaxy S8 from Samsung and if they can learn from
their mistakes with the Note 7, the Galaxy S8 is looking to
be a really attractive phone. Now, conversely, maybe you
were looking to buy an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. Maybe, it fell into your upgrade cycle and if that's the case and it just happen to
coincide with the red iPhone, then yeah I would go for it. In this world of technology,
we are constantly playing the next, newer, better product
just around the corner game so I can see why it could
be a difficult decision. At the end of the day, if I had to give you a definitive answer I would probably tend to
say wait for the next iPhone and not buy this red one. Yes, it is red. It is shiny. It is new. But, it is also very similar to the past two iPhone designs and with the next one I think we're gonna expect something fresh and something new. Now, about that giveaway. I've actually teamed up
with my buddy Phillip over at Everything Apple Pro. We're giving away not just a red iPhone 7, but a red iPhone 7 Plus as well. To enter, just make sure to
subscribe at both channels. Check out his video and
I'll drop a link down below that will walk you through everything. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (beep) Did you know there is a
custom one off red Mac Pro? 
- Yo guys. Jonathan here with the
56th What's in My Bag video you've seen for CES. This one's a little different. There's a little bit of a surprise. There's a twist. And I also wanna play a game. Don't cheat. Don't scrub ahead. I want you to guess what camera you think that I brought to CES. Drop a comment down below and, again, don't cheat. Now the reason this is a
little bit of a surprise is I didn't pack this bag and, actually, I only picked this bag up
because Rich convinced me. Comere Rich. Take a seat. Why do we need to buy this bag? - [Rich] 'cause it is the
nicest bag I've ever seen. - Everything we possibly
need for CES is in this bag. Right off the bat what
I noticed with this. This is from Peak Design. It feels good. But this is actually kinda cool. So there are four, really solid aluminum ... pipes? - Latches? I think their like latches. - Latches? That's probably the better term. But how you use it is,
that'll actually ... I mean I can't get that last one, but that's how you would
adjust how to tighten this bag. And that's actually really clever, so, we are at level three right now. I'm gonna open this up. Is there a particular area or
section I should start with? - Probably at the top. - Here it comes. Don't cheat again. And, we got it. Okay, that dang extra large
cable was holding us back. This is the camera of choice. And I'm gonna say ... I'm gonna go out there
and call this the most totentially underrated camera of 2017. There's a lotta hype around RED right now. Myself included. But this actually surprised
the heck out of me. It's an amazing camera. Canon got a lot of ... - Pizzazz. (laughs) - I don't think pizzazz is the right word. But, either way, if you're a videographer, you've been looking at that
RED RAVEN, that RED SCARLET-W. Seriously consider this. I think what has sold me on the C200 has got to be Canon's autofocus. It's amazing, which you
guys will see right now. We have the Canon 5D Mark IV. This is not sponsored by Canon. These were purchased with our own money. They're just doin' some
great stuff right now. This is the appropriate side. (bulb hissing) This funny-looking gadget is
used to get dust out of tiny crevices. (bulb hissing) We have the glass selection and all these work really
well with the C200. All right Rich, you sold me on this bag. We're fittin' a lotta gear in here. Now we hadda cheat a little bit to bust out the Sound Devices MixPre-3. That is what we're using
to record audio right now. So, Rich did have to
take that out first, but, aside from that, literally everything we
have packed for this trip did fit in this bag. I'm lookin' through
holes and loops and ... Don't fall. ("Ave Maria") Yeah ... You! Why? Batteries upon batteries. We got more stuff in here? You didn't tell me about this. All right, I'm not gonna whip this out. Essentially, this is
the power for the C200 if we wanted to plug it into a wall. We got a USB-C cable, a microfiber cloth. I'm gonna zip that back up. So we got one more side. Ooh, we got SD cards,
CFast cards, excuse me. This is for the C200. These guys, a little bit
pricey, but they do the job. Oh, we got a backup audio kit. So, for those out there
looking for an inexpensive, but really high-quality lavalier set, this actually records audio
directly into the device by a micro SD, so it's super
convenient, super handy and definitely would recommend. I've just been informed, there's still more stuff in the bag. Where could it possibly be? In here?
- Right here. - Holy ... so if you wanna sssssssssssss Wow, polarizer, more batteries. If you wanted to, you could definitely squeeze a 15-inch MacBook Pro in here. That is my editing machine of choice. We got an ND filter. Which I don't need that for the C200 because that is built into the camera. That is one of the biggest
selling points there. Rich, of course, being over-prepared, but it's nice to have that, especially if we needed to use the 5D or anything like that. We are all, finally,
emptied out of this bag. But, this is a sweet, freaking bag. Peak Design nailed it. Movin' on to the lenses,
we have three here. And you might be surprised
to see no Sigma 18-35, but the reason I went with these is they actually work
in tandem with the C200. That dual-pixel autofocus,
again, is mind-blowing. First up is the trusty
24-105mm lens from Canon. It's the Mark II. It's not gonna have a
crazy f-stop, only f/4, but why I love this lens
is the stabilization. So you pair that with the
really wide focal range, and it's gonna be an awesome
lens to take on the floor. I know sometimes also
people freak out when they see the f/4, and they're gonna worry about not having that beautiful
blurred background, but when you compress
this and you zoom in, you get some pretty stellar results. From there, movin' on, this is the 16-35, and, my goodness, this
is built like a tank. It is really solid, really heavy. This doesn't have stabilization, but what it does have is a wider aperture. So this is ap 2.8, so it's
gonna do better in low light. And it's also wide
enough to the point where you're not gonna have to worry too much about that shakiness. Lastly, from there, we have the 24. This is just a prime lens. So this is gonna be
f/1.4, so you're gonna get bokeh and blurred-out background for days. This is a beautiful, fast
lens, which looks incredible and works fantastic, both with
the C200 and the 5D Mark IV. Now to quickly whip this up, I'm gonna get this C200 powered on. This battery right here. This is the BP-A60. Holy sh (censor beeps) t. I can't even say that. But, this is more battery
than you could ever need. I think it's like five
hours or somethin' so, we are not gonna need
to change this battery once on the floor when we take this out. We're gonna power that on. If you use Final Cut X, that's one of the benefits
of that program right now, is the RAW Light Support. So I've messed with that with the C200 and it works really well. For demonstration purposes right now I think I'll throw on the 24 mil, give you guys a quick little
example of that face tracking. And for real, like I said, when you guys are lookin' at the RED RAVEN or the SCARLET-W, I think
this is the most underrated camera, like I said,
for YouTube right now. If you shoot a one-man band
and you're just by yourself, the autofocus is super, super helpful. So, we are locked and loaded. I'm gonna switch on autofocus so we can take advantage
of that autofocusing. I'm gonna see if I can bring that down. So are we about f/1.8 right now? If I can get a little closer. Rich, give me that
beautiful mug over here. So, can you guys see how
that is tracking his face? Rich, come closer. This is not me doing anything. That is Rich just moving up. And the camera is doing all that work. It's pretty silent, which is a pretty
incredible feat in itself. So, here is the look
at the massive RED rig that we brought to CES that we're really shootin' on. Not really. That's the Sony RX100 Mark IV ... ? V, link in the description. Everything you guys are watchin' right now is shot on that camera. Now what's also cool
is I can tap to focus. So, right now, we have a
tap to focus on the lens, but if I wanted that lamp in the corner, tap over there, and, again, you can see where that
dual-pixel autofocus kinda really shines. It's freakin' awesome. From there though that's pretty much everythin' we're rollin'
with as far as CES goes. Again, audio's being recorded into the Sound Devices MixPre-3. We have the Sennheiser MKH 50-P48. This is one of my favorite microphones. Right now, we are using the
Road, somethin' other lab. I will link that in the description with everything featured in this video. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video. If you did, and you are
feelin' like bein' awesome, make sure to smash that like button. Also, make sure you
followin' me on Facebook. Gotta special giveaway goin' down today. Link below and I'll catch you guys later. - [Male] All right, I think
you broke that bottle. Yeah, you did. ♪ I wanna understand. ♪ 
- Yo guys, Johnathan here,
and this is iPhone 10. Now to clear things up, yes
it is spelled out iPhone X, but the correct pronunciation, Final Cut, just like Logic is iPhone 10, the number. Now this was the first
Apple event at the brand new campus too, and it was a little bit crazy. Honestly, this was
probably the hardest event to actually get your hands on a device with the iPhone 8, the 8 Plus,
and of course, the iPhone X, so huge shout-out to Mark,
Marques, Judner, Justine, this was kind of like this little collab tech team to get any kind of footage we can using all of our resources. I did manage to get some hands-on footage of both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, so if that's a comparison you want to see, let me know by dropping a like down below, and also, if you guys maybe want
to see an iPhone X giveaway. Hit that subscribe button so
you don't miss out on that. So, as far as the iPhone X,
it is a really pretty phone. There's two colors, Space Gray and Silver. I'm kind of leaning
toward Silver right now. It looks super classy,
but regardless of whatever color you go with, both
of them have black fronts, which makes sense with
that edge to edge display. Now, as far as that edge to edge panel, it is a 5.8 inch display packed inside what is really closer to and iPhone 7, now, of course, iPhone 8 body, so you're getting a much larger display and much more screen real estate than even the iPhone 7 Plus or 8 Plus, but it's sandwiched inside
a smaller container. So, that's a little
deeper into this display. It's what Apple is calling
their Super Retina Display. It's packing a resolution of 2436 by 1125, and for you pixel nerds out
there, that is a ppi of 458. Nothing really groundbreaking here, as far as resolution
goes, but what is pretty impressive is the fact that we finally have and OLED panel to the iPhone. That was maybe rumored to happen in 2018, so the fact that it's here
now is awesome, and if you've ever experienced OLED,
it is a beautiful thing. Now, the one thing you're
probably thinking is that is a giant display,
where is the home button? And unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, depending on how things work out, that home button is no
more. Rest in peace. That is completely gone from the iPhone X. So, the way you unlock
your iPhone X is simply just swiping up, and this
also double functions to go back home, so if
you're inside an app, swipe up, and it's going
to bring you right home. Now on top of that, if
you actually swipe up and pause slightly, that's going to bring you into multitasking mode. It's a little weird to
get used to at first, but once you do, I can
see it being pretty fluid. Conversely, if you now want
to access Control Center, that is definitely a little different. It's actually a downward, diagonal swipe from the top right-hand corner. Again, definitely gonna take some
time to get used to, but it works really well with the
bigger form factor display. So, you're probably wondering, how do I unlock my phone, now
that touch ID is gone? Apple's replacing that with
what they are calling Face ID. Essentially, it is facial
recognition to unlock your phone. (loud background interjection) Trust me, I fully realize
this isn't anything new. I know Samsung pushed it
last year with Note 7, then this year with the S8,
S8 Plus, and now Note 8, but it does look like Apple took some time to really execute this well. They threw some number out there, like the change of breaking through randomly through touch ID was 1 in 50,000, and I believe Face ID, the chance of breaking that was like one in a million. So, if it is that accurate,
it is definitely a good thing. Now, as far as what's packed
inside the iPhone X, it's what Apple's calling their A11
Bionic Chip, which sounds -- (white noise) In a nutshell, that is six total cores, two and then four, and that's paired with a tri-core GPU, so this thing is supposed to be really, really powerful. What's interesting,
though, is this is actually the same exact processor packed inside both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. So, even though you are kind of getting a downgrade there at a lower price point, it's still nice to know you do have that power packed inside those, as well. Now as far as the cameras on the iPhone X, this is a dual camera
system laid out vertically as opposed to horizontally
in the iPhone 8 Plus. Dual 12 megapixel sensors, but what's unique here and actually isn't new because Samsung just rolled this out with Note 8 is both lenses feature OIS. Now, why that's important is because it's going to help in
stabilization, obviously, but more importantly, low-light and just getting an overall cleaner, better image. A really big thing for Apple at this event for both the iPhone 8
Plus and the iPhone X because of those dual
lenses is Portrait Mode. On top of the improved optics, there's also improved software. So with both the iPhone
8 Plus and the iPhone X, Apple's introducing what they're
calling Portrait Lighting. It's kind of hard to really
explain and demonstrate with just a couple minutes with the phone, but the general idea
is you now have control to mess with the lighting and adjust it, just like you would in a studio, and this applies both pre- and post-photo. Beyond that, there is
now Portrait Mode on the front-facing camera, which I
think is actually a huge deal. It's a seven megapixel shoot, so you're getting increased sharpness, but the big thing here is because of their True-depth technology
for the facial unlock, that's going to reap benefits for the front-facing camera in photos, as well. So, this is also something
that applies to the iPhone 8 Plus. Here's a
quick demo of how that looks. You can see how you can
adjust things post-photograph, and I'm actually really excited to check this out in more detail. From there, with the
power of both the cameras and the actual power inside
these iPhones, the big thing this year and the focal
point was augmented reality. Got a little bit of a
chance to check things out. It's a little bit crazy. I've
never been a big fan of VR, but I can really see myself digging in and having fun with augmented reality, and both the iPhone 8,
8 Plus, and the iPhone X seem to pull it off really well because they are all using that A11 chip. Now, I don't have exact
specifics as far as the battery capacity
goes with the iPhone X, but Apple's claiming two
more hours than the iPhone 7. So, it's nice to know that
you're kind of getting iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus battery life on a much smaller form
factor, but with that bigger display. You're getting
the best of both worlds. Now, one huge implementation
across the board, across all iPhones whether it's 8, 8 Plus or the iPhone X, as a wise man Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson once said finally, wireless charging is here through the wireless Qi standard. Now I get it, I am bracing myself for you keyboard warriors out there who are going to yell at
me and say, "What the hell? That's been around for 58
years. That's not new." For the record, I am
not stating this is new or some kind of witchcraft
or Apple invented it. I'm just simply letting you know it is now available across all iPhones. And again, the biggest thing for me here is minus Apple's slightly silly name, was their air-powered,
wireless charging mat, which allows you to
charge everything at once, your iPhone, your Apple
Watch, surprisingly AirPods. So, it looks like there's a wireless charging case coming
for that soon. Yes, sir. But aside from that, I
think rather than looking at this like a negative,
if you are on that side of the team, where you
feel like you've had wireless charging forever,
this is actually a good thing because this is going to
open up a wider adoption, and that is always a good thing. Lastly, kind of round out everything as far as storage and pricing goes, the iPhone X is either coming in a 64 gig or 256 gigabyte flavor. Unfortunately, that means no 512, but it's going to start out at $999. Pre-order starts October 27th, and it will finally ship November 3rd. So, we got a little bit
of time ahead of us. So, that is iPhone X in a nutshell. Thank you, guys, very much for watching. Hopefully, you enjoyed this hands-on. Again, if you have not subscribed, you probably want to do that. Turn on notifications
because there's going to be an iPhone X giveaway very
soon. I would love to hear your favorite feature on the iPhone
X. Drop me a line down below. This is Johnathan, and
I'll catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathon here and welcome to the 2017 office tour. (upbeat music) So by far one of the biggest
changes from the last office tour, which crazy enough,
was two years ago, is the giant wall behind
me, back then it was empty, pure white, it could be
a little intimidating and overwhelming because
of how massive it looked, but since then, we've
painted it this really nice dark gray color, which I
love because it absorbs pretty much any color you throw at it. So this right here has kinda
become the product table where we shoot a lot of
the B-roll for the videos, got a couple of target
lamps in the back here, although there are some
very similar ones on Amazon, in case you're looking
for a style like this. Now as far as the lamps go,
I'm sure by now you've seen them in many of my videos,
they're both from Tomon's, this is technically the newer
model, whereas the white one has got that classic
Toy Story Pixar action but I really like the contrast,
the black and the white, and then like I was talking
about, the gray wall really absorbs the color,
so I couple hue bulbs that each of these splash
up against the wall, pair that with a light strip and you got a really cool-looking combo. Now one of the things I've
been wanting to do forever is outfit this entire
space with Philips hue and I can now say we have
successfully done that so giant shoutout to Philips for sponsoring this office tour and
making that a reality. So instantly through voice, you can turn every single light in this place. Turn off all the lights. I really like Google Home because it is super responsive at changing colors. Turn all the lights purple. And then lastly, the
Amazon Echo works fantastic if you wanna instantly change scenes. Turn on Savannah sunset downstairs. Now jumping back over here,
you're probably wondering what this crazy setup is,
and it's actually a custom Xbox console that was built by Chris over at Four Eyes Furniture. We've kinda turned it into
this little product showcase area with that classic circle LED, a really awesome-sounding
speaker from Naim, this is actually custom right
here, we got a crispy AF and a TLD logo, huge
shoutout to Dan and Lincoln over at What's Inside, we got
that cut in half golf ball action, and then this is the
giant Xbox One collection. So if you wanna see more of that, Mr. Kevin Kenson just did
this crazy ultimate Xbox setup that I'll link to here
and also down below. Moving along, this is my desk right here and the one thing you notice
is I wanted to keep things kinda uniform, so we've
used the Ikea Oppeby, and I'm probably slaughtering that name, across all of our desks here,
these are some of my favorite looking tops, I've always
really liked the glossy look from Ikea, so these are a
little bigger, a little wider, give you a little more room to play with, then that pair with the
legs, which are actually technically a dark
brown, look super classy. Back at it again is Mr. Toy
Story Pixar lamp from Tomons, little Homer Buddha, I'm not
sure if he's still available but I will link him along with
everything if I can find it down below, and recently
I've got a ton of questions on what speakers do I
use, and these right here are the Adam Artist 3,
and by far, they are my favorite-sounding pair of
speakers, they are incredible. Kinda got a little hack
here going, in the sense that these are actually
audio engine speaker stands but they work really well with the Adams. My mouse of choice right now
is the Logitech MX Master paired with a wireless
Apple Bluetooth keyboard, that is being powered
by a 2016 MacBook Pro straight into an LG Ultrafine 5k display. I talked about it a
little bit in my latest What's In My Bag video,
but this has been my setup, I'm not using an iMac,
I'm not using a Mac Pro, this is my desktop when I'm
here and then I just take the MacBook and go when I'm on the road. Now the other uniform thing
you'll se across the office are the chairs, these are
the Sayl by Herman Miller, we kinda got that white and gray look that looks really clean
and I think matches the aesthetic of the
wall, of the white desks, they're also extremely comfortable. Really like the looks of
this mesh back right here, and what's awesome with
these is you can pretty much customize them any way you
want, down to the color and the legs, the feet, and
I know it might seem crazy to invest any sort of money into a chair but if this is something you
do on a day-to-day basis, where you're sitting down
for long periods of time, then it's not that crazy. Moving this way again, along
with the tables, the chairs, we have 5k monitors across the board, so here at Ralphy's
desk, we got that lamp, MacBook Pro docked in, Ralphy's
weapon of choice right now is the Sony A6500, which
is arguably the best 4k YouTube camera out right now, this is also a secret
weapon, the Road Video Micro, which is hard to beat for the price. Over here, we got a little Lego action and if you haven't watched
Ralphy's Legos videos, they are really really good,
you should go check them out. Curiosity Box, by VSauce. Shoutout to Jake, I love you, man. So moving over here, this has
kinda become video gear world, we got C stands and sliders and
monitors, a crazy sky panel, I know some of this gear
might be a little intimidating and overwhelming, honestly
it's more of the stuff we use for the higher-end
and crazy production stuff, but really, most of the
time, these airy low-casters are what we end up using, you
could do some crazy good stuff with just a single LED bounce like this and that's honestly what I use
for most of my talking head stuff that you guys have
seen in recent videos. So it's safe to say as we've
gotten a little further into this video world, we
finally upgraded some gear, for the longest time, honestly,
we used Home Depot lights for like I'd say three or four years, so don't feel intimidated if you see any of this crazy stuff,
because you can do some really spectacular stuff with budget gear. Closing it up over here, this is Mr. Matt. As we were recording right now,
I saw this sweet transition. Get ready for it. Bam! So if that's not enough to
entertain you, and maybe pique your interest, you should
probably go watch that video while this truck outside
here interrupts me. (laughs) - Geek Squad, man!
- It's the Geek Squad, dude! - Geek Squad! You screwed me again! $200 to change a hard drive. How do you sleep at night? So closing out Matt's desk,
it's very similar to mine in the sense we've got the Pegasus, he's got those Adam Artist
3s, which are phenomenal, and then again here, just closing
out the matching desk set, we got the LG Ultrafine 5k display, ready to go at any given time
to dock a MacBook Pro into. Now before we move on, a
shoutout to Dude Perfect for making us waste many many hours shooting baskets and not making videos. Also, before I forget
and you guys yell at me, those Disney posters, found those on Etsy, printed them at Costco
where they did the canvas, the frame, everything, not
sure if they're still available but if they are, I will
link them down below. Moving over to the Ikea case of doom, this is actually meant to be a closet but we've turned it into a gear container, we've actually had this
for a couple years now. That's a lot of batteries. On the flip side, actually,
you wanna know what two many USB cables looks like? Look at that rat's nest. We've kinda got it organized. - Some Splinter action.
- Lightning, micro USB, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3. Lenses galore, and then
this mess and this mess has kinda become the tech under 50, 25, 100, testing area where I'll just
go on these Amazon rabbit holes and add many many many things to my cart, order them, test them out
to see if they make a video, and that's kinda where they live. Eh man, why are you in my mouth? Continuing along, this
is some kitchen stuff, not really anything that interesting. Water, half an eaten cookie. No pears, unfortunately. This here is kinda like
the little entertainment, get around together, watch
some YouTube video center, home to the Google Home,
couple Xbox controllers, TV, another really
awesome speaker from Name and then the Amazon Echo right here. Now this guy right here
is actually from Ikea and it is extremely useful in
terms of being a gear cart, so we got this power
extension kinda mounted here, so that's not going anywhere,
this is probably my favorite extension cable from Blue
Lounge because it's blue, really easy to see and not
miss in the massive amounts of rad action cable land, it's a magnet, so Jesse would approve,
and that's about it. Now, if we go over here, if
you don't have a motion sensor in your life, you should,
because that is honestly one of the coolest things we've done here and it's not that important
or that cool right now but when it's night and
there are no lights in here and you walk by, it's the best. So as far as upstairs,
this has kinda become the entertainment center of sorts. Back in the day, that used
to be actually my desk and speaker setup, but
since then, we kinda went with a similar theme as we
did downstairs with that dark gray wall, say hello to
Rich and the ice light. As far as a TV goes, we got that beautiful curved OLED from LG, tons of consoles, this has kinda become the
game memorabilia area, virtual boy, holy crap. Here's actually one of my
favorite pieces that I've used in a few different time lapse shots, the Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt clock, really really cool, shoutout to the Bulls, who are back and forth this year. Last but not least, we got
this Halo Needler action. This is also part of
the ultimate Xbox setup, so don't normally have this around, but you can check out why
we got it in that video. Also you might notice,
there's a closet back there, that is just boxes and more nerf. - Wanna go check?
- No, nah, we can't show them that, they'll
never come out of it alive. They'll never come out. Hey hey, you son of a! So that wraps up the 2017 office tour, hopefully you enjoyed the video, if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to smash that like button. If you have any ideas or
suggestions for the next tour, drop a comment down below
where I'll post everything we talked about in this video
along with this sweet shirt. This is Jonathon and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Today's video is brought to you by Philips Hue, the white
and color ambience A19 starter kit will get you
amazing lighting like this. It's currently on sale,
so make sure you check out the link below. Your guy Jonathan here, 2018 is here, but before we dive into the new year, I want to take a look back at not only my favorite tech but the
tech I used most in 2017. Now 2017 was an amazing year as far as smart phones go, but
if I were to look back at a single feature that
impressed me the most, hands down, it's gotta be the camera on the Google Pixel Two. So in 2017, dual cameras on smart phones were super popular, and
with that came a term you're probably most familiar with, portrait shots, this emulates
pictures you'd normally expect on something like a DSLR with that beautiful blurred background and then Google comes along, it's like, "Eh, we could do that with one lens." And they did. Really well. Some of the shots I got on the Pixel Two still blow my mind to this day to the point where it
almost doesn't make sense that this kind of image
came out of a smart phone. And it's not just portrait mode. The camera as a whole on the Pixel Two is stellar, from its
low light performance, dynamic range, sharpness
and kinda all results in this really well-rounded package. Now, as impressive as that
is, it still gets better with portrait selfies, and
there was a lot of hype around the iPhone 10 and
what they were gonna do with portrait selfies, but hands down, the Pixel Two outperforms
that in every single way. So yeah, the Google Pixel
Two and, more specifically, its camera are kind of outstanding. Next up from there,
though, are Apple AirPods. Yes, AirPods. I know you're thinking to
yourself, "Why on earth "would you include
AirPods, those kinda suck." The thing is, they're
actually kind of amazing. So, what exactly is amazing about AirPods? Honestly, it is the convenience. The W1 chip inside these
things is something I wish was in every pair of
Bluetooth headphones ever. Yes, that initial setup is stupid simple, but what's especially
special is once you set up AirPods on one device,
every device after that essentially is paired and ready to go thanks to iCloud. So whether you jump from your phone to your laptop to an
iPad or even upgrading your phone, because of
iCloud, those AirPods are there and ready to go. Now, yeah, initially I
was a little skeptical with these things. One, how they looked. Two, were they easy to lose? And three, how did they sound? As far as looks go, yeah, they still look a little goofy, there's no denying that. But I will gladly deal with that because of how well they work. As far as how easy are they to lose, I've never lost a pair of AirPods or a single AirPod, period. Because the case is how you charge them, you're constantly in the
habit of putting them back in the case when you're
done, so losing them is actually really hard to do. As far as sound quality,
I think they sound good. They don't sound amazing,
but they definitely don't sound bad. My only real complaint with these as far as sound quality
goes would be noise isolation because they
don't do a real good job with that at all. Again, it comes down to the convenience. They're small, they're
compact, you have great battery life, and it's
something you can just keep with you at all times in
your pocket, in your bag, in your purse, and more
importantly, it's something you don't have to think
about, it just works. Next up is something you're
probably not going to see on most tech lists out there. It's not a smart phone, it's
not a pair of headphones, it's not a computer but rather lighting, so if you're a
videographer, pay attention. So this is pretty much
two awesome products that when combined together make something even more awesome. The main component is
Wescott's Flex light, which is a really cool, flexible LED mat. In this case, this is their one by two, one foot by two feet,
bi-color, so it's gonna output all the way down from a really warm 2,800 Kelvin all the way up to 6,000. Now, what made these especially popular was the flexibility, the
portability, you could essentially stick and take
these things anywhere. That's cool and unique, but
honestly, it never really, truly appealed to me. That was, until I saw this,
their Flex Drum soft box, which transforms the Flex
light into a beautiful, portable soft box. Now, I will be the first to tell you, if you don't need the
flexibility or the portability, there are many more
inexpensive lighting options which I'll link to down below, but what changed the game
for me was the ability to take high-quality lighting
essentially anywhere I went. - For the record, I'm a
hard, extremely hard -- - Who are you talking to, the sprinkler? - I'm talking to you, I guess. I was looking at the sprinkler. Do you want to put that
on a chair or something? - The OnePlus 5T video
I shot earlier this year was in Brooklyn in some random AirBNB. The entire video was lit
off this lighting setup. So when you combine that flexibility and the portability and
end up with this beautiful, evenly dispersed, soft light,
it is a killer combination. Now speaking of light,
again, huge shout-out to today's sponsor, Philips Hue. If you're looking to
get into the smart home lighting game, their white
and color ambiance A19 starter kit is hands down
my favorite way to do that. In the kit, you get
the Philips Hue Bridge, which is the centerpiece of
all that beautiful lighting. With this, you can add up
to 50 different light bulbs, and believe me, it does get addicting. You also get four white
and color ambiance A19 light bulbs, which'll get you everything from that relaxing warm lighting to that energizing cool lighting all the way to that
beautiful colored lighting that you more than likely have seen in these videos. Plus, whether you use
Google Home, Amazon Echo, Home Kit with Siri, you can combine those with Philips Hue to control every aspect of your lighting with your voice. This is what I've used
for years to achieve that bright, vibrant color lighting, so if you want to jump in on this, again, there's a sale on this kit right now, which I will link to down below. Last up is something that barely, barely made the list and was
released at the very, very end of 2017. This, of course, is the iMac Pro. If you caught my videos earlier this year, this is one piece of tech
that I was super excited for, really looking forward to, and now that it's here,
it hasn't disappointed. If you wanna learn more
about performance and speed in benchmarks and numbers,
I will drop a video to that link down below,
but again with the iMac Pro, it was kinda one of those
products that changed my workflow up. I talked about it before,
but AK raw footage is incredibly taxing and
incredibly demanding, and with the iMac Pro,
I'm able to edit that AK raw footage natively, no trans-coding, no optimizing. I can hop back and forth
between the raw settings, the ISO, the white balance. You have buttery smooth
playback in your timeline and the absolute craziest thing about this is you can take that AK
footage, trans-code it to a 4K-ready YouTube file
and do that essentially in real time, which is mind-blowing. So, yeah, the iMac Pro is fairly new, but it has quickly become one of my go-to favorite pieces of tech
along with everything featured in this video. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video. If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to smash that like button. I would love to hear what
your favorite gadgets or piece of tech was in 2017. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. (beep) Yes, AirPods, and I know
some of you out there -- What the f--? - [Man] You said AirPods. - Throw it to my hand. - [Man] You gotta look to catch 'em, man. - No I don't. Watch, toss it. 
- [Jonathan] You guys, Jonathan
here and this is FrontRow. The goal is to be the
wearable camera of the future, and really it's unlike
anything you've seen before. A huge shout-out to FrontRow
for sponsoring an early Look, I am stoked to be one of the
first people on the planet to check this out, and also
for sending me a second one to give away to you guys. So if you're interested,
details on that are down below. Thumbs up are not required,
but they are always of course, appreciated. So what is it about that stands out to me is one, is a super sleek
compact piece of tech. It's lightweight and two,
it is a wearable camera that doesn't make you
feel silly wearing it if that makes sense. Now because of the design, the idea behind FrontRow is to capture
those every day moments while remaining completely hands-free. I like the fact that there's
some modularity here, you may have not noticed it at first but if you look closely,
this connector here gives you that flexibility. You can use it with a
lanyard, a magnetic clip that works fantastic as a stand, or even with different
third party accessories like you see here. Now as far as what makes this unique, I think for me again what stands out most is the fact that this really is the first wearable camera that you
don't need a head strap or a chest mount or some crazy accessory that makes you look or feel
like a crazy person in public. It has this beautiful circular high resolution
touchscreen that looks like it is straight out of the future. I also really like the fact
that while it does work great with iOS and Android, you are
not reliant on your smartphone to get that content off your device. You can share it directly from FrontRow. Beyond that no features
in the world would matter if it was a bad user experience, but you can see as I swipe
and navigate through things everything is crazy
responsive and super snappy. I'll also be honest straight up capturing either a photo or a
video, there is Story Mode which I will cover in more detail shortly but the idea here is
that it's gonna give you this really unique cool first
person time lapse perspective of your day which is awesome. As far as the specs go, your main shooter has an 8 megapixel sensor paired with a 5 megapixel front-facing camera but more importantly,
that 8 megapixel sensor is a crazy wide 140 degrees wide lens that's gonna light and capture all kinds of things in the frame. Internally, you have
32 gigabytes of storage but you also have the ability to expand that via cloud storage. Video-wise this shoots in 1080p or in 4K at a 4 by 3 aspect ratio. Now the idea there is, it's
gonna give that extra punch, that extra sharpness so
you can punch in and post. Two things that really stand out to me as far as capture goes one, the OASness is crazy good. It is almost scary how well it works. If you're out there on the go, or if you're out there on the road, you don't have to worry
about that shaky video. It just works really well. Also, the microphone
capture works really well. So if you are at a concert or if you're just in a
general noisy environment you're not gonna have to
sacrifice audio quality. So right now I'm testing
the microphone quality while capturing front-facing video. Excuse the squinting, it's
a little bright right now, but I would love to hear what you think with a comment down below. Beyond that you know I
love me some USB scene. FrontRow does not disappoint there. In addition to having that USB-C port you're also getting a crazy fast 20 minute quick charge time. You do of course get really
solid battery life with FrontRow but it's nice to know just in
case you do run out of juice, you're gonna be able to
charge up super quick. Now software-wise, with FrontRow there are three core features. Starting with the ability to livestream directly from the device. It works with Twitter, Facebook and more importantly for me YouTube. From there we have of course Story Mode, which again is this crazy
first person time lapse and the way it works, it actually will use its built-in motion sensor to know when to capture those moments. With this you can record up to 16 hours and the beauty of it, is
you're not gonna have to do much work at the end of the day. The idea is you kind of set it, forget about it and then look back on moments you may have
not normally captured. Conversely for someone
who likes to tweet things you're not just stuck with that story, you do have the ability
to enter a story editor and with that you can save a frame, pull out a frame or even just the playback speed on the story. From there again the FrontRow
works incredibly by itself but you do also have really solid support from the FrontRow app on your smartphone. Really you guys can see here on video how responsive everything
is to the preview mode. It is lightning fast and what's cool is it's gonna work both
through WiFi and Bluetooth. What's really cool is
automatically right off the bat, you're getting a low
resolution preview version of that picture or that video you just took on your smartphone but what happens when
you connect a FrontRow and your phone on same WiFi network it's automatically gonna
sync at high resolution full quality version of video or picture. From there you also have the
ability to control everything remotely from your phone. This is especially important
if you just want to use the FrontRow device as your
main livestreaming device. You're not gonna have to mess with it or touch things on the FrontRow. You can do everything
from your smartphone. So far I think this is an
awesome wearable camera. More importantly, it's
intuitive, it's snappy and incredibly easy to use. It looks great, it
captures fantastic content and I think more importantly,
it's gonna be great for those who aren't super techy who don't want this crazy
obtrusive rig or camera, who just want to capture life moments. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed the video. If you did and you feel like being awesome make sure you smash that like button. If you want to check out FrontRow I will drop a link down below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- What? You've never seen "Space Jam?" The Monstars. (bouncy music) Yo guys, Jonathan here,
this is the Iphone 10, this is face unlock working, but today, I am going to
see if I can trick it, and thank goodness,
because it is Halloween, I have an assortment
of costumes and masks, and fake mustaches. - Mornin'. - Good day to you, sir. Wait a minute, what the hell? - But first, I am going to use the Ipad, I got a little video. But I want to see if that
will work on Face ID. Can I trick it with the video? I'm going to lock it, see if I can get you guys to play that again, nothing
seems to be working. No. (beep) From there, I think it's time to move on to a mask, this is actually Robin. Not Batman, how do I look? Nope, I got denied, shut
down, I got that little lock saying, "nope, you are
not getting on my phone, sorry Robin." (beep) No, to kind of clear
this out as we move on through each mask and different disguise, I'm going to unlock it, so we can start from a fresh slate, because if someone tries
to get into your phone, it's gonna make you enter
the password the next time, from there, we got a clown nose. From what I understand,
the three main components of Face ID are your eyes,
your nose and your mouth, so I'm going to assume that this will not work. Denied. One more time, denied. (beep) And I'm going to assume,
because that Robin mask did not work that this is also not gonna work. Whoa, my hair. From there, denied. (beep) If I peek it. Will it work? That works, so, I'm going
to see if I can actually register Captain America. Okay, I can move my head. That's step one, okay that's complete, I might be able to oh, this is ridiculous. Second Face ID scan complete, Face ID is now set up, so here we go, we're going to try this out. It unlocks! (ding) So the problem with this now is my normal face does
not work, ah damn it! Put the mask back on. Unlocked, okay. Man, I did not need to stretch my neck out like I did in that
unboxing, it's way simpler than I made it out to be. Face ID is back with me, so from there, I think we'll go a little simpler, with some glasses. That unlocks it, so glasses
were not a problem. (ding) From what I understand, tinted glasses or sunglasses should work as well, but this is no problem here whatsoever. Swipe up, I'm in the phone, so that did not seem to affect things. So far the only thing we're able to get in with this Iphone 10, is programming Captain America's face, and glasses on myself, but so far everything
else has been denied. Got that old man mustache, and eyebrows. I guess we'll start with the mustache, and oh man, got hair everywhere. Ah! Nope, (laughs) Psst! Nope, denied. (beep) Rip it off, it works. So I understand that if
you grow a beard gradually over time, or a mustache, that's it's gonna kind of adjust with you, but if you go drastic,
like I did in this case, it is not gonna work, so yeah, that is shutting me down. Pfll! There you go. Iphone 10. That unlocked. (ding) In my phone, eyebrows do not
affect it apparently, so, yep, that worked twice, so mustache, no, old man eyebrows, yes. Next, we got the Snazzy
Q stache going on here. Did you guys know Snazzy
also modeled part time for Halloween costumes too? He's a beautiful man. A beautiful man from Utah. Okay, no (laughs) Why do these things... Damn it. (beep) Oh, this is the backside, right? Those are eyes, no? Nope, that's just the emoji. Oh no. Denied, why is that denied? Is it my hair? Let me try entering the password. Fris-tal... Nope. (beep) That unlocks. Oh man, next... We got the wig. Okay. I'm sorry, I really am, I'm sorry, I'm terribly sorry. This is not letting me in. What do you want me to do? I guess I should try to
program it, isn't that right? It worked. (ding) So crazy, yeah, that let me in, it's not, why didn't that work
with the poop emoji face, and it's working with this. Okay, Rich, choose your
favorite Ninja Turtle. (muffled voice) You don't
know any Ninja Turtles! Everybody, for shame. - Don't look at me, don't look at me. - [Jonathan] For shame! No, Rich. I'm going with my favorite, oh man, am I screwing things up? Ninja Turtles do not work. (beep) It is that mask, so that
is probably covering up too much of my eyes, so, yeah, it's been a really interesting test, I'm not sure how much it helped you out. I had this beard. So Game of Thrones. Denied. (beep) Ow... Here you go, Rich, grow some facial hair. It's not gonna work, but I assume I can program the face. Face, nope, that's not gonna work. Clearly that is not gonna work. Let's do this one. Oh dear god. Ah, now I'm like so
determined to get this. It is done, I think we got this. It unlocked! (ding) Thank you guys very much
for watching this video. Hopefully enjoyed it, if you did, and found a
little amusement out of that, make sure you guys drop a like down below. If you want to see a
more comprehensive video on my unboxing with the Iphone 10 that is way more informative, I will catch you guys later. Bye. Nope, needs that beard. - Okay, I'm gonna cut.
- Cool. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here,
and I'm gonna say it, the Galaxy Note 8 is
getting way too much hate. Way too much. (upbeat music) Now by far, the biggest critique and shot fired I've seen
taken against Note 8, is that it's an over hyped
S8 plus with an S Pen, a dual camera, for some reason
a slightly smaller battery, more RAM, and I'm not gonna lie, at the Note 8 event I jokingly
called it an S8 Plus Plus. My reacting to? The S8 Plus Plus - You're reacting to it.
(laughing) - Sorry. In actuality though, that
really isn't the case. Yeah you are paying more for the Note 8, but that is because you are getting more. Minus the battery. If we were to break this
down into it's simplest form, no one's gonna yell at a cheeseburger for being a glorified hamburger. Are they similar? Yes. But you know they're different, and you have no problem paying
extra because it's an option. Same thing at Chipotle. You want guac? You are
ponying up the cash. And I guess in some strange
way, what I'm trying to say is, S Pen equals avocado. Ultimately in some weird way, Samsung has almost
kinda screwed themselves by having too many options. If we're being honest, the only reason Samsung's
Plus models exist is to compete with Apple
and their Plus model phones. For simplicities sake,
imagine there was no S8 Plus. Just the S8 that was
their smaller flagship and then in turn, we had
to wait for the Note 8 as their bigger flagship. Conversely, after what happened last year, Samsung could've easily
killed off the Note lineup and brought the S Pen over to the S8 Plus, but somethin' about that really
just wouldn't've felt right because ultimately, what makes
a Note a Note is the S Pen and that's how it's always been. So mini rant aside, I actually
really like the Note 8 and by far what stands out to
me most with this of course, is that giant beautiful display. It is big, and it is beautiful. This here is a 6.3 inch display, and again, it's not much
bigger than the S8 Plus which sizes in at 6.2 inches. But the thing we gotta
get out of our heads, is that displays between the Note 8 and the S8 Plus are not
gonna be deciding factors. Again, it comes down to the
S Pen, to the dual cameras. But regardless, the Note
8 has a beautiful display. You guys know, I love what Samsung did with their infinity displays. Not only does it look fantastic
just simply using the phone, but of course consuming media whether you're looking at photos, video, and on top of that
aesthetically I think it takes these phones to the next level. And honestly, I think so far they're the best looking
phones of this year. Your move next, Apple. Now specs wise, one thing
that separates the Note 8 from the S8 Plus and the
S8 for that matter, is RAM. This is packing 6 gigabytes inside. Which makes sense, because the Note has always kinda been known
as that multitasking machine. Speaking of multitasking,
being able use multiple apps simultaneously in separate
windows isn't new, but what is, is the ability
to create app pairs. So instead of opening an app, running through the
process every single time, you can actually pair up apps
that you use most frequently and from there it is only one step, and I think that is awesome. Switching gears, one weird
thing spec wise with Note 8, again is battery capacity. Not only is it smaller
than last year's Note, it's also smaller than the S8 Plus, which kinda leaves you
scratching your head. The Note 8 is a bigger phone and whether it's just barely
bigger, it is still bigger. So the fact that it has a smaller battery really doesn't make sense. And again, as much as the Note has kind of been synced
up with multitasking, I think the Note has been
synonymous with big battery life, so I can see why people
would be upset here. Past that though, I think
there are still a ton of enticing elements with Note 8, and there's not a whole
lot you can complain about. You have USB-C, a headphone
jack, quick charging, wireless charging, water resistance, micro SD card expansion. Overall, it is a really solid package. So from there, I think we
all know what S Pen is about, what it can do, so I first
wanna focus on the dual cameras. Because that is what really impressed me. You have dual 12 megapixel sensors, a wide angle lens and
then a telephoto lens. But what makes this really special, is the fact that both of these have OIS and that makes a big difference. Speaking of stabilization,
I do wanna slightly call out Samsung for their OIS video
demo at the Note 8 event. If you watched it, they compared the Note 8 against an iPhone but somethin' was clearly off. Could you imagine the
behind the scenes on that? Jokes aside though, we
have clearly seen and know what the S8 and S8 Plus
cameras are capable of, and I think with the Note 8, it kinda takes things to the next level. Now one of the biggest camera features on the Note 8 is live focus. And yes, some people are
gonna say it is very similar to portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus and really, every other dual camera out there for that matter. But in particular, what I love about this is not only the quality,
but the flexibility. There definitely are other
smart phones out there that give you the ability
to edit things and post, but that usually comes with
a sacrifice in quality. As far as Note 8 goes, it's not perfect, and it's not gonna work every single time, but as a whole, it is super impressive. The ability to adjust the amount of blur, to really fine tune dial in and to find that point of clarity in both
naturalness is really cool. But on top of that, what
I think is the coolest thing about this, is you
have the ability to go back at any time and view
the wide angle version of that photo, which is crazy. Now beyond live focus mode in
terms of the camera as a whole no surprise, it is really good. Here's an example of jumpin'
from the wide angle lens to the telephoto lens, and
yes, you do lose a little bit of light with F stop of
2.4 on the telephoto lens. But looking at the pictures, you can see both are really nice. In this picture here, this
is the telephoto lens. But what stands out to me here is the sharpness in the detail. It was just about sunset,
so you can really see that sun beaming down on
the floor but beyond that, the detail in the leaves and the concrete, I think one might call it, "crispy." In this picture here in particular, the dynamic range is really impressive. We see the blue of the
sky, we see the clouds, we see all the lighting and the signs. Nothing's blown out, and
overall it's just a really, really well rounded photo. Now as things started
to get a little darker, this was one of my favorite shots. Not a ton of light in the foreground, just the light bulb itself,
but we still see the clouds, we see a little bit of
that sun blowin' out and overall, it is just
a beautiful picture. As far as the front facing cameras, I think Samsung has done an amazing job the last couple years. And again, nothing has
here with the Note 8. This is how this shot
looks on a red camera and here is how it looks with the front facing camera of the Note 8. Jumpin' over to an outdoor selfie again, great dynamic
range, great sharpness. I love the fact that you
have a wide angel lens and really there's not
much more to say than, "Great job Samsung on the cameras." Video quality wise, here's a quick example of how that looks, how
the stabilization works, and also I'm gonna shut
my mouth for a second so you can hear the microphone quality. (calm music plays) So from there I kinda wanna
round things out with S Pen. Because again, that is ultimately what makes the Note a Note. It has definitely evolved
a ton over the years. But there really wasn't
a huge jump in features from this year over last year. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Smart Select and Screen
Write are useful as always. Live Message, while it
isn't necessarily original is actually a lot of fun
to use with a physical pen. You kinda just draw out
your message but it's nice having that extra bit of accuracy with that physical pen. You can play it back, make
sure you didn't screw it up, and then send it off. Definitely though one of my
favorite features with S Pen is the ability to integrate that with Samsung's always on display. If you just need to jot
something down quickly, or you need to remind yourself, you don't have to go into the phone, just bust out the pen, write it down, and that it will stay there
as a reminder in your face. Overall the Galaxy Note
8, while it's not perfect, it is a damn impressive phone. And if you know what you want, you want that S Pen but
you kinda been skeptical because people have been a
little too hard on the Note 8, forget the haters, grab
it, you will enjoy it. I wanna give a huge shout
out to my boy Benjamin who I met out at London. Super humble, super
hardworking, but also has a really underrated YouTube channel. Definitely check him out,
I will link him down below. He actually helped me
get ahold of the Note 8 a little bit early so this
entire video is thanks to him. Thank you guys for watching. This is Jonathan, and
I'll catch you guys later. 
- So if you own a Galaxy
S8 or you're looking to pick one up, hands down
one of its coolest features is the fact that it can
essentially transform from a smartphone into
a fully-fledged desktop and this is how I turned my
Galaxy S8 from this into this. So alongside the Galaxy S8,
the other important piece of this puzzle that you need
to absolutely make it work is the Samsung Dex. This is a sphere-like
hockey puck-shaped gadget that then transforms into a
dock that houses the Galaxy S8, outputs to video, and also
allows you to connect things like a mouse and keyboard. Now if you want to get that
sweet Dex-top experience you're gonna need to drop some cash. The Dex itself is not cheap by any means, it's around 150 bucks,
and then on top of that you're gonna need to buy a
monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Now of course there is
the argument of what if you already own a display,
keyboard, and mouse? If that's the case, I am willing to bet that you more than likely have a computer to go along with it, and unless
it's some 22-year-old Dell from 1995 that is barely staying alive, with that sweet 256 megs of RAM, then more than likely
your computer is gonna be a better full-fledged desktop experience than the Galaxy S8 and Dex combined. Now as far as the display
goes, for my setup I went with a 23-inch monitor from Lenovo. The name and product number
is ridiculous and dumb, so if you're interested
I'll drop a link down below. For the keyboard I went
with the Logitech K380 which adds an absurd amount
of bright beautiful orange that kind of compliments
the screen saver perfectly. For the mouse, I went with
the Logitech Ultrathin mouse which is a super clean
minimal touch mouse. It isn't the cheapest, around
50 bucks, but it works great, it looks awesome, and
also perfectly compliments the Harmon Kardon bluetooth speakers that I went with for audio. So with the Dex, there definitely
are some pros and cons. For starters, even
though the box advertises that it will output 4K, right
now only 1080p will work. On one side that actually
may be a good thing based solely on the fact
that if you were spending four to six hundred
dollars on a 4K display just for your phone, that
might be a little crazy. Yes, I also understand that
it might be a little bit weird using a display with
less pixels than your phone, but honestly I've really
enjoyed this setup so far. Now beyond the HDMI out on
the Dex, you're also getting two USB ports and sadly,
these are USB 2.0 not 3.0 so you might have to deal with some painfully slow transfer speeds. Lastly, you also get a gig
ethernet port for those of you who are all about that hard-wired life. Conversely though, one
disappointing factor with the Dex is the fact that
there is no headphone jack or audio out on the dock. In theory, you could have
technically used the Galaxy S8 if the headphone jack were up top, but since it's on the bottom
and it is then docked, you are out of luck. So with that, as far
as a work around goes, you pretty much have two options. You're gonna need a monitor that supports audio pass through over HDMI,
or in my case what I did was set it up through a bluetooth speaker. Now surprisingly using a
bluetooth speaker with this setup works really really well. So as far as audio control
goes, I really like how everything is laid
out in the interface. You have independent
control over your ringtone, the bluetooth speaker notifications, and then the overall system
volume which is awesome. So now that we're past
audio, as far as the actual user experience with Dex goes, it actually works surprisingly well. Now regardless of how
great the experience is, and trust me, I give Samsung
all the credit in the world for executing it this well,
I think the biggest downfall right now is the lack of app support. There is a dedicated app
section that is optimized for Dex, but that list is
really really small right now. The other confusing part
is that there are apps that aren't on the optimized
list that still work, so it's almost like you've got to play this weird guessing game. For some strange reason,
Spotify does not work with Dex. Play Music of course
does, in a big beautiful full-screen mode, and what
made me scratch my head is while Spotify isn't
supported, for some weird unknown reason Apple Music works on Dex. Now in certain cases
some apps don't work well because you do need a
touch screen to actually take most advantage of those. It's really hard to talk and not get eaten by a ghost right now, so I'm
gonna try and dodge these guys. Oh no! (growls loudly) (Pac-Man game over tone)
Dammit. Now jumping from games
and beyond things like Word docs and note taking
apps, one thing I was genuinely curious about was
video and photo editing. Much to my disappointment,
video editing is not really a thing on Dex. Adobe Clips, from what I
can tell, is one of the better options out there but it was not a great experience at all. Photo editing, on the other
hand, was actually really cool. For starters, Photoshop
Express and Lightroom mobile both are fully supported
on Dex, so you can get a pretty fantastic full-screen experience. As most of you I'm sure
are aware, the Galaxy S8 has a fantastic camera,
so being able to edit those photos on a bigger
screen and then have them directly on the phone after you're done is kind of awesome. Now as far as apps that work
well, I actually really like the YouTube layout, especially
in full-screen mode. We have a nice big window for
our video here on the left, shout out to UrSAVAGEconsumer. On the right you have a nice
layout of all the videos. And a little tip, just
in case you own this, instinctively you want to scroll down here to leave that first comment, but actually you gotta scroll down
all the way right here, leave Jud a little love, drop a comment, I usually say what's up
within the first hour so let me know how your day is going. Also from there I'm
giving you a quick demo of how well the bluetooth
functionality works. You can actually control
volume from the keyboard. - If you guys have
encountered any bad products that you think I should feature in-- - Also strangely enough
Instagram works in Dex. You can also access the
camera, so if we wanted to send out a picture, Evans! - How's it going? - You wanna take a selfie
with me, through Dex? - Oh, Dex, yeah, let's Dex it. - You're really close, man. No to me, not the screen. - Oh, okay. - I'm clicking my mouse right
now to take the picture. (mouse clicks) - Now you gotta get
Friyay, yeah, there we go. - Yeah, nice and clean. There you go. - That's what I get. - The mouse is like a stylus. - That is the worst thing I've ever seen. I don't like that. - Other really cool points
with the Dex setup is while your Galaxy S8 is docked it is also charging simultaneously, on top of that it does support fast charging. Honestly, I think where
this makes most sense is for those who don't
already own a computer and can pick up a display,
mouse, and keyboard for cheap. Is the Dex a full-fledged
desktop replacement? Absolutely not, but it is definitely a step in the right direction. The only thing I've got
to say is I hope Samsung sticks with this, continues
to make improvements, and does not abandon this. It is a crazy cool concept
and as smartphones get faster and more powerful,
I don't think it's insane that they will eventually
turn into our computers. (electronic beep) What's Wex posting? - Hey Wex, the Gazelle action. Oh that's the Superstar action. - It's the zebras!
(man shouts) 
Today's video is sponsored by Anker. For deals on the latest USB-C chargers including one that can charge a MacBook and a chance to win a ton of different prizes Including an iPhone X. Check out the links below. The iPhone X ["TEN"] (said like this throughout the whole video except where noted), it's not perfect, but it is really good. Yo guys, Jonathan here and today I am diving deep into the iPhone X both the good and the bad, and if you picked one up I would love to know what your experience has been so far. So with the iPhone X, there are a couple key, elements that make this phone what it is. The first of which being the display. It's a 5.8 inch OLED panel with a classically weird Apple resolution of 2436 by 1125 and weird numbers aside it looks Really good. I think any doubt or concern with the display not being bright enough has been put to rest It's super bright the colors are extremely accurate and honestly the display is one of the most enticing features of the iPhone X. Now for the million dollar question of "Is there any blue shift?" And yeah, if you look for and you tilts it off access you will definitely see a little bit of that. It is by no means Pixel 2 XL status, but there's no denying if you're a little tilt and shift crazy you are gonna see a little bit of blue. Now the reason Apple is able to squeeze so much screen into the iPhone X because Of what is probably The biggest change to ever come to the iPhone and that is the omission of the home button. It is completely gone. Honestly, I got used to this and adjusted to it way Way faster than I thought I would no joke every time I pick up a phone that is not the iPhone X, I find myself Wanting to swipe up to go home. Now for the most part this works incredible And I don't find myself missing the home button, but there are a couple dumb things. One is Control Center. That used to be a one-handed move Where you swipe up and that's how you access Control Center, but now you got to swipe down all the way on the top. Right and most of the time to comfortably do that you need to use two hands. Conversely, You can enable reachability Which is not enabled by default, so pro-tip head in to Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility Once you have it enabled you can access for reachability by doing this really Really precise swipe down at the bottom edge of the phone It's definitely easier than having to reach all the way towards the top right of the phone and then swiping down But it's still two steps, and I don't think it's a foolproof solution. Now, I know Snazzy Q is busting out of the seams and has this well thought out to elaborate solution to this But I would also love know what you guys think is a better alternative to this weird Control Center option We have now. From there the other slightly dumb thing That's not really a huge deal is how you exit out of apps before all I used to do is open up multitasking and swipe Up and that was it Now once, you're in the multitasking window you actually got to hold the app wait for that little minus icon And then you can swipe out and exit out. Yeah, it's not the biggest deal in the world and before anybody yells at me I totally get it technically you don't have to exit of apps, but for me It's just kind of one of those unnecessary Two-step movements. Now with the lack of home button, the way You enable Siri is by one saying Hey [Siri], Not gonna say that and trigger your phone or two Holding the side button. Now one slightly annoying thing is if you have Do Not Disturb enabled, unless you are in Control Center There is no way to know that it's on whether you're in the lock screen or actually in the phone There is no icon in the top right-hand corner Which makes it super easy to forget that it's on. Now from there that kind of leads into the next Controversial thing with the iPhone X that is the notch. Initially every Mostly angry tech fans on Twitter seem to hate it Honestly though the notch really isn't a big deal like 95% of the time I don't realize it's there. The only time I do notice it is when I'm watching Widescreen video because the way that's formatted that notch is creeping its way in there And there is nothing you can do about it. Now the flip side of that for most YouTube videos that are in 16:9 you are not seeing the notch whatsoever. Yes, you can zoom in, but for the most part That's not the optimal viewing experience because you are chopping off heads #PrayForLamarr Over the weekend both Kevin Kenson and Austin Evans dropped some Incredible looking widescreen video and watching those back on the iPhone X, it kind of got me thinking Is this the future of content especially with more and more of these phones headed in that direction? the video you are watching right now is also in widescreen so if you're watching on an iPhone X or Galaxy S8 I would love to know how it looks on your phone Next is FaceID that feature that anyone anti-Apple deep down really wanted to fail, but it actuality It was really well done and well executed. Just like the iPhone X FaceID isn't perfect But it's really good for me. It has to have worked like 98% of the time there really hasn't been too many times where it's failed. It absolutely works at night, in the dark, whether you're in a car. I've been in planes where it's worked flawlessly. On the opposing end of that spectrum. It's worked great outdoors, in sunlight with glasses on, with a hat on. The only time I've ever really had trouble with it is in the middle of the nights when I wake up. I got one Eye closed and then it kind of trips up but for the most part It's worked really well, and I haven't really missed TouchID. I think where FaceID really shines is for password based applications especially when you're browsing online you're already looking at the phone So it kind of becomes this instant thing that you don't really think about The other pro with FaceID in the case where your hands are wet or it is crazy cold outside And you're forced to wear gloves Yes, the same argument could be made with FaceID in the situations where it doesn't work, but overall as a whole I think it's a step in the right direction Hasn't slowed me down at all. Now because of all that tech required for FaceID that is also yielded Animojis I guarantee you by now You've probably seen some an Animoji Karaoke in your feed, but I want to give a shout out and some credit to Mr. Snazzy Q for the best one on the internet right now I kind of wish I had a dollar for every time someone said "The iPhone X [Ecks], the thousand dollar emoji machine. One, It's an Animoji and two, it's kind of fun man. So are Animojis is the sole reason why you would buy an iPhone X? Absolutely not. If you want to use them, they're there, but if you don't, no one's forcing you song- what does the fox say God, I remember that now as far as performance that A11 Bionic chip inside the iPhone X is no joke. Everything from Multitasking to gestures to gaming is buttery smooth. Now with all that power one area where the iPhone X and even 8 and 8 Plus For that matter excels at and are kind of in a league of its own is AR It's still really early in terms of the development of apps and games, but there's some pretty incredible stuff out there And if you own an iPhone X or 8 or 8 Plus and haven't checked out augmented reality yet It is a lot of fun. I will say it's worth mentioning This is the exact same chip also found in the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus so it's kind of a testament to their performance as well
But as far as smartphone performance goes it is not even close right now. 3, 2, 1... "But the iPhone X doesn't have as many cores as..." Clearly it is not about the cores because there is some insane performance Coming out the iPhone X as well as the 8 and 8 Plus. So now that we're fired up and before anyone asked. What about the iOS bugs? Why did I have to bowl? Yes, performance on the iPhone X is incredible, But there is no denying iOS has been a little weird especially No one can forget that weird stupid. "I" glitch where you typed an "I" and it autocorrected it into some weird characters and a question mark Someone singing... I think. It has been since updated and fixed But it was out there for a long time and honestly that was one of the weirdest, dumbest, most annoying bugs I've ever dealt with on a smartphone so to say the iPhone X has been an overall smooth experience isn't quite the case From there shift into some positive, the camera in the iPhone X has been incredible. Again, this features dual lenses, a wide-angle and a telephoto lens, But the big thing here is that telephoto lens now features optical image stabilization. Now we first saw this dual lens with OIS on the Note 8 It's something the iPhone 8 Plus does not have and it definitely makes a difference. The biggest thing I've noticed jumping from wide-angle to telephoto is that you're getting a much more consistent image in terms of low light and low light performance Portrait mode in terms of the rear facing camera is excellent I think Apple does a really great job with this. As a whole there really isn't much to complain as far as the camera goes on the iPhone X. Images are crisp, they're sharp, they're vibrant, they're saturated. Now as far as the front-facing camera goes I would say it is equally as impressive as the rear camera my only real gripe with it Portrait selfies. Regular selfies look great; lighting, color, skin tones. My only complaint is I wish it was just a little wider something I've always liked on Samsung phones, but as far as those Portrait selfies go it just seems like it's not quite there yet. The actual image quality and skin tones and color all look great, but for whatever reason it seems to have a real hard time with both hair and in my case Ears where it just doesn't get those correctly. With the Pixel 2, the images sometimes over sharpened whereas with the iPhone I much prefer the more natural look so if we could somehow combine both these elements That would be amazing now. I think the Pixel 2 might have the slight edge on the iPhone X as far as photos Go there is no comparison in terms of video. The color, the ability to go up to 4K 60 frames per seconds The image stabilization on the iPhone X is second to none. You have slow motion at 1080p, up to 240 frames per second which is ridiculous Music playing... So if you use your phone to capture and create video, the iPhone X is kind of in a league of its own as far as that goes. From their notable mentions, battery life on the iPhone X has been surprisingly good. It's not as good as something like that from 8 Plus or 7 Plus for that matter, but it is definitely better than both the iPhone 7 and 8. For me I've been averaging about 6 to 8 hours of usage, so getting through day is not a problem whatsoever. The stereo speakers in the iPhone X yeah, they're not gonna blow your mind But I do enjoy having that feature and it does make a difference over phones that don't have stereo speakers. As a whole I think The iPhone X is the best and most exciting thing Apple's put out in a very long time. I'm excited to see where this goes in the future not only with Apple specifically, but with the smart phone game as a whole. What I'm saying is that it's a great time to be alive in terms of smart- phone technology and technology in general right now. The iPhone X is definitely a part of that. I've enjoyed it Hopefully enjoyed this video if you do and you're feeling like being awesome make sure to go Batman on that Like button, this is Jonathan, and I will catch you guys later. 
(dramatic music) - [Sports Announcer]
Here's Barnes on the drive, throwing it down with authority. - (beep) Yo guys, Jonathan here. We're living in a world
of clones and knock-offs. For every box of Frosted Mini-Wheats, you got your Frosted Cereal Mini-Spooners, Cinnamon Toast Crunch,
Bunch O'Cinnamon Squares. For every box of Pop-Tarts,
you got your Toast'em Popups, and, in this case, for Apples
AirPods, we got a $50 set of Chinese clones that
are the closest thing I've seen yet. So I got to give the
clones an A for effort for the attention to detail straight down to the AirPod lookalike case. Here we have some extremely,
extremely premium packaging and actually if you search
for these on Amazon, a few models come up. Some come in crappy plastic like this. Some come in fancier boxes,
but at the end of the day, they're all these same
rebranded Chinese clones. So to complete the true clone experience, we're going to go with the crappy plastic. I hope you guys are enjoying this lovely relaxing
rain soundtrack going on. This kind of looks like
a damn doctor glove. Have to do an inspection. What this actually is, is the USB cable. So we got that premium
USB quality right there. We'll toss that aside
and actually take a look at the clones themselves. We got some custom ear tips, the instructions, and the AirPod clone. So it does look like
you actually charge them through the case, just like the AirPods. I'm going to get all this
trash out of the way. - [Sports Announcer] Kobe. - So take a look at the clone. Let's see if we can pop this open. Does it even have the, oh (clunk). It kind of like has the
magnetic functionality from the AirPod case, but this guy for whatever reason does
not want to stay in. Pop it back in there. (rattles) Shake and bake. (clunk) This doesn't want to stay
in, so we'll pop this out, and again, these have some serious length. So for reference for scale, I got a fresh pair of AirPods right here. That is a much smoother
unboxing process for sure. I gotta say, once we get
these lined up side-by-side, you can see the massive size difference. This is the guy she tells
you not to worry about. And this is you. So for a second though, can
we agree, even though AirPods may be a little silly looking,
these things look ridiculous. They're huge. If AirPods are the
equivalent of toothbrush tips in your ears, I'm not going to say it, but these things look like (deep horn). Oh, man. Oh, no. They definitely don't fit that well. They're kind of like hanging
in there by the plastic. Taking those out for a second, one of the biggest differences I assume there is going to be, with the clones versus the actual AirPods,
is the pairing process. So for that, I'm going to pop
the AirPods back in the case. So for the pairing process with
the AirPod, I'm going to pop the cap, and you'll see a
little icon pop up instantly. I hit Connect. And pretty much instantaneously, I am connected to the AirPod. This is going to be a
completely different story I assume with the clones. For these, I think it's
going to be time to whip out the instructions, hopefully
they are in English, if not, I am screwed. Dear customer, thank you for choosing the Dofin 7TWS wireless Bluetooth headset. Please read the user manual carefully for proper instructions to maximize the advantage of our products. So after diving through
the instruction manual, from what I understand, we gotta pair the left AirPod clone first. We're going to hold the
multi-function button until we see blue. I'm going to hop into the
Bluetooth section of my phone. Ah, there we go. So in the Bluetooth section, it's going to pop up as GF7
TWS, that's what she said. I'm going to connect the left one. First impression is these do
not sit in my ear very well. So we got some volume. All right, so that works. Now what we gotta do is
actually power this down by holding it long-pressing
the multi-function button. From there, now that we have
the left earbud connected, we gotta do the same thing, but hold both the left
and the right together? So finally I got both of
these earbuds blinking blue, and now I will try to connect
both of them together. Connected. Here, finally, is the moment of truth where we can pop these
monsters in my ears. Man, dude. Like shoving a lollipop in your ears. So, that's kind of funny
right there, there's actually more functionality to control
your music right here. With the AirPods, to pause them, you gotta double-tap and use Siri. With these, you can
actually just play and pause on the clones themselves, so plus one for the clones actually. They don't sound bad. (lively music) They don't have the cool
play/pause functionality of the AirPods by pulling
one out of your ear, so right now, even
though I pulled this out, the song is still going. Plus one for the AirPods. All right, so for reference, I'm going to pop these AirPods back in. They're instantly connected
so you can see how cool that actually is and works. That actually seamlessly transferred over. Now sound quality-wise,
these didn't sound anywhere as bad as I thought they would be. For sure, they had more
bass in the AirPods, but overall, I would say these
are clear and more enjoyable to listen to, but if you like that bass, you might actually like these clones. Now with AirPods, those
suckers are going to stay in my ears pretty much
no matter what I do. I've done cartwheels,
I've done front flips, and they don't fall out. With these, I am not so sure,
so before we go any further I'm going to give it the
old trusty head bang test. (lively music) Oh, they're getting looser. They're getting looser. Oh, man, I'm dizzy. So much to my surprise,
these stayed in my ear. They don't feel as secure as
the AirPods, but nonetheless they pass the test, and
we're on to round two. The dude perfect dunk test. ♫ I believe I can fly (buzzer) So after all is said and done, these are kind of a mixed bag for me. They don't sound nearly as
bad as I thought they would, and in fact, they actually
sound halfway decent, but I think everything else
about them outweighs that. For starters, they look ridiculous and there is no other way around that. On top of that, these
things are a giant pain in the butt to connect. I think that is one of
the most attractive things about AirPods, the instant connectivity, the fact that once you
pull them out of the case and pop them in your
ears, they're ready to go. The play/pause feature of
taking an AirPod out of your ear and then popping it
back in to resume play. Even though these may be
a fraction of the price of AirPods, if you're looking for a pair of truly wireless
earbuds, while it may not look like AirPods, there are
still some really great options out there for around $50 to $60. Even beyond that, I actually
really like AirPods. I use them all the time. If you're in the Apple ecosystem, I think they're worth the price. If, however, you want to
see some other options, potentially how the AirPods
stack up the against the BeatX wireless, you can
check out that video here. Hopefully, you enjoyed the video. If you did, and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to smash that like button. Feel free to subscribe if you haven't yet. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (beep) What is it, Pop'em, Toast'em Pop'em? Toast'em Pop-ups, man,
who names this stuff? 
- So, guys, Jonathan
here, back with a Q and A. This time, we're doing a mix
up of Snapchat and Twitter, so if you're not following me there, definitely make sure you do so so you have a chance to be
featured in the next video. Also, huge shout out in the
theme of demonetization. Got a limited run of
this shirt available now. It's up for a couple days. If you wanna scoop it up, I
will drop a link down below. Let's go. "How many phones have you broken?" Honestly, the answer is way too many. A couple recent ones that stand out is one while filming my iPhone X review, I was getting slow motion footage, balanced the phone on a tripod
without any kind of mount and of course, it fell and cracked. Probably the craziest one, though, was going all the way back to
I think the iPhone 4 or 4S, because I remember that glass back. I was at Sea World on a roller coaster, remember it going
(exclaims) right by my head. I remember getting off the ride, having that panicked feeling of holy crap, where is my phone in my pocket? Of course it was gone,
but somehow, someway someone found it on
the floor, returned it, and it was hilarious, because I remember the lady up front was
trying to ask me to log in or kinda get into it to
verify it was my phone, but there was no freaking
way that was happening, because the phone was
completely obliterated. "What would be the ideal screen size for a 2018 plus sized iPhone XL?" Oh, if we could edit
tweets by now (laughs). I am sorry, Marques. I've seen rumors that we're gonna see three iPhones next year, a 6.5 inch model, the 5.8, which is the same
as we see with the iPhone X, and a 6.1, which would be an LCD screen. That really doesn't make sense for me. I think 5.8 is solid with the iPhone X, but there still is room
for a bigger screen. Potentially, we've seen 6.3
inches on the Galaxy Note 8, that feels really good, so
somewhere in that ball park of 6.3 to 6.5 inches would be
amazing for the iPhone X Plus or whatever the hell
they're gonna call it. "How skinny are those skinny jeans?" Come on, man, they are not that skinny. I think what's happening here
is I've always had a problem finding jeans that fit
because I kinda share the same problem with Rich,
we got them thick legs. - Are you gonna buy the Tesla Roadster? - Tesla Roadster looks amazing. Honestly, I think it's a
little too sporty for me. I'm not sure what it
was, I'm kinda missing that Tim the Tool Man
Taylor gene in my body where I just get crazy over cars. I like them, I can appreciate
the tech, but for me, I would probably still stick
with something like a Model S. Austin Evans, I just found a
famous YouTuber, Austin Evans. Got an important question for you. "If Spongebob had a
phone, what would it be?" - [Girl] Sponge phone. - There's your answer. - Is this a documentary? - Yeah. - A YouTube channel? - About Austin Evans. Go harass him, go harass him. Just go yell and scream,
scream, scream, scream. - [Guy] Is that Austin Evans? - It was Austin Evans. "Hey Jon, Yeezy's or Ultraboosts?" Rich, what's your thought? - [Rich] Yeezy's all day. - Yeezy's all day? I mean, I feel like Yeezy's are something that you don't wear all the time. If you were gonna pick
like, an everyday shoe, I would go with Ultraboosts. They're comfortable as
hell, they look good, and they're not as flashy as Yeezy's. Yeezy's have their place and
their time, unless you're rich. "What is your favorite position... To hold your phone, perv." Well played, sir, well played. "Favorite show on Netflix?" I think most people are probably
gonna say Stranger Things, but I'm gonna go with Team Master of None. I freaking love Aziz Ansari and if you have not watched it yet, not only the story line, but the cinematography is incredible. Honestly, yeah, if I would recommend any show out there right
now, it's gotta be that. Go watch it now. - Hey Jon, so what are your
favorite kicks right now? - As far as this year, I gotta
say the new Pharrel NMD's, definitely the Oreo out of that bunch. In terms of my favorite shoe
that I've picked up this year, also a Pharrel release, the
blue Original Human Race, which to me, is probably my
favorite shoe that I own period. "Should I get an XBOX OneS now or what for the X to get cheap?" Honestly, with the X just being released and the holidays here, I think it's gonna be awhile before we
see that drop in price, so it's probably the best
time to buy an XBOX OneS. I've seen it drop as low
as like 189 recently. They're doing bundles, tons
of deals, so I'll make sure to drop the best possible
price down below. - I need a new gadget bag for Christmas, any recommendations? - So, as far as a gadget
bag, if you haven't done so, make sure you check out my latest what's in my tech bag video. I featured the Hershel
Apex Lawson, which to me, is my favorite bag of 2017. It's unique, it's different,
it's got what they're calling Apex knit, which is very
similar to a prime knit or a fly knit, so if you like
that material, it is amazing. You got room for a laptop,
all sorts of gadgets, and I believe it's
still on sale right now, so I'll drop a link down below. "What's your favorite animoji?" I'm gonna say the dog,
because dogs are awesome. - Hey Jonathan, do you think they'll ever get rid of the notch on the iPhone X or the upcoming rumored X Plus? - As far as the notch goes,
I think it is here to stay. So, we gots to embrace
it or look elsewhere, especially down the
road with something like the iPhone X Plus, that is
definitely gonna have the notch. Maybe like way, way in the
future, they'll come up with an alternative, but for now,
that notch ain't going nowhere. "What kind of hair product do you use?" I believe the last time
I answered this question, it was Suavacito, that is still correct, but I've converted over
to the matte version. It's not sponsored, but it's
what I use all the time. It smells amazing, works amazing,
and yeah, I'd go get some. "According to you, what's the
future of wireless charging?" Honestly, I still think it's
gonna be where it's that like, wireless charging vicinity
where you can just set your phone or watch or headphones down like in this five, 10 foot radius and not worry about placing
it on a mat or some sort. That, to me, would be amazing. - Hey Jonathan, what is
your favorite camera lens? - So, I assume you're referring
to something like a DSLR or how you can capture photos
or video, and honestly, even though I've had a
chance to mess with some higher end lenses, the ZEISS Otus is some great and amazing stuff. I still find myself reaching
for the classic Sigma 1835, it's what you're watching this video being recorded with right now. If you're looking for an
upgrade, that is the way to go. "What are some of your favorite non-tech related YouTube channels?" Hands down, H3H3, Philly D, Pewdiepie, it's gonna sound weird,
I'm not the biggest fan of his gaming videos, not
because I don't like them, I'm just not a huge gamer myself, Boogie. As far as the fitness
world, definitely gots to be the Hodge Twins and I do watch
a lot of Christian Guzman. I'm sure most of you have
heard of all those guys. If you haven't, I will
definitely link them all below. - Hey Jonathan, I was just wondering what your best budget
Windows 10 laptops would be, like under 500 dollars and
tell Rich, keep it uncensored. - [Dave] What's up? - Hey, this is random,
I'm doing a Q and A, I got a question, someone
was asking for the best budget Windows laptop under
500 bucks, off the head, go. - Uh, Acer Aspire Five. - There you have it. - It's 500 bucks on the nose, I think. - 500 bucks on the nose. Anything like, slightly cheaper maybe, or is that like, the way to go? - That's the way to go, man. - Alright.
- That stands out. That's the one plus five
of the laptop world. - Acer Aspire Five, straight
from the man, Dave 2D himself. Taking the time, he's probably
with his family right now. Check him out, huge
shout out, links below. I love you, Dave. - Hey, I really like cookies, what kind of cookie technology do you
think's gonna be developed soon? 
- So, Apple just dropped brand
new MacBook Pros this month, but what would MacBook Pro launch be without the perfect MacBook setup? (uplifting ambient music) So, the desk is the Rigastahd, Rigastad? Riga-stad? From Ikea. Like usual, I am butchering that name, so if I am wrong, please,
please correct me. So this desk, strangely enough, I actually found outside of the office and desk section in Ikea. For whatever reason,
I've had a ton of luck finding really, really cool
desks in the dining section. This guy's got a nice,
stealthy black look to it, it's clean, it's minimal, it's something you don't normally
see every day with a desk. It has six legs. Now, because the desk is
so stealthy and so minimal, I kind of wanted to follow suit with that for the rest of the setup. The plan here is space gray
tech that compliments the desk and then not throwing
on a ton of crap that you don't need. Now, for the MacBook Pro, this is the brand new 13 inch
space gray touch bar model and the outside, nothing has changed from last year's MacBook Pro but on the inside, there's actually a pretty
respectable performance jump. What I think I like most
about the setup, though, is between the MacBook Pro
and the HP ENVY monitor, there is one single cable. Not only is the MacBook Pro
sending video to the monitor, the monitor is actually sending
power to the MacBook Pro and charging it. To take things even further, though, on top of the video and on top of the power, there is also data passed through between the MacBook Pro and the
monitor, so naturally, I had to include the classic
mounting external SSD to the back of the monitor method. In this case, what it does is it gives me instant additional storage
for the MacBook Pro and in this case, two terabytes and the beautiful part about this is everything's connected to
that one single USB-C cable. Now, as far as the HP ENVY monitor, yes, this is a big, beautiful
34 inch ultra wide display. It is quad HD, it is crisp, it is vibrant, it is beautiful, but what I was most excited
about was the fact that there are built in Bang
and Olufsen speakers right into the monitor and I was curious if these could actually replace desktop speakers. Now, before I jump into the sound test, one thing I noticed immediately is if you are using this with a Mac, make sure you go in settings and select audio over USB
as opposed to display port. Right now, it is set to
display port and if you notice, nothing happens with
the volume, which sucks. But if I hop over to USB, I get that sweet, sweet
control through the keyboard in Mac OS. - Yes! - So, jumping into the sound test, we got a fresh track from Whitney Myer, you guys really dug the DJ Khaled cover from last HomePod video. This time, we got some Calvin Harris Feels which is a great song by itself. Let's see how this monitor sounds. (bouncy pop music) That is damn impressive considering it is coming from a screen. I think the fact that it is curved kind of gives you almost a surround feel, not only with the display
but the actual sound as well. So, Bang and Olufsen, good job. So, moving on, without a doubt, the element that takes
this setup over the top has to be that custom
space gray Apple keyboard and track pad from Colorware. As many of you know, with the
announcement of the iMac Pro alongside that comes a
beautiful space gray keyboard, track pad, and mouse but the downside is Apple's not gonna sell that separately. Fortunately, though, Colorware
is not about that life and can bring space gray to the masses. If you look closely at these, the detail is amazing, it
looks as if it were from Apple and even though in this case this is the regular
wireless Apple keyboard but I'm sure Colorware is
gonna do the same thing with that new full size
wireless one as well. Now, rounding out the setup and going over these smaller accessories that kinda glue everything together, the MacBook Pro is sitting on
a beautiful space gray stand from Rain. The build quality is phenomenal,
it has looks to match, I have been a fan of Rain
for a really long time and in this case, it is no different. Next to the monitor we of course have the patented Tech
YouTuber fake plant from Ikea. If you don't have one, make
sure you pick one up today. Next to that is the Bose
SoundLink Color Bluetooth speaker in soft black. Space gray. I initially picked this
up more so as a backup 'cause I wasn't really sure
if the speakers on the monitor would be enough but that
clearly proved me wrong. In this case, though, you
now have a space gray speaker that perfectly matches your setup and is something cool
you can take on the go. Now last up is that giant Mario
Banksy's canvas behind me, I actually first featured this in my custom Nintendo Switch
desk setup but since then, I've gotten a ton of
questions on what it is, where can I get it. I thought it looked great here as well, so I thought I would feature it and answer that question for you guys. Along with that and everything
else featured in this video, I of course will link
everything down below. So, that is my 2017
perfect MacBook Pro setup. Hopefully you enjoyed the video, if you did and you're
feeling like being awesome, make sure to drop a like down below. But maybe Mac isn't your thing and you're looking for a Windows setup... - So, the Microsoft Surface
laptop just came out this week and when I saw the beautiful
burgundy colored one, I just knew it needed a setup. (bouncy pop music) 
- [Jonathon] Yo guys, Jonathon here, and when you think of a
great smartphone camera, most people might think of
Samsung and the Galaxy S7, Apple and the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, LG's V20 was great, but what you might not think of, or maybe even heard of for that matter, is the Huawei Mate 9. Now with it being 2017, the Mate 9 was announced late last year but it officially launches here
in the US this week at CES. So huge shout out to Huawei for not only sponsoring this video and kicking
off my CES coverage early, but also sending this my way so I could get a hands on
pretty early in the game. Now what immediately stood
out to me with the Mate 9 is the build quality is phenomenal. It's solid aluminum, super premium, and absolutely nothing about
this phone says "cheap." It's got a wicked fast fingerprint reader which is located on the back, it's packing great specs with four gigs of RAM, 64 gigabytes of storage, and micro SD card expansion. Now on top of that the Mate 9 is priced pretty competitively at $599, and because it's geared to
compete with the iPhone 7 Plus, and Google Pixel XL, if you were considering one of
those this could potentially save you almost 200 bucks. So next what I want to do is break it down into the top three most
compelling features of this phone, and first is hands down the camera. Just like we saw in Huawei's P9, once again they've teamed up with Leica for the glass on the smart
phone, and the end result is a really good freaking camera. Now within the camera are two sensors, a 12 megapixel RGB sensor
that's gonna capture the color and the bulk of the photo, and then a 20 megapixel monochrome sensor that's gonna work together
to capture the finer details. Now this thing is jam packed full of features and software, including a pro mode, which is gonna give you
not only tons of control but also flexibility. What surprised me most and what may be my favorite feature about this camera, or software rather, is actually how you can control exposure when you're not in pro mode. Instead of dragging exposure up or down, what you can do is tap to
select your focus points, and then from there actually
drag an exposure tracking point where you can use a
specific part of the image to balance exposure. So in this case instead of using the wood to balance exposure, I was able to drag the point
over to a brighter area, and with that I was able to find a pretty solid middle ground, and the end result was surprisingly good. In taking a deeper look at
some of the photos I took this one in particular
really impressed me. It's sharp, there's great dynamic range, and surprisingly this
shallow depth of field is real and not simulated. This one here is also
a really great example of natural shallow depth of field, no simulation here either. And then hopping over to some indoor shots this one in particular is
also one of my favorites because of how it handles the highlights, the shadows, the color is also really well balanced, it's not too saturated, it's just a nice mix of everything. Now with that monochrome
sensor comes the fun of taking true black and white pictures. Yes you could take a normal
photo and de-saturate it or apply a black and white filter, but there's something special about taking a true black and white picture. Now this is by no means a game changer and I understand completely that the majority of you out there want most of your photos in color. What it does do though is give you a creative spin on the pictures you do want in black and white. It almost forces you to
think of the picture, the composition, the framing differently, and the end result is really nice. There's tons of detail, and the flexibility of being able to take really great black and white photos, and really great color photos is awesome. Now everything we've
seen up until this point in terms of depth of field
has been completely natural, but because there are two sensors there is also a simulated depth mode, and again like most
simulated depth software out there it's not gonna
be perfect every time, but when you get it right,
it looks really good. The advantage that you
might have with this over something like the
iPhone 7 Plus is that really only truly works well
with people and portraits like the name implies, but with this you're able to
utilize it with objects as well instead of just people. On top of that it's also rocking an eight megapixel camera on the front that is equally impressive, and over all like I talked about it is a really fantastic camera that competes with the best of the best. Now next, the second
most compelling feature of the Mate 9 has gotta be battery life because inside this guy is packing a 4,000 milliamp hour battery. Most Android phones these days teeter between 2500 and
3500 milliamp hour range, so the fact that this
jumps into 4000 is awesome. Now as far as the display goes this thing is packing a 5.9 inch 1080p display so you are sacrificing some
pixels in terms of battery life. Myself personally, as
much as I do love pixels, 1080p still looks really
good on a smart phone. If you're used to 1440p you're probably gonna notice a difference, but really it comes down to would you prefer a lower resolution screen and better battery life, or the maximum amount of pixels. Rounding out the battery and battery life, this thing charges and connects via USB-C which in my opinion is the better route. There's an ever growing
list of USB-C devices, peripherals, chargers, so the fact that the Mate
9 includes USB-C is a win. Now last up the third most
compelling feature of the Mate 9 is the fact that it ships
with Android 7.0 Nougat. As far as software and updates go sometimes Android can be the wild west, so the fact that you get this out of the box is reassuring. For the most part the phone feels extremely lightweight and
responsive while using it, it's fast, it's zippy, and over all the
performance of Android 7.0 paired with the battery life, the camera, the micro SD card expansion make this a really well
rounded smart phone at a fantastic price. Aside from that hopefully
you enjoyed the video, if you did and you are
feeling like being awesome make sure to smash that like button. I am currently at CES 2017 so go ahead and drop a comment down below on what you want to see covered. This is Jonathon and I
will catch you guys later. (poppy electronic music) 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here. Welcome back to another episode of the Best Desk Setup, where this setup includes the computer. Drop a like if you're excited for that, but more specifically,
we are putting together a complete laptop setup for
under two thousand bucks. (upbeat ambient music) So, kicking off the setup for this episode I went with the Monarch
Specialties Hollow-Core desk. This is actually very similar
to the latest $500 setup, where you can set up the drawers to sit either on the right or the left-hand side. It's simple, but super clean. A little higher end,
a little more premium, and I love the metal frame that almost gives off this floating vibe. With the white desk, I wanted to accent it with dark grays and blacks. Keep it simple and not too over the top. Because honestly it is way too easy to want to throw eight
million things on your desk. And often times, especially
in this case, less is more. Next up as far as the laptop goes, LG reached out and said, "yo
Jon, you're setups are cool, I'm gonna let you finish, but you feature way too many MacBooks. We want
to sponsor a Windows setup." So, I was like, "funny you say that, I get a ton of requests
for Windows setups. What do you got?" They, in turn, sent out the
brand new 2017 13-inch gram, which is killing it in
the looks department, and one of the lightest laptops out there. So here, the setup looks beautiful sitting right there on the desk, but this guy weighs barely over two pounds and that makes it perfect
to also take on the go. (light electronic music) As far as the lightness goes, it is a little hard to paint
that picture through video, but if you pick one up
and hold one in person, you almost kind of double
take at how light it is. Now, with the LG gram you're also getting up to 15 hours of battery life, which of course makes
it perfect for traveling and being on the go, but that also makes if
perfect for a setup like this. The goal here is to keep
things clean with no clutter, cables and wires out of
sight, so the fact that you are not tied to a
power supply is awesome. As far as the display goes, it is rocking a super pretty
13-inch, 1920x1080p display. It's bright, the colors are fantastic, and I know you can see those
color popping behind me. As far as those sweet specs go, this is rocking a 7th Gen
Intel Core i5 processor, 8 gigabytes of RAM,
256 gigs of flash storage, and comes loaded with Windows 10. On top of the specs,
the beautiful display, it being super lightweight, there are also actual USB ports so you can plug things
in without an adapter. It's got a fingerprint reader. It is also touchscreen, so you're getting the best of both worlds. I think all that combined is the recipe for one of the best laptops out right now. With the gram having that
beautiful dark gray finish, I was on a mission to find the
perfect complimentary speaker and I think I found it. This is the Harman Kardon Onyx Mini, which matched the setup
perfectly and sounds even better. With the Onyx Mini it also allows us to keep the wire-free theme. One, by connecting through
BlueTooth to the laptop, and two, because there's
a built-in battery it also allows us to not have to be plugged into a power source. Now, the Onyx Mini is
pretty compact and tiny but can surprisingly fill a room, which you will see right now. (soulful rock music) You can see, not only does it
sound great, it looks great. And just like the laptop, because it is so compact and portable, it's
perfect for on the go. As far as the rest of the setup goes, below the laptop I have a dark
gray desk mat from Satechi which matches perfectly. It is one of my favorite
desk mats of all time. Next to the laptop is
for all of you out there who are always asking about
that fake plant in the setup. This particular one is
from Crate &amp; Barrel. It is under 10 bucks. As far as that sweet lamp behind me, I know I am going to butcher the name because it's from IKEA, so please correct me
in the comments below. It is a RULLAN and LAUTERS
combo which, together, is only about 50 bucks. The black base with the gray top sits really well with this setup, and I particularly like
the control you have over cable management and the fact that you can dim the light
straight from the lamp. Next, because I guarantee you someone is gonna ask about the canvas, that I actually picked up off Etsy and I then had printed out at Costco. They are not a sponsor, but I guess in addition to cheap hot dogs
and bulk household items, they do a fantastic canvas print as well. Last but not least, we are rounding this setup off with the chair. And if you think I butchered
the name of the lamp it is about to get ugly. This is the LÅNGFJÄLL from IKEA and for under 200 bucks
it is one of the most comfortable chairs I've sat on. Just like the lamp, it's got a black base with a dark gray top, which is actually more of a heather gray. Really, if you're looking
for a chair that looks good and is comfortable for
extended periods of sitting, this is a fantastic option. You can see right now I'm
rocking back and forth and does not have that squeak action. It's like one of those
horses on the playground back when they used to have sand. Then they changed it because
kids would eat needles. (giggle) Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed the video. If you did, and you're not subscribed yet, maybe hit that button here. If you love setup videos,
you need to watch this one. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (beep) (soulful rock music) Oh damn! - [Man] Are you okay? - [Jonathan] I hurt my knees. - [Man] Did you really? - [Jonathan] Man down. No, I'm all right. I just Andrew Bogut-ed my knees. 
- [Lois] Peter, we're gonna be
late for my cousin's wedding. Aren't you dressed yet? - [Peter] Oh crap. Well, one of us is gonna have to change. - Some things are just facts. It is a terrible time to be a Bulls fan, England is a beautiful city, and I am an iPhone user. And I realize I am probably
putting a giant target on my back by saying that, but honestly, I'm kinda tired of having
to be politically correct, especially when it comes to smartphones. You use what you use. You like what you like. For me, that happens to be an iPhone, but because of that, I feel
like it's kinda given me the chance to sit back and
watch the OnePlus 5 launch from a different perspective. There was so much hype
going into the launch, maybe too much for their own good, and once the phone dropped,
it got crapped all over, and maybe some of that was unwarranted. So what I wanna do is kinda break down the five biggest complaints
I've seen surrounding the OnePlus 5 and also
hopefully, shed some light on those complaints, as well. And hands down, the number
one comment I've seen is that it looks very, very
similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. So being an iPhone user and specifically, an iPhone 7 Plus user, yes, there are no doubt
similarities between these two, and honestly, I wouldn't be
surprised if someone mistake the OnePlus 5 for an
iPhone 7 Plus in the wild, but surprisingly, I
actually prefer the feel of the OnePlus 5 in my hand
over the iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 Plus has always
felt a little slippery and a little bulky. If you wear it in shorts, forget about it. And with the OnePlus 5
being lighter and thinner, I actually think it is a better
in-hand experience overall. So next up on number two,
one of the biggest complaints I've seen is that the
OnePlus 5 camera sucks. And honestly, it's not so
much that the camera sucks. It's more so that it's just not better than the best out right now. I think OnePlus really needed
to hit a home run with this, and had they done that, I don't think they would've been beaten up as badly as they have been. The Google Pixel is a great example. It is a flagship phone at a flagship price that is clearly missing a
ton of high-end features, but because of the pure android experience and because the camera was so good, it was pretty well received. As far as dual cameras
on the OnePlus 5 go, I think portrait mode works well. It's not better than the iPhone 7 Plus, but I think really the
bigger complaint I've seen is the fact that they wish
OnePlus 5 would've went with a wide angle lens
instead of a telephoto lens as the second option. Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus user where I'm kind of in the same boat with that second lens
being a telephoto option, I tend to agree, LG kinda nailed it with
their dual camera system. The wide angle is much, much more useful. So with that, I kinda wish OnePlus would've gone that route, as well. Now jumping from pictures to video, one of the things I noticed right away was the lack of OIS, and yes, there a software version of that, but it is nowhere near
as good as the real deal, and I think using an
iPhone 7 Plus for so long, that has gotta be one
of my favorite features, how well that video stabilization works. So from a camera package as a whole, I can kind see why OnePlus
got a little beat up for that. Next up on number three, the
biggest complaint I've seen is that it is only a 1080p display. Where, OnePlus, is my 1440p display, and where is my super
tall 18:9 aspect ratio? So yeah, I totally see that point, but I also don't see it as
the biggest deal in the world. Yes, the Galaxy S8 does a 1440p display, but it also shifts in a
1080p mode out of the box for better performance. The iPhone 7 Plus has a 1080p display, which I think looks fantastic, and yeah, you do lose out on that extra
tall 18:9 aspect ratio screen like on the LG G6 or technically, the 18 1/2:9 aspect
ration in the Galaxy S8, but those phones cost considerably
more than the OnePlus 5. Now next up on number five,
one of the biggest complaints I've seen is that the OnePlus
5 has no water resistance, and again, kinda jumping
back to the camera, if they had done a better job with that, I don't think the water
resistance would've been as big of a deal. Again, like I mentioned, the Google Pixel was not water resistant, but
because the camera was so good, because the experience was so good, it kinda got a pass for that. Could they have included water resistance with the OnePlus 5? Absolutely, but that
kinda ties into the fifth and final complaint I've
seen about this phone, and that is the fact that it
is simply too expensive now. Now, from that standpoint,
that is where I kinda disagree with everything. The OnePlus 5 starts at $479. You compare that to the iPhone 7 Plus, the Galaxy S8 Plus, the Google Pixel, those are all $700 plus. The iPhone 7 Plus, which is $770, only has 32 gigabytes of storage. Same thing with the Google Pixel XL. We can talk specs and benchmarks
or cheating benchmarks all day, but at the end of
it, what really matters, I think the best thing about
the OnePlus 5 is OxygenOS. It is clean. It is very similar to a
pure Google experience but also very useful at the same time. You have USBC, super fast
storage inside the phone, and hand down, one of the coolest features with the OnePlus 5 is their
Dash Charge technology, which is lightening quick. The unfortunate thing with
OnePlus is I kinda look at them as that person in a relationship who tried so, so hard at the beginning to go above and beyond, meet
these crazy expectations, but over the long term, just
couldn't simply keep that up. The problem though is that
second person in the relationship or I this case, the consumer
and the tech audience becomes a little bit jaded and maybe a little less
appreciative of the efforts now. Ultimately, the way I
look at the OnePlus 5 is kinda like a la carte cable. If there are channels and
features you don't want, you leave them off and
ultimately save money. In this case, if you don't
need water resistance, if you don't need a 1440p display, if you don't need an extra
tall 18:9 aspect ratio, then maybe you wanna
consider the OnePlus 5. On the other hand, maybe
you want those features, maybe you really want that better camera. Then I would step up to
the Galaxy S8, the LG G6, the iPhone 7 Plus, but maybe
those features aren't worth it to you and you wanna save $300, the OnePlus 5 is not bad at all. 
- Yo, guys, Jonathan here, and these are the brand new Beats X Wireless. Before we hop in, let's talk AirPods. Those have been out for
a couple months now. I really enjoy them, but
now that the Beat X Wireless is here, let's see how
they stack up side-by-side. Without question, the first
thing we gotta compare is price. Apple's AirPods come in at $159, whereas the Beats X Wireless
are 10 bucks cheaper, so, as far as cash goes,
they are pretty spot on. As far as what you get in
the box: on the AirPod side of things you get the case,
which also charges the AirPods, the AirPods themselves, some literature. You might not see it at first glance, but deep inside the packaging
is a lightning cable. As far at the Beats go, you
get the Beats X Wireless, a carrying case, which does
not provide any kind of charge. You do, however, get customizable
ear tips, so just in case these don't fit, you can
swap 'em out and, in turn, get a better fit in your ear. Just like the AirPods, you
also get a lightning cable. Unlike the AirPods, though,
when you pick up a pair of Beats X Wireless, you
get a code for three months of free Apple music, which I'm gonna flash in three, two, one. Now, just like the AirPods,
the Beats X Wireless feature Apple's W1 chip, so
pairing is stupid simple. For the Beats, you simply
hold the power button with them next to your iPhone,
an icon's gonna pop up, you hit Connect, and that is it. Also, like the AirPods,
Beats X Wireless also feature iCloud connectivity, and what that means is you can instantly switch back and forth from, say, your iPhone to your Mac. Now, with the AirPods, one
of my favorite features was the Apple Watch
integrations, which is hands down my favorite way to control them, With the Beats X Wireless you
also get that functionality, so the fact that you don't
have to sacrifice that is really cool. One of the advantages I will
say the Beats X Wireless have over the AirPods, no
question, are inline controls. With the AirPods you have
control through your phone, the aforementioned Apple
Watch, which you have to buy separately or already own,
or what most people will use, or potentially may not use is Siri, because I don't think
many people wanna talk to their earphones to change
the volume or change a song. With the Beats X Wireless you
have all that functionality plus the ability to change
a song, raise the volume, activate Siri right through
the inline controls. While functionality between
these two is very, very similar, the giant difference
between these is design. AirPods, on one hand, are
completely and truly wire free, whereas, with the Beats X
Wireless, you do have a cable that, in turn, will run behind your head. Personally I will say I love the freedom of not having any wires
whatsoever, but, on the other side, with the Beats X Wireless,
having that cable almost adds a layer of security for some
people, simply due to the fact that, because your ear pods are connected, you're gonna reduce your chances of losing half of your headphones. What I think it comes
down to is the question of do you want the freedom
of the wire free AirPods, or will you sacrifice that
for that extra security and the inline controls
on the Beats X Wireless? From there the question that comes next is how do these fit in your ears? With the AirPods, Apple
kinda went with the one size fits most approach, so, if
they don't fit in your ears, you're kinda screwed, but,
in my case, because they do they're really locked in. With the Beats X Wireless,
those also fit really Well] in my ears, and, again, on the plus side, if they don't fit out of the box, you do have those customizable tips, which is a definite plus. As far as pure looks go,
I think it's safe to say the Beats X Wireless look
better than the AirPods which always still look
a little funny to me, but, looks aside, as far as my ears go, both of these fit really well. With the AirPods, surprisingly,
those are not coming out of my ears no matter
what I do, so, with that, I wanted to test out the Beats X Wireless. Starting with something as
simple as shaking my head back and forth, the Beats X
Wireless stayed in perfectly and did not fall out. Upping the ante, though, and
playing a little basketball, schooling my buddy, Rich, once
again the Beats X Wireless stayed in perfectly and did not fall out. (hip hop music) Finally, the only way I was
able to get the Beats X Wireless to fall out of my ears was
with a poorly-attempted front flip off a
trampoline into some sand, so I apologize for what
you just had to witness, but, if you appreciate
the front flip attempt, go ahead and drop a like down below. As far as sound quality goes,
I'm pretty familiar with the AirPods, so now it's time to give the Beats X Wireless a shot. Right ear in. Left ear. Immediately what I notice
with the Beats X Wireless compared to the AirPods was,
surprise, surprise, more bass. I think that has to do with
how they actually sit and fit in your ears, where they're
actually jam packed in there, but, conversely, going back
to the AirPods after listening to the Beats X Wireless,
those actually sounded a little bit thin. If we were talking solely
sound quality and that was it I'm gonna throw it out there
that most people out there I think would prefer the Beats X Wireless. I personally do think the AirPods sound a little more balanced overall,
but, if you like that bass, definitely go with the Beats X Wireless. The other thing that I noticed immediately with the Beats X Wireless
was that sound isolation seemed night and day better. With the AirPods, if you're
not in a loud environment, they do the job great,
but, once you get into a noisier situation like
the gym, I often find myself battling the volume, trying to turn it up to battle the outside noise, but with the Beats X Wireless, though,
those do a much better job of blocking that sound out, but to be sure I wanted to put it to the test. Right now, at about 50% volume
I'm gonna pop this in my ear and let Ralphie hit it. (loud vacuuming) Hopping over to the AirPods,
once again I had the volume set to around 50%. One advantage I do wanna point
out with the AirPods, though, is the play/plause feature,
so, because this isn't in my ear right now, right
now the song is paused. Once I pop it back in
there, the song will resume. That is something not available
on the Beats X Wireless. With that said, though,
sound isolation may be a completely different story,
so let's check this out. (loud vacuuming) One leaf blower later, I
can definitely confirm that the Beats X Wireless do a much
better job at sound isolation over the AirPods, so, if that
is something important to you, the Beats definitely take the cake. Besides that, breaking down smaller things like how you charge them,
both the Beats X Wireless and the AirPods have
really stellar options. With the Beats X Wireless
you can get two hours of battery life with only
five minutes of charge time, which is crazy. The AirPods, on the other
hand, also hold their own really well where 15 minutes
of charge time equates to three hours of battery life. One advantage you do
get with the AirPods is, because you charge through the case, that is gonna give you multiple charges. With the AirPods by themselves,
those are gonna last around four to five hours, but
with the case fully charged, that's gonna get you nearly a full day. The Beats X Wireless will last
longer on a single charge, around eight hours, but overall
you're definitely getting more with the AirPods, not to
say that the Beats X Wireless battery life is bad by any
means, 'cause it's actually really solid, but it's
just something to consider when you're comparing these side-by-side. Another really awesome thing
with the Beats X Wireless is the fact that they actually
clip together magnetically. If the AirPods had that,
it would be game over. Overall, I think these are
both fantastic options, especially if you own an iPhone. They will, of course, also
both work with Android, but, if you wanna get
the most out of these, you definitely wanna use iOS. With that said, though,
if you are using Android, I would definitely grab
the Beats X Wireless over the AirPods, because
you're gonna get way more functionality, but, at the end of the day, it really comes down to
whether you want the freedom and flexibility of the AirPods
or the security of the cable with the Beats X Wireless
and that extra layer of bass that you're not getting with Apple. Regardless, though, hopefully this helped ease your buying decision,
but, if you're wondering how do these stack up against Jaybirds, my good buddy Austin Bolt
Evans just dropped a video where I may or may not have
raced and/or tackled him, which you can check
out here, and subscribe if you haven't yet. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. Kobe! 
- So as you may have heard, this week marks the 10th
anniversary of the iPhone. But what you may not know
is the story of the iPhone actually dates back all the way to 1977. (upbeat techno music) Not only is this month the
10th anniversary the iPhone, it is actually the 40th
anniversary of the Apple II, which I have right here, in this bag. Now I've never seen one in person, so I'm a little excited check this out and fun fact, the tech inside this was mostly design by Steve Wozniak, but in classic Steve Jobs form, he actually took the spotlight and debuted in 1977 at
West Coast Computer Faire and yes, Apple did build and sell the original
Apple I a year prior, but really this was
the first Apple product geared for the masses. Now unfortunately, this sweet leather bag was sold separately back in the day, but that shows you Apple
was still milking people for leather accessories
from the beginning of time. Now what I notice immediately, is this apple over here on
the bag is fully intact. There's no bite out of this. From what I understand, Apple actually added that bite so people would not confuse this with a cherry or tomato. Let's crack into this bag. Gotta be careful. This is a vintage piece of tech. Hey! We got some... (computer bangs) This is the Apple 2. Man, this is much, much different than computers we see today. And again, I never seen
one of these in person so this is really, legitimately, my first experience with this. Ah! So unlike Apple products today, Apple actually wanted this to be really accessible to the users so you can upgrade parts, you can add iO. Not like anything we see today with Apple, where they charge you
millions of dollars for RAM. Now for reference to how
far things have come today this had a one megahertz processor. One freaking megahertz. And for contrast, you'd need about 2,000 of these to equate to the computing
power inside most phones today. Now something interesting
with the Apple II is there was no floppy
disk drive on this machine. So the way you accessed data or really did pretty much anything was through add on peripherals,
like this guy here. You can see we have a whole slew of additional ports and lanes, so it's kind of similar to how you'd add a video card or a PCI SSD, to a modern computer today. But the attention to detail
on this is kind of crazy. What immediately stands out to
me is the Apple computer logo right smack in the middle and I'm willing to bet that this was more than likely intentional because of how OCD Steve Jobs was. On the left, we have the power supply followed by the speaker below that. I'm going to pop the top back on. Hopping over to the keyboard. I'm actually not sure why there
is a BELL text on the G key. Why is there a BELL? From a quick Google results, the BELL key was actually
activated by typing control G. That's a holdover from old
typewriters and teletype machines that actually had a
little metal bell in them. Moving on to the keyboard. This has some nice
click-y, tactile response, very similar to a mechanical keyboard. In addition to the BELL key, there's also a REPT key, which I would assume means repeat, but also unlike any computer
keyboard we see today. That's crazy! There's like the at symbol on the P, so it's a shift @ P TLD TODAY. Now, funny story, we actually used to have a disk drive that we thought would be a great idea to turn into an SSD, throw it in dream desk 3 and then give it away. But that left us without
an option for the Apple II. But not to worry we
have the Apple II C here which does have a floppy reader built-in and will allow us to play
The Glorious Oregon Trail. You may be a banker from Boston, be a carpenter from Ohio.. Immediately my mind goes to
basketball Celtics or Cavaliers. I don't think I want any of those. Be a farmer from Illinois.
That's the Bulls! - [Announcer] Greatest mascot in the NBA. - I don't even know what four
was but I selected three. What is the first name
of the wagon leader? Austin Ekans, Rich, Terry Crews, Kanye West. So you're going to Oregon. I can fix you up with what you need. Man he's selling me drugs. I charge $40 a yolk. That's some expensive eggs right there. Now loading the wagon. You see those sweet color graphics, that's actually a fun fact. The Apple II was able to
output color graphics. So that's actually why Apple
did the colored Apple logo. It was a way to market that, hey, this machine can output color. S for shoot, nope. B for blasts, D for dead, shift. I did not buy any ammo. Terry Crews, no! Kanye West has a fever. (laughs) Kanye West just died. Rich just died. - You're dead.
- I'm dead. Terry Crews just died. - No! - That's everybody, right? Here lies Austin Ekans. (laughs) Well, that's the darkest Oregon
Trail game I've ever played. Now from there, let's
fast-forward from 1977 to 2007. This is what a popular smartphone looked like before the iPhone. Shout out to the Sidekick. And when you think back
on what people assume the iPhone was gonna be, I think they really just pictured an iPod with a phone built in which would have been terrible. Luckily though, we got this which over the past 10 years
has transformed into this. Now hopping back to the Apple II, besides the sweet retro
color or paint job, how is this iPhone and the Apple II, two very different-looking
machines, the same. Really what I think you
have to ask yourself is what was Apple trying
to do with these products. When they Apple II first came out, it was often referred to
as an appliance computer, just like those things in your kitchen. Steve Jobs really wanted people
to associate the Apple II just like they would have
blender or a toaster, not in the way that would make you food but more so that it was intuitive and would make your life easier. Flash back to before the Apple II, this was the modern-day home computer which had crazy switches and lights. Honestly, it really
didn't look too invited. I think that was the purpose and why the Apple II
looks the way it does. It was meant to be simple and something that you
wanted to use naturally Now think back to the iPhone. From it's beginning stage, iOS was so simple a baby could use it. So, really, when you look
back at the Apple product, over the years, it's kind of always led to this. The simple appliance computer that is meant to make your life easier. So basically, what Jobs
and Wozniak dreamed about all the way back in 1977, has evolved into what you maybe watching this video on today. 
(can rattles) (spray can noise) - Whoo Don't inhale paint, kids. Yo guys, Jonathan here. It is no secret, I love
desks, I love setups, but this one in particular
next to me is beautiful. The gray mixed with the
custom blue and red drawers look amazing and
shout-out to my boy Etika, because this is clearly-- - Joy-Con boys. - Inspired. Now the goal in mind
was to not only to create the perfect setup where you could
dock and play your Switch, but to actually switch
between the Nintendo Switch, the NES Classic and a
fully-functioning computer. So the centerpiece of the setup
is the Alex desk from Ikea, which is one of my
favorite desks of all time. I will admit, it does hold a special place in my tech heart because it pays tribute all the way back to the
original dream desk. That was showcased in
white, this of course, is in gray, but what's
awesome is back then it was priced at around 170 bucks and now it has dropped
all the way down to 130. Something you're not gonna
find at Ikea, however, are those super sweet
custome blue and red drawers, which when paired to the gray, the desk looks incredible next to the Switch. So the process behind this
really wasn't too crazy, we pulled the drawers out
and from there spray painted them with a two in one
primer spray paint combo. (simple music) Now if you're wondering what kind of paint we used, and no this is not a sponsor. So much in fact, I gotta look down to see what these are called. We got a little Rust-Oleum
painters touch action in Satin Poppy Red
and Satin Oasis Blue. Now I'm not gonna lie, the end result came way better than I
ever could've hoped for. The drawers are vibrant, they pop and really make the desk look like they were meant for the Switch. Now hands down, one of the
best things about this desk is the integrated cable management. Because without it, this would look like a rat's nest paradise. This setup in particular was
a little more complicated that most, simply because
there were multiple devices going into a single monitor. You pair that with the
speakers and heightened cables became a little tricky, but the end result was pretty fantastic. Now the magic behind this setup is located in the blue drawer behind me. Inside there is a Kinivo HDMI switcher, and what this is gonna allow us to do is jump back and forth between the Switch, the NES Classic and a
super tiny Intel NUC, which is a crazy valued mini PC, which comes in under 300 bucks. Now unfortunately, both
the Nintendo Switch and the NES Classic are
pretty much impossible to find right now, but
if you need to have one right now, post a couple links down below where you can scoop one up if
you don't mind paying markup. So what I have the Switch,
NES Classic and the NUC going into is a Samsung
CFG70, which is a pretty bad-ass 27 inch curved gaming monitor. So funny enough, during the infancy stages of this setup, I actually
posted a teaser on Instagram with a 23 inch Acer monitor. That's actually much
cheaper, around 100 bucks, but I got a ton of requests
to go for a bigger monitor, so that's why I ended up
going the Samsung route, but if you don't need anything as robust or maybe you like the smaller for factor, the Acer is a great alternative. Now as far as the speakers goes, I'm using the Bose Companion 5, and these have also kinda
turned into a secret trick of the setup, so to speak. What I love about this speaker is the fact that they come with a super
handy volume controllers. I was actually able to mount
it underneath the desk, which makes it easy to
access and also hides it, keeping the setup clean and tidy. So rounding out the setup
across the rest of the desk, I have some classic fake Ikea greenery, followed by this super
cool, solar blaze Mega Man from Pixel Pals, it
actually lights up, like so. Amazing. Popping this guy back on the
desk with the no look action, on the other side of the desk
is the Breath of the Wild Zelda amiibo. Next to that is not super
necessary for this setup, but I just really loved
how the blue matched the Nintendo Switch theme. This is the Bose Sound
Link in Aquatic Blue. These come in a few different colors and while they're not the
ideal setup for a desk, they do make a fantastic
portable Bluetooth speaker. Lastly, as far as the
keyboard and mouse go, this is actually a really
good deal from Jelly Comb. It's both the mouse and
the keyboard as a pair for 30 freaking bucks. Before I forget though,
because I know someone's gonna yell at me if I don't talk about it, the artwork above me is a
Super Mario Banksy canvas that I found on Amazon and
I'll make sure to post a link to it and everything we
talked about down below. Aside from that, hopefully
you enjoyed the video. If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to smash that like button, and if you haven't caught it yet, there's still a chance to win
a brand new Nintendo Switch, which you can check out here. Also, my buddy Kevin Kenson
may have figured a way to get wireless charging
on the Nintendo Switch, that is here. This is Johnathan, and I
will catch you guys later. (beep) Reach for the sky. The double-flip. Poosh! Jon's dead! 
- Alright, here we go. (clapping) Did I clap already? Yo, guys. Jonathan here, and welcome to the Behind the Scenes of iPhone X unboxing. I thought it would be cool
to give you a sneak peek of what goes on into a video. This particular shot is gonna be focused on the iPhone X trick shot where, in this case the phone sitting here isn't going to be in that shot. I'm going to reach this
way, and hopefully, grab the iPhone X and bring it out here to kick off the video. Yeah. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) So at some point, I'm gonna toss the phone to you
since you got a free hand. - [Brandon] You betcha. - And then I'll catch it outside. Yo, guys, Jonathan here. I'm excited, and hopefully you are too, and that is because it is
iPhone X unboxing time. This is it. Let's go. - I'm happy. - Cool. So we got the footage
inside Final Cut Pro X. We of course have the main talking shot, the second silly shot of the iPhone X. Drew a little masker on that, feathered it off to give it
a nice little smooth look, and I think, Rich, if you wanna come make sure we didn't screw this up. We're gonna watch it
back for the first time. And we go full-screen. Jonathan here. I'm excited and hopefully you are too, and that is because it is
iPhone X unboxing time. This is it. (slapping table) Let's go. Got 'em. So we're moving on to the outdoor shot. This is gonna be where I catch the phone from me throwing it to myself. We got Brandon, Rich. Rich is gonna throw the phone to me. Brandon locking down the camera. - 'Sup. - And, uh... Let's see if we can pull this one off. We got some nice sweet, sweet lens flare. J.J. Abrams, what's up? So, here we have the box
with the iPhone X in it. - We have to record that, sorry. I'm an idiot. - You're not an idiot, Brandon. - You like it like that
though, just kinda like this? - 'Kay, give me a heave. - Like Jansen last night, getting wrecked. - Who's Jansen again? - Dodgers, man. Sorry to all you Dodgers fans. That was a brutal, brutal game. He was a Dodgers fan. He doesn't look too happy right now. - You want me to get the
wide shot of you saying that? - Let's do that one more time. Yeah, we'll do it one more time. - Cool. Uh, wide, or close? - Wide, wide. I think we have enough
when up close to cover it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy there. - Three, two, and go. - So, here we have the box, iPhone X previewed on the outside. We got that pretty,
pretty, pretty wallpaper, that notch, which may be
for better or for worse, but we shall see. Towards the bottom, we
have the flashlight icon, the camera icon, and
from what I understand, you can access those by 3D touching, and actually what might be the
coolest part about this box, and I'm not sure if you can pick it up, but this outer part, which would be the stainless steel
portion of the iPhone X, on the box, actually has this little bit of reflective shine,
and is kind of awesome. Now as far as the lighting, this is actually one of the coolest things I've picked up in a long time, the Westcott Flex light kit. This is in a china box,
something like that, where this is the Westcott Flex soft box. And they're super portable, you can take these in a suitcase, and just to give you a
demo what it looks like, Rich, you wanna kill the right light? And I have this sitting
just off to the side here, giving me some fill here, and kinda battling the super
bright windows behind us. One light off, second light. There we go, so you can
see that should make a huge difference. Back on. Thanks, buddy. So now we've hopped
over to the night scene. It's completely dark outside and these lights are really really, really coming through. It's kind of incredible what we got here. We got pumpkins everywhere. So I'm just gonna give
you a little sneak peek of the image right now. Pumpkin one. Switch up that light for a warm light, give it a little bounce. We got pumpkins and some sweet lens flare. I'm recording on the iPhone X right now. This is actually a
really cool piece of tech from Quasar Science, portable light, you can take it anywhere, it's magnets. Jesse Pinkman would be proud. Not sure again what this
little light is called, but it actually will split up color, so that's giving us a little
splash in the background. And Rich running sound, Brandon making sure I don't screw this up. And here we go. So with this night scene to
give you a little example of what these lights are doing I'm gonna turn this main light off. Rich, do you wanna go
hit that other light? Probably looking Halloween AF right now. 'Bout to get creepier in a second. That's a pretty big difference, so main one, overhead, back on. Probably looks pretty good, got a little shadow going on right now, and then we're gonna use this as the fill and it does an amazing job. (beeping) Yeah, I'm a monkey. Rich. I'm gonna break your legs. Aww, I'm gonna sound like an (bleep). 
- Yo guys, Jonathan
here, there's a couple firsts that are going down
here on the channel right now. One, is the first time I'm
shooting in 60 frames per second, 4K mind you, so if you've
been out there requesting and craving that sweet 4K 60fps goodness, today, is the day, now
I'm doing so through the iPhone 10, that is one
of the more impressive features with the iPhone
10 as well as 8 and 8 plus, and whether you love
Apple or you hate them, it is still impressive to get
that out of a smart phone, because honestly, not even
many high end cameras have that, but, we are also doing
another thing with this, we are unboxing, oh man,
how do you like that sweet motion, through
60 frames per second, this is, the Xbox One X,
that's been sitting here, haven't got a chance to check it out yet, so I figure what better
way to unbox this then through the iPhone 10
in 60 frames per second. So lets crack this box
open, we got a beautiful plane, in the distance,
so let me know how that sounds or looks, we got
some special limited edition Xbox One X design packaging. And this looks like a... Setup book, and it is
some pretty, nice quality, like you could knock
somebody out with that. Beyond that, I'm just gonna
kinda get some motions going on since we're doing the
4K 60fps, Planet Earth 2! I'm not really that excited
for that, but, just in case, you've been wanting to get
your Planet Earth 2 on, this is included with this,
from what I understand, there are quite a bit of
game codes included with this press kit, so
throughout the video, look for some Easter eggs you're
going to get a chance to win some free games. From there, there it is,
there's the Xbox One X. Behold, have you ever
seen an Xbox One X in 4K 60fps probably, because
most channels you watch this on are shooting 60 frames per second, but probably not in 4k, so... That is a difference here. I'm not going to litter,
but, I'm going to throw the box at Ralphy right now, cause he is in this
ridiculous Where's Waldo costume and... - You can't see me bro. (laughing) - Sorry man, oh no, oh no, well I was going to
say there was a problem, because I didn't have any
knife or any way to get in through this, but,
seems like the bottom just collapsed on me, so, nonetheless, like Fogel says, "We are in." Here we go, we got the
hardware, the Xbox One X itself. Now this is a little
different from the limited edition Project Scorpio,
that is coming out for those who got a
chance to pre-order that, but, stay tuned, because we may or may not be giving one of those away. (upbeat pop music) Look at that blow... In 60fps glory. So there we have it,
it's very similar to the Xbox One S, a little
bit longer, but more so, the more impressive thing
is how much power they're packing inside of this and
still retaining the design. From there, I'm going
to set that off and it's going to blend into the park
bench that we're at right now, power cable, that is also
one of the more impressive things that I remember from
my first impressions is that even though this is a much
more powerful machine, its actually using these
same power cables, so, wow, so that's cool,
Microsoft includes the HDMI cable because no one
wants to run to Walmart... Well no one really wants
to run to Walmart anyway, but, on top of that, if
you have to pick up an HDMI cable, that is no fun, from there, last but not least, inside this Xbox One X unboxing, we have the
cable, I'm going to walk over here and get you
guys a close up of that. Through the iPhone 10,
feels good in the hand, we got like, 15-20 minutes of light left, so it should be a pretty good
test, because with the 4K 60 you do need more light
then 30 frames per second or 24, so let me know what you guys think. Aside from that, this has
been kind of a chaotic, a little bit messy
unboxing of the Xbox One X, like I said, I am giving
one of these away, but not just this one, the
Project Scorpio edition, and I'm doing so with
my buddy Kevin Kenson, who has been killing it
on the gaming coverage, not only with the Xbox One
X, but everything so far. So if you're interested,
details, rules, and the link is below so you
can enter this giveaway, this is Jonathan, if you
missed my iPhone 10 unboxing I'll link it here and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo, guys, Johnathon here, and if you're wondering
why I look like this, it'll all make sense shortly. But essentially, the reason
we're here is to check out the 240fps 1080p slow-mo on the iPhone 8, and to make it interesting,
stack it side by side against this, the Red Epic-W,
which is a $30,000 camera. And the reason I'm doing
that is, surprisingly, 240fps 1080p is not a
feature you will find on many phones or even cameras out there, I think, as of now, until
the next GoPro comes out. Allegedly, I've also
heard that the Pixel 2 is going to have 1080p 240 slow motion, but for now, it's like
something where the Scarlet-W or the Raven is the cheapest option. It was like 14 or 15 grand
just to get that feature. Obviously, two different
sensors, different camera. I'm not gonna say this is
magically gonna be better, but the fact that you
have this in your pocket is kinda crazy, and let's test it out and see why am I fully colored. Rich, how do you feel about that? Can I take the Red in the water? - Absolutely not, never! No. - Why you yelling at me? - 'Cause this is crazy, John. - Yep, he gets it. He said, "Anything for the shot." (upbeat electronic music) Now, the one thing just realized, I may not have had to get in
the water the second time, because in order to get
240 frames per second on this camera, we have
to switch it to 2K. That, in turn, crops it in crazy much. So to kind of get a similar
framing, I'm actually, you know, right about here. I'm gonna roll. (upbeat electronic music) So, for reference, you saw how close I was with the iPhone 8. I was able to get pretty
much right up in there, where with this, because
of the crop factor, I have to stand all the way back here, which is kinda crazy. So, for test number two, I'm not sure if it's the greatest idea, but I'm gonna try and jump and clear that bench right there. Right now, I have the iPhone 8 set up, and then following that,
once we get this done, I'll set up the Red in
a similar configuration, so we can kind of match that framing. Let's try this out. (grunting) (buzzing) JK. Flagged for (censored) jumping! (grunting) That was a full clear,
that was a full clear. Spiderman, what's up? Ready for it? Clean dismount. - [Male] Sean, if you're a skateboarder, this is a phone you need. - I'm not a skateboarder,
but if you are, Tai Moss, you'd better upgrade. Do you know how to kick flip. - I don't. This is a new skateboard. It's like jacked because
if I turn too much-- - But you normally could. - No, I still can't. Also, I can't turn right now. - Got it, okay. So, we're back on the Red, and again, because of that crop
factor, you're about to see, I'm gonna have to move back quite a bit compared to the iPhone. Again, this is not super
scientific, Danny Winget. We're kinda more or less
just having fun here. Ah. Way back. Jump test number two. Hopefully I don't fall
on my face this time. All right, I got this down. Two clearance, two clearance. Red down, one more. (grunting) So, at this point of the day,
where it's getting darker, and because that crop is so intense, we are effectively letting in
much less light to the sensor, so you can see it start to
get grainier and noisier. Again, the point of the RED camera is not for 240fps slow motion. Especially when you have to crop that beautiful sensor this much. It's moreso an example
of how that actually is a really cool feature
to have on a smartphone, but I think that case is
made, so from here on out, it's time to enjoy some
iPhone 8 slow motion goodness. So, for the grand finale, we have a Photojojo colorblast kit. I'm not sure if I should
go with pink or blue. Ralph has got yellow. I'm not even sure how this works. It feels like a bottle of mustard. (upbeat electronic music) - Hello, guys, my name is Ralph, and today you are watching Disney Channel. - You got me, man. - Was my audition good? - Now you're hired. - Sweet! Ah! You got my glasses dirty! (laughing) - So, thank you guys
very much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed this test. Again, it wasn't meant
to be super scientific, but at least we had some fun. Right now, it's actually just about time to go take out the Galaxy S8
and iPhone 8 out of the water. I think, because magic, and somehow you're gonna see this video second, so if you missed that
video, click right here. There's also a chance to win an iPhone 8, or a Galaxy S8 here. This is Johnathon, and
I'll catch you guys later. 
- You guys, Jonathan here. And, if you've been looking for a pair of AirPods alternatives, you're
gonna wanna check these out. (upbeat music) These are the brand new Air NANO wireless
headphones from crazybaby, which are so new in fact,
they aren't even out yet. They're currently available
for pre-order on Indiegogo. So, giant shout out to crazybaby for letting me check these out early, and sponsoring this first look. Now on top of that, I also
got a chance to give away a brand new pair to you guys. For details on how to win, make sure you guys check
out the link below. And it's not required, but
if you guys appreciate that, let me know by smashing that like button. So, the Air NANO's come
in this capsule-like case, that both houses and charges
them with a fully charged case. You usually get about 15
hours of battery life. They also come with a ton of
ear tips, which right there, may be an advantage over AirPods. For me, AirPods fit, they don't fall out, but for a lot of people, they just don't agree with their ears. And with this, that'll
help ensure a perfect fit. One thing that immediately
jumped out to me, that I really appreciate, is that the case charges via
USBC, so thank you crazybaby. That is one less cable I gotta carry. Now another really
unique aspect with these, they're gonna be available
in 10 different colors. Black, White, Red, Purple,
Pink, Matte Gold, Austin Yellow, Morandi Blue, Atlantis
Green, and Volt Green. Now, these are gonna start out at $99, but if you catch that
Indiegogo link early, you can actually pre-order these for $89. Which is a substantial amount cheaper than a pair of AirPods,
Which are around $160. Now regardless of the price, or however many colors they come, if they don't sound good,
and more importantly, if they don't stay in your
ears, none of that matters. Naturally, the first thing I wanted to do was see how well they stayed in my ears. Surprisingly, these
stock ear tips that came with the Air NANO's
seem to work perfectly. I started out the test
with a simple head shake, and then leveled up to a mediocre 360 jump off a very small ledge. That passed the first
test with flying colors. So the next test was
also a mediocre attempt at a handstand on a rail. The bad news is, I did
not execute that move. The good news is, the headphones did not
fall out of my ears. So based off that, I think
they're gonna be great. Not only for day to day use, but also if you want to
take them to the gym, or workout with them. Yes, there is the argument that because they are two tiny earbuds, what if I lose them? The fact of the matter is, you're gonna get in the habit
of charging them in the case. If you do that, that is not something you're not gonna have to worry about. So, clearly they stay in my ears, but how do these things sound? With AirPods, yeah, they work really well for most situations. But if you're at the
gym, or on an airplane, RIP whatever you're trying to listen to. With these, they definitely do a much better job with that. And, kind of fill in
that gap where AirPods are kinda lacking. Now, these are also rocking Bluetooth 5.0, and a Qualcomm CSR chip that's gonna help ensure
solid connectivity. Yeah, you don't get
that super satisfactory WN pairing experience like
you would with AirPods, but set up was super simple. And the beautiful part
is, once you are paired, it will automatically pair every time you take these out of the case. So the takeaway here is,
they sound great, thumbs up. They fit in your ears, thumbs up. And, they are much cheaper than AirPods, for the final, and third thumbs up. On top of that, I think the thing that has me most hyped is all those pretty, pretty colors. I definitely want to
check out the blue ones. Let me know what's your favorite colors with a comment down below. Again, if you jump on
that early bird special, you can scoop these up for $89. I will drop the link down below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and
today is gonna be a fun day. LG reached out and wanted to sponsor an extreme water test,
and I was like wait, you want me to try and
destroy your phone with water? They said yes, so I was like, I am in, and now we're about to put the LG G6 through its paces. So what we're gonna do
is incrementally climb the ladder of extreme, so to speak. We're gonna start out somewhat small, with a simple one hour in water test. Once it hopefully passes that, we can then move on, but as a disclaimer, do not do what I do. Just because this phone
can withstand the water doesn't mean you should replicate the dumb things I'm about to do. Drop a like if you appreciate that though, because the last thing I wanna do is see you void your warranty. And with that out of the way, let's drop this guy in water. (upbeat electronic music) So the hour's passed and actually taking a look at the phone, we
got a little more than that. We're currently sitting at
about an hour and 13 minutes. Everything looks good so far, but I'm gonna pull it
out just to make sure. Shake it off a little bit. So I'm gonna hop out of the timer and everything looks good so far. I do wanna make sure that the
speakers are still intact, so let's go and actually
test out the screen with some audio playing. (dramatic music) So it definitely passed that test, which really wasn't too much of a shocker. But what it does mean is that
we're ready for round two. Part of the next test, we
are taking the G6 hiking. It might get a little wet. - [Camera Man] No man, we'll be fine. - [Jonathan] This is just
the beginning, buddy? - [Camera Man] Is this it? Is
it gonna be worse than this? - Yes, your feet are gonna get wet. So we're about 15 minutes in right now, and man, hiking is pretty good cardio, but we're racing the light right now, hoping to find the waterfall
before it gets dark. So, we shall see. (upbeat techno music) All right, so, we made it, and I was kinda hoping that maybe we wouldn't make it in time, with the sun dropping out, but now this means I gotta do it. (upbeat techno music) God, it's cold! Oh, that is cold. Oh, it's cold. Well, that was cold,
but, obviously the phone passed that test. We're on to the final round. So next up, yes, I am standing on top of a washing machine. That is because we're about
to toss the G6 inside. I will, of course, make
sure we use cold water, so we don't shrink that sweet display. But now, let's go ahead
and soak this baby up. (dramatic music) (clanking loudly) So, the cycle is completed. Honestly, we may have gone a
little too extreme with this, in the sense that there
is nothing but the phone. No pillows, no blankets,
no padding to protect it. But now, it is the moment of truth, and we've gotta see if it survived. I'm kind of a little bit scared. I heard it rattling and
smashing around inside. So, pop the door open, grab the phone. Holy crap, the phone is still alive! The screen is on! No dings, no damage, no cracks. The screen is working perfectly. I know it's probably a little hard to see in this blinding, blazing sunlight. So as impressive as the water test, I may be more surprised due to the fact that it actually survived
being tossed around like a rag doll inside. But that means we are ready
to move on to the next round. So next up, it's time to
whip out the heavy artillery. It, by no means, is this an
official IP69K test, nor am I an official tester, so please, do not do what I do. I'm about to blast this G6 full of water. Look at that. Notifications work, the
camera's still recording. I think we should probably
bump up the test a little. (dramatic music) (menacing laughter) (upbeat music) So, at the end of the day, whether it was an hour underwater, a hike through a waterfall, being tossed in a load of laundry, or blasted with pressure and water, the LG G6 held its own and then some. Huge thanks to LG for
sending this my way early. Again, this is a pre-production model, so things may change in the final version. Again, don't do what I did. But hopefully you enjoyed
it and had some fun. If you did, make sure you
guys drop a like down below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathon here, and over the weekend while I
was busy talkin' about desks, you may have seen LG
drop their brand new G6. Fortunately, I was able
to get my hands on it, check it out, see what the hype is about, and these are my thoughts 48 hours later. Now, for starters with
the G6, LG has thankfully ditched the modular design
of its predecessor, the G5, and instead gone with a safer
all-glass, all-metal body that is super pretty and while
it may not be groundbreaking, I really like it. The one thing you do lose
with the lack of modularity though, is the removable battery. For me that's never been a huge issue, with the abundance of battery
banks and fast charging. For some people that
may be a deal breaker, but honestly, I think it
is a small price to pay in turn for what yields to be
a much better overall phone. Now, as far as the battery goes, internally this is
packing 3,300 milliamps, which isn't bad, but it's also not great. I kinda wish LG woulda
pushed this a little further, maybe somewhere north
of 4,000, but overall, you should still get some really solid battery life with the G6. And more importantly, like the Rock says, - Finally, - wireless charging is here. Now wireless charging is a
game changing or revolutionary, and yes, we've seen it on a
ton of other phones before, but it's 2017, which means
it's about time every phone includes wireless charging. I am looking at you, Apple. So thumbs up to LG on this one. So, while the removable
battery may be gone, the one thing power
users can still rejoice and hold onto dearly, is
expandable storage, via micro SD. You're probably gonna
hear some fancy tech talk flowin' around, like, expandable up to two terabytes of storage. Roping people back to
reality for a second, the biggest current
micro SD card available is one eighth that capacity. Even that is a around 200
bucks, so you can imagine, even if a two terabyte
micro SD card does come out, you're gonna have to sell
some blue sky to afford it. Beyond that the LG G6
features a USB-C port, which is a thumbs up, because
everything should be USB-C. We also still see the
classic LG power button and a fingerprint reader on the back, which is a little weird
if you've never used it, but once you spend some time with it, it feels really natural. Now, beyond the design changes, I think maybe what stood
out most to me with the G6 has gotta be the display,
because it's really different than anything you're
normally used to seeing. This has a 5.7 inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 2880 by 1440. And if you're thinkin' to yourself, that math sounds a little
off, you, sir, are correct. That's because this isn't your traditional 16 by 9 aspect ratio,
it's actually 18 by 9. So what this means is it's
gonna be a little longer when you're holding it upright and a little wider when
you're holdin' it landscape. It is gonna be a little bit weird when you're watching movies
and videos that aren't 18 by 9, and honestly, that is the
majority of them out there, but if you can get past
the black bars on the side, which really aren't that big of a deal, it's actually kinda cool what you can do with the extra space. For starters, multitasking
works really, really well, because essentially, you're
getting two perfect squares, one on the top, one on the bottom, which results with more
room for activities. Actually, what I found
really useful though, is once you're in the camera app, with that extra space up top, you can actually see
all your recent photos that you've taken, and again, much like a lot of things
you'll start to notice with the G6, it's not
game-changing or revolutionary, but it's actually really useful. On top of that, one of the
coolest things with the G6 is the fact that you're
getting more screen real estate in a smaller overall package. So, for example, here
is the iPhone 7 Plus. This is a 5.5 inch phone and side-by-side next to the G6, you can see that it's physically smaller, but has more screen real estate. So that right there, honestly,
is kind of a big deal. I've always thought the
iPhone 7 Plus was kinda bulky and too big for one-handed use. So the fact that you
can fit a bigger screen in a smaller package that
feels better in your hand is kind of a win. Beyond that, the bezels, or
rather lack thereof on the G6 are a beautiful, beautiful thing. The curved elements
are a super-nice touch, and you kinda just wanna stare at it and appreciate the display. So, day two is when I
got to spend some time with the camera, or cameras,
I should say, on the G6. I gotta admit, though, every
time I stare at this thing I cannot unsee the monkey tablet stand. Regardless, though, with
this guy you're getting twin 13-mega pixel shooters. The first of which being
your standard portrait lens, and the second being an ultra-wide, get-everything-in-the-shot lens. What I particularly like
about this in the G6 is the fact that you
don't lose any quality jumping back and forth from lenses. Here are a couple pictures, the first of which
being the standard lens, I'ma then hop over to the ultra-wide lens, and you can see, for
it being really gloomy, overcast, and nasty
outside, nearing sunset, both of these do a fantastic job. And you don't really notice
any quality difference at all. Overall for the past couple
of years, I've really liked what LG's done in terms
of smartphone cameras, and with the G6, it is no different here. I definitely do wanna still
put it through its paces a little more, but overall so far, I am super impressed with the camera. Now, another bright note with the G6 is the fact that it is
now water-resistant. Just doin' some basic things,
like tossin' it in water, taking some video,
everything worked perfectly. And while those tests
weren't crazy by any means, I do have some plans for
some more extreme water tests featuring the G6. If that's something you
wanna see, make sure you guys drop a like down below. Now, this is a pre-production model, so I'm not gonna dive too deep
into the software or the OS. You do get Android 7.1 Nougat,
which is definitely a plus, but in terms of really diving deep in there with the software, I'm definitely gonna
wait till I get my hands on the final retail model. But I will say, I definitely
don't mind LG's skin, it's pretty light and for the most part stays outta your way and
there are some things that I actually kinda enjoy, like when you swipe across the screen, the text kind of bounces with you, which is strangely
satisfying, but overall, gone is the bastard
child G5, here is the G6. And I think it's safe to say LG is back in the smartphone game. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. If you haven't yet, definitely
feel free to subscribe. You're probably not gonna
wanna miss that water test, and if you're thinkin' to yourself, what is that beautiful setup? You can check out that video here. This is Jonathon, and I
will catch you guys later. So day two is when... Oh, come on man, my mouth is frozen shut. I'm like Elsa. 
- Wow, that's pretty Christmassy. - Thanks, buddy. Yo, guys, Jonathan here and welcome back to a special holiday edition of the Best Tech Under 50, so
whether you're in need for a super last minute gift idea, or you're watching this after the holidays and need some ideas on
what to spend those sweet gift cards on, this has you covered. Now quick announcement, the
shirts are finally here, available to pick up. Huge shout out to everyone on Twitter who's rockin' 'em, they look amazing. And if you haven't checked 'em out yet, I will drop a link down below. So first up is the
Philips Hue Motion Sensor. And huge shout out to Philips
for not only sponsoring this gift guide, but also
a really sweet giveaway. So if we can hit 10,000, no 20, no, 5,000 hundred million likes, or they delete my channel and
Ralphy goes homeless, then we can give some stuff away. Or, I love you guys, and
even if we hit 20 likes, I am givin' away some stuff. Now if you have Philips Hue, the motion sensor is pretty much a must have, because it gives you control of your
lighting through motion. No talking, no pressin'
buttons, simply movement. What's awesome with this, though, is A, it's battery powered, so there's no wires, and B, it can also attach magnetically, which allows you to place
this pretty much anywhere. The ability to adjust
it and place it in the optimal field of view for
motion is a nice touch, but what I love most about
this is how responsive it is. With this, you're not only able to simply turn on lights, but you
can also trigger entire scenes with motion. So in this case, if I
want something colorful when I walk by, bam. But more realistically, if it
were the middle of the night and wanted somethin' dim,
relaxed, with no blue tones so it didn't wake you up,
you can do that as well. And then conversely, you can set it up to where it will automatically
turn off the lights once you leave the room,
which is perfect for those who tend to leave those on and drive up that electricity bill. So next up is the Amazon Echo Dot. The tiny baby brother to the Amazon Echo, and this is a great option to either extend Alexa into various
rooms in your household or, in this case, if you already
have a Bluetooth speaker, you can pair it with
that and save some money. If you haven't jumped
on the Echo train yet, it is kind of awesome. Alexa, turn off all the lights. - [Amazon Echo] Okay. - Alexa, turn on the lights downstairs. - [Amazon Echo] Okay. - You could also use it to play music. Alexa, play some Christmas music. - [Amazon Echo] Here's a
station for Christmas music, Holiday favorites. (upbeat funky music) - Damn, Evans. (laughing) Alexa, stop, for the love of God, stop. (laughing) - [Man] You're gonna break something. - I think he broke his hip. So really not much more needs to be said. It is pretty awesome. Whether it's for yourself or someone else and you've been looking to
get into the smart home game, this is a fairly
inexpensive and also really great way to do so. Now following that, we've
got a couple inexpensive headphone options, both of the wired and wireless nature. The first of which are the Status BT-1s, which are a simple, clean, lightweight pair of wireless headphones that right now are only about 40 bucks. Now these are on ear headphones and not over ear phones, so that, combined with the fact that they are lightweight like I talked about, means they're not gonna be cumbersome or feel like they're weighed down after longer
periods of listening. What really stands out
to me with these, though, is the sound quality. They're not gonna beat out Bose or Sony in that two to $300 range, but they are definitely gonna give headphones at least twice the price
a run for its money which is really surprising. On the flip side, in the wired world, the Superlux HD 668Bs might be my new favorite headphones under 50 bucks. Right now these are around 40. They're not the flashiest,
they're not the prettiest. They get a little bit
bulky with the cable in and everything, but good God, these things sound really good for the price. The build quality isn't phenomenal, but there is a pretty substantial amount of padding, which makes
these really comfortable for long periods of time. Now obviously, if you're on team iPhone 7 or any other phone
without a headphone jack, you're gonna need to dongle it up to take advantage of these but if you do have a headphone jack and you don't have a ton of cash to spend, these
are a fantastic pick up. Now next I'm gonna hand this
one off to Miss Krystal Key. - Hey guys. So this is a Priva II from Avantree, and it's a tiny little device that acts as a multi point Bluetooth transmitter. And probably the biggest reason why you'd wanna use this is
to send your TV's audio wirelessly to your Bluetooth headphones. So this is perfect for
watching movies late at night without disturbing your
sleeping family members or maybe even prevent
them from disturbing you. And the latency on here is very low, too, and from what I can see
the audio looks perfectly in sync and the sound quality is great with it using an aptX
HiFi quality stereo codec. It's very easy to set up, too. You can slap it somewhere near your entertainment system,
run an aux or RCA cable between the Priva II and your television, and then after that, you can easily sync any pair of Bluetooth headphones or earbuds you already have. Now you can have the
Priva II run on a charge or plug it into an outlet
or USB port on your TV. But the best part with
using the Priva II, I think, is that you can hook up
two Bluetooth devices and have them work simultaneously, so you can watch movie
and shows with a friend, still without any noticeable latency and both 100 percent in sync. And you can even use this to turn other devices into wireless
audio transmitters, like computers or audio interfaces. And the Priva II will only
set you back about $50, which is already much cheaper than buying just one good pair of
wireless TV headphones. - Now next, Google did
launch their 4K Chromecast earlier this year, but if you don't have a 4K TV or something
to watch 4K content on, then it kinda doesn't make
sense, and if that's the case, the regular Chromecast
is still a great option. For the most part, you
can pick it up on sale for around 25 bucks right
now, and if you have an HDMI equipped TV but can't
access things like YouTube, Netflix, or Hulu, this
is probably the cheapest and easiest way to do that. Going down the list next, is the BHOLD Acoustic Pod, and this is a
very simple piece of tech. You place your phone in it
and it amplifies things. Now, by no means is this
gonna compete or replace a dedicated Bluetooth
speaker, but if you want something simple, something
you're never gonna have to charge, more
importantly I think it leans to people who
tend to use their phones for a lot of conference
calls, this is gonna be a simple and effective
way to amplify your sound. Now next, I know a ton of you out there shoot video, you take
pictures, and with your cameras you're gonna need media,
so I wanted to recommend one of my personal favorite SD cards, the Samsung Pro+. These are super fast, which is important if you shoot 4K video
and more importantly, they're gonna allow you
to transfer the files to your computer quickly. Unless you own a Macbook Pro, then you gotta get a dongle,
that's a whole different story. But either way, this is
a super solid SD card. Following that, we're gonna show a little Apple Watch love and
when I first saw this, I was like, holy crap, that is actually a really smart idea. This is an Apple Watch car charger, and I've seen portable
Apple watch chargers before, which kind of really
don't make too much sense. But if you were ever to
charge your Apple Watch in a situation that
wasn't next to your bed, to me, the car is the perfect scenario. What I like about this is, A, it works right out of the box. You're not gonna have to install or buy any extra cables
and B, there is also a USB port, so you're gonna be able to charge your phone at the same time. Build quality is fantastic. It feels really premium, so I've been really happy with this. And whether you've been
looking for the perfect Apple Watch accessory for yourself or for someone else, I would definitely recommend picking this up. Next up is the TP-Link Smart Plug which has quickly become
one of my favorite pieces of tech. So theoretically, you could use this to connect anything in your house, whether it's the TV,
speakers, or in my case, I have it hooked up to the tree. I do of course have
control through the app to turn it off and on. But again, it also does
work great with Alexa, turn the office tree off. - [Amazon Echo] Okay. - Alexa, turn the office tree on. - [Amazon Echo] Okay. - The app is clean, it's
simple, it's easy to navigate. I love the fact that you can apply different icons to different
things in your house and again, if you own an Echo or Echo Dot, the integration was seamless. Aside from that, hopefully
you guys enjoyed the video. If you did, and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to go Austin
"break that hip" Evans on that like button. And as far as that giveaway goes, I am teaming up with Krystal Key. We're giving away an Apple Watch, a Philips Hue starter kit, an Amazon Echo Dot, and
a couple of these shirts. Now to enter the giveaway, all you gotta do is make sure you're
subscribed here on TLD and then also to Krystal's channel. She just released a really awesome tech guide herself, so
check that out as well, it's linked here and down below. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. (clapping)
Whoo. Damn that eye though. - [Man] Alright, you ready to cut? - Yeah. 
- You know what I keep
picturing man because of you? Damn Kevin Hart as a bunny. - Let's do this now! - Yo guys, Jonathan here and welcome to the $200 desk setup where the challenge is to
find a desk, the accessories, and not only make it functional but it's gotta look good
and most importantly, not exceed that price point. Now, disclaimer. This does not include the
computer or the speakers because that would pretty
much single-handedly obliterate the entire budget. That may make its way to a later episode at a higher price point. If that's something you wanna see, go ahead and drop a like down below but for now the focus is for those who already have a computer but need to shake things up
as far as their setup goes. So for starters, we cannot
do a setup challenge without a desk and for this, I went with the Techni
Mobili modern computer desk which has this really
clean pine laminated top, white accents, white steel legs, and gives you a pretty
decent amount of real estate all while remaining relatively compact. Now currently as of right now, this desk is a 110 bucks on Amazon. So that's gonna give us roughly
90 bucks to play around with as far as accessories go, but a couple of things that
stand out to me with this desk is one, the storage which
is plenty enough space to store your keyboard, your
mouse, your pen, your pencil, or in this case, if your Austin Evans your 10 year anniversary
notebook at Zotac. Regardless if you're Austin Evans though, anybody's gonna appreciate
some cable management and that is exactly what
we have here on the back. This compartment opens up which
is gonna be really helpful for hiding those pesky cables. First up is the Globe desk lamp which is a really, really, tall box. Oh man, this is gonna be some assembly required. That's got some reach. That doesn't screw, it
just kinda sits there. Oh no. Okay, I'm just dumb. I was trying to connect the
spring to the top of the lamp but in this case, it goes from end to end. Be careful you don't whip
yourself up in the face. And then we got ourselves a light. So now we got the lamp set up, initial impressions are up to the kinda sketchy installation, it's not bad for 20 bucks at all. We're gonna go ahead and
get this light bulb in. This is a $10 colored LED light bulb. Damn, now let's see if we
can get some changing colors. So we got red, green, blue.
- You're my boy! - So it's a lamp and a
light bulb out of the way. My biggest question right
now is gonna be the LED strip for the back of the desk. This I've actually
never messed with before so it could be interesting to set it up. What's cool though from what I can see is that it's actually powered by USB so you're not gonna have
to tinker around with power or possibly electrocute yourself. So to test it off, I'm
assuming you can power this up through a USB powerbank, yup, that actually works. I am like a sit-down Christmas tree. Following the LED light there are this really cool
cable management strips. They come in a pack of
five for around 12 bucks. What you're seeing here is
actually one split in half. The reason I'm doing that is
so we can keep that opening in the middle of the desk where we can eventually
then tuck in the cables. Just like the LED strips, what's
also a nice touch with this is they come with the
3M adhesive preinstalled so you're not gonna have to attach that or stick that on yourself. Next, we can go ahead
and attach the LED strip and right away, you can already see how that cable management
strip is paying off because we can tuck the
cable neatly through that and run it inside the desk. Now, functionally the
LED strip work perfectly and for 10 bucks, having the
built-in control was awesome but it was at that
moment, I quickly realized that I actually placed it too high because of how the desk functions. So through my trial and error,
if you go with this setup, it's actually a better move
to place the LED strips slightly lower. What that's gonna do is
allow you to open and close the cable management portion of the desk without screwing up your LED strip. Now realistically, you're
not gonna wanna throw a USB bank inside your desk, so next stop is a surge
protector from Poweradd. What I like about this is
in addition to the outlets, there are also two USB ports which in turn will power up the LED strip. It was almost a test within a test but it was really nice to know that you're not limited to one
stick only on the LED strip so attaching that a second
time worked just as well. From there, it was really about putting the finishing
touches on the setup. But I gotta say, the
cable management section worked really well and helped keep things super clean and tidy. Total for this setup was
just under a 180 bucks which leaves us around 20
bucks to play around with. So in this case, I went ahead
and threw in a fake plant and of course, Baby Groot. So with the color we're
getting through the lights and the lighter tone of the desk itself, it looks really great
against a darker wall especially at night but it also looks great
in a lighter environment, in front of a white wall like this. All in all, for a 110 bucks,
the desk is really solid. The one thing I will point
out is you gotta be careful not to scratch because
it is a laminate top so if you happen to be
subscribed to the Curiosity Box by Vsauce, definitely don't do this. - There you go. - Now for scale and for reference, this is a 15 inch MacBook Pro. If you're thinking about using a monitor, I would say 21 to 24 inches is probably the ideal sweet spot. The cable management section is awesome. You can see what a great job
it does at hiding the wires. You pair that with the
drawers on the front that helps keep things organized. Pack on a few accessories and for two bills, we
get a really clean setup. Aside from that, hopefully
you guys enjoyed the video. If you did, make sure you
subscribe for more episodes like this and if you like setups, you probably want to
check out the Dream Desk which you can check out here. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here, and welcome back to another
episode of the Best Desk Setup. This time, we got a $500 budget. And compared to the $200
challenge last time, that is quite a bit more
to play around with. You guys asked for a
dark theme desk setup, so that is what we are rolling with. (upbeat electronic music) So, jump into the desk. For this setup, I went with
a Linnmon and Alex combo from Ikea in a black/brown finish. And what I really like about it is the fact that it's modular in the sense that you can configure the
drawer to sit on either side. There's tons of space, and with the drawer you get three smaller compartments,
one large compartment, and the best thing about this is the entire desk is under $130. So, next up, for those of you who caught the latest episode of
the Best Tech Under $50, I showcased the Brightech USB Desk Lamp, but I actually liked it so much, and because two is better than one, for this setup I am rolling with a pair. I think my favorite thing about this lamp is how simple but
aesthetically satisfying it is. It looks great next to
a computer or a monitor and it really adds a ton of warmth and character to the setup. I really dig the symmetry of
two of these paired on a desk. And on top of that, they have
a stealth USB port on the side that you could use to charge your phone. (upbeat electrical music) So, next up, a lamp without a light bulb is like peanut butter without
jelly, lamb without tuna fish. And with that said, what I'm
throwing inside these guys is the Philips Hue White
Ambiance Starter Kit. And a huge shoutout to Philips
for sponsoring this setup. So, within the kit, you get two White
Ambiance A19 light bulbs, a Hue bridge which you can then use to expand your system later down the road. And then, what's cool is
you also get a dimmer switch that you can use to control your lights when you don't wanna reach for your phone. Now, the warmth of these
lights paired with the lamps creates this really beautiful look that really catches
and bounces off a desk. Beyond the mesmerizing warm light, not only do you have control
from warm to bright white, you can also adjust scenes. So, here we're going from relax to read to concentrate to energize, and you can see how useful this could be depending on the time of the day. (upbeat electronic music) Now, just like the last video, the computer is not a factor in the price point of the setup. Thumbs up, though, if
you're excited to see a non-Apple computer in the video. What I am including with
this budget, though, is a really cool pair of
wireless Bluetooth speakers. So, these are the JBL Jembe BTs. And what I mean by wireless
is they allow you to ditch the aux cable or a USB
cable and connect directly to your computer wirelessly via Bluetooth. Now, you're gonna be able
to avoid cables completely because you do need to connect to power and these to each other, but having that one less cable
does help keep things clean. The compact design and the
gunmetal-ish gray finish looks fantastic next to the
speakers and the lights. And while these may not
be the biggest speakers in the world, they pack a
really good punch for their size and are gonna be a fantastic upgrade over stock computer speakers. Now, if you're wondering
where all those cables went, I'm using the exact same
channel cable raceway as the last setup. And for $20, this thing is a lifesaver. It attaches through a 3M
adhesive to the back of the desk and you can see how well it works. You pair that with a couple cable drops and you've got a super
clean and tidy setup. So, closing off the
setup, in the last video, I saw a lotta comments in the vein of, "Cool setup bro, but where is the chair?" Now, because we have a higher
budget to mess around with, this time I got you. So, this is a Poly and Bark Eames Style Molded Plastic Chair, which
is pretty much a clone of the Herman Miller version. It's a fraction of the price, and honestly most people
aren't gonna be able to tell the difference if you
had these two side-by-side. These come in a ton of
different color combinations, but I think the dark plastic
mixed with the dark wood legs really complement this setup well. But seriously, if you've been eyeing that Herman Miller chair but don't wanna drop that kinda cash, these for under $70 are
really, really good. So, that brings us to a
grand total of around $460, and that means you got some
room to play around with, whether it's accessories,
cable management; hell, maybe you wanna swap
out the chair, the speakers. It is not meant to be an
exact piece-by-piece replica for you to copy, moreso just
for inspiration and ideas. Aside from that, I would
love to see your setup, so hit me up on Instagram,
Twitter; show me what you got. And if you haven't seen the last episode or Dream Desk yet, check those out here. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (upbeat electronic music) 
- [Jonathan] Yo guys, Jonathan here and welcome to my Perfect iMac Pro Setup. (upbeat music) So, yep, that is an iMac
Pro on a desk outside. You're not crazy. The reason behind this is I thought it'd be fun
to take this outside, shoot AK raw, and then use
that to test on this iMac Pro. So with the setup, I
wanted something clean, something simple, but most importantly, I wanted something to compliment and match that beautiful space gray finish. So the centerpiece of this setup is without a doubt the iMac Pro and for those who love talking specs,
get them wet naps ready. This is the 10-core,
three gigahertz model. 128 gigabytes of RAM, AMD Radeon Pro Vega 64 graphics
with, get ready for it, 16 gigabytes of HBM2 memory. Last but not least, this is packed with two terabytes of flash storage, which should be insanely fast. Now these go on sale this Thursday and alongside the 10-core there is the baseline 8-core, a surprise 14-core model
and it will max out at 18 freaking cores. Now for the desk, I went
with the ARTIFOX DESK 02. This is their limited run black edition. It's very simple but also extremely well thought-out and compliments
the iMac Pro perfectly. Now this comes in both
sit and stand variations and what's awesome is
it's extremely modular. So you go simple like I've done here or you can deck it out with a ton of different accessories
to complement your setup. Now a couple of really
smart things that come with this desk out of the box is one, you have a little cable
drop towards the back so in my case I threw a
wireless charger here, dropped that cable right through and it keeps things nice and clean. And for those curious
about the wireless charger, this is from Kroma Wireless and I will say on the Amazon page it
looks like it's space grey, clearly it's not. As much as I would have loved space grey, this is still a really nice accent and the best part about it is that it's under 15 bucks. Now the second really
smart thing with this desk is towards the front you
have hooks on each side. You can probably hang a
ton of different things but in this case it works
amazing for a pair of headphones. So the headphones are the
Focal Listen closed back over ear headphones and these
were perfect for two reasons. One, aesthetically this complemented the entire setup really
well and more importantly, two, they sound amazing. Focal makes some crazy
high-end gear but these are under 200 bucks and honestly they're probably one
of the best headphones you can get under that price point. And for the keyboard, the mouse, and in this case the trackpad
I didn't have to look elsewhere because they all
came with the iMac Pro. The black keys with the space grey finish on the keyboard look
beautiful across the desk. Honestly, I'm not the biggest
fan of the Magic Mouse but in that finish it was hard not to include with this setup. Lastly, that space grey Magic Trackpad 2, no complaints there. It works well and has the looks to match. Now as far as the speakers go, I don't think I could have
planned this out any better. They weren't tweaked,
modified, or customized. The Kanto YU2 Powered Desktop speakers come in this matte gray
finish that is nearly a perfect match for the
space grey iMac Pro. They're small but they pack a surprising amount of punch and
what's cool is you connect them directly via USB to the iMac Pro. So the size paired with the
finish and more importantly, how it fits on this
desk all work perfectly. Now jumping to the back of the iMac Pro this thing is pretty decked out. You have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, an SDXC card slot with UHS-II support, four USB 3.0 ports and then
four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the USB-C flavor which
is double what you get on the non-pro iMac. Last up is the Ethernet port but the big thing here is that it's 10 gigabit which is a pretty big deal. Now as far as performance goes, over the next week I will
be putting this thing through its paces but
to get the obligatory geek bench score out of the way, on the single core side we're looking at 5,450
but more impressively, on the multi-core side that is 37,434. So on the outside it
looks like an iMac Pro with a space grey finish but on the inside it is clearly a different story. From there, if you're
looking for some more insight on the iMac Pro,
my good buddy Marques aka MKBHD also spent some time with one. You can check out his impressions here or link down below it. If you haven't yet, I'd
definitely make sure you subscribe for more iMac Pro coverage. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. - [Man] The design, the
stand, the display, the bezels it's all the same but
what makes this iMac Pro an iMac Pro... 
- You guys, Jonathan here,
and I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous right now, because I have no idea
where this video is going. Beside me in this weird,
luxurious, one of a kind Wizpak knapsack is a 1300
dollar tech backpack, or as they like to call it, "the first-to-market,
patented Smart Backpack, "that is a true vision
of wearable technology." honestly, my favorite line off
the website has to be this, "The Wizpack is a four-in-one Smart bag, "which allows you to go to
the beach, the gym, the boat, "the dance studio, park or classroom "and enjoy your favorite tunes." The frigging boat? And just for full disclosure, this is not a sponsored video. I wish I could say this was sent to me, but unfortunately I paid for
this, bought it off Amazon and sadly, I'm outside the return window, so I am stuck with this. (doorbell ringing) I think the bag just doorbelled me. That definitely came from the bag, we don't have a doorbell. (theme music from "The X-Files") Continuing on, bringing this out, here is the 1300 dollar
backpack, full leather, which you could smell from a mile away and I've gotta admit, I am
definitely not one to say I got a grasp on fashion
or sense of style, so I'm not gonna hate on this directly. As far as the looks go, I personally don't think
it looks that good, but if you guys do, let me
know in a Comment down below. Upon first glance, I think
what stands out most to me is this is supposed to clearly
be a fashion statement. Jumping back to their
great website of lines, "The quality and concept behind the Wizpak "is a blend of Apple, Bose
and Gucci in nature." (laughs) Without a doubt though, past the price, past the leather, the biggest thing that stands
out about this backpack are the crazy, built-in speakers. Supposedly, they're 40 watts,
so we've gotta test those out. So the first problem is I've
gotta find the power button. We got some cool, (rubbing
base) what are these called? Studs, now you could
hurt someone with these. Oh, I'm dumb, it's over
here on the side right here, so we're gonna power this guy up. We got a light. (doorbell rings) It did it again! Can you imagine the marketing
room meeting right there, when they're deciding what sound we need to turn the backpack on, like,
"Oh, how about a doorbell?" "Great idea!" Aside from that, the
Wizpak has now showed up. Let's see if we can connect. I'm a little nervous right now. Three, two, one, Yellow Claw. (upbeat, pop music) OK, I'm not gonna lie, it's
kind of a legit speaker, but the thought of someone
with this on their back and blasting music that
loud in public is insane, like, no one's gonna wanna be your friend, if you're out in public with this guy blasting music out full volume. I was about 75% right now, honestly, maybe we'll go a little higher than that. (upbeat pop music) And I wanted to really not like this, especially for the price. Is it a 1300 dollar speaker? I don't think so, but you can't deny,
that's pretty impressive. Apparently there's a sub woofer in here and you can actually hear the difference, once you place it on a table and it's engaging in that sub woofer mode, whereas if you were holding it, you can definitely hear a difference. Strangely enough, there is also
an SOS Help button on here, just in case you're in public and someone wants to steal your Wizpak. So if we flip things over here
to the side of the backpack, on the back of the strap,
that is Volume control. (doorbell ringing) What the-- (doorbell rings) (laughing) That's gonna confuse so many people, man. What if you have a Grandma in the room? (doorbell ringing) (laughing) I've never heard a doorbell in tech, like, aside from ring (laughing). So apparently I was
looking in the wrong place. On the flip side, behind
the Volume Control and the Doorbell button, there's
actually that SOS button. (alarm sounding loudly) Holy! (laughing) Stop! Jesus! That's gonna set off some serious concern, if you're out in public. I guarantee no one's stealing
your Wizpak with that one. No! (alarm sounding loudly) (brass band, jazz music) So maybe we found a use case right there. We've got Jaden and Gage laying it down, big thumbs up, big applause to them. You guys killed it, thank you very much. Keep doing what you're doing. Sorry Wiz Khalifa. No part of this video at all is sponsored. The backpack we bought, this was actually a trip down to Best Buy. So during that trip, I
wanted to challenge myself to see exactly how much tech
I could buy for 1300 bucks and everything here on
this table right now actually came out to under
1300 dollars with tax. We got the Honor 6X Smartphone. We got the HP, probably a long PC name, m3-u101dx laptop, which is around 500 bucks. We got the MyCharge Portable Charger, which is around 39 bucks, honestly, you can pick up a
much cheaper and bigger one on Amazon, which I will link down below. We got this sweet Solo Velocity Backpack, that holds laptops up to 17 inches. Sony MDR Bluetooth Headphones in this sweet, sweet, sweet TLD blue and last, but not least,
what I am most excited for, the Logitech Megaboom,
ooh, damn, that's a... sweet entrance and we got blue everywhere. So you've gotta ask yourself,
do you want a crazy speaker, that is built in and
attached to your backpack, or do you want a comparable
bluetooth speaker, that you can take on the go? Let's power this guy on. UE Megaboom. (mellow, pop music) So I'm not gonna lie, based
off just initial reactions from this compared to that,
it is kinda scary close with this and this is
a 250 dollar on sale, sometimes 300 dollars speaker. (mellow, pop music) OK, it does have more
volume and more bass, but again, this is 1300
dollars, this is 300 dollars and with the price difference, we get a smartphone,
we get a battery bank, we get a pair of headphones and that's probably the
smarter move right there, because if you're playing
the Wizpak out in public, people are gonna get pissed. This is the way to listen to
music out there in public, in privacy and quiet, don't
disturb anyone, please. And last, but not least, we got this sweet, sweet, sweet HP laptop. Now again, I really have
no need for any of this, so if you guys wanna win either the Wizpak or everything featured in this
budget tech bag right here, let me know by dropping a Like down below, make sure you Subscribe, turn on notification, check out the details down below, where you can pick that up. 
- Without a doubt, this is the biggest unboxing I have ever done on this channel. Maybe not size-wise, but for sure sheer mass. Apple dropped a ton of new computers this month, so I decided to channel my inner DetroitBORG and get pretty much every single one of them. Here is a high-end 27-inch iMac. Here is the lower-end 21.5-inch iMac. This is the 15-inch space
gray Touch Bar MacBook Pro, and last but not least, the lowest-end non-Touch
Bar 13-inch MacBook Pro. This may be a terrible idea. So my debate is if I should go from smallest to biggest, and I think what I'll do is I'll go from cheapest to most expensive, that's gonna give us a nice cross pattern here to here to here to here. That means we're gonna start with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which again is the cheapest MacBook Pro you can buy, this is the non-Touch Bar model. Maybe people don't need it, this might be a fantastic option. (crinkling paper) Nothing more satisfying than some sweet, sweet --
- Can. - We have the USB-C cable, some literature, and that USB-C power brick. I wish everything would go USB-C. Nothing really new has changed on the outside with these MacBook Pros, it has all been internally upgraded. So on the outside, they look exactly the same as last year. Drop that. - ♫ Drop that ass - So, next up is the 21.5-inch iMac, and from what I've seen, this is the $1,499 configuration and I think it might be the best bang for your buck, which is really strange as far as Apple products go. But, iMac unboxings are always a really smooth, smooth experience. I am potentially gonna murder that. Bring it down. Keyboard, mouse. (sliding styrofoam) Oh, no. Oh, I hate styrofoam. Ugh, I'm sorry. Why did I think this was a good idea? And why is the top not coming off? It has been a while since I've seen a 21.5-inch iMac in person, they always look like, that's not good. - Okay, okay. - Alright, power supply next. Let's undress this guy. The baby iMac. God, there's so much plastic with these things. (crinkling plastic) iMac one, out. Box, go away. 13-inch MacBook Pro out, 21.5-inch iMac out. I'm gonna give you that sweet view of the backside so you don't stare at
some glossy reflections. Cheapest to most expensive. This is the highest-end GPU can get, so I'm pretty excited to see as far as performance goes. I've actually still been using my 2016 MacBook Pro and haven't really got a chance to see the performance bump on these. So I'm kinda nerding out a little bit for that. We got baby brothers, and bigger brothers, in every shape and form right now. Of course, all space gray. I wish these were space gray, but unfortunately we're gonna have to wait for the iMac Pro for that. For reference, quick size comparison. 13-inch MacBook Pro, 15-inch MacBook Pro. Smashed next to the 21.5-inch iMac. So I'm gonna set these down. Actually, let's get a little stack action. You guys saw what came with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, it's exactly the same minus a slightly bigger, more powerful power brick, with the 15-inch MacBook Pro. 15-inch MacBook Pro away, and we are on to the big daddy. The 27-inch iMac, again much like the 15-inch MacBook Pro, this is pretty spec'd out. Highest-end GPU, 512 gigs of that sweet, fast flash storage. Hopefully this is a little, that was much easier than the 21-inch model. So this is a terrible idea. Okay, there we go. We are almost there. Oh, that was nice. That was like a nice rip. (exhales) (crinkling plastic) One more piece of plastic, and we got the whole family completed. 27-inch iMac here, we're gonna go 21 1/2-inch iMac here. 15-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and before I continue, I wanna give a huge shoutout to LastPass for making
this craziness possible. So a huge shout out to LastPass for sponsoring this video. With LastPass, they eliminate the need to worry about remembering passwords and potentially getting
locked out of your account. True story, Rich actually missed out on a pair of Zebras this weekend because he could not
remember his password. With LastPass, you don't need to write, remember, or even reset those passwords. They essentially do all the work for you. Put you on auto-pilot mode so you can do things like unbox an insane amount of computing machines. Now I get it, you love grandma, but it's not always the most convenient thing in the world trying to remember her maiden name when you're trying to figure out that security question. This is gonna allow you not to do that, plus on top of that, it's also gonna enable you to never use the same password on every single website. Hopefully, you're not doing that, hopefully you're not using 1234. If you are any of those people, make sure you guys check out LastPass which is linked down below. Now, for reference this 13-inch MacBook Pro is the only dual-core machine. This, this and this are all quad-core. Right off the bat by far, as far as price and performance goes, this is hands down the most impressive. On Geekbench 4, we got a single-core score of 4,924, multi-core was 14,215, and why that is so impressive is this; this is a $2,800 dollar MacBook Pro, it scored 4,776 on the single-core score side, and 15,851. So this on the single-core side outperformed this MacBook Pro. It was really, really close on the multi-core side. Now for comparison, this 13-inch MacBook Pro did pretty well on the single-core side, 4,516. Obviously, you are
getting nowhere near the power on the multi-core side with two cores versus four here. That scored 9,497, but as we move over to the giant, this is the clear winner
as far as performance goes. Single-core score of 5,805, and then we hop over to the
multi-core score, 19,737. From there I'm gonna go
ahead and test out the disk speed test performance. This is actually the only oddball here as far as that goes. All three of three of these machines are pure fast flash storage, whereas this is the Fusion Drive. Still though, a much better option than
a 7,200 RPM hard drive, or for whatever reason, Apple still sells a 5400 RPM hard drive in the baseline iMac. It is 2017, and no one should use that. So hopping over to the 21.5-inch iMac. As far as performance goes, this is 357 megabytes
per second on the write, and then 566 megabytes
per second on the read. So, jumping over to this MacBook Pro, that is where we really start to see the speed gains as far as flash storage goes. On the write side, this scored 686 megabytes per second, whereas read was a crazy fast
1,848 megabytes a second. Where we see the absolute
fastest performance though is when we hop over to this MacBook Pro and this 27-inch iMac. On the write side here, this was 1,987 megabytes per second, and then read 2,415. Same story here, where the write side comes in at 1,990 megabytes per second, and the read side 2,547, so just slightly faster
than the MacBook Pro, but still both of these are crazy fast. Now, whether you go from the 27-inch iMac, or the 21.5-inch iMac, both of these, in addition to the USB 3 ports, also have Thunderbolt 3 in the USB-C flavor. So you definitely have more port options compared to the MacBook Pros. These are stuck with
just Thunderbolt 3 ports in that USB-C flavor. Now, one more thing that I think often gets
overlooked with these iMacs is the fact that on top
of the computer inside, there is a beautiful display attached. This is a 21.5-inch 4K display, whereas this a big, beautiful 27-inch 5K display, and yes, the specs may not be as thick or as meaty as the PC
master-race may want, but all in all they are
pretty solid machines. Ultimately what I've seen here is I think this is surprisingly the best bang for your buck
as far as the Mac goes, you're getting great performance, and the only downside I would say would be the Fusion Drive, so if you do go this route and you can't upgrade
to pure flash storage, that is gonna be the
best total experience. This one is still a great value if you need the power
plus the portability, the 15-inch MacBook Pro
is the way you wanna go, and if you need the most power, it is clearly the 27-inch iMac. Hopefully you enjoyed this video. If you did, and you're feeling like we did awesome, make sure to drop a like down below. This is Jonathan, and I'll catch you guys later. 
- From a carbon fiber 8K camera, to a 38-inch ultra-wide display, to the latest car tech from Ford, this is the Coolest Tech on the Planet. So, first up is the RED Weapon Helium, and in terms of camera tech, this is at the forefront of bad-assery. The camera itself is this
beautiful carbon fiber modular body that allows it
to not only be lightweight but also extremely adaptable to pretty much any shooting situation. Without a doubt, though, the
wow factor of this camera is the fact that it shoots in
eight-freaking-K resolution, and I know someone's going to say, "Bro, that is overkill. "Why do you need so many pixels?" And it's actually less about
outputting a video in 8K, which is still awesome, and more about the
flexibility you get in post. Now you really don't truly
appreciate how crazy 8K is, until you bring it into
your editing program. So within Final Cut Pro X, for example, this window right now is 25% scale. If we were to bump that up to 100%, you can see how crazy the detail is. Beyond that, not only does it shoot 8K, it shoots 8K up to 75 frames
per second, which is bonkers. Something I use all the time
is 8K at 48 frames per second, which conforms down to 24 and
gives you this really smooth, cinematic slow-motion shot
that adds a ton to the video. As cool as the resolution and
the slow-motion is though, one of the most useful
features, hands down, is the fact that you're shooting it raw. You may have heard that
term used in photography, where all the data and
information is still there, so in post you have a ton of flexibility. Well, you have that
here, but with 8K video. So, for example, let's say
you're shooting outside, maybe underexpose a shot, or even worse, you overexpose the shot. With most cameras, you're kind of screwed because it is baked in, and there's nothing you can do about it, but with RED, you can change it in post. It's crazy, it is kind of
like God mode on a video game. This also applies to white balance, and the idea here is not to say, "F white balance, I'll worry
about everything in post," but moreso, having that extra flexibility, just in case, is nice. So, next up, I got a
chance to check out the Ford Fusion Energi Titanium, and huge shout-out to Ford, for not only trusting me with their car, but also sponsoring
Coolest Tech on the Planet. Now, on top of looking super-clean, there's a ton of tech
packed inside this car, starting with the fact
that it's a plug-in hybrid, so you're getting the best
of both electric and gas. So when you're utilizing
both electric and gas, you're going to get around
100 miles per gallon, which is way better than
anything I've ever used, and then conversely, even if electric was out of the picture, and you were solely using gas, you're still going to get
around 40 miles per gallon, which is fantastic. On top of that, remote
start is even cooler because there's something special about turning your car
on while you're not in it that makes you feel special inside. Dual climate control is awesome, especially when you
have a significant other that turns the heat way
higher than it needs to be. Now, as far as the tech
you're normally used to, inside this guy is an eight-inch touch LCD that is powered by Sync 3. So, with this, you're
getting a nice, large display to navigate and to interact with, but for me, it was actually my first time getting to check out Apple CarPlay. It's simple, it's clean,
and having those icons laid out largely in front of you, instead of having to look at your phone is definitely a plus. And as cool as that was, the
most fun I had using the Fusion was using its park assist,
especially with parallel parking. Now, I guarantee it, the
same guy that yelled at me about 8K is going to say, "Why do you need help with park assist?" "Can you not parallel park? "Can you not drive?" And to you, sir, I say, "Yeah, of course I can parallel park, "but those situations
where you're out in public, "there's a ton of traffic,
a ton of pressure, "not having to think
about it is kind of nice." So once park assist is
engaged, simply drive forward, and through the Fusion's sensors, it's going to let you know when
to stop and a spot is found. From there, pop it in reverse, back up, and then the Fusion will
begin to do it's magic, and I've got to say,
it it kind of awesome. Even with me backing in way faster than I probably should have,
it still worked really well. So that, combined with Sync
3, the looks, the tech inside, Ford is killing the car game. Now last up is the 38-inch, ultra-wide curved display from LG, and if you've seen
pictures or video online, that really doesn't do it justice because seeing it in-person,
this thing is massive. This is packing a
resolution of 3840 by 1600 on an IPS display, so the color and the image
on this is phenomenal. Now, me personally, most of the time, I prefer a non-ultra-wide monitor simply because I like to focus
on a single window at a time, but on the flip side, maybe you're a multi-tasking ninja, you're going to go nuts over this. On a serious note, though, Screen Split 2.0 is
actually really useful. What this does is gives
you multiple resize options and picture-in-picture modes, which helps keep things nice and tidy. Now, beyond the display itself, I really enjoy how well-thought-out and how much functionality
is inside this display, starting with USB-C connectivity. So, through a single USB-C
cable, you connect your laptop, transfer video, data, and
charge it at the same time. There is also a USB 3.0 quick
charge port, which, in turn, allows you to quickly
charge your phone, useful. Now, this monitor also features
Bluetooth connectivity, which normally might
seem strange or weird, but because the speakers on
this actually sound pretty good, it kind of makes sense. So, all-in-all, with this,
you're getting dual monitor real estate in a single package, plus a ton of tech packed on top of that. It looks great, both picture-quality-wise, and in a setup on your desk because it is definitely
going to turn heads. And overall, in a tech world filled with monitors and displays, this one is unique and
definitely stands out. Aside from that, hopefully
you enjoyed the video. If you did, and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to smash that like button. If you haven't yet, definitely
feel free to subscribe. Maybe check this video out. This is Jonathan, and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Here guys, Jonathan here. Just dropped a video on some of the best iPhone Ten accessories and today got something for
the Pixel Two and Pixel Two XL. It is no secret that it has probably the best smartphone camera
in the game right now. If you disagree, let me
know what your pick is with the comment down below. But today if you're a Pixel fan, get excited because I
got a couple of gadgets that should elevate things
and take full advantage of the amazing camera
inside the Pixel Two. So this is a two piece case,
slash, lens combo from Moment and how it works is you pop on the case and that then adds a layer of modularity in the sense that you can
swap out different lenses, there's a wide angle,
a telephoto, a fisheye, and even a macro for those
super-close tight shots. So the first thing that
immediately jumped out to me with these is build quality, presentation, are all extremely well done
and they are built like a tank. They are freaking heavy. I'll let you in on a little secret before every Ossen Evans
video, he curls these 856 times and that is a secret
to those Atkins gains. Speaking of presentation, anything that comes in a case or a bag always makes you feel just a
little extra special inside. Here we have the wide angle
lens and I'll pop it out. They also include a lens cover
so you're not gonna scratch that glass, which is really nice. Very well thought out. Here's the telephoto 60 millimeter lens and again same deal there, lens cap and there's just a really
well though out system. Now as far as installation goes, we have a marker here on the case, we have a marker here on the lens, so they make it extremely
simple to not screw this up. Pop it in, slide, we have
the Moment logo there. You can clearly see once
you take the lens cap off the 18 millimeter sight in there. And now it is time to test this guy out. So to give an example
of how much this alters your field of view, I'm gonna snap a photo here, but I'm also gonna pop up the lens and show you how much
that alters the image. So we had that beautiful wide image, now we are much more cropped in. I'm gonna snap a photo. And take a look back at these pictures. The standard stock lens in the Pixel Two, that's a great picture. But as we swipe over
to that wide angle shot you can see so much more in there. You see the sky, we got
that street going across, into the sun peeking outta the corner. It's doing a great job
with the highlights. You're not really losing any quality. You were just getting an
amazing looking wide shot. It's pretty incredible. Seeing that makes me want to
pop this immediately back on because we got some beautiful sun creeping through that tree. I'm gonna see if I can
catch that right now. We got them palm trees and if I were to take this off, there's no way we are getting that much. Yeah, that's like crowding your image. There's no way we are
getting that much detail. I would have to scoot
way the hell back there. Man, can I just give the Pixel 2 some major credit right here? The sky is completely visible but we are still getting that
beautiful ray of sunshine blasting through those leaves, beautiful. Now on top of photos, these lenses will also work through video. So what you're watching right now is me being shot through the Pixel 2 with that wide-angle lens. It's gotta make this little bit of scenery look extra cinematic but if
we were to take that lens off you guys could see how
much of that wide angle we are losing. I have no idea what this
looks like right now. I'm sure it is nowhere
near as cool as before. Well let me know in the comment down below what you think of the quality
with the lens and without. Lastly, there is one shot I want to get. Part of me really wishes
this light bulb was on because that would be
a freaking cool shot, but I'm still gonna try to get it anyway. I don't think I would normally
be able to get anything close like this without the wide-angle lens so if I could just get a
little bit of exposure, bring that down. Snap it and that is a
really impressive image. Now if I were to swipe this off, yeah that is cool but it's nowhere near that wide angle shot. It just adds a whole layer to that photo. Now quick update, initially
I wasn't the biggest fan of needing a case to use a lens but the more and more I use it, the more it find myself liking it. One, it's not something
you gotta think about. You just swap it on and you're good. And two, if you've ever
used those lens attachments that don't require a case, sometimes they don't always align properly but with this you get
it perfect every time. So we've seen what that
wide angle lens can do. Now it's time to check
out that telephoto lens. We're gonna add some
length to this Pixel 2. Pop it on, pop the lens cap off. I think we're gonna test it out with this nice little arrangement
of flowers right here. What I'm seeing immediately right now is some really nice
blur in the background. It's got a super-nice roll-off. This is not in portrait mode. I'm gonna snap a photo but you
can see that is really nice. For reference I'm going to pop this off and we should effectively
lose all that right now. So yeah, you can see the
image is nowhere near as compressed with this. We still see a little bit
of that in the background but comparing it to this shot with a telephoto lens on, you can see we got that nice
circular fall off ball action. Boca, boce, whatever you want to call it, it is pretty as hell. Now to kinda take that one step further, what I'm gonna do is pop the lens back on and also check out this
with portrait mode enabled and see what that does. So right off the bat, that's going to crop us in
just a little bit further. We have some nice foreground going on, we still have that ball in the background. I'm gonna take the shots, let it process and right there that is pretty impressive. So we see a little bit
more blur in that light in the background. But either way, with or
without portrait mode, having this telephoto lens
is a really nice addition. From there, Rich, let's flex those breads. We got Rich in frame, photo taken. One without the lens just for safety. Now we see all your legs in that shot. Take it a look back, so that
is without the telephoto lens. It's pretty nice. - [Rich] Yeah. Oh that's really nice. - [Jonathan] Look at that!
- Oh, got a little flair too? - Yeah, I love what it
does with the background, the blur, the sun, it
holds all those highlights. This is pretty damn cool. Ugg, I though I was gonna go to move that. I wanted to bring the flowers
so I could catch the sun. It's not gonna happen. Oh we got a train coming! Quick, Rich.
- Yeah? - Hit me with the stand. Hook me up. This is also a really
good test of how quickly you can get set up. (upbeat music) Look man, I'm like one
of those Instagram kids. And this guy I'm
following, what's his name? It's Steve. Steve is moving it. He said get that (beeps) outta my way! - [Rich] Demonetized. - Holy crap, man, using this telephoto
lens on video right now, like that is freaking crazy. It's like portrait mode
all the time but in video. I'm not sure how that
effects stabilizations, so let me know what you guys think. But just what I'm seeing right
here through the viewfinder is kind of crazy. Like the light behind it,
that is some insane footage. So with this that is gonna
add a complete different layer to your arsenal with the
Pixel 2 in terms of video. Now I'm not gonna lie, initially when I saw these,
I was a little skeptical especially because of the price point. They aren't the most
insane things in the world but they're also not the cheapest. I guess in the grand scheme of things when you compare it to
other camera gear out there, it kinda makes sense. The build quality, the fact
that it's well presented, you have a case, you have a lens cap. It all kinda makes up for that price. But more importantly the image quality. That wide angle lens was awesome, but after seeing what this did, especially for video, it
has definitely won me over. With that said, that has me
super-excited for these to come to the iPhone Ten. I believe they're currently
available for the Eight and Eight Plus right now, but as we know I think the
Pixel 2 and the iPhone Ten are currently the two best in the game. Aside from that, thank you
guys very much for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed the video. If you did, and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to go Richard's
Bread on that like button. If you missed it, we are
currently giving away a brand new Xbox One X Scorpio Edition. You can check that out
here or in the link below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo, guys, Jonathan here and not only are we fresh
off the announcement of the brand new iPhone X, but also the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus as well. I got a chance to go hands on and extensively cover the iPhone X, so if you missed that video I
will drop a link down below, but today I wanna focus on
both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, help to make it a little
bit easier for anyone who's potentially on the fence about buying one of those phones or even
waiting for the iPhone X. Now, hands down the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus naming scheme
was purely a marketing move. They very easily could've and probably should have
named these the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, but honestly I can't really
hate on them for that because business wise it
was a super smart move. Everybody up until the
point where essentially everything got leaked, would've assumed that the
iPhone 8 was Apple's giant big flagship release this year, but as we've seen that
is clearly the iPhone X and because these phones
are more than a month apart in release, I think it's
safe to say it's gonna be a pretty big end of the year for Apple. Now, one thing different with he iPhone 8 and 8 Plus is the iPhone 6 to 6s and 7 all shared aluminum bodies, whereas for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus those feature an all glass back, which not only change up
the look and the feel, but also introduces wireless charging. So, for anyone out there who
thought that maybe wireless charging was exclusive to the iPhone X, nope you get that across the
8 and the 8 Plus as well. And as you start to see
throughout this video these three phones share more
features than you might think. Now, as far as the colors
go, gone is rose gold. So, no longer do we have to
argue about whether it's pink or rose gold, we are now
simply left with silver, gold, and space gray. Honestly, after seeing
these in person I think I'm gonna have to say gold is my favorite. It just looks the nicest by far. And surprisingly I'm gonna
say the silver is my runner up and the space gray out of these
three was my least favorite. Now, as far as the displays
go there definitely are some improvements, nothing drastic though. The iPhone 8 is still
rockin' a 4.7 inch display with the same resolution, whereas the iPhone 8 Plus is
rockin' a 5.5 inch display with the same resolution as well. Upgrades that both these phones share are improved stereo speakers. Surprisingly both the
iPhone 8 and 8 Plus share the exact same A11 Bionic
chip found in the iPhone X, so maybe you're not ready
to give up that home button, whereas the iPhone X really
isn't doing it for ya, it's nice to know that
you're not gonna have to sacrifice performance. So, if you missed my iPhone
X video, crazy name aside, that A11 chip is supposed
to be stupid fast. I think there were some
preliminary benchmarks that leak showing that it
was just as fast as a 13 inch MacBook Pro, which is kinda
crazy if you think about it. I for one am super excited
to get this in house, check it out, test it out for myself. And if there's anything
as far as performance goes that you guys wanna see, let me know with a comment down below. Now, as far as the cameras
go the iPhone 8 is rockin' a single 12 megapixel shooter. It is supposed to be an improved sensor with what Apple is calling deeper pixels. Not sure exactly what that means, but it's supposed to translate
to more accurate colors. Then of course we'll have to
see once I get one in house. Now, as far as the iPhone 8 Plus, that again is rockin' a
dual lens configuration like we saw in the 7 Plus, but if you're curious
what's different between the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X, obviously one, we have a vertical
configuration in the iPhone X, but the biggest difference between the two is the iPhone X actually
has OIS on both the lenses, where the iPhone 8 Plus only has OIS on the single main shooter. Just like the iPhone X though, there are of course
improvements to portrait mode on the iPhone 8 Plus
as well on top of that, what Apple is calling Portrait Lighting, which essentially give you
the ability to manipulate different lighting
elements in environments either pre or post photo. What's kinda cool, too, on top of that, beyond the ability to
tweak things in post, you could just shoot a
regular portrait mode photo without any portrait lighting effect and still decide to add it in later. Now, from there hands down
one of the biggest upgrades to come to the iPhone 8,
the 8 Plus, and the X, this is one feature that all three of these phones share is video. These phons all shoot at
4K, 60 frames per second. It might be a little crazier for me is 240 FPS slow motion at 1080P. Go Pros don't shoot 4K 60,
none of the Canons shoot 4K 60, I think the GH5 will get you 4K 60 FPS, but is nearly two grand, so hopefully that should
put things into perspective. So, from there anyone
who's kinda on the fence between the iPhone 8 and
8 Plus or the iPhone X, I think one of the biggest questions is, are you ready to give up that home button? Both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus still have
that comfortable familiar touch ID home button where the
iPhone X obviously does not. Essentially you're almost
kinda guinea piggying a first generation
product with he iPhone X because do you trust face unlock? Is it gonna be good enough? We've already seen some controversy, so that is something you
definitely have to ask yourself. For me what draws me
most towards the iPhone X is you're essentially getting
all of the Plus features in a smaller form factor. You're gettin' a bigger screen,
you're getting dual cameras, with OIS on both lenses, so for me that's kinda
almost the way to go. I will say, though, if I had
to guess between these three phones I would think the
iPhone 8 Plus would still have the best battery life out of the three, followed by the iPhone X and of course lastly the iPhone 8. Ultimately, features aside though, it comes down to pricing. Do you wanna pony up the
cash for the iPhone X? The iPhone 8 starts at $699, the iPhone 8 Plus starts at $799, and then we of course have the iPhone X which starts all the way up at $999. So, for those watching right
now there's a good chance you may have just pre-ordered
an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus or you could be holding
out for the iPhone X. Let me know what you went with and why, I would love to hear what you think. Aside form that, thank you guys very much for watching. If you enjoyed this video if it helped, make sure you guys drop a like down below. This is Jonathan and I'll
catch you guys later. 
- [Jonathan] Hey guys, Jonathan here. Without a doubt Samsung's
Galaxy S8 is one of the most impressive phones of 2017. The iPhone 8 however is officially here and with that I think it's time to see how these two stack up side by side. Now clearly once you put these phones next to each other in terms of the design, aesthetics and really just overall looks, not to sugarcoat it or
anything but the Galaxy S8 is miles ahead. The iPhone 8 definitely does have some very impressive features, but design wise, it really hasn't changed
much over the years. So honestly for all intents and purposes, it very well could have
been called the iPhone 7S. The Galaxy S8 on the
other hand is a completely different story. It has this beautiful bezel-less display that looks like it's
straight outta the future. And I've said it before but
I still think the Galaxy S8 is arguably the best
looking phone of 2017. Now with the upcoming
iPhone X that very well may change that statement for me, but that is different
comparison for a different day. For now, and especially
because both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 are very similar in pricing we're gonna focus on these two phones. Now regardless, both of these
are very impressive devices and I'm sure most of
you out there would love to win either of these. So with that you have
a chance to win either a brand new Galaxy S8 or
iPhone 8, the choice is yours. But if you wanna go
crazy and we can get to 100,000 likes I will
give away both of these. So for a chance to win go
ahead and check out the link down below. But the main thing to do
is make sure you subscribe, so if you haven't don't
that, make sure you hit that subscribe button. Huge shout out to The
Walking Dead: No Man's Land for sponsoring this
comparison and giveaway. I was actually super excited
they wanted to do that because I freaking love The Walking Dead. If you guys haven't checked out the game it is turn based action strategy game where you battle those walkers and you can do so with Daryl, Rick, Glenn and even the ninja master
with a stick, Morgan. Now as much as I love those
guys, there's a part of me that can't help but root
for Megan and Lucille. So if you're a Megan fan too,
right now you can download the game which is free
in both the App Store and the Play Store before September 30th you get Megan for free. This game is super addicting. And if you can't get enough Walking Dead there's a unique storyline
written specifically just for this game. There are weekly challenges and two huge updates just dropped. First is the Distance which
is a brand new game mode which is specifically for
players which have reached Council Level 18 and this is designed so you can put those skills to the test in a brand new Survival Mode. It's a little challenging
because characters will not be able to heal
in between missions. But if you're up for the
challenge, it's worth it because new rewards will drop each time the Distance event occurs. This allows you collect
components for your mission crates and craft badges for your survivors. Both these updates are available now, so make sure you check
out the links below. And whether you're on team
iPhone or team Android if you're a fan of The Walking Dead you're gonna dig this game. Now unfortunately with the
iPhone 8 it still connects to a lightning port and surprise, surprise does not have a headphone jack. So two potential advantages
with the Galaxy S8, is one, USB C and two, the
fact that you can connect a pair of wired headphones
without any adapter. Now another potential
advantage with the Galaxy S8 is MicroSD card expandability. Now I don't want to turn this into an iOS versus Android war. For me I've never really felt the need to store anything on a MicroSD card but for some it may be big deal and if that's the case, that is clearly where the Galaxy S8 has one up. Some of you might notice
that both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 feature an all glass back. Now that's because both of
these feature wireless charging. Clearly this isn't anything new to Samsung or the Galaxy line up. It is however brand new to the iPhone 8. They're using a wireless Qi standard and not some proprietary crap. So the fact that it's
finally here on the iPhone is only gonna help wireless
charging become further adopted and that is better for everybody. The one thing mention though
in terms of fast charging or quick charging, that
is something you get right out of the box with the Galaxy S8 whereas with the iPhone 8
you're going to need to spend nearly $100 in accessories
just to get that which is kinda crazy. So definitely a plus one
to Samsung for providing Quick Charge out of the
box, and unfortunately in typical Apple fashion,
you're gonna pay more for adapters and accessories. For me though, whether
I'm on Android or iPhone I'm usually plugged
into an Anker PowerBank or wall charger so I've never really felt like my phone needs to charge faster. This is their brand new PowerCore II which packs 20,000 mAh of juice inside, so battery for days. It really doesn't matter
which device you're on, it just works and it works well. So if you're interested
in checking on out, I would drop a link down below. Now from there, jumping into displays. It is not even close. The Galaxy S8 here is the clear winner. It features a beautiful
and I mean beautiful 5.8 inch Super AMOLED display. It's bright it's colorful, it's vibrant and the lack of bezels kinda
just makes you wanna stare in awe at it, and there
is really no other word to describe it than impressive. With the display Samsung
also did a fantastic job of implementing a virtual home button into the screen and it
just works really well. The downside to that is that
Samsung could not implement the finger print reader into the display so in turn it is located
awkwardly on the back next to the camera which
I'm still not a fan of. Unlike the iPhone X, the
iPhone 8 does however have a fingerprint reader
or Touch ID up front so in terms of that, I
definitely prefer the iPhone 8. That though unfortunately does not help the iPhone 8's
display when stacked up side by side against the Galaxy S8. Now the iPhone 8 is not a
bad display by any means. Its got a beautiful white
color gamut, bright, true tone, actually works really well
but it just kinda pales in comparison in both size and resolution. It is a 4.7 inch display
with a 750P resolution. And again when you stack it side by side against the Galaxy S8 it's not even close. So while the display is a clear
advantage to the Galaxy S8 if we look under the hood, the
iPhone 8 might surprise you. Yes, the Galaxy S8 has
an eight core processor and I've seen people
make fun of the iPhone 8, the iPhone X for finally
getting a six core processor. But the fact is the A11
Bionic chip is nuts. Stacked up side by side
against the Galaxy S8 it completely smashes and obliterates it. The big thing with that
A11 chip is that when it needs to it's gonna
utilize all six of those cores at the same time whereas
with the Galaxy S8, it is actually two pairs
of quad core processors. That in turn is why the
iPhone 8 and especially in multi-core performance does so well. And just for reference that is on par with a 13 inch MacBook Pro which is crazy in terms of a smartphone. Again, I don't want to
turn this into a war or negate how awesome the Galaxy S8 is, because it is a fantastic,
beautiful, really fast phone. But in terms of performance,
it is clear that Apple is miles ahead. From there I wanna jump over to cameras because honestly that is probably one of the most important features
to pretty much everybody out there. Both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy
S8 feature 12MP shooters on the back and in terms
of performance goes as far as photography,
both do an amazing job. The showcase that I think
these two pictures here are a prime example of
why that is the case, this was shot on the Galaxy
S8 which is an amazing picture but if we hop over to the
iPhone 8, it is pretty much equally as impressive. I'm not sure which I like more but I think either way you
would not be disappointed with either of these. Same thing here with these pictures, I think the iPhone 8 does a fantastic job of capturing the highlights, the shadows, not over blowing the sunset. But it's pretty much the same thing on the Galaxy S8. The only advantage I would say the S8 has with this picture over
here is if we crop it and zoom in, it does retain sharpness just a little bit better
over the iPhone 8. Now into where I prefer the Galaxy S8 over the iPhone 8 is
this alpha balance shot right here. The iPhone 8, it is every so slightly just a little over washed,
a littler over exposed. But as we hop over to the Galaxy S8, it kinda just holds
everything together better. The colors pop more and overall it's just a more pleasing image. From then we move into more
of a lower light situation. I think both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 do a really fantastic job. I think with the iPhone 8, you get a more natural true to life image with more accurate colors, whereas with the Galaxy S8 it looks great but it tends to cool things down a bit but overall it was just a sharper image. Now as far as the front facing cameras go that hands down goes to the Galaxy S8. I've always liked their wide angle lens. The iPhone has just never
really felt wide enough. And as you can see as we
stack them side by side, both do a really impressive job but I just prefer the look
of the Galaxy S8 more. Now from there, one clear
advantage the iPhone 8 has over the Galaxy S8 is
when it comes to video. The iPhone 8 will shoot up to
4K at 60 frames per second. That's something the
Galaxy S8 does not do. So for reference here's an example of both at 4K 30. So we're here on the iPhone
8 testing out 4K 30FPS video. Also gonna get a little test
out to the stabilization. We're gonna walk around, give
it a little back and forth. Rich with the crispy shirt. Looking good with the tricolors. Ralphy holding down the camera. And now let's hop over to the Galaxy S8. Holy crop factor, we're
here on the Galaxy S8. Moving around again, test
out the stabilization. Video quality looks good, I'm
curious to see how it reacts a little bit, moving in, grabbing focus. That's pretty quick. Tricolors one more time. It looks crisp here, not gonna lie. Back to Ralphy, and lemme
know which you think looks better with a comment down below. The other big deal with the iPhone 8 is 1080P 240FPS slow motion video which is crazy. Here's a quick example of
the 240FPS slow motion video on the iPhone 8. Again, this is not something
the Galaxy S8 even does so I can't truly compare apples to apples. To make it a little more even here's what 120FPS slow
motion video looks like on the iPhone 8 and you can see it does a really amazing job. Clearly my rock juggling skills
could use some improvement but as we hop over to the
Galaxy S8, you can see in terms of clarity and
just overall quality it is miles better on the iPhone 8. Now ultimately it really comes down to preference and ecosystem. Both of these are fantastic
high quality phones. The Galaxy S8 is far
superior in terms of design, hardware, the display. And while the iPhone 8 may
not look the most impressive on the outside, it is
packing some serious power and impressive features inside. With the Galaxy S8 and
more specifically Android you're clearly getting more customization, more freedom, more flexibility
whereas with the iPhone 8 and more specifically iOS11,
yes it can be limiting but in terms of the
eco-system the App Store it is second to none. For me, both these are fantastic phones, and again it is a great time to be alive in terms of technology. Hopefully this video kinda showcase what is cool about each of these phones and helped you with your choice. Aside from that, thank you guys very much for watching. If you missed it I just
dropped a brand new iPhone 8 Plus versus 8
unboxing and comparison. You can check that out here
or check out the link below. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (upbeat music) 
- Today's video is
sponsored by Sennheiser. Yo guys, Jonathan here. It is time for a brand
new "What's In My Bag?" Got some new tech and, more importantly, a really freaking cool backpack. So this guy sitting on my back right now, kind of blending into my shirt, is the Herschel Supply Co. Apex Lawson. If you love prime knit,
if you love fly knit, or if you love yarn and
knitting in general, you will dig this. I've been a fan of Herschel
backpacks for a while now but by far this is my
favorite in terms of looks and aesthetics because it
is so unique from the rest. It looks great, it's comfortable,
it's definitely held up in terms of tossing it
around while traveling; especially at the airport. And I gotta say, as far as backpacks, this is definitely the most
questions I've ever got in terms of, "what is that on your back?" Now as far as the backpack,
there aren't a ton of compartments and
pockets, which I kinda like for a couple of different reasons. One, I generally don't
carry that much with me in the first place so
it's not more than I need. And two, because it's so simple it keeps things nice and organized. Now as far as the main compartment, you got tons of room for activities. This will house a laptop up to 15 inches. I like the fact that
there's plenty of padding and there's an additional compartment for things like a tablet or, in my case, I have a Nintendo Switch
sandwiched inside. There's also a couple
additional slots I'm using to carry a Samsung T5
SSD and a battery bank. And, really, there's not much that I dislike about this backpack. So, next up, these as the Sennheiser HD 4.50 wireless
Bluetooth headphones. And I feel like I've
been on a plane, like, every other week for
the past two months now and these have been my go-to headphones. First and foremost, these
feature active noise cancellation which is so, so amazing on airplanes. It's one of those things
you don't truly appreciate until you have it and
then you don't have it. But, regardless, it works
fantastic on these headphones. On top of that, you are
getting stellar battery life. So, without noise cancellation, these will last about 25 hours. But, if you do want to take advantage of that noise cancellation, you're still gonna get about 19 hours which is crazy and pretty much long enough for any flight out there. You have super cushiony ear pads which are gonna make
these crazy comfortable. And they also fold up really nicely, which is perfect for traveling. More importantly, you guys
that know Sennheiser know they make great, quality headphones. So sound quality is also on point as well. And combine that with
active noise cancellation, I can't hear a thing right
now and that is the recipe for a great pair of traveling headphones. Make sure you guys check
out the link below. So from there, I got everything
laid out from my backpack and we will start with the
most boring out of this bunch and that is the USB-C Macbook Pro charger that of course goes along with
the 2017 15 inch Macbook Pro. It's what I use to edit
pretty much all my videos including the one you
are watching right now. Got a sweet, leather dbrand skin on here. If you guys want to check
that out for yourselves I will drop a link down below. Alongside the Macbook Pro,
this is the Samsung T5 SSD which is easily one of my
most used pieces of tech. It's compact, but this particular model is packing two terabytes of storage. So it's what I use to edit pretty much every single one of my videos. So the Macbook Pro combined
with these crazy speeds makes it perfect for, not only on the go, but also for your desk as well. And, if you don't need this much storage, they also come in a few
different flavors as well. Next, this probably the
most interesting piece of tech in my bag, this
is my Nintendo Switch that I take on the road for
traveling, for gaming... But when I'm back, it's
kind of become the office, Frankenstein, guinea pig Switch. In this case, whenever Kevin
wants to get a crazy tweak or mod, this is what happens to it. In this case, we got this crazy, atomic purple, see through d-pad on here. If you guys wanna learn more about that, definitely make sure
you check out his video, which I will link to down below. Next, this is probably the
weirdest thing in my backpack, because it is solely used just to charge my Apple Watch when I'm traveling. It is a duel purpose battery bank. What's cool is, there is a
built in Apple Watch charger right here, so it's almost wireless in the sense that you pop your Apple Watch on and you are magically charging. Now this would usually get
me about four to five charges with my Apple Watch, so instead of taking something I plug into a wall, this is actually all I take on the road and it's perfect for
charging my Apple Watch. Next, this guy right
here, from Native Union is probably the best $50 that I've spent in a really long time. It's an extension cord, one. So, it's super helpful
especially when you're traveling. You got this nice, braided cable and, more importantly,
it's like this multi-tool where you got multiple
USB ports, you got USB-C, and you actually have
two outlets; one here. They're evenly spaced. And it has actually become one of the most useful things
I've purchased all of 2017. So if you travel a lot,
this has been so, so useful. I cannot recommend it enough. And from there, kind of
rounding everything out, we got this super tough, rugged
lightning cable from Nomad. So if you travel a lot,
you're not gonna worry about this thing breaking
or tearing or ripping apart. This I use alongside this monster ANKER power bank which is packing
26,000 milliamps of power. What's also crazy cool
is there is a USB-C port and enough juice packing inside this guy to power a Macbook or Macbook Pro. Now, it's not gonna be
your main source of power but it's definitely useful
when you're in a pinch or in an emergency. And, definitely, if you
use the Nintendo Switch, that's gonna be your partner in crime. (dogs barking) So thank you guys very much for watching and if you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you guys go "dogs fighting in a park"

in this video are down below. This is Jonathan and I'll
catch you guys later. (Jonathan laughs)
(dogs continue barking) 
- Damn I got a like on
Twitter from Jays' two cents. Shout out to Jay. Yo guys, Jonathan
here, and this is a $750 product red iPhone,
and this is a $20 skin. So the product red iPhone 7 has been out for a little over a week now. And if you caught my
unboxing, my general feelings towards the phone, is yes,
that red looks amazing, it is super tempting, but
it might not be the smartest buying decision right now. Specifically, because the iPhone seven is now six months old, which puts us at the halfway point, until the next generation iPhone is out. On top of that, if you
already own an iPhone 7, or 7 plus, it does not make sense to drop $750 plus just
to have a red phone. The other thing and maybe
the bigger controversy was why Apple decided to
op for the white front on their product red iPhone and not go for the stealthy black and red. Personally, I really like the white front, I thought it looked clean,
I thought it looked classy, but a ton of you out there
want a black and red. And with that you have a couple options. By far the riskiest option
would be to disassemble your iPhone. You can do this by either
frankensteining siding parts from a black iPhone or the cheaper route, would be to order the screen online. Now the problem with
this is because touch ID is actually connected to
Logic Board, if you wanted to take the safer route,
and not potentially break your touch ID, that's gonna
leave you with a red back, black front, and a white
button that sticks out like a sore thumb. Conversely, if you wanted
to level up to advance mode like my buddy Danny
Windget and you wanna take that risk and disassemble everything, higher risk, bigger reward, but the end result is
a red back, black front and black touch ID. Now if you are awesome
at taking things apart, and putting them back together, fantastic. But I can see why a lot
of people would be kind of hesitant to do this, because honestly, it is a near $1000 risk. So jumpin back to the skin,
which is significantly cheaper and much safer. Whether you have an iPhone 7, 6S, 6 or even Google Pixel for that matter. That is gonna give you access
to that sweet, sweet red. Now disclaimer, ColorWare
did not sponsor this video. Specifically, I actually
sent them out some phones to wrap and send back. But if you do wanna pick one of these up, a little bit does go back
and support the channel, or maybe if you wanna win one of these, go and drop a like down below. So givin you guys a rundown
of the goods I got in. This is an iPhone seven plus
with their formula red matte on the back and black
leather on the front. If you dig that really clean matte look, this looks phenomenal. And beyond the red, there are
a ton of other color options. The reason we are here though, is this candy apple gloss red. Which my goodness, looks good. For those of you familiar
with ColorWare, you know they've made their name
with custom painted tech, and they've taken that
skill over to the skin game and the end result is something you really haven't seen before. This looks like a painted freaking phone, but it's not. It is a $20 skin. No joke, when I got these, and I could still smell
a little bit of that freshly coated paint on the skin, it was probably not the safest
idea to sniff your phone, but you get the idea. And honestly, I'm not gonna lie, I'm gonna do one of those basketball games where you gotta keep
your eye on the phone. Which one is which? Keep your eye, the crowd is going crazy. Can you tell, which one is the real deal? We're swoopin, you don't know
what's happenin right now. Which one is the real iPhone? When you stack these two side by side, this being the real
product red iPhone 7, this being the skin, I gotta say, the skin actually looks a
little better and pops more. And you guys are seeing
this right on camera for yourselves. This is gonna get you
the black Apple logo, the black hardware. And on the front of this
I went with a carbon fiber black front, which looks awesome. Next you quickly saw me
tease the Red Google Pixel. And this is an XL in all of its red glory. What I like specifically about the Pixel is how you can mix and match. On the main portion, I got that smooth shiny glossy candy apple red, and I'm completing it with a red leather. Which looks phenomenal. As far as the front goes, this is black leather. Which is a great contrast to the red back. Flippin the switch for a second, and as cool as that red iPhone is, it really made me want a blue iPhone, and now I got one. I've kind of teased a blue
MacBook here and there. I got a ton of questions
on where I got it from and no, it is not a painted MacBook. It is a painted skin on the Macbook. Same thing applies here. You can see how much
this blue pops on camera. Compare that with a
carbon fiber white front, and this is the perfect
combination for me. Now maybe you don't like blue, maybe you're not OKC fan. Maybe you bleed purple
and love the Lakers. Not sure why, but what? But seriously, look how good these look. And just like the blue iPhone, I got a white contrast up front. This is actually white leather, which also looks crazy good. So it's safe to say, whether you want red, blue, purple, orange
on your phone, Macbook, there is probably an option for you. Now if you want a custom
wrapped iPhone seven, or potentially, the brand new Galaxy S8, go to hit that subscribe button, and turn on notifications
so you do not miss that announcement. This is Jonathan, and I will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here and I'm crazy excited for
what is inside this box. To the naked eye, it might
appear as if it were everyday run of the mill box-o-AirPods,
but on the contrary, what is actually inside
here is something exclusive, something you haven't seen before, the world's first pair
of jet black AirPods. So with that said I am stoked to dive in and check these out in person
to see what the hype is about so let's go ahead and flip it around. From there we're gonna dive
in, do a little Dexter work and cut this box up. I should probably be cutting away from me, so kids do not repeat after me, but like Fogel, we are in. So once we take that off, we can then... Holy crap, even the case is jet black. From first glance this is really close to the jet black iPhone. I'm gonna have to
compare that in a minute. But for now, let's unveil the
glorious jet black AirPods. And holy crap, they do not disappoint. Look at the attention
to detail on these guys, the smooth, glossy black coats, every single part of
this AirPod is flawless. There are no spaces, there are no gaps. And I'm not quite sure
what kind of wizardry were used to pull this off. Now when you compare these
against the now classic stock white AirPods, you can really start to
see the attention to detail from the speaker grill, down
to the left and right icon and I can't even begin
to fathom how tedious this must have been, pulling
apart such a tiny piece of tech and painting every single
nook and cranny so precisely. From there, stackin' it side
by side against a jet black iPhone 7, you can see these
two are a match made in heaven and it really makes you wish Apple would've released
these outta the gate. They sadly did not, but fortunately Colorware stepped in and made that dream a reality. Now as awesome as these
look aesthetically, I do want to test out a
couple things to make sure the paint does not affect functionality. So we'll start out with
the connection test. So just like that, the W1
chip is comin' in clutch and I can connect instantly just like any normal pair of AirPods. From there, now that I'm connected I'm gonna take 'em out
and pop 'em in my ears, I really like looks of the
black and the white interior inside the case. It kind of gives off this cool piano vibe. Right out the box, we got
this connection tone in my ear so now it's time to play some music and AirPods are working perfectly. The other thing I'm curious
about is whether or not the paint affect the sensor on the AirPods so I'm gonna pop it out,
instantly the song is paused, I'm gonna pop them back in,
and as it normally should the song automatically resumes
so the paint is not affecting anything here. Next I'm gonna go test out
Siri by double tapping. Next song. That also works perfectly. And if you caught my one month
later video on these AirPods you know, that is my least
favorite way to control these but it is nice to know nothing
is affected by the custom paint job. Now disclaimer, what I'm about
to do next is not something I would advise. Colorware does not advertise
this, nor does Apple with the AirPods being water resistant, but I was curious to see how
the paint reacts to water. In my mind it's kinda
gonna simulates sweat. So with that said, lets
kinda jump into it. (plop) (upbeat music) Yup. They're in there. Nope. (laughing) So now we shall see. So far it, doesn't look like the paint
is bleeding or anything. Let's first see if I could
actually get my hand in here. Oh it's cold. The AirPods seem so far so good. I'm gonna pop it in. Left ear in. Right ear in. Got a little, bath for my ears. Now it is time to see if
the AirPods still work, fingers crossed! And thank god, they do. Taking a closer look
at the painted AirPods, those look really good as well. So as far as the tests go, we nailed every single one! So it passes the looks department, it passes the functionality department and at the end of the day, Colorware did a killer job on these. Not gonna lie though, after see these stack side by side against
the matte black iPhone 7, I think I might kinda
want to go that route. Part of me is torn though,
maybe to go to that TLD blue. And part of me really wants
to ask Colorware to do a retro version of these
just like dream desk three where they got that nice matte tan with a retro Apple logo on the case. And if that's something you guys wanna see let me know by dropping a like down below. There are a ton of customization options from gloss to matte to metallic. The possibilities are almost endless. So the good news is,
these are finally here. They're a reality. But the bad news is the press is so hot, everyone wants to get
their hands on these, so they're a little hard to get but fortunately, I bought three
extra pairs of AirPods to send the Colorware and
custom paint anyway you want. For a chance to win one of
those pairs of custom painted AirPods, all you gotta do is be subscribed here on the channel. You can do that by clicking here. Then for the other two, I'm
giving away one on Instagram, and one on Twitter, so go ahead and follow
me there for the details. Aside from that, tahnk you
guys very much for watching, and stay tuned because I'm
dropping the $500 desk setup this Sunday. Super stoked to launch it. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (beep) Oh man! I just splashed all over myself. 
- So I've done a few setups in my day. Most of them happen to be desk-related, but this time, I wanted to
focus on the TV side of things. So, this is my ultimate
4K entertainment setup. (bouncy pop music) So the heart and soul of this
setup is the SJ9 Sound Bar from LG, and huge shout
out to them for not only sending this my way, but
also sponsoring this video. Now, to take things up a notch, any time there is a sponsored
video on this channel, I'm gonna use that as a
way to get back to you guys so not only do you have a chance
to win this SJ9 Sound Bar, I'm gonna take that even
further and give you a chance for a $1,000 Amazon gift card
so you can upgrade your setup any way you want, if you're
down with that, let me know by dropping a like, and details on how to win are down below. Now immediately, what I love about this is the dark gray finish. Aesthetically, it looks amazing even on top of a white console,
also not gonna lie, usually I don't get to
mess around with sound bars of this caliber, so the audio
nerd inside me is excited to see how this sounds. So I think it's only
fitting to test this out with the Game of Thrones
season seven trailer, at least the second one,
which I have not watched yet. We got some playback action. Time to crank this sound bar. Sansa, that's Richard's favorite. (Game of Throne theme playing) That's pretty loud. I'm gonna turn that down for a second. We've got some beautiful, beautiful, beautiful John Snow
dialogue, which sounds great. There's a ton of low end, so
that sounds fantastic here, let's see how a little music sounds. This is Rich's favorite track. (pop music) That's a lot of low end. ♫ I don't know if you can take it ♫ I know you wanna see
me naked naked naked I'm gonna turn that down. That's really really impressive, and if you're only rocking
stock audio on your TV, you maybe want to consider an upgrade. This thing makes a huge difference. So sound quality is beyond
on point, and on top of that, this thing is packed full of features. And a couple things that
really stand out to me is one, 4K passthrough. Whether you're waiting to buy that sweet, shiny new Xbox One X, you own a PS4 Pro, or in
my case, have an Xbox One S where you're using it for 4K consumption, your sound bar may only output 1080p, which defeats the whole
purpose of a 4K setup. On top of that, having a
wireless subwoofer is amazing, and in this case, what it allows you to do is not be tied down
wire to wire to the TV, and not only was it the
better sound choice placed in the corner, but I think
aesthetically, it took this setup to the next level. So you pair those features
with fantastic sound quality, Chromecast functionality,
which not only works with Netflix, YouTube, but
also things like Spotify, and that is a recipe
for a killer sound bar. Now from there, you probably
assume I'm gonna talk about that sweet TV
behind me, but I'm gonna throw you a curve ball and
talk about the console itself. Now don't get me wrong,
I love me some IKEA, but sometimes, it's fun
to step outside there. This is from Living Spaces, not a sponsor, but Living Spaces, if
you're watching, let's talk. The walnut front with the off white sides looks phenomenal together, and I get it, some people are gonna see
the price of this and say, "I could build a gaming
PC for that price." But the one thing I want you
to take away from this video is good wood ain't cheap. What I think I love
most about this console is the fact that it keeps
things squeaky clean. That was my goal with this setup. I don't want consoles and
wires flying everywhere, I wanted to look at
this and see simplicity. Now specifically, what I
mean by keeping things clean is yes, there is tons of
space and room for activities with this console, but what it excels at is cable management. To the naked eye, all
you see on the outside is the sound bar and the
TV, but what's packed away inside here is an Xbox
One S, specifically, the Gears of War 4 special edition. I love this color. You have a really cool option
to send the cables directly through the console, which
really helps keep things clean and on top of that, as you
see, there is a ton of space for remotes, for controllers,
and in this case, I added the Xbox One media controller, so just in case you want to
use this to watch Blu-rays, or to watch Netflix in 4K, this is perfect so you don't have to
bust out the controller. If you do want to go 4K gaming,
obviously, you're gonna want to wait for the Xbox One X,
or throw a PS4 Pro in there, but whatever console you go with, this is gonna hide it perfectly. So jumping from the Xbox,
I think that it's time to talk about that sweet TV behind me. And funny story, even though LG sponsored the sound bar portion of
this video, I actually went and picked this up myself at Best Buy. It was on sale, I think
for $699, normally $799, but even at that price,
for a 60 inch 4K IPS TV, I think that is a fantastic deal. Personally, I've always been
a fan of LG's WebOS interface. It is super clean, intuitive, and just in case you haven't
added an Xbox, or a PS4, or Chromecast, for that
matter, you can still use this without wanting to pull your hair out. Overall, my take-away with this TV is you can pick up a really
big, really good 4K TV for relatively cheap nowadays. So if you're stuck at 1080p
and you've been wanting to upgrade, the time
has never been better. Rounding up the setup to the
left and right of the TV, I have a couple glass shelf
floor lamps from Target so you can see this setup
is all over the place. I think what I like most about
this is the cylinder element that really complements
these hanging lights up here from IKEA. Right now and here I have a couple of those classic tech Youtuber
fake plants from IKEA, but you could easily
throw some books on there, Zebra Yeezys, or even, if your
heart desires, some Waifus. Last but not least, you know
a setup would not be complete without a little Philips Hue action. I got a white and colored
bulb here, here, here, here, and of course, the classic
light strip in the back which gives everything a beautiful glow. Of course, everything I talked
about is linked down below. This is Johnathan, and I
will catch you guys later. 
- Yo guys, Jonathan here,
today I've got a fun behind the scenes look at
shooting with MKBHD, what gear he uses, what gear he recommends,
and also the Tesla Model 3. (relaxing electronic music) So this was cool for me because
oftentimes I prefer being behind the camera in terms
of the creative process as opposed to being in front of the camera. Capturing the shots, the composition, that's all really fun to
me so it was kinda cool to kick back, watch Marques do his thing but still capture everything
from my perspective. (relaxing electronic music) - The camera is the
Weapon carbon fiber body that I've had for awhile,
but the sensor inside is new. It's the full frame Monstro
8K sensor and it's glorious. (loud engine roars) I mean, the obvious thing is
all my lenses are wider now. I could never really use
the 100mm macro for anything other than really precise set up shots. But I've found that I can
actually use the 100 now for medium shots and weird other applications so that's pretty fun. My favorite lens now
that I have a full frame is actually the Zeiss 55 Otus. It used to be that 18
to 35 and I still use Sigma's 24 to 35 for a
lot of the same stuff but I really like that 55 now. - Now for a second, I wanna hop in because this has become kind of a slightly controversial and heated discussion of why YouTubers choose Red to shoot video when it's completely and
absolutely unnecessary. I actually, to an extent,
agree 100% with that and there are a ton of amazing
creators and videographers out there shooting on GH5s, A6300s, A7s, Canon 5Ds, 6Ds, 80Ds, all kind of Ds. You get the point and I'm sure you've heard this a million times before. It's not what you shoot on
but how you shoot on it. And yeah, I could not
agree with that more. Myself, the reason why I
decided to go Red was kind of the commercial work that
came along with YouTube. Right now, I'm working on
a commercial for Philips that lives outside this
channel on their website. This was all shot on Red, and
that's where these higher end cinema cameras, for me at
least, start to make more sense. Now as far as Marques, there's not really much that needs to be said. There's a reason why
he's at where he's at. Plus, he's constantly and has always tried to push the envelope in
terms of video quality. So naturally, that makes sense. The other thing I think people
often forget is even though we do this as a career, it's
also what we do for fun. So just like someone would
invest in their music gear or to cars, it's kinda
similar to how gear is for us. I don't party, and I'm not really that into cars surprisingly. I do have a slight shoe
addiction but other than that, video gear is really what gets me excited. And also, I'm sure Marques, like myself, has aspirations way beyond YouTube so really that's why we
go crazy over video gear. With that though, if
you're curious what camera Marques recommends on a budget? - Best YouTube camera under 1500 bucks? Ah, that's tough. I almost said iPhone
10, does that make me... A6500? Does that come in
under $1500 right now? - [Jonathan] Pretty solid, yeah. - I think that's Sony Alpha A6500. - Also, when we hang out
there usually seems to be some sort of gear purchase effect that goes on, I know Judner can attest. Recently I was able to scoop up a pedestal on eBay for an insane price. Honestly, that's really the only reason why I considered grabbing one. It was so new that Marques thought I was holding out on him. - This is life changing, I'm mad at you for not showing me this earlier. We just got new tripods in
the studio and that's all fun, but there's only so much you can do with a tripod without wheels. This is a glorious tripod
with wheels, I'm all in. I mean, so the classic
vertical shot, whenever you see the camera moving up and down,
it's usually a lot of work. I can demonstrate it on
that tripod but it's just such a pain but this is
literally weighted to the point where I've completely
unlocked it, it's steady, and then one finger now is just lowering or raising the entire thing. Plus you have the head on top here so you can do these parallax shots. I was missing this in my
life, but expect a step up in the video quality
as soon as I get back. - Lastly, the Model 3, this was my first chance checking out the car. I was actually really impressed. I know I said I'm not that
into cars and for whatever reason, that chromosome
in me seems to be missing. I like them, I appreciate
them, but I don't go crazy about them but the Tesla Model 3 actually was really freaking nice. The tech inside the Model 3 is incredible. I think the biggest downside
though is it's nearly impossible to get one
anytime soon unless you A pre-ordered one way back
when or you own a model S, which kinda defeats the purpose of trying to buy a more affordable Tesla. Either way though, it's awesome. Again, if you missed
that full Model 3 video, that is linked on Marques's
channel down below. Hopefully you enjoyed this
behind the scenes look. If you did and you are
feeling like being awesome, make sure to smash that like button. This is Jonathan and I
will catch you guys later. (relaxing electronic music) 
- So today or yesterday by
the time you're watching this, Samsung announced that they are announcing the Galaxy Note 8 in just about a month from now on August 23rd. And that has me excited
for a handful of reasons. One is simply the fact that
there is a Galaxy Note 8. At this point, I think
it's a little played out and a little bit of a cheap shot to insert explosion joke here, (explosion booms) because ultimately what happened with the Note 7 was unfortunate. It was an awesome phone that
was insanely well received to the point where people
did not want to give it up and were risking it catching fire because they loved their Note 7 that much. And honestly as far as
the Note lineup goes, Samsung could have
easily shut things down. They could have easily
brushed that under the rug and acted like it didn't happen like a certain company we know, but they didn't. They faced that problem
head-on, made it a point, and I would expect no less
with the Galaxy Note 8. And next up on number two is the display and personally I think the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus have the
best displays of 2017, and on top of that, they might be the best looking
smartphones of all time. The Galaxy S8 features a 5.8 inch display with the Galaxy S8 Plus being 6.2 inches, and with the Galaxy Note 7, we can expect a slightly
larger display of 6.3 inches. Now you might be thinking that is not that big
of a screen size jump, but what has me excited is as impressive as the Galaxy
S8 infinity display was, based off leaks and rumors, the Galaxy Note 8 might be even crazier with a better body-to-screen ratio. So I am drooling over the idea of this giant display in my
hand with essentially no bezels. And next up on number three is the camera or cameras I should say. The Galaxy S8 has an amazing camera, one of the best out there, but I think it's safe to say they took the safe route and
opt in with a single lens. Apple dropped dual lenses on
the iPhone 7 Plus last year, so it was a little surprising not to see it on the Galaxy S8. Obviously, the LG G6, the OnePlus 5, but it looks like we should finally see it with the Galaxy Note 8. There have been some conflicting reports on whether it's going to be dual 13 or dual 12 megapixel sensors, but based off the Galaxy S8
and what I've seen so far, I would bank on dual 12 mega-pickles. What's interesting to me though is whether Samsung's gonna
go with a wide-angle or a telephoto lens for
the secondary option. Both have their pros,
both have their cons, and I would love to hear
what you would prefer with a comment down below. But either way it is shaping
out to be an awesome camera. And next up what has me
excited is the S Pen, because ultimately that is what separates the Note series from the S series. You may not have realized it
but one of the best features on the Galaxy S8 in
that it can create a GIF actually stem from the
Note 7 and the S Pen. Also, it's usually a given that any newer product is
better than the older product so that is true with the Note 7 S Pen, but it was so much better
than any prior S Pen that it has me excited to see what Samsung is doing this time around. So yeah, we're gonna
see an improved S Pen, but the thought of using it
on that giant, edge-to-edge, nearly bezel-less display sounds
like an amazing experience. Now last up I'm going
to step out of reality and jump into dreamland
unicorn world for a second because everything I've talked about up to this point we
can pretty much expect, but if I could wish for any
one thing on the Galaxy Note 8, it would be that they could
implement the fingerprint sensor underneath the display as opposed to the awkward position of the Galaxy S8. I fully realize this is more
than likely not gonna happen, especially based off all the leaks, but what gives me hope is
Qualcomm actually beat Apple to the punch with this technology so if Samsung can somehow
steal that thunder, it would be amazing. So that is my wish with the Galaxy Note 8, and if you could wish for one feature, it could be anything, let me know what that is
with a comment down below. Between the Galaxy Note 8, the
iPhone 8, the Google Pixel 2, it is shaping up to be
a crazy end to 2017. Speak of the Google Pixel 2, if you want to know more that, Ms Krystal Key has an awesome video which you can check out here. This is Jonathon and I
will catch you guys later.
